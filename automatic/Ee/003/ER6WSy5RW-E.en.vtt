00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.360
 66 patients in this facility yes 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.460
 that is correct yes it seems like 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.900
 matches claim too long they would have 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.150
 another 67 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.590

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.699
 So something mysterious with theirs 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.070

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.660
 marshall teddy the to shutter island with 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.989
 His colleague Rhys is one of those 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.630
 institution very far away on one 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.910
 island and there is a very inmates 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.070
 mysteriously disappeared 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.290
 but instead of itself would like none 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.510
 give information and so is the us 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.550
 Marshall stands before him and must 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.469
 really completely alone 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.500
 the investigations lead and that 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.110
 More and more people are coming too many days 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.940
 painful memory and other things 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.140
 Who can not betray me? I show 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.140
 but now the trader 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.790
 you know about these 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.140
 I only know that there is one 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.770
 mental institution is mentally ill 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.840
 criminal 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.890
 we only take the most dangerous 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.299
 disturbed patients with those no 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.560
 we will finish another hospital 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.969
 Be here to donate your weapons 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.189
 are prompted properly 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:24.929
 ordered us marshalls as long as you stay here 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.670
 They stick to the regulations 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:28.670
 Gentleman welcome to shutter island 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.570
 so orlando is sometime in 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.000
 She escaped the last 24 hours 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.439
 Dangerous can be said to hold you up 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.210
 to the nearest shore the water is freezing cold 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.649
 We do not like you from the room 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.920
 has arrived as a round to our tenants 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:56.000
 she was suddenly gone as if she were 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:58.470
 he evaporates through the walls is 67 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.149
 There are 66 patients in total 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.070
 this device yes that is correct yes 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:07.159
 it seems like matches are too long 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.159
 claim they still have a 67 dr 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.769
 A lot of people know something about this 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:14.200
 but no one talks like they have 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.400
 a fear of it 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.219
 you did not swallow any tablets 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.489
 or met in the living albums 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:21.489
 mesh 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.489
 I have built something valuable here 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.189
 cup is not it you are the rat in the 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.450
 maze and valuable things become 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:42.519
 often misunderstood 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:45.000
 who knows about it the sisters possible 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.000
 what everyone 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:52.349
 It is clear that they will not let you go 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.349
 let where can it go? 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.620
 I have this extra weekend 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.540
 shutter island selected for you 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.220
 many different reasons namely 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.290
 that it's a movie about it one very much 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.120
 can discuss a lot and me both 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.250
 opinions on whether the film is good or 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.830
 less well finds very understand 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.000
 So it can polarize very much after what 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.430
 Definitely beyond any doubt 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.780
 sublime is the look of this film 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.610
 and before I play with it 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.920
 dramaturgy just look at it 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.630
 this film is different, you see it 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.730
 not just his craft as a matter of fact 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.200
 director understands but also the 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.970
 leadership of the cameraman and the 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.060
 cameraman is a sensation here 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.250
 these rides this look this 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.950
 Mysterious mood simply nonstop 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.640
 is really over the film is really 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.860
 created fantastically 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.420
 Unfortunately, one has to say that at this 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.069
 film commission to all weaknesses 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.380
 sometimes a little too much at the time 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.150
 screw is turned and I almost that 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.000
 I feel like this at some moments 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.440
 persiflage on such a mysterious 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.810
 because sometimes it really is 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.750
 The policemen are a bit too exaggerated 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.040
 are all so mega caled and the in 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.900
 The institution really wants everyone 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.150
 say nothing and that's all 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.560
 weird and funky as it exaggerates 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.790
 if you have some moments yet 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.350
 a bit too much if you look at it 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.299
 this film is, however, admitted 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.950
 extremely save something again 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.860
 fantastic acting performance 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.470
 also from leonardo dicaprio league where me 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.030
 mark ruffalo his colleague in the movie real 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.070
 he is sorry, he is also one 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.830
 really great actor comes but 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.470
 Not so much to the train and is more so too 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.120
 but the author is cool overall 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.830
 cast and it works too and 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.990
 dicaprio shows that even in this 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.000
 genre loosely at home so sit 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.100
 really you should not go for it if 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 individual films as a complete edition 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.500
 unfortunately he has dramaturg weakening and 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.360
 students at their own posts then so 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.729
 a bit back and forth is then too 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.680
 a little too long is filmed as a whole 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.390
 But you should look great 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.030
 have looked at it if there is no 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.530
 Great masterpiece has become what it is 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.630
 could have been just the twist 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.310
 in the end everything was nice and interesting 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.770
 there was more in it 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.660
 Rossi there was more in it you knew that 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:15.140
 at that time, even after that I still find 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.909
 subsequently in the not designed but 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.080
 not bad at all is enough 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:18.680
 every case for the couch place six and 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.600
 48 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.090
 of 10 points, that is to say you were complaining 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.440
 here on a very high level you can but 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.199
 sometimes we are talking about 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.310
 one of the best directors and there you can 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:29.360
 you also have a closer look 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.639
 Look at the movie in any case 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.229
 but who says I might want 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:34.400
 not something so gloomy now I have 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.150
 I'm not that old at all 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.710
 a bit younger 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.600
 then you look mal ne of the last 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.919
 week on x-men's first decision one 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.530
 couch classic he is now also the 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.120
 new movie in the cinemas 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.880
 or you look at something completely different 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.710
 namely, once crazy movie facts 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.180
 I have linked you well down here 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.940
 then we'll meet again soon 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:56.199
 at 94 criticism here the film factory with 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.199
 my view
