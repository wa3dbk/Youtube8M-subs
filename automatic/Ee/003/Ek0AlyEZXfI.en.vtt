I'm trying to hit those rotator cuff

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.999 
I'm trying to hit those rotator cuff
muscles<00:00:24.900> but<00:00:25.900> I'm<00:00:25.990> not<00:00:26.140> sure<00:00:26.470> if<00:00:26.619> I'm<00:00:26.800> actually

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009 
muscles but I'm not sure if I'm actually

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.769 
muscles but I'm not sure if I'm actually
doing<00:00:27.460> it<00:00:28.289> that's<00:00:29.289> because<00:00:29.740> I'm<00:00:29.919> not<00:00:30.779> that

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
doing it that's because I'm not that

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.240 
doing it that's because I'm not that
might<00:00:32.020> as<00:00:32.140> well<00:00:32.169> be<00:00:32.410> a<00:00:32.619> for<00:00:32.890> some<00:00:33.040> type<00:00:33.220> of

weird biceps exercise okay let me

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:37.890 
weird biceps exercise okay let me
explain<00:00:36.820> something<00:00:37.210> to<00:00:37.239> you<00:00:37.480> if<00:00:37.720> you're

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
explain something to you if you're

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.259 
explain something to you if you're
trying<00:00:38.230> to<00:00:38.290> do<00:00:38.620> some<00:00:39.309> rotator<00:00:39.940> cuff

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:40.269 
trying to do some rotator cuff

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:42.630 
trying to do some rotator cuff
strengthening<00:00:40.930> exercises<00:00:41.500> and<00:00:42.129> you're

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
strengthening exercises and you're

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.390 
strengthening exercises and you're
picking<00:00:42.970> up<00:00:43.269> a<00:00:43.420> dumbbell

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
picking up a dumbbell

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.490 
picking up a dumbbell
by<00:00:45.400> the<00:00:45.460> way<00:00:45.730> dumbbells<00:00:46.330> work<00:00:46.690> against

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
by the way dumbbells work against

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.579 
by the way dumbbells work against
gravity<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.940> they<00:00:49.480> really<00:00:49.870> need<00:00:49.989> to<00:00:50.170> move<00:00:50.350> up

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
gravity so they really need to move up

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.590 
gravity so they really need to move up
and<00:00:50.769> down<00:00:50.909> not<00:00:51.909> over<00:00:52.900> a<00:00:52.930> bad<00:00:53.229> side-to-side

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
and down not over a bad side-to-side

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.439 
and down not over a bad side-to-side
ineffective<00:00:55.600> so<00:00:56.350> when<00:00:57.100> all<00:00:57.640> your<00:00:57.879> resistance

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
ineffective so when all your resistance

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.210 
ineffective so when all your resistance
right<00:00:58.659> here<00:00:58.900> is<00:00:59.080> just<00:00:59.110> pushed<00:00:59.650> is<00:00:59.890> going

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
right here is just pushed is going

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.310 
right here is just pushed is going
straight<00:01:00.519> down<00:01:00.580> so<00:01:01.269> really<00:01:02.140> you're<00:01:02.290> just

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
straight down so really you're just

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.439 
straight down so really you're just
engaging<00:01:02.799> your<00:01:03.040> forearm<00:01:03.549> and<00:01:03.760> your<00:01:03.850> biceps

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
engaging your forearm and your biceps

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.990 
engaging your forearm and your biceps
your<00:01:04.750> shoulder<00:01:05.710> even<00:01:06.189> though<00:01:06.310> you<00:01:06.520> are<00:01:06.700> still

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
your shoulder even though you are still

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.710 
your shoulder even though you are still
pivoting<00:01:08.490> at<00:01:09.490> your<00:01:09.729> shoulder<00:01:10.150> you're<00:01:10.450> really

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
pivoting at your shoulder you're really

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.450 
pivoting at your shoulder you're really
not<00:01:10.840> doing<00:01:11.080> anything<00:01:11.530> to<00:01:11.890> strengthen<00:01:12.340> the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
not doing anything to strengthen the

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.929 
not doing anything to strengthen the
rotator<00:01:12.909> cuff<00:01:13.049> rotator<00:01:14.049> cuff<00:01:14.290> root<00:01:14.560> so<00:01:15.310> this

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
rotator cuff rotator cuff root so this

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.090 
rotator cuff rotator cuff root so this
is<00:01:16.119> the<00:01:16.299> fix<00:01:16.600> and<00:01:17.260> I'm<00:01:17.590> sure<00:01:17.920> you've<00:01:18.070> seen

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
is the fix and I'm sure you've seen

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.070 
is the fix and I'm sure you've seen
people<00:01:18.580> at<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:19.000> gym<00:01:19.180> doing<00:01:19.360> this<00:01:19.659> one<00:01:19.869> right

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
people at the gym doing this one right

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.770 
people at the gym doing this one right
they<00:01:20.830> grab<00:01:21.040> the<00:01:21.220> dumbbell<00:01:21.640> and<00:01:22.030> off<00:01:22.509> to<00:01:22.750> the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
they grab the dumbbell and off to the

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.070 
they grab the dumbbell and off to the
races<00:01:23.020> oh<00:01:23.700> yeah<00:01:24.700> my<00:01:25.210> shoulders<00:01:25.720> are<00:01:25.900> getting

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
races oh yeah my shoulders are getting

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.320 
races oh yeah my shoulders are getting
stronger<00:01:26.740> yeah<00:01:27.640> baby

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
stronger yeah baby

best<00:01:32.140> way<00:01:32.350> to<00:01:32.380> do<00:01:32.740> internal<00:01:33.700> and<00:01:33.820> external

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
best way to do internal and external

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.090 
best way to do internal and external
rotation<00:01:34.270> if<00:01:35.170> you<00:01:35.470> want<00:01:35.650> to<00:01:35.740> do<00:01:35.860> it<00:01:35.950> with<00:01:36.070> a

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
rotation if you want to do it with a

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:43.560 
rotation if you want to do it with a
dumbbell<00:01:36.430> is<00:01:37.000> like<00:01:37.690> this<00:01:39.690> find<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:40.870> bench<00:01:42.570> lay

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
dumbbell is like this find the bench lay

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.870 
dumbbell is like this find the bench lay
down<00:01:45.600> get<00:01:46.600> your<00:01:46.810> elbow<00:01:47.440> lined<00:01:47.950> up<00:01:48.250> with<00:01:48.850> your

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
down get your elbow lined up with your

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.060 
down get your elbow lined up with your
body<00:01:49.210> so<00:01:49.810> your<00:01:49.990> elbow<00:01:50.380> is<00:01:50.530> right<00:01:50.740> on<00:01:50.890> their

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
body so your elbow is right on their

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
body so your elbow is right on their
ribs<00:01:51.840> hold<00:01:52.840> your<00:01:53.140> hand<00:01:53.680> so<00:01:54.190> that<00:01:54.220> your<00:01:54.550> knuckle

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
ribs hold your hand so that your knuckle

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.450 
ribs hold your hand so that your knuckle
your<00:01:55.390> thumb<00:01:55.720> knockos<00:01:56.200> on<00:01:56.500> your<00:01:56.710> belly<00:01:56.979> button

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
your thumb knockos on your belly button

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.539 
your thumb knockos on your belly button
and<00:01:57.900> then<00:01:58.950> rotate<00:01:59.950> upward<00:02:00.580> and<00:02:01.060> back<00:02:01.840> down

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
and then rotate upward and back down

and then rotate upward and back down
rotate<00:02:03.549> up<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.500> back<00:02:05.500> down<00:02:05.830> so<00:02:06.220> you<00:02:06.280> always

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
rotate up and back down so you always

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.850 
rotate up and back down so you always
started<00:02:07.240> from<00:02:07.420> your

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
started from your

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.720 
started from your
biblical<00:02:08.430> or<00:02:08.790> your<00:02:08.970> belly<00:02:09.270> button<00:02:09.690> area<00:02:09.840> and

biblical or your belly button area and

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:14.930 
biblical or your belly button area and
then<00:02:11.730> opening<00:02:12.600> that<00:02:12.840> car<00:02:13.200> door<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:13.940> then

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
then opening that car door and then

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.630 
then opening that car door and then
lowering<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.750> back<00:02:15.930> down<00:02:16.200> now<00:02:16.530> for<00:02:16.950> internal

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
lowering it back down now for internal

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.500 
lowering it back down now for internal
rotation<00:02:18.060> same<00:02:19.020> exact<00:02:19.590> thing<00:02:20.180> now<00:02:21.180> about

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
rotation same exact thing now about

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.480 
rotation same exact thing now about
still<00:02:21.960> up<00:02:22.260> against<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.740> body<00:02:22.920> it's<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.250> little

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
still up against the body it's a little

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.310 
still up against the body it's a little
bit<00:02:23.580> more<00:02:23.730> awkward<00:02:23.970> because<00:02:24.570> you're<00:02:25.050> kind<00:02:25.290> of

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
bit more awkward because you're kind of

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.730 
bit more awkward because you're kind of
tonight<00:02:25.560> on<00:02:25.800> your<00:02:25.980> upper<00:02:26.610> arm<00:02:26.850> but<00:02:27.810> same<00:02:28.110> same

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
tonight on your upper arm but same same

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.810 
tonight on your upper arm but same same
approach<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.430> then<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:29.610> rotate<00:02:30.030> inward<00:02:31.820> okay

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
approach and then you rotate inward okay

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.550 
approach and then you rotate inward okay
coming<00:02:33.480> up<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.380> into<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.430> buy-in<00:02:36.560> what's

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
coming up and into the buy-in what's

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.890 
coming up and into the buy-in what's
this<00:02:37.710> doing<00:02:38.190> this<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.580> isolating<00:02:39.510> the

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
this doing this is isolating the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.460 
this doing this is isolating the
rotators<00:02:40.590> now<00:02:41.540> now<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:42.900> just<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.230> ten

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
rotators now now this is just a ten

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.970 
rotators now now this is just a ten
pound<00:02:43.740> dumbbell<00:02:44.190> this<00:02:44.460> is<00:02:44.610> very<00:02:44.850> easy<00:02:45.980> but

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
pound dumbbell this is very easy but

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.710 
pound dumbbell this is very easy but
maybe<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.459> could<00:02:47.670> start<00:02:48.030> at<00:02:48.209> weight<00:02:48.420> for

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
maybe you could start at weight for

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.860 
maybe you could start at weight for
those<00:02:48.900> people<00:02:49.530> just<00:02:49.830> starting<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.790> do<00:02:51.450> some<00:02:51.750> of

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
those people just starting to do some of

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.320 
those people just starting to do some of
this<00:02:51.990> work<00:02:52.730> eventually<00:02:53.730> you're<00:02:54.090> probably

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
this work eventually you're probably

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.830 
this work eventually you're probably
progressed<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:55.680> 15<00:02:56.580> 20<00:02:57.060> pounds<00:02:57.240> and<00:02:57.690> maybe

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
progressed to 15 20 pounds and maybe

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.770 
progressed to 15 20 pounds and maybe
even<00:02:58.050> go<00:02:58.260> beyond<00:02:58.590> that<00:02:58.860> but<00:02:59.820> having<00:03:00.480> strong

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
even go beyond that but having strong

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.130 
even go beyond that but having strong
rotator<00:03:01.350> muscles<00:03:01.470> is<00:03:02.540> essential<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.810> it's

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
rotator muscles is essential and it's

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.730 
rotator muscles is essential and it's
very<00:03:04.410> easy<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:05.360> get<00:03:06.360> strong<00:03:06.750> deltoids<00:03:07.380> and

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
very easy to get strong deltoids and

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.790 
very easy to get strong deltoids and
have<00:03:08.310> weak<00:03:08.640> rotator<00:03:09.240> cuff<00:03:09.570> muscles<00:03:10.050> and<00:03:10.290> then

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
have weak rotator cuff muscles and then

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.710 
have weak rotator cuff muscles and then
all<00:03:11.250> of<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.459> sudden<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.790> have<00:03:12.000> an<00:03:12.120> injury<00:03:12.510> that

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
all of a sudden you have an injury that

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.680 
all of a sudden you have an injury that
prevents<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.380> from<00:03:13.410> doing<00:03:13.800> you<00:03:14.550> know<00:03:14.700> any<00:03:15.239> any

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
prevents you from doing you know any any

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.900 
prevents you from doing you know any any
of<00:03:15.870> your<00:03:15.989> presses<00:03:17.030> even<00:03:18.030> some<00:03:18.209> back<00:03:18.420> work<00:03:18.720> so

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
of your presses even some back work so

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.670 
of your presses even some back work so
you<00:03:20.910> know<00:03:21.030> shoulder<00:03:21.570> strange<00:03:21.930> they<00:03:22.290> come<00:03:22.530> in

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
you know shoulder strange they come in

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.310 
you know shoulder strange they come in
to<00:03:22.739> go<00:03:22.920> but<00:03:23.700> what<00:03:24.480> I've<00:03:24.600> noticed<00:03:24.630> over<00:03:25.170> the
