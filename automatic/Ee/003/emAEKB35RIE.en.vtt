00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.630
Today we're going to check out the Buick
Enclave

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.320
a large, distinctly American, luxury sport
utility, that competes with the popular

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.660
Acura MDX

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.340
and Infiniti QX60.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.000
♫♫

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.680
The Enclave comes standard with the 288
horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 under the hood

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.779
when equipped with all-wheel drive, it gets
22 miles to the gallon on the freeway

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.829
16 in the city. The transmission is a
six-speed automatic.

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.700
When equipped with the trailer package,
like the one we have here, the Enclave

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.200
can pull up to 4500 pounds.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.820
♫♫

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.510
Now the main reason that families
purchase these large SUVs

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.800
is so they can transport their kids
around with minimal fuss.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.880
This makes a useful third row critical.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:10.430
♫♫

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.510
To access the third row, there's a simple
lever right here on the second row seat

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.680
the back seat actually has it's

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.370
own sunroof and separate set of air con
controls

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.620
now I have to say, most vehicles kinda
give a light

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.520
puff of air, but not this one. Full blowers.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.350
from the driver's seat it's an
interesting mix of new and old

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.190
Let's start it up. Yup it uses the
traditional key

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.610
and transmitter for lock and auto-start.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.320
The enclave includes an impressive
array

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.550
of active safety technology like lane-assist,
collision detection

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.900
blind spot identification, cross traffic
alert

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.080
an adaptive cruise control. However
some of the indicators

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.080
seem like a little bit of a throwback. Where
other car makers are adapting the high

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.380
resolution displays

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.960
and futuristic graphics. Buick seems to be
relying on a more

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.460
comfortable, old-fashioned approach.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.260
Still, it works and once you figure it out, it
makes sense. The gauges are very clear

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.840
and bright too which is nice.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.270
In terms of infotainment, Buick's included its own IntelliLink system

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.350
this provides navigation, phone integration

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.459
and the usual mix of XM, FM, and
music media player options.

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.000
Now if you have an iPod or Android
device, the USB plug

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.640
is easily accessible right here. Which is nice.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.540
You can see that it pencils out to be
just a little over $53,000.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.360
Now when you consider all that
this Buick Enclave premium all-wheel

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.700
drive has to offer.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.780
you're actually getting quite a lot for
your money.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.740
The Enclave is designed for active
families that need the space and capailities

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.400
a large SUV offers.

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.569
To those ends, the Enclave delivers.

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.769
It's a well thought-out vehicle with
distinctive looks.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.489
On the road it never felt overly large,
sometimes these big SUVs can be a handful.

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:30.849
We never found that to be the case for
the Enclave.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.460
Buick redid the suspension last year
and it really did wonders for the handling.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.180
The all-wheel-drive system is
designed to activate automatically when

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.300
a slip is detected

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.780
that means most of the time the Enclave
feels like a front wheel drive vehicle

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.200
but when you need it it will kick in
power to all four wheels

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.040
no buttons necessary.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.290
So that's our look at the 2015 Buick Enclave
premium all-wheel-drive

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.050
it's a unique offering for those
shopping for a large luxury SUV

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.020
