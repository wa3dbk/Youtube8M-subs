I've<00:01:38.759> been<00:01:38.940> in<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.180> room<00:01:39.390> 50<00:01:39.660> times<00:01:39.930> but<00:01:40.290> last

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
I've been in this room 50 times but last

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.230 
I've been in this room 50 times but last
time<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.770> boxes<00:01:41.100> were<00:01:41.130> green<00:01:41.550> kind<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.090> way

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240

the<00:01:42.720> game's<00:01:42.929> repetition<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.649> linear<00:01:43.950> nature

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
the game's repetition in linear nature

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.190 
the game's repetition in linear nature
is<00:01:44.490> its<00:01:44.670> biggest<00:01:44.819> drawback<00:01:45.360> yeah<00:01:46.050> these

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
is its biggest drawback yeah these

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.480 
is its biggest drawback yeah these
behind<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.530> game<00:01:46.649> are<00:01:46.770> solid<00:01:47.160> but<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.369> feels

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
behind the game are solid but it feels

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.210 
behind the game are solid but it feels
too<00:01:47.819> constricting<00:01:48.590> there's<00:01:49.590> also<00:01:49.740> one<00:01:49.979> point

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
too constricting there's also one point

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.440 
too constricting there's also one point
that<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.399> head<00:01:50.550> towards<00:01:50.910> and<00:01:51.060> maybe<00:01:51.179> two<00:01:51.420> or

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
that you head towards and maybe two or

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.940 
that you head towards and maybe two or
three<00:01:51.569> different<00:01:51.869> ways<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.140> reach<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.770> point

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
three different ways to reach that point

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.950 
three different ways to reach that point
if<00:01:53.190> you're<00:01:53.280> lucky<00:01:53.429> the<00:01:54.119> mechanics<00:01:54.539> deserve<00:01:54.780> a

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
if you're lucky the mechanics deserve a

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.690 
if you're lucky the mechanics deserve a
