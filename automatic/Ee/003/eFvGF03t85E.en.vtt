mm-hmm but how did you know there was a

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.760 
mm-hmm but how did you know there was a
transmitter<00:01:26.280> lodge<00:01:26.670> there<00:01:27.440> that's<00:01:28.440> some

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
transmitter lodge there that's some

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:47.810 
transmitter lodge there that's some
female<00:01:29.190> intuition<00:01:29.490> you've<00:01:29.880> got

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.969 

Eva<00:01:48.820> didn't<00:01:49.539> you<00:01:49.689> steal<00:01:49.960> some<00:01:50.229> explosives<00:01:50.829> out

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
Eva didn't you steal some explosives out

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.069 
Eva didn't you steal some explosives out
of<00:01:51.039> the<00:01:51.219> fortress<00:01:54.360> c3<00:01:55.360> a<00:01:55.390> highly<00:01:55.780> potent

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
of the fortress c3 a highly potent

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:59.700 
of the fortress c3 a highly potent
explosive<00:01:56.619> from<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.860> West<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:59.079> can<00:01:59.229> be<00:01:59.350> molded

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
explosive from the West it can be molded

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.639 
explosive from the West it can be molded
into<00:01:59.799> any<00:02:00.070> shape<00:02:00.369> like<00:02:00.670> clay<00:02:01.110> with<00:02:02.110> just<00:02:02.439> this

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
into any shape like clay with just this

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.230 
into any shape like clay with just this
much<00:02:03.009> you<00:02:03.039> could<00:02:03.340> blow<00:02:03.490> up<00:02:03.610> the<00:02:03.729> shag<00:02:03.970> Oh<00:02:04.000> hot

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
much you could blow up the shag Oh hot

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.919 
much you could blow up the shag Oh hot
in<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.479> lab<00:02:04.720> along<00:02:04.990> with<00:02:05.049> it<00:02:05.380> is<00:02:06.189> that<00:02:06.490> right

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
in the lab along with it is that right

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.220 
in the lab along with it is that right
yeah<00:02:07.929> but<00:02:08.709> there's<00:02:08.890> a<00:02:08.950> trick<00:02:09.280> to<00:02:09.310> using<00:02:09.640> it

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.230 
yeah but there's a trick to using it

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:20.390 
yeah but there's a trick to using it
tell<00:02:11.230> me<00:02:11.380> about<00:02:11.440> it

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:38.860 

well<00:02:21.060> what<00:02:21.390> do<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.540> think

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.690 

the<00:02:39.870> shag<00:02:40.110> watz<00:02:40.230> booster<00:02:40.830> unit<00:02:40.860> uses<00:02:41.519> liquid

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
the shag watz booster unit uses liquid

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.839 
the shag watz booster unit uses liquid
fuel<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:43.410> fuel<00:02:43.590> tanks<00:02:44.069> are<00:02:44.160> in<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.340> main<00:02:44.580> wing

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
fuel the fuel tanks are in the main wing

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.790 
fuel the fuel tanks are in the main wing
of<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.090> weapons<00:02:45.420> lab<00:02:45.660> in<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.050> hangar<00:02:46.379> housing

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
of the weapons lab in the hangar housing

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.040 
of the weapons lab in the hangar housing
the<00:02:46.920> shag<00:02:47.129> ohad<00:02:47.400> itself<00:02:47.819> so<00:02:48.360> I<00:02:48.390> should<00:02:48.720> blow<00:02:48.900> up

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
the shag ohad itself so I should blow up

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.800 
the shag ohad itself so I should blow up
the<00:02:49.170> tags<00:02:49.410> that's<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.489> basic<00:02:50.790> idea<00:02:50.910> it<00:02:51.510> should

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
the tags that's the basic idea it should

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.100 
the tags that's the basic idea it should
be<00:02:51.930> enough<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.290> blow<00:02:52.440> up<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.709> entire<00:02:52.739> hangar

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
be enough to blow up the entire hangar

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.860 
be enough to blow up the entire hangar
there<00:02:55.110> are<00:02:55.290> four<00:02:55.620> fuel<00:02:55.980> tanks<00:02:56.430> in<00:02:56.970> order<00:02:57.750> to

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
there are four fuel tanks in order to

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.750 
there are four fuel tanks in order to
destroy<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.440> hangar<00:02:58.799> you'll<00:02:59.160> have<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.519> set

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
destroy the hangar you'll have to set

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.030 
destroy the hangar you'll have to set
explosives<00:03:00.000> on<00:03:00.540> each<00:03:00.840> of<00:03:01.019> those<00:03:01.170> tanks<00:03:01.620> all

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
explosives on each of those tanks all

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.009 
explosives on each of those tanks all
four<00:03:02.519> of<00:03:02.549> them<00:03:02.819> it<00:03:03.150> should<00:03:03.330> be<00:03:03.480> no<00:03:03.629> sweat<00:03:03.989> for

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
four of them it should be no sweat for

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.920 
four of them it should be no sweat for
you<00:03:04.670> besides<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.910> scientists<00:03:06.510> have<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.780> day

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
you besides the scientists have the day

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.080 
you besides the scientists have the day
off<00:03:06.959> today<00:03:07.110> so<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:08.250> hangar<00:03:08.549> is<00:03:08.610> completely

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
off today so the hangar is completely
