rear ones are 17 inch wheels okay so I

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.150 
rear ones are 17 inch wheels okay so I
kept<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.760> interior<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.780> -<00:02:30.010> pretty<00:02:31.010> much

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
kept the interior the - pretty much

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.400 
kept the interior the - pretty much
original<00:02:31.370> because<00:02:32.170> there's<00:02:33.170> so<00:02:33.320> many

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
original because there's so many

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.990 
original because there's so many
aftermarket<00:02:33.770> dashes<00:02:34.430> that<00:02:34.520> you<00:02:34.640> can<00:02:34.760> put<00:02:34.880> in

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
aftermarket dashes that you can put in

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.970 
aftermarket dashes that you can put in
there<00:02:35.180> right<00:02:35.510> but<00:02:35.690> this<00:02:35.840> just<00:02:36.140> really<00:02:36.740> went

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
there right but this just really went

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.220 
there right but this just really went
