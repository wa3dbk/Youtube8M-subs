00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
requests to stuff but I decided what I'm

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.250 
requests to stuff but I decided what I'm
going<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.730> do<00:00:08.880> here<00:00:09.090> is<00:00:09.300> I'm<00:00:09.510> going<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:09.809> take

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
going to do here is I'm going to take

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.370 
going to do here is I'm going to take
this<00:00:10.469> motor<00:00:10.800> as<00:00:11.099> found<00:00:11.670> I<00:00:12.080> just<00:00:13.080> picked<00:00:13.259> this

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
this motor as found I just picked this

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.740 
this motor as found I just picked this
motor<00:00:13.650> up<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.759> I'm<00:00:14.880> gonna<00:00:14.969> do<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.120> series<00:00:15.480> of

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
motor up and I'm gonna do a series of

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.920 
motor up and I'm gonna do a series of
videos<00:00:16.080> on<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.920> tune-up<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.840> getting<00:00:18.840> this

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
videos on the tune-up and getting this

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.859 
videos on the tune-up and getting this
old<00:00:19.140> motor<00:00:19.289> back<00:00:19.590> up<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:19.949> running<00:00:20.100> again<00:00:20.250> so

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
old motor back up and running again so

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.500 
old motor back up and running again so
we'll<00:00:21.869> probably<00:00:22.080> do<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.380> video<00:00:22.560> on<00:00:23.300> the<00:00:24.300> motor

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
we'll probably do a video on the motor

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.480 
we'll probably do a video on the motor
itself<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.109> general<00:00:25.439> check<00:00:25.650> over<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.279> motor

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
itself the general check over of a motor

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.029 
itself the general check over of a motor
that's<00:00:26.730> just<00:00:26.939> been<00:00:27.090> found<00:00:27.359> which<00:00:28.320> this<00:00:28.830> one's

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
that's just been found which this one's

going<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.220> be<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.730> then<00:00:30.689> what<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:30.990> takes<00:00:31.170> to

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
going to be and then what it takes to

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.229 
going to be and then what it takes to
get<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.500> back<00:00:31.590> up<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.830> running<00:00:31.949> again<00:00:32.239> this

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
get it back up and running again this

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.639 

we<00:00:50.129> picked<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:50.489> motor<00:00:50.760> up<00:00:50.969> at<00:00:51.500> up<00:00:52.500> in

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
we picked this motor up at up in

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.680 
we picked this motor up at up in
northern<00:00:52.949> Minnesota<00:00:53.340> from<00:00:53.579> one<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
outboard parts companies that I do a lot

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.470 
outboard parts companies that I do a lot
of<00:00:57.329> business<00:00:57.690> with<00:00:58.670> the<00:00:59.670> reason<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.059> after

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
of business with the reason that after

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.939 
of business with the reason that after
we<00:01:00.809> actually<00:01:01.079> went<00:01:01.230> after<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.590> motors

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
we actually went after this motors

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.770 
we actually went after this motors
because<00:01:02.250> they<00:01:02.399> wrote<00:01:02.550> down<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.090> flywheel

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
because they wrote down on the flywheel

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.240 
because they wrote down on the flywheel
that<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.260> did<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.409> good<00:01:04.619> leak<00:01:04.830> down<00:01:06.140> and<00:01:07.250> weak

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
that it did a good leak down and weak

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.090 
that it did a good leak down and weak
spark<00:01:09.020> shows<00:01:10.020> water<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.560> was<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.890> lower

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
spark shows water that was in the lower

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.620 
spark shows water that was in the lower
unit<00:01:11.400> they<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.939> looks<00:01:12.000> like<00:01:12.150> they<00:01:12.240> looked<00:01:12.540> it

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
unit they it looks like they looked it

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.539 
unit they it looks like they looked it
over<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:13.430> March<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.490> 2010<00:01:16.159> you<00:01:17.159> can<00:01:17.280> see<00:01:17.430> this

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
over in March of 2010 you can see this

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.330 
over in March of 2010 you can see this
motor<00:01:17.790> here<00:01:18.090> has<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.350> bit<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.860> discolored

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
motor here has a bit of a discolored

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.820 
motor here has a bit of a discolored
cylinder<00:01:20.729> head<00:01:21.229> that's<00:01:22.229> usually<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.619> sign<00:01:22.650> of

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
cylinder head that's usually a sign of

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.240 
cylinder head that's usually a sign of
an<00:01:23.009> overheat<00:01:23.900> but<00:01:24.900> since<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.710> has<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.890> good<00:01:26.100> leak

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
an overheat but since it has a good leak

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.109 
an overheat but since it has a good leak
down<00:01:26.460> install<00:01:26.820> yet<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:27.750> probably<00:01:28.170> okay<00:01:29.119> you

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
down install yet it's probably okay you

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.109 
down install yet it's probably okay you
can<00:01:30.240> see<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.420> motor<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.780> still<00:01:30.960> fairly<00:01:31.200> dirty

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
can see this motor is still fairly dirty

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.969 
can see this motor is still fairly dirty
overall<00:01:33.119> because<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.170> have<00:01:34.350> not<00:01:34.500> cleaned<00:01:34.829> it

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
overall because I have not cleaned it

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.400 
overall because I have not cleaned it
yet

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.170 

so<00:01:38.410> usually<00:01:38.980> when<00:01:39.280> I'm<00:01:39.400> looking<00:01:39.520> at<00:01:39.790> buying<00:01:40.030> a

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
so usually when I'm looking at buying a

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.120 
so usually when I'm looking at buying a
used<00:01:40.330> motor<00:01:40.690> a<00:01:41.020> couple<00:01:41.650> things<00:01:41.740> that<00:01:41.860> I<00:01:41.980> like

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
used motor a couple things that I like

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.190 
used motor a couple things that I like
to<00:01:42.160> look<00:01:42.370> for<00:01:42.430> first<00:01:42.940> thing<00:01:43.090> I<00:01:43.180> do<00:01:43.240> is<00:01:43.540> I<00:01:44.140> will

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
to look for first thing I do is I will

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.500 
to look for first thing I do is I will
turn<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:44.620> flywheel<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.970> make<00:01:46.120> sure<00:01:46.300> that<00:01:46.390> it

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
turn the flywheel and make sure that it

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.620 
turn the flywheel and make sure that it
has<00:01:46.660> feels<00:01:47.380> like<00:01:47.530> it<00:01:47.620> has<00:01:47.770> good<00:01:47.950> compression

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
has feels like it has good compression

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.320 
has feels like it has good compression
and<00:01:49.630> this<00:01:49.780> one<00:01:49.900> feels<00:01:50.110> pretty<00:01:50.320> good<00:01:51.240> what<00:01:52.240> I'll

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
and this one feels pretty good what I'll

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.630 
and this one feels pretty good what I'll
do<00:01:52.450> then<00:01:52.600> is<00:01:52.660> I'll<00:01:52.900> put<00:01:53.110> it<00:01:53.170> in<00:01:53.230> gear<00:01:53.440> and<00:01:53.650> turn

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
do then is I'll put it in gear and turn

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.460 
do then is I'll put it in gear and turn
it<00:01:54.729> some<00:01:54.880> more<00:01:55.060> and<00:01:55.660> make<00:01:55.870> sure<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.110> propeller

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
it some more and make sure the propeller

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.520 
it some more and make sure the propeller
turns<00:01:57.300> so<00:01:58.300> we<00:01:58.420> know<00:01:58.540> we<00:01:58.630> got<00:01:58.720> forward<00:01:59.170> gear<00:01:59.380> and

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
turns so we know we got forward gear and

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.900 
turns so we know we got forward gear and
then<00:02:00.220> what<00:02:00.340> I'll<00:02:00.430> do<00:02:00.580> is<00:02:00.820> up<00:02:01.510> bertin<00:02:01.750> Traverse

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
then what I'll do is up bertin Traverse

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.190 
then what I'll do is up bertin Traverse
and<00:02:03.910> these<00:02:04.090> motors<00:02:04.420> usually<00:02:04.960> need<00:02:05.110> to<00:02:05.140> be

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
and these motors usually need to be

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.840 
and these motors usually need to be
turning<00:02:05.620> so<00:02:06.180> Burton<00:02:07.180> Traverse<00:02:08.820> okay<00:02:09.820> a

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
turning so Burton Traverse okay a

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.400 
turning so Burton Traverse okay a
propeller<00:02:10.240> turns<00:02:10.600> so<00:02:10.840> we<00:02:10.869> know<00:02:11.080> that<00:02:11.110> that

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
propeller turns so we know that that

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.180 
propeller turns so we know that that
one's<00:02:11.560> good

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.260 

other<00:02:15.190> things<00:02:15.370> I<00:02:15.489> look<00:02:15.670> at<00:02:15.820> make<00:02:16.030> sure<00:02:16.180> that

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
other things I look at make sure that

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.300 
other things I look at make sure that
it's<00:02:16.450> complete<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.890> only<00:02:18.040> thing<00:02:18.160> that's

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
it's complete the only thing that's

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.130 
it's complete the only thing that's
bringing<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.820> bell<00:02:18.970> right<00:02:19.150> offhand<00:02:19.300> is<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:19.959> does

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
bringing a bell right offhand is it does

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.630 
bringing a bell right offhand is it does
not<00:02:20.260> look<00:02:20.440> like<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.709> proper<00:02:21.070> keeper<00:02:21.400> here's

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
not look like the proper keeper here's

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.000 
not look like the proper keeper here's
on<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.120> for<00:02:22.989> the<00:02:23.080> choke<00:02:23.290> knob<00:02:23.440> on<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.770> floor

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
on the for the choke knob on the floor

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.410 
on the for the choke knob on the floor
I'm<00:02:24.130> doing<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.730> choke<00:02:25.020> not<00:02:26.020> a<00:02:26.050> big<00:02:26.290> deal<00:02:27.420> seems

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
I'm doing the choke not a big deal seems

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.960 
I'm doing the choke not a big deal seems
like<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.660> throttle<00:02:29.020> turns<00:02:29.230> properly

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
like the throttle turns properly

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.460 
like the throttle turns properly
carburetor<00:02:30.970> opens<00:02:31.330> feels<00:02:31.840> fairly<00:02:32.200> smooth

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
carburetor opens feels fairly smooth

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.470 
carburetor opens feels fairly smooth
we'll<00:02:33.459> go<00:02:33.550> ahead<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:33.700> check<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.030> three<00:02:34.270> coils

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
we'll go ahead and check the three coils

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.010 
we'll go ahead and check the three coils
see<00:02:34.750> how<00:02:34.870> that<00:02:35.050> feels<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:37.480> seems<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:37.930> be

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
see how that feels that seems to be

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.660 
see how that feels that seems to be
working<00:02:38.380> just<00:02:38.410> fine<00:02:38.820> so<00:02:39.820> we'll<00:02:40.000> let<00:02:40.180> that<00:02:40.360> be

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
working just fine so we'll let that be

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.640 
working just fine so we'll let that be
other<00:02:42.670> things<00:02:42.850> I<00:02:42.940> like<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.090> do<00:02:43.269> is<00:02:43.500> check<00:02:44.500> the

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
other things I like to do is check the

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.229 
other things I like to do is check the
spark<00:02:44.980> on<00:02:45.220> them<00:02:45.370> so<00:02:45.580> I'll<00:02:45.670> go<00:02:45.820> ahead<00:02:45.850> and<00:02:46.090> check

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
spark on them so I'll go ahead and check

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.740 
spark on them so I'll go ahead and check
the<00:02:46.360> spark<00:02:46.660> on<00:02:46.810> it<00:02:46.959> see<00:02:47.110> how<00:02:47.230> that<00:02:47.440> looks<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:48.750> lot

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
the spark on it see how that looks a lot

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.930 
the spark on it see how that looks a lot
of<00:02:49.840> these<00:02:49.930> old<00:02:50.140> Chrysler's<00:02:50.730> one<00:02:51.730> way<00:02:51.880> to

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
of these old Chrysler's one way to

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.390 
of these old Chrysler's one way to
determine<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.600> year<00:02:52.840> is<00:02:53.709> if<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:53.980> look<00:02:54.160> at<00:02:54.310> the

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
determine the year is if you look at the

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.350 
determine the year is if you look at the
spark<00:02:54.730> plug<00:02:54.910> wires

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
spark plug wires

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.170 
spark plug wires
they'll<00:02:55.660> have<00:02:55.810> printing<00:02:56.290> on<00:02:56.440> them<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:57.180> think

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
they'll have printing on them I think

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.800 
they'll have printing on them I think
this<00:02:58.299> one<00:02:58.450> here<00:02:58.630> says<00:02:59.130> 1963<00:03:00.540> that<00:03:01.540> seems

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
this one here says 1963 that seems

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.180 
this one here says 1963 that seems
pretty<00:03:01.989> early<00:03:02.320> since<00:03:02.560> Chrysler<00:03:02.920> actually

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
pretty early since Chrysler actually

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.780 
pretty early since Chrysler actually
bought<00:03:03.340> out<00:03:03.489> west<00:03:03.700> but<00:03:03.850> in<00:03:04.230> 1965<00:03:05.519> it<00:03:06.519> could<00:03:06.700> be

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
bought out west but in 1965 it could be

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.590 
bought out west but in 1965 it could be
a<00:03:06.820> leftover<00:03:07.150> might<00:03:07.450> be<00:03:07.600> a<00:03:07.630> 1965<00:03:08.410> motor<00:03:09.330> it<00:03:10.330> is

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
a leftover might be a 1965 motor it is

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.560 
a leftover might be a 1965 motor it is
definitely<00:03:11.140> an<00:03:11.230> old<00:03:11.410> one<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:16.000> see<00:03:16.269> if<00:03:16.360> I<00:03:16.420> could

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
definitely an old one and see if I could

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.710 
definitely an old one and see if I could
try<00:03:16.690> to<00:03:16.750> date<00:03:17.049> it<00:03:17.230> here<00:03:17.380> real<00:03:17.530> quick<00:03:18.540> this<00:03:19.540> one

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
try to date it here real quick this one

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.810 
try to date it here real quick this one
say<00:03:19.900> in<00:03:20.019> 63<00:03:20.500> -<00:03:20.739> so<00:03:20.980> I'm<00:03:21.070> guessing<00:03:21.430> this<00:03:21.519> border

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
say in 63 - so I'm guessing this border

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.490 
say in 63 - so I'm guessing this border
is<00:03:21.880> probably<00:03:22.180> a<00:03:22.269> 64<00:03:22.780> it<00:03:22.870> might<00:03:23.019> be<00:03:23.140> a<00:03:23.170> leftover

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
is probably a 64 it might be a leftover

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.650 
is probably a 64 it might be a leftover
Westman

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.370 

the<00:03:27.260> ID<00:03:27.500> tag<00:03:28.040> on<00:03:28.340> this<00:03:28.520> motor<00:03:28.820> is<00:03:29.480> right<00:03:30.260> up

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
the ID tag on this motor is right up

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.140 
the ID tag on this motor is right up
underneath<00:03:30.680> here<00:03:31.040> I<00:03:31.310> don't<00:03:31.760> know<00:03:31.880> if<00:03:31.940> you<00:03:32.030> can

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
underneath here I don't know if you can

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.360 
underneath here I don't know if you can
see<00:03:32.330> that<00:03:33.550> so<00:03:34.550> it<00:03:34.670> is<00:03:34.700> a<00:03:34.820> five<00:03:35.090> horse<00:03:36.100> and<00:03:37.100> it<00:03:37.250> is

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
see that so it is a five horse and it is

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.150 
see that so it is a five horse and it is
an<00:03:37.520> early<00:03:37.760> one<00:03:37.880> so<00:03:39.370> anyway<00:03:41.740> I'm<00:03:42.740> going<00:03:42.800> to<00:03:43.100> go

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
an early one so anyway I'm going to go

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.320 
an early one so anyway I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:43.550> and<00:03:44.350> pause<00:03:45.350> this<00:03:45.740> video<00:03:46.160> here<00:03:46.490> or<00:03:46.760> stop

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
ahead and pause this video here or stop

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.330 
ahead and pause this video here or stop
on<00:03:47.540> this<00:03:47.720> video<00:03:48.050> and<00:03:48.350> then<00:03:48.680> we'll<00:03:49.010> start

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
on this video and then we'll start

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.670 
on this video and then we'll start
another<00:03:49.550> one<00:03:49.820> when<00:03:50.180> I<00:03:50.350> go<00:03:51.350> to<00:03:51.410> take<00:03:51.590> the

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
another one when I go to take the

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.280 
another one when I go to take the
flywheel<00:03:51.890> off<00:03:52.250> so<00:03:52.910> this<00:03:53.780> will<00:03:53.900> be<00:03:53.990> the<00:03:54.110> first

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
flywheel off so this will be the first

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.290 
flywheel off so this will be the first
video<00:03:54.500> in<00:03:54.770> a<00:03:54.800> series<00:03:54.890> of<00:03:55.220> videos<00:03:55.580> so<00:03:55.610> thank<00:03:56.210> you

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
video in a series of videos so thank you

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.500 
video in a series of videos so thank you
for<00:03:56.390> watching<00:03:56.510> bye
