watchtower stuff where you're using the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.660 
watchtower stuff where you're using the

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
neck pickup and you need a lot of gain

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.920 
neck pickup and you need a lot of gain
the<00:01:22.670> other<00:01:22.820> cool<00:01:23.060> thing<00:01:23.119> is<00:01:23.539> if<00:01:23.690> you're<00:01:23.840> doing

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
like a rhythm part you want to sound a

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.120 
like a rhythm part you want to sound a
little<00:01:29.509> less<00:01:29.690> strata<00:01:30.200> you<00:01:30.470> can<00:01:30.619> roll<00:01:30.830> up<00:01:30.979> that

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
little less strata you can roll up that

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.010 
little less strata you can roll up that
presence<00:01:31.580> control<00:01:33.729> and<00:01:34.729> that's<00:01:35.660> a<00:01:35.780> gain

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
presence control and that's a gain

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:44.680 
presence control and that's a gain
control<00:01:36.500> on<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.770> mid-range<00:01:43.450> just<00:01:44.450> it<00:01:44.660> just

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
control on the mid-range just it just

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.240 
control on the mid-range just it just
adds<00:01:45.020> a<00:01:45.140> little<00:01:45.289> more<00:01:45.380> distortion<00:01:46.039> to<00:01:46.130> your

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
adds a little more distortion to your
