secateurs will lay their eggs in the

secateurs will lay their eggs in the
ground<00:00:08.290> in<00:00:08.800> late<00:00:09.160> fall<00:00:09.490> and<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.900> eggs<00:00:11.350> will

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:11.710

ground in late fall and the eggs will
and<00:00:11.889> the<00:00:12.250> larvae<00:00:12.670> will<00:00:12.820> overwinter

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
and the larvae will overwinter

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.439 
and the larvae will overwinter
underground<00:00:13.960> and<00:00:14.230> then<00:00:14.350> emerged<00:00:14.830> in<00:00:15.699> the<00:00:15.760> late

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:16.449 
underground and then emerged in the late

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.050 
underground and then emerged in the late
spring<00:00:16.750> or<00:00:17.140> early<00:00:17.199> summer<00:00:17.440> from<00:00:18.430> holes<00:00:18.699> for

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
spring or early summer from holes for

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.140 
spring or early summer from holes for
Susie<00:00:19.980> right<00:00:20.980> here<00:00:21.190> we<00:00:21.310> have<00:00:21.460> three<00:00:21.970> holes

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
Susie right here we have three holes

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.890 
Susie right here we have three holes
which<00:00:22.779> the<00:00:22.929> k2<00:00:23.140> have<00:00:23.320> recently<00:00:23.710> emerged<00:00:24.099> and

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
which the k2 have recently emerged and

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.939 
which the k2 have recently emerged and
after<00:00:25.900> they<00:00:26.019> immersed<00:00:26.320> in<00:00:26.439> the<00:00:26.529> ground<00:00:26.800> they

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:26.949 
after they immersed in the ground they

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.409 
after they immersed in the ground they
then<00:00:27.189> crawl<00:00:27.580> to<00:00:28.330> the<00:00:28.359> nearest<00:00:28.660> tree<00:00:29.109> and<00:00:30.419> then

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:31.419 
then crawl to the nearest tree and then

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.210 
then crawl to the nearest tree and then
climb<00:00:31.779> the<00:00:32.140> tree<00:00:32.380> to<00:00:32.650> find<00:00:32.890> a<00:00:32.980> place<00:00:33.190> where

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
climb the tree to find a place where

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.180 
climb the tree to find a place where
they<00:00:33.550> can<00:00:33.610> hang<00:00:34.360> over<00:00:34.780> overhang<00:00:35.470> and<00:00:35.740> hang

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
they can hang over overhang and hang

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.979 
they can hang over overhang and hang
downwards<00:00:36.520> so<00:00:37.030> that<00:00:37.180> they<00:00:37.300> can<00:00:37.480> then<00:00:37.510> emerge

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
downwards so that they can then emerge

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.850 
downwards so that they can then emerge
from<00:00:38.620> their<00:00:38.879> larval<00:00:39.879> state<00:00:40.629> case<00:00:40.989> you<00:00:41.649> can<00:00:41.829> see

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
from their larval state case you can see

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.840 
from their larval state case you can see
here<00:00:42.460> is<00:00:42.760> an<00:00:43.480> empty<00:00:43.750> shell<00:00:44.109> of<00:00:44.440> a<00:00:45.100> cicada<00:00:45.460> that

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
here is an empty shell of a cicada that

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.670 
here is an empty shell of a cicada that
emerged<00:00:46.239> they<00:00:46.780> climbed<00:00:47.079> out<00:00:47.260> of<00:00:47.289> its<00:00:47.500> hole

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
emerged they climbed out of its hole

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.000 
emerged they climbed out of its hole
look<00:00:48.250> and<00:00:48.969> fell<00:00:49.210> down<00:00:49.440> find<00:00:50.440> out<00:00:50.590> of<00:00:50.710> its<00:00:50.829> hole

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
look and fell down find out of its hole

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.360 
look and fell down find out of its hole
and<00:00:51.309> then<00:00:51.969> emerge<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:53.500> Butte<00:00:53.710> from<00:00:53.980> an<00:00:54.100> adult

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
and then emerge to Butte from an adult

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.240 
and then emerge to Butte from an adult
insects<00:00:54.820> and<00:00:55.750> as<00:00:55.989> I<00:00:56.109> you<00:00:56.710> can<00:00:56.859> see<00:00:56.980> there's<00:00:57.160> a

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
insects and as I you can see there's a

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.490 
insects and as I you can see there's a
crack<00:00:57.550> in<00:00:57.579> the<00:00:57.820> back<00:00:58.059> here<00:00:58.390> where<00:00:58.660> the<00:00:58.809> log

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
crack in the back here where the log

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.099 
crack in the back here where the log
with<00:00:59.829> the<00:00:59.859> adult<00:01:00.219> in<00:01:00.340> six<00:01:00.579> came<00:01:00.850> out<00:01:01.059> it<00:01:01.960> has

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
with the adult in six came out it has

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:03.869 
with the adult in six came out it has
the<00:01:02.260> big<00:01:02.410> claws<00:01:02.739> and<00:01:03.039> front<00:01:03.280> for<00:01:03.519> digging

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
the big claws and front for digging

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.960 
the big claws and front for digging
right<00:01:04.030> there<00:01:05.190> you<00:01:06.190> can<00:01:06.340> find<00:01:06.370> another<00:01:06.640> one

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
right there you can find another one

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:14.340 
right there you can find another one
right<00:01:07.180> here
