00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.310
 In ancient times, it was believed that stars 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.440
 eternal immutable are today but 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.389
 we know that's not true stars 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.969
 be born live your life and 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.250
 Eventually it dies like a star 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.500
 largely depends on its mass from a 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.570
 low-mass stars ends up as a white dwarf 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.320
 a massive star becomes one 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.480
 black hole 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.550
 but what happens to a star 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.880
 this medium becomes one 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.880
 neutron star 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.629
 stars spend their whole life with 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.520
 nuclear fusion this process begins with 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.530
 the simplest of all atoms namely 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.930
 hydrogen in the fusion of 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.520
 Hydrogen nuclei stands helium and the 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.120
 The energy released thereby brings the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.120
 stars to light up 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.640
 if a star has enough water 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.870
 he starts with the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.989
 fusion of matter 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.210
 in the process, heavier elements are created 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.850
 first helium then carbon neon 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.320
 oxygen and so on sometime but 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.720
 the star is running out of energy 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.340
 the nuclear fusion stops the star 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.700
 no longer develops and 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.700
 finally dies 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.310
 Smaller stars end up as theirs 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.900
 dwarfs you can call them glowing berlin 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.250
 with white very hot matter 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.300
 describe themselves over billions 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.100
 cool years 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.570
 even if no more nuclear fusion 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.580
 she is divorcing because of her 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.580
 astronomical high temperature anyway 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:37.210
 one day ours will be ours too 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.250
 sun as a white dwarf big star 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.050
 have a strong gravitation after 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.240
 Heavy damage to the end of the nuclear fusion 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.530
 caused by the gravitation 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.490
 Particles split and solid 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.530
 compressed 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.630
 The result is a black hole 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.730
 whose attractions are so strong 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.850
 that everything is sucked up around it 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:58.570
 even light the danger zone is called 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.280
 black represents radius called stars 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.840
 mean mass not too white 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.930
 dwarf or black holes 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.730
 They will become neutron stars 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.119
 as the name says for the most part 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.280
 Neutrons are neutral particles 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.860
 As early as 1920, Ernest Rutherford said the 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.390
 existence of neutron ahead twelve 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.880
 Years later, they were from James 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.170
 chadwick proved 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.770
 Neutrons are located in the nucleus of 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.090
 atoms 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.000
 but they are also the so-called 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.440
 trapping electrons formed under 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.360
 action of sufficient force 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.730
 the electron fuses with the proton 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.010
 that then becomes a neutron and neutrino 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.500
 The neutrino is super fast and 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.810
 leaves the core immediately 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.850
 the neutron that is the basis around 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.090
 to understand how neutron stars 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.739
 arise 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.450
 imagine a dying star in front of you 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.269
 about 50 percent heavier than ours 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.069
 sun is the gravitation of the strongest 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.379
 strong enough to squeeze through 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.629
 electrons and protons neutrons and 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.310
 neutrinos to form the neutrinos 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.010
 evaporate and leave one behind 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.299
 big heavy of neutron's 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.400
 gravitation continues to squeeze the neutrons 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.730
 together until a certain point is reached 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.129
 is 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.430
 this is the so-called pauli principle 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.260
 or paulis exclusion principle it 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.819
 said gross that two particles not 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.250
 at the same time the same place 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.770
 can claim a neutron star 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.270
 is born 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.940
 how is the difference of 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.930
 emergence of white dwarfs 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.540
 neutron star and black holes in 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.400
 pay off we face a dead one 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.230
 star with an imaginary wheel 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.950
 before we with the mass arbitrarily 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.710
 can change 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.910
 So we start with a solar mass 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.400
 the mass of our sun 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.500
 it produces a white dwarf, a 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.870
 rotating ferry made of white extreme 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.920
 hot matter in about the size of 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.350
 our earth is 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.210
 let's start a bit on the main 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.520
 increase the mass becomes the gravitation 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.590
 stronger the white dwarf smaller and the 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.710
 rotation faster we turn that 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.870
 The dial on 139 solar masses is the 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.700
 gravitation so strong that electrons and 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.750
 protons neutrons and neutrinos 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.210
 merge 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.430
 this value will be radically limited 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.740
 called the dead we stand to one 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.210
 neutron star he swims to one 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.430
 sphere with a radius of 10 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.440
 kilometers together and revolves with 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.200
 a speed of up to 100 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.460
 revolutions per second we turn 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.739
 continue on the wheel is the 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.540
 gravitation finally so strong that 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.370
 the neutrons are split and the 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.320
 star collapsed to a black hole 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.170
 this is the so-called dreamers 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.310
 oppenheimer folk on border of the exact 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:30.550
 value is unknown but is 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.440
 somewhere between 1.5 and 3 solar mass 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.820
 a neutron star does not exist that way 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.440
 from neutrons 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.570
 Although they make the bulk of the 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.570
 there are still some components 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.980
 rest of protons and electrons due 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.480
 the fast rotation form the 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.970
 charged particles a strong 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.590
 magnetic field but also on earth 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.790
 this magnetic field does not necessarily have to be 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.820
 with one and educational axis 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.560
 match like a star lighthouse 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.710
 transmitter the posing signals in form 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.760
 of electromagnetic radiation, too 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.560
 be from these signals 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.490
 neutron stars sometimes also pulsars 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.260
 called the existence of 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.210
 neutron stars and methods 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.000
 itself was already following first 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.770
 Observations predicted as neutron 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.620
 The astronomers were discovered 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.840
 walter bade and fritz zwicky preceded that 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.000
 arise from supernova neutron stars 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.530
 can 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.600
 1967 was then for the first time 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.190
 pulsating neutron star observed 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:29.290
 since then many more have been discovered 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.060
 the universe is infinite as well 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.640
 our urge for new knowledge therefore 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.070
 is it worth our channel too 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.030
 just subscribe to the way 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.490
 subscribe -button 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.060
 we make sure that the thirst for knowledge 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.060
 be breastfed
