00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.059
 Andres is one of the newest models. 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.279
 sports cars 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.500
 if you watch which car from 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.340
 real life refers alpha then i 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.470
 I'll tell you right away that this rain skill in 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:30.650
 1991 in the pictures you see two 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.650
 auto alpha and do not distinguish true 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.280
 Now about the alpha machine itself takes 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.710
 intermediate position between 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.559
 sports cars and medium 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.230
 class has a pretty good cherry bit 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.390
 and impressive characteristics which 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.390
 close to the level of sports cars 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.430
 by the sound of the engine we can say that 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.770
 car alfa racing motor alpha 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.630
 well accelerated and well managed 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.940
 on the road trouble sanan dres 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.720
 and can still be found in many areas 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.720
 geta sanandres 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.600
 And now a little about the design of the machine if 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.970
 you might notice alpha looks 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.729
 beautifully enough I want to notice that 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.260
 it is for cars of the 90s very 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.310
 looks good compared to others 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.970
 cars 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.470
 maybe all the work is done by lights 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.960
 undoubtedly the headlights one of the most beautiful 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.619
 parts in cars and alpha not 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.619
 excluded 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.310
 also if you notice the car has 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.200
 only 2 and 2 not 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.630
 and if you think logically and 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.660
 most race cars have it 2 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.010
 doors and place 2 is the driver's seat and 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.380
 seat guide 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.580
 but there are also ordinary cars that 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.440
 have a total of 2 2 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.250
 but this does not always mean that this 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.250
 racing car 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.140
 move on to the evaluation of my car scale 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.040
 ratings changed a bit over this 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.390
 the time span will now be in it 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.379
 manageability damageability 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:41.290
 elegance drawing maximum overclocking 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.900
 speed and overall rating of the car but 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.200
 added a couple of points hope they don't 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.780
 too much and now assess friends 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.329
 handling this car 9 out of 10 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.690
 because the machine is driven perfectly 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.920
 but still I miss something 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.129
 damage seven out of ten car 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.109
 easy to break really but not so 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.660
 easy as 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:06.640
 more let's say the same elegance 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.700
 this car is gorgeous since 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.010
 sports cars are always graceful i think 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.370
 everyone agrees with me 10 out of 10 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.040
 drawing 10 out of 10 in my car 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.500
 traced to the smallest 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.780
 pixel overclocking nine out of ten 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:28.319
 still a racing car and so i 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.319
 decided to make this assessment naturally by 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.880
 speed and naturally overclocking 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.980
 still something is missing for 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.049
 speed cars is the maximum 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.579
 speed eight out of ten car 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.739
 accelerates fast enough 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:44.829
 Still, the maximum speed is not 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:47.139
 the biggest overall rating of this 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.299
 car 9 and even 10 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:51.040
 nine and a half on the top ten i'm not in 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.000
 In no case can I deliver as 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.340
 this is a sports car and 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.460
 and according to sports estimates, it does not 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.970
 can deserve dozens unfortunately here 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.970
 so here
