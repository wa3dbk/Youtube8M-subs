hi<00:00:01.230> everyone<00:00:01.530> we're<00:00:01.920> back<00:00:02.159> with<00:00:03.319> intracranial

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
hi everyone we're back with intracranial

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.440 
hi everyone we're back with intracranial
pressure<00:00:04.799> monitoring<00:00:05.460> and<00:00:06.120> this<00:00:06.270> is

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
pressure monitoring and this is

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.210 
pressure monitoring and this is
something<00:00:06.899> that<00:00:06.930> most<00:00:07.350> nurses<00:00:07.859> do<00:00:08.040> not

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
something that most nurses do not

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.370 
something that most nurses do not
experience<00:00:08.790> because<00:00:09.059> first<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.540> all<00:00:09.719> not

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
experience because first of all not

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.759 
experience because first of all not
every<00:00:11.240> institution<00:00:12.240> allows<00:00:13.049> intracranial

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
every institution allows intracranial

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.709 
every institution allows intracranial

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
pressure monitoring Sony very

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.470 
pressure monitoring Sony very
specialized<00:00:16.410> places<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.160> do<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.670> actually

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
specialized places that do and actually

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.720 
specialized places that do and actually
it<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.930> not<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.439> easy<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:20.010> accomplish<00:00:20.369> so<00:00:20.670> I'm

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
it is not that easy to accomplish so I'm

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.970 
it is not that easy to accomplish so I'm
going<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:20.970> try<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.270> just<00:00:22.050> breeze<00:00:22.289> over<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:22.740> very

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
going to try to just breeze over it very

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.470 
going to try to just breeze over it very
lightly<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.490> can<00:00:23.670> take<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.000> time<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.359> do

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
lightly and you can take the time to do

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.960 
lightly and you can take the time to do
the<00:00:24.600> case<00:00:24.810> studies<00:00:25.260> let's<00:00:26.070> take<00:00:26.340> what<00:00:26.730> would

I<00:01:20.220> try<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.729> just<00:01:21.150> give<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.420> an<00:01:21.810> overview<00:01:22.290> of

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
I try to just give you an overview of

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.600 
I try to just give you an overview of
what<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.220> patient<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:23.970> ICU<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:25.009> ICP<00:01:26.009> monitor<00:01:26.040> and

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
what a patient in ICU on ICP monitor and

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.030 
what a patient in ICU on ICP monitor and
looks<00:01:26.820> like<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:27.600> not<00:01:27.990> an<00:01:28.259> easy<00:01:28.470> thing<00:01:28.680> to

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
looks like it's not an easy thing to

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.609 
looks like it's not an easy thing to
conquer<00:01:29.520> just<00:01:29.759> by<00:01:29.970> reading<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:31.140> walk<00:01:31.409> it

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
conquer just by reading this to walk it

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.039 
conquer just by reading this to walk it
through<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.070> not<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.610> easy<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.479> takes<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.869> lot

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
through is not that easy it takes a lot

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.499 
through is not that easy it takes a lot
of<00:01:34.079> experience<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:35.070> lot<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.280> learning<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.299> get

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
of experience a lot of learning to get

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.510 
of experience a lot of learning to get
there<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:36.990> even<00:01:37.170> if<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.560> have<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.799> patient<00:01:38.340> and

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
there so even if you have a patient and

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.310 
there so even if you have a patient and
you<00:01:38.549> don't<00:01:39.180> know<00:01:39.360> all<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.659> details<00:01:39.840> don't

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
you don't know all the details don't

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.219 
you don't know all the details don't
feel<00:01:40.590> bad<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.100> takes<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.430> long<00:01:41.640> time

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
feel bad it takes a long time

intracranial pressure monitoring is

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.210 
intracranial pressure monitoring is
usually<00:01:45.060> done<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.930> control<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.740> amount<00:01:47.070> of

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
lot of damage to the brain not to speak

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.929

a bag which is emptied every hour and

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.530 
a bag which is emptied every hour and

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
then the intracranial pressure is read

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.479 
then the intracranial pressure is read
the<00:02:35.050> normal<00:02:35.380> intracranial<00:02:35.800> pressure<00:02:36.310> is

the normal intracranial pressure is

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.270 
the normal intracranial pressure is
usually<00:02:36.700> 0<00:02:37.239> to<00:02:37.360> 15<00:02:37.930> but<00:02:38.440> that's<00:02:38.590> not<00:02:38.800> paved<00:02:39.100> in

cement the other criteria like if a

cement the other criteria like if a
patient<00:02:41.890> has<00:02:42.070> been<00:02:42.220> severely<00:02:42.640> brain<00:02:43.030> damaged

patient has been severely brain damaged

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.470 
patient has been severely brain damaged
it's<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:44.380> would<00:02:44.620> be<00:02:44.800> very<00:02:45.090> unrealistic<00:02:46.090> to

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
it's it would be very unrealistic to

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.690 
it's it would be very unrealistic to
expect<00:02:46.600> a<00:02:47.019> normal<00:02:47.170> pressure<00:02:47.620> so<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.340> doctor

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
expect a normal pressure so the doctor

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.400 
expect a normal pressure so the doctor
usually<00:02:49.180> works<00:02:49.420> or<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.720> patient<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:50.290> the

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
usually works or the patient and the

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.380 
usually works or the patient and the
pressures<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:51.040> writes<00:02:51.700> his<00:02:51.910> orders<00:02:52.269> to

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
pressures and writes his orders to

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.290 
pressures and writes his orders to
coincide<00:02:52.660> it's<00:02:53.650> again<00:02:54.040> very<00:02:54.370> complicated<00:02:55.060> and

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
coincide it's again very complicated and

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.210 
coincide it's again very complicated and
do<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.570> best<00:02:55.720> you<00:02:55.870> can<00:02:55.959> to<00:02:56.769> learn<00:02:56.980> whatever

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
do the best you can to learn whatever

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.030 
do the best you can to learn whatever
you<00:02:57.580> can<00:02:57.820> now<00:02:58.690> I<00:02:58.720> address<00:02:59.260> seizures<00:02:59.769> here

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
you can now I address seizures here

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.130 
you can now I address seizures here
because<00:03:00.400> patients<00:03:00.700> who've<00:03:01.150> had<00:03:01.180> brain

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
because patients who've had brain

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.220 
because patients who've had brain
injuries<00:03:02.560> tend<00:03:03.070> to<00:03:03.220> develop<00:03:03.489> seizures<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.480> so

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
injuries tend to develop seizures and so

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.050 
injuries tend to develop seizures and so
