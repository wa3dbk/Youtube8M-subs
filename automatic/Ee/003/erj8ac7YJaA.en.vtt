Roxio or I think I'll get or any other
capture<00:01:04.500> card<00:01:04.650> base<00:01:04.830> clear<00:01:05.189> um<00:01:06.020> you<00:01:07.020> can<00:01:07.229> eat

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
capture card base clear um you can eat

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.109 
capture card base clear um you can eat
you<00:01:07.650> you'll<00:01:08.100> probably<00:01:08.400> be<00:01:08.670> using<00:01:08.700> those

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
you you'll probably be using those

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.840 
you you'll probably be using those
anyway<00:01:10.010> even<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:12.229> something<00:01:13.229> will<00:01:13.470> use<00:01:13.680> HMI<00:01:14.369> to

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
anyway even I something will use HMI to

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.030 
anyway even I something will use HMI to
report<00:01:15.180> as<00:01:15.330> well<00:01:15.509> well<00:01:16.170> then<00:01:16.380> what<00:01:16.770> but<00:01:17.009> i

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
report as well well then what but i

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.840 
report as well well then what but i
don't<00:01:17.540> so<00:01:18.540> basically<00:01:18.960> just<00:01:19.200> what<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.770> do<00:01:19.979> if

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850
