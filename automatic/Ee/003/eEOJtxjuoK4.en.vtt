let's<00:00:07.740> take<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.010> look<00:00:08.220> at<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.490> main<00:00:08.730> radar

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
let's take a look at the main radar

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.350 
let's take a look at the main radar

2<00:00:12.630> we<00:00:12.870> have<00:00:12.990> HDS<00:00:13.650> 10<00:00:13.889> in<00:00:14.010> front<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.490> us

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.200

grayed out its target expansion and you

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.040 
grayed out its target expansion and you
could<00:00:31.950> select<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.520> we<00:00:33.180> have<00:00:33.329> target<00:00:33.750> trails

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050

we<00:00:34.379> could<00:00:34.530> turn<00:00:34.710> them<00:00:34.980> on<00:00:35.129> or<00:00:35.250> off<00:00:35.489> when<00:00:36.450> we

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
we could turn them on or off when we

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.430 
we could turn them on or off when we
turn<00:00:36.780> them<00:00:36.930> on<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.890> leaves<00:00:38.130> a<00:00:38.280> trail<00:00:39.440> behind

turn them on it leaves a trail behind

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.410 
turn them on it leaves a trail behind
our<00:00:40.890> readings<00:00:41.310> and<00:00:41.520> that's<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.850> white<00:00:42.150> there

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
our readings and that's that white there

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.720 
our readings and that's that white there
that<00:00:42.930> way<00:00:43.110> we<00:00:43.290> can<00:00:43.440> see<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.770> path<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.430> moving

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
that way we can see the path of a moving

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.319 
that way we can see the path of a moving
object

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
object

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.540 
object
it<00:00:45.780> also<00:00:45.930> clutters<00:00:46.440> up<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> screen<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> bit<00:00:47.130> so

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
it also clutters up the screen a bit so

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.080 
it also clutters up the screen a bit so
you<00:00:47.670> may<00:00:47.850> not<00:00:48.030> want<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.390> on<00:00:48.600> all<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:49.110> time<00:00:50.090> we

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
you may not want it on all the time we

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.660 
you may not want it on all the time we
have<00:00:51.329> our<00:00:51.540> pallet<00:00:52.079> that's<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.920> colors<00:00:53.340> that

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
have our pallet that's the colors that

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.670 
have our pallet that's the colors that
it<00:00:53.790> draws<00:00:54.060> in<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.780> we<00:00:54.930> could<00:00:55.020> select<00:00:55.350> one<00:00:55.470> of

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
it draws in so we could select one of

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:05.299 
it draws in so we could select one of
these<00:00:55.800> other<00:00:56.010> ones<00:01:03.170> we<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.309> orientations

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
these other ones we have orientations

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.219 
these other ones we have orientations
greyed<00:01:05.610> out<00:01:05.640> right<00:01:06.030> now<00:01:06.240> then<00:01:06.840> we<00:01:06.990> have<00:01:07.110> our

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
greyed out right now then we have our

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.280 
greyed out right now then we have our
threshold<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.820> could<00:01:09.060> turn<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.630> right<00:01:09.990> up

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
threshold you could turn that right up

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.460 
threshold you could turn that right up
or<00:01:10.500> right<00:01:11.370> down<00:01:14.510> north<00:01:15.510> indicators<00:01:16.110> greyed

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
or right down north indicators greyed

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.450 
or right down north indicators greyed
out<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:17.100> we<00:01:17.220> can<00:01:17.400> enable<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.909> also<00:01:19.460> range

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
out but we can enable that also range

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.390 
out but we can enable that also range
rings<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.240> say<00:01:22.170> always<00:01:22.440> leave<00:01:22.619> range<00:01:22.890> rings<00:01:23.159> on

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
rings I say always leave range rings on

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.460 
rings I say always leave range rings on
these<00:01:23.909> are<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.180> Rings<00:01:24.360> there<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:25.110> take<00:01:25.320> them

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
these are the Rings there you take them

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.410 
these are the Rings there you take them
off<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.799> disappears<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.430> it's<00:01:26.729> harder<00:01:27.150> to

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
off it disappears and it's harder to

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.590 
off it disappears and it's harder to
read<00:01:27.720> how<00:01:28.020> far<00:01:28.409> an<00:01:28.710> object<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.610> from<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.180> so

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
read how far an object is from you so

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.780 
read how far an object is from you so
leave<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.930> on<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.409> then<00:01:31.440> we<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.310> do<00:01:32.520> range

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
leave that on and then we can do range

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.210 
leave that on and then we can do range
markers<00:01:33.360> which<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:33.869> tells<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.470> what<00:01:34.650> each

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
markers which just tells you what each

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.980 
markers which just tells you what each
one<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.549> these<00:01:35.640> lines<00:01:35.880> are<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.360> that's<00:01:36.450> 200

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
one of these lines are so that's 200

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.910 
one of these lines are so that's 200
feet<00:01:37.200> out<00:01:37.380> 300<00:01:38.010> feet<00:01:38.220> out<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:38.820> on

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
feet out 300 feet out and so on

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.950 
feet out 300 feet out and so on
we<00:01:40.920> have<00:01:41.220> compass<00:01:41.790> we<00:01:42.150> could<00:01:42.299> turn<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.810> or

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
we have compass we could turn that on or

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.330 
we have compass we could turn that on or
off<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.409> that's<00:01:43.530> going<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.740> control<00:01:44.220> these

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
off and that's going to control these

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.130 
off and that's going to control these
degrees<00:01:44.580> and<00:01:45.000> such<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.600> see<00:01:45.810> their

bearing it's grayed out right now but

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:51.920 
bearing it's grayed out right now but

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
when it's not grayed out we could adjust

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.490 
when it's not grayed out we could adjust
that<00:01:52.520> marpa<00:01:53.520> which<00:01:54.090> stands<00:01:54.479> for<00:01:54.659> mini<00:01:55.140> auto

safe rings here just let you know
whether<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.530> objects<00:02:07.950> safe<00:02:08.129> or<00:02:08.310> not<00:02:08.519> and<00:02:09.829> then
