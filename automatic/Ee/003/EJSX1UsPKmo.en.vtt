00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
mode zero so now let's say now let's

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.080 
mode zero so now let's say now let's
drag<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.840> back<00:02:25.080> into<00:02:25.320> our<00:02:25.530> CFG<00:02:26.280> folder<00:02:26.460> sweet

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
drag it back into our CFG folder sweet

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.540 
drag it back into our CFG folder sweet
alright<00:02:28.020> so<00:02:28.260> now<00:02:28.590> we<00:02:29.010> can<00:02:29.190> get<00:02:29.340> rid<00:02:29.520> of

terminal now let's open tech it or

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.050 
terminal now let's open tech it or
technic<00:02:31.950> launcher<00:02:34.250> now<00:02:35.250> once<00:02:35.460> again<00:02:35.610> before

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
technic launcher now once again before

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.160 
technic launcher now once again before
you<00:02:36.180> did<00:02:36.330> all<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.600> stuff<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:36.960> just

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
that was closed otherwise this will not

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.190 
that was closed otherwise this will not
function<00:02:40.560> properly<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:41.810> let's<00:02:42.810> go<00:02:42.930> ahead<00:02:43.020> and

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
function properly and let's go ahead and

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.050 
function properly and let's go ahead and
log<00:02:43.350> back<00:02:43.560> into<00:02:43.740> tech<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:46.130> so<00:02:47.130> hopefully<00:02:47.910> this

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
log back into tech it so hopefully this

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.699 
log back into tech it so hopefully this
does<00:02:48.270> not<00:02:48.420> take<00:02:48.660> too<00:02:48.780> long<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:48.959> load<00:02:49.080> I<00:02:49.260> hope<00:02:49.530> it

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
does not take too long to load I hope it

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.740 
does not take too long to load I hope it
doesn't<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.850> seems<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.270> be<00:02:51.390> running
