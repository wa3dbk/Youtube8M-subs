bottom of one tab through the top of
another<00:02:24.050> form<00:02:25.050> them<00:02:25.290> like<00:02:25.560> bricks

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.710 

and<00:02:44.540> they<00:02:45.140> should<00:02:45.440> turn<00:02:45.920> out<00:02:46.300> something<00:02:47.300> like

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
and they should turn out something like

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.740 
and they should turn out something like
that<00:02:48.190> eventually<00:02:49.190> though<00:02:49.430> if<00:02:49.850> you<00:02:50.450> keep<00:02:50.690> doing

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
that eventually though if you keep doing

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.570 
that eventually though if you keep doing
this<00:02:51.910> they'll<00:02:52.910> turn<00:02:53.150> into<00:02:53.570> something<00:02:54.580> more

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
this they'll turn into something more

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.150 
this they'll turn into something more
like<00:02:55.820> this<00:02:59.260> you<00:03:00.260> can<00:03:00.440> see<00:03:00.650> here<00:03:00.950> I've

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
like this you can see here I've

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.750 
like this you can see here I've
connected<00:03:01.660> each<00:03:02.660> one<00:03:03.020> of<00:03:03.050> these<00:03:03.320> in<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.520> same

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
connected each one of these in the same

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.490 
connected each one of these in the same
way<00:03:05.860> that<00:03:06.860> I<00:03:06.920> did<00:03:07.040> these
