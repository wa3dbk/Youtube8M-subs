00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.120
 or the one that came is how you are welcome 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.680
 how to give away fish and guess who 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.870
 they have not given him fish for their aquarium 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.120
 once the problem is that there are many 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.800
 too many varieties and many of them 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.080
 they are incompatible in several aspects 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.880
 so let's help a little bit at all 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.039
 those people who need some guidance 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.289
 or directions to give away fish 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.539
 successfully first of all you must 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.490
 make sure that the fish are 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.740
 compatible with water parameters 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.060
 of the person who will receive them the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.369
 ph and the gh 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.589
 secondly you need to know what and 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.059
 how many fish are in the aquarium in the 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:38.190
 that is going to be the place of the fish 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.350
 new the overpopulation of fish is 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.120
 deadly to them and the behavior of 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.249
 each species is essential for them to be 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.379
 compatible between them and do not kill 

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:48.359
 third large fish for 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.609
 very large aquariums and small fish 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:53.850
 for small aquariums or never 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:55.769
 you give away a golf and a tent or a koi to 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.629
 unless that person has aquariums 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.969
 hundreds of liters and do not have any kind 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.069
 of another fish in fourth place that can 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.469
 seem silly but that is the 

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:05.650
 better advice has thrown better than 

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:08.260
 give away many 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.740
 watered the least possible but by the 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.200
 contrary 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.390
 give her many plants this will give a 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.060
 quality touch to the aquarium and also the 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.800
 fish will live longer and much better try 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.590
 that are easy plants like the rain 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.320
 bacteria to nubia nana for the one of fox goes 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.450
 The leaves left moss left behind 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.940
 oval would design among others 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.860
 in fifth place males and females this is 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.330
 a dilemma always and that's why before 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.580
 give away make sure there is not 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.830
 too many males or in some cases that 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.630
 there is only one male according to the species without 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.369
 However, and generally you can have 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.890
 several females with the most 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.140
 species in sixth place when we take out 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.060
 the fish in a store we have to 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.250
 Hurry up when they get to their place 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.960
 between 30 and 60 minutes would be the time 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.540
 maximum so that there are no consequences 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.250
 yes the weather is good if long 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.619
 cold or a lot of heat the time is reduced 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.720
 drastically and by the way the best 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.360
 time to move them is in winter 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.340
 in seventh place if we give away a fish very 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.770
 special accompanies the gift with his 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.470
 necessary food is to say in stores 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.810
 they will usually tell us that the fish can 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.030
 eat anything or just do not 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.980
 tell us what it is 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.780
 what you eat or need to eat that fish 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.240
 but you're really going to have to look 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.670
 for yourself that you need to eat that fish 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.190
 specifically in eighth place the fish 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.500
 very pretty they are usually conflicting or 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.690
 difficult and you have to look with magnifying glass 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.520
 needs and their compatibility 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.650
 example a beta is a gift 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.480
 sure for its beauty but can not 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.130
 be with other fish other cases 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.500
 also complicated can be the 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.870
 climb the disk the fish the balloon the 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.640
 precocious tome et cetera etcetera add in 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.100
 the place there are many ornaments for 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.780
 nice and interesting aquariums but if 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.519
 they have sharp edges is better 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.830
 leave them because the fish are made 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.750
 wounds very easily it's always better 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.790
 put a single ornament or two with a lot 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.950
 to leave space for the fish and 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.510
 that can swim in tenth place and for 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.370
 last if you think too many 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.470
 indications for a simple gift 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.420
 you can always write down which fish has the 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.370
 person and with this list ask in the 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.380
 Fish store are compatible but 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.480
 never give away fish by surprise and without 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.370
 look at the good compatibility but well 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.290
 I hope this will be useful for 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.480
 give away fish to people who have 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.980
 aquariums that do it successfully and 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.370
 I hope you liked the video 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.140
 I like it a lot 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.060
