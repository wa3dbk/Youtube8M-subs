little power cable which the power cable

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.209 
little power cable which the power cable
isn't<00:02:02.579> as<00:02:02.939> like<00:02:03.590> terrible's<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.649> lot<00:02:04.799> whoa<00:02:04.950> the

deal<00:02:59.620> with<00:02:59.710> him<00:02:59.800> it<00:02:59.860> was<00:02:59.980> hard<00:03:00.130> to<00:03:00.190> like<00:03:00.340> try<00:03:00.580> to

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
deal with him it was hard to like try to

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.220 
deal with him it was hard to like try to
wrap<00:03:01.450> him<00:03:01.600> up<00:03:01.720> when<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:01.990> were<00:03:02.080> going

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
wrap him up when you were going

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.020 
wrap him up when you were going
somewhere<00:03:02.470> so<00:03:02.740> this<00:03:02.920> is<00:03:03.070> way<00:03:03.490> more<00:03:03.520> convenient

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
somewhere so this is way more convenient

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.340 
somewhere so this is way more convenient
if<00:03:04.180> I'm<00:03:04.330> going<00:03:04.420> to<00:03:04.510> take<00:03:04.630> it<00:03:04.690> somewhere<00:03:05.050> like

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
if I'm going to take it somewhere like

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.020 
if I'm going to take it somewhere like
if<00:03:05.500> I'm<00:03:05.620> going<00:03:05.860> to<00:03:06.010> a<00:03:06.040> hotel<00:03:06.340> or<00:03:06.580> something

if I'm going to a hotel or something

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.340 
if I'm going to a hotel or something
like<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.240> this<00:03:07.900> would<00:03:08.050> be<00:03:08.080> way<00:03:08.320> more

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
like that this would be way more

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.830 
like that this would be way more
convenient<00:03:08.890> to<00:03:09.100> carry<00:03:09.250> around<00:03:09.370> with<00:03:09.790> me<00:03:09.850> so<00:03:10.810> I

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
convenient to carry around with me so I

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.720 
convenient to carry around with me so I
definitely<00:03:11.140> like<00:03:11.560> that<00:03:11.770> and<00:03:12.100> then<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.490> take<00:03:12.670> a

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730

exactly<00:04:23.950> like<00:04:24.370> what<00:04:24.550> happens<00:04:24.820> when<00:04:24.970> it<00:04:25.060> comes

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
exactly like what happens when it comes

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.490 
exactly like what happens when it comes
to

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
to

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.170 
to
you<00:04:25.560> possibly<00:04:26.130> putting<00:04:26.400> a<00:04:26.550> camera<00:04:26.820> on<00:04:27.000> there

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
you possibly putting a camera on there

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.430 
you possibly putting a camera on there
because<00:04:27.330> why<00:04:27.450> stream<00:04:27.870> I<00:04:27.900> like<00:04:28.230> to<00:04:28.290> have<00:04:28.380> a

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
because why stream I like to have a

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.160 
because why stream I like to have a
camera<00:04:28.650> and<00:04:28.980> i<00:04:29.550> paid<00:04:29.790> like<00:04:30.120> 70<00:04:30.780> bucks<00:04:30.960> for

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
camera and i paid like 70 bucks for

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.630 
camera and i paid like 70 bucks for
xsplit<00:04:31.590> so<00:04:31.770> more<00:04:32.010> than<00:04:32.040> likely<00:04:32.160> what<00:04:32.550> i'm

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
xsplit so more than likely what i'm

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.190 
xsplit so more than likely what i'm
going<00:04:32.730> to<00:04:32.790> do<00:04:32.970> is<00:04:33.180> I'm<00:04:33.660> going<00:04:33.750> to<00:04:33.840> use<00:04:34.020> this

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
going to do is I'm going to use this

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.280 
going to do is I'm going to use this
other<00:04:34.500> feature<00:04:35.070> which<00:04:35.490> is<00:04:35.730> what<00:04:36.600> you<00:04:36.810> use<00:04:37.080> on

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
other feature which is what you use on

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.750 
other feature which is what you use on
the<00:04:37.410> other<00:04:37.590> one<00:04:37.770> pretty<00:04:38.250> much<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:38.550> same<00:04:38.700> thing

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
the other one pretty much the same thing

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.220 
the other one pretty much the same thing
that<00:04:39.000> looks<00:04:39.480> like<00:04:39.600> it's<00:04:39.750> a<00:04:39.810> little<00:04:39.990> bit<00:04:40.110> more

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
that looks like it's a little bit more

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.370 
that looks like it's a little bit more
upgraded<00:04:40.650> and<00:04:40.920> that<00:04:41.850> would<00:04:42.090> be<00:04:42.120> a<00:04:42.810> total<00:04:43.260> media

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
upgraded and that would be a total media

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.640 
upgraded and that would be a total media
extreme<00:04:44.070> which<00:04:44.460> also<00:04:44.760> has<00:04:45.750> I<00:04:46.200> guess<00:04:46.320> it's

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
extreme which also has I guess it's

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.160 
extreme which also has I guess it's
known<00:04:46.950> as<00:04:46.980> arcsoft<00:04:47.730> totalmedia<00:04:48.170> extreme

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
known as arcsoft totalmedia extreme

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.370 
known as arcsoft totalmedia extreme
that's<00:04:49.920> a<00:04:50.010> program<00:04:50.340> i<00:04:50.460> use<00:04:50.610> not<00:04:50.880> with<00:04:51.060> that<00:04:51.380> you

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
that's a program i use not with that you

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.860 
that's a program i use not with that you
can<00:04:52.560> capture<00:04:52.830> which<00:04:53.340> with<00:04:53.670> this<00:04:53.970> being<00:04:54.240> hdmi

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
can capture which with this being hdmi

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:55.970 
can capture which with this being hdmi
and<00:04:54.900> then<00:04:55.260> just<00:04:55.380> being<00:04:55.560> i<00:04:55.620> think<00:04:55.800> a<00:04:55.860> better

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
and then just being i think a better

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.040 
and then just being i think a better
product<00:04:56.340> it's<00:04:56.700> way<00:04:57.030> more<00:04:57.060> crisp<00:04:57.630> looking

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
product it's way more crisp looking

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.270 
product it's way more crisp looking
whenever<00:04:58.320> i<00:04:58.380> stream<00:04:58.680> you'll<00:04:58.830> be<00:04:58.919> able<00:04:58.980> to<00:04:59.100> see

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
whenever i stream you'll be able to see

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.890 
whenever i stream you'll be able to see
it<00:04:59.370> it's<00:04:59.490> going<00:04:59.610> to<00:04:59.669> look<00:04:59.820> way<00:04:59.940> more<00:04:59.970> crisp<00:05:00.419> not

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
it it's going to look way more crisp not

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.300 
it it's going to look way more crisp not
to<00:05:01.020> mention<00:05:01.140> the<00:05:01.320> video<00:05:01.650> has<00:05:01.860> come<00:05:02.040> out<00:05:02.160> better

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
to mention the video has come out better

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.620 
to mention the video has come out better
like<00:05:02.520> the<00:05:02.640> videos<00:05:02.880> that<00:05:03.000> I've<00:05:03.090> recorded<00:05:03.390> are

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
like the videos that I've recorded are

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.230 
like the videos that I've recorded are
much<00:05:03.780> better<00:05:03.960> so<00:05:04.650> being<00:05:05.160> an<00:05:05.280> HDMI<00:05:05.790> really

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
much better so being an HDMI really

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.909 
much better so being an HDMI really
helps<00:05:06.540> that<00:05:06.750> i'm<00:05:06.990> able<00:05:07.080> to<00:05:07.260> capture<00:05:07.500> and<00:05:07.800> make

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
helps that i'm able to capture and make

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.159 
helps that i'm able to capture and make
it<00:05:08.040> look<00:05:08.190> you<00:05:08.880> know<00:05:09.000> a<00:05:09.030> lot<00:05:09.510> better<00:05:09.720> than<00:05:10.080> what

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
it look you know a lot better than what

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.100 
it look you know a lot better than what
I<00:05:10.230> had<00:05:10.470> before<00:05:11.120> it<00:05:12.120> does<00:05:12.360> have<00:05:12.630> a<00:05:12.660> little<00:05:12.960> bit

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
I had before it does have a little bit

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.170 
I had before it does have a little bit
of<00:05:13.260> a<00:05:13.440> delay<00:05:14.010> though<00:05:14.310> whenever<00:05:14.580> I'm<00:05:14.820> going<00:05:14.850> to

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
of a delay though whenever I'm going to

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.060 
of a delay though whenever I'm going to
like<00:05:15.330> turn<00:05:15.540> it<00:05:15.720> on<00:05:15.840> and<00:05:16.050> get<00:05:16.169> it<00:05:16.260> going<00:05:16.290> for

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
like turn it on and get it going for

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.460 
like turn it on and get it going for
some<00:05:17.280> reason<00:05:17.520> I<00:05:17.580> have<00:05:17.760> an<00:05:17.880> issue<00:05:18.060> where<00:05:18.690> like

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
some reason I have an issue where like

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.320 
some reason I have an issue where like
it's<00:05:19.830> it<00:05:20.280> could<00:05:20.460> be<00:05:20.580> just<00:05:20.700> my<00:05:20.880> computer<00:05:21.240> or

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
it's it could be just my computer or

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.909 
it's it could be just my computer or
something<00:05:21.450> going<00:05:21.720> on<00:05:21.900> but<00:05:22.080> it's<00:05:22.200> kind<00:05:22.650> of<00:05:22.710> hard

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
something going on but it's kind of hard

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.700 
something going on but it's kind of hard
to<00:05:22.980> pull<00:05:23.250> up<00:05:23.430> the<00:05:23.640> program<00:05:23.910> and<00:05:24.480> it<00:05:25.320> delays

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
to pull up the program and it delays

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.040 
to pull up the program and it delays
being<00:05:26.340> able<00:05:26.520> to<00:05:26.610> show<00:05:26.880> me<00:05:27.030> the<00:05:27.180> feed<00:05:27.480> or<00:05:27.810> if<00:05:27.930> I

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
being able to show me the feed or if I

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.870 
being able to show me the feed or if I
hit<00:05:28.230> capture<00:05:28.650> it'll<00:05:28.980> like<00:05:29.190> delay<00:05:29.430> it's<00:05:29.610> a<00:05:29.669> lot

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
hit capture it'll like delay it's a lot

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.850 
hit capture it'll like delay it's a lot
longer<00:05:30.120> than<00:05:30.390> whenever<00:05:30.690> I<00:05:30.750> did<00:05:30.930> it<00:05:31.050> on<00:05:31.169> the<00:05:31.470> HD

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
longer than whenever I did it on the HD

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.950 
longer than whenever I did it on the HD
PVR<00:05:31.890> number<00:05:32.490> one<00:05:32.669> so<00:05:33.300> that's<00:05:33.510> really<00:05:33.660> weird

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
PVR number one so that's really weird

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.110 
PVR number one so that's really weird
and<00:05:34.290> then<00:05:34.410> sometimes<00:05:35.010> like<00:05:35.220> my<00:05:35.400> screen<00:05:35.850> it

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
and then sometimes like my screen it

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.010 
and then sometimes like my screen it
might<00:05:36.360> be<00:05:36.479> just<00:05:36.630> the<00:05:36.660> way<00:05:36.750> I<00:05:36.780> have<00:05:36.930> it

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
might be just the way I have it

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.420 
might be just the way I have it
connected<00:05:37.200> just<00:05:37.680> saying<00:05:37.950> I<00:05:38.100> don't<00:05:38.160> know<00:05:38.340> if

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
connected just saying I don't know if

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.409 
connected just saying I don't know if
this<00:05:38.520> is<00:05:38.580> happening<00:05:38.700> but<00:05:39.000> sometimes<00:05:39.300> my

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
this is happening but sometimes my

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.990 
this is happening but sometimes my
screen<00:05:39.900> will<00:05:40.830> just<00:05:41.010> be<00:05:41.100> black<00:05:41.400> and<00:05:41.760> then<00:05:41.940> I

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
screen will just be black and then I

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000 
screen will just be black and then I
have<00:05:42.120> to<00:05:42.150> move<00:05:42.450> my<00:05:42.720> xbox<00:05:43.169> controller<00:05:43.590> like
