stuff<00:01:42.789> that<00:01:42.820> you<00:01:43.330> know<00:01:43.420> you<00:01:43.539> might<00:01:43.690> not

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
stuff that you know you might not

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.450 
stuff that you know you might not
necessarily<00:01:44.020> learn<00:01:44.590> that's<00:01:45.070> going<00:01:45.310> to<00:01:45.369> be

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
necessarily learn that's going to be

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.670 
necessarily learn that's going to be
really<00:01:45.729> really<00:01:46.030> helpful<00:01:46.270> later<00:01:46.780> on<00:01:47.020> i<00:01:47.289> mean

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
really really helpful later on i mean

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.010 
really really helpful later on i mean
i've<00:01:47.830> been<00:01:48.460> using<00:01:48.610> firefox<00:01:49.210> four<00:01:49.479> years<00:01:49.720> and

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
i've been using firefox four years and

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.960 
i've been using firefox four years and
using<00:01:50.530> all<00:01:50.590> sorts<00:01:50.649> of<00:01:50.920> open<00:01:51.369> source<00:01:51.490> projects

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
using all sorts of open source projects

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.960 
using all sorts of open source projects
when<00:01:52.090> I<00:01:52.149> do<00:01:52.210> my<00:01:52.420> developing<00:01:52.930> but<00:01:53.490> it's<00:01:54.490> it's

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
when I do my developing but it's it's

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.029 
when I do my developing but it's it's
not<00:01:55.149> exactly<00:01:55.570> clear<00:01:55.660> you<00:01:56.170> know<00:01:56.320> what<00:01:56.530> projects

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
not exactly clear you know what projects

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.680 
not exactly clear you know what projects
actually<00:01:57.399> need<00:01:57.580> help<00:01:57.820> with<00:01:58.000> and<00:01:58.210> how<00:01:58.390> you<00:01:58.450> can

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
actually need help with and how you can

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.779 
actually need help with and how you can
quickly<00:01:58.930> get<00:01:59.500> involved<00:01:59.950> and<00:02:00.100> start<00:02:00.700> making

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
quickly get involved and start making

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.669 
quickly get involved and start making
useful<00:02:01.060> contributions<00:02:01.780> so<00:02:02.050> I<00:02:02.200> sent<00:02:02.440> out<00:02:02.560> an

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
useful contributions so I sent out an

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:05.520 
useful contributions so I sent out an
email<00:02:02.830> to<00:02:03.009> the<00:02:03.670> cs<00:02:04.149> list<00:02:04.479> a<00:02:04.750> while<00:02:05.080> ago<00:02:05.110> and

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
email to the cs list a while ago and

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.570 
email to the cs list a while ago and
said<00:02:05.710> what<00:02:05.950> do<00:02:06.009> you<00:02:06.039> guys<00:02:06.130> think<00:02:06.190> of<00:02:06.429> this

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
said what do you guys think of this

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.340 
said what do you guys think of this
open-source<00:02:06.910> event<00:02:07.420> and<00:02:07.600> everybody<00:02:08.049> replot

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
open-source event and everybody replot

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.389 
open-source event and everybody replot
and<00:02:08.590> so<00:02:08.709> for<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:08.890> last<00:02:08.920> couple<00:02:09.130> of<00:02:09.250> quarters

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
and so for the last couple of quarters

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.100 
and so for the last couple of quarters
we've<00:02:09.729> been<00:02:09.850> planning<00:02:10.179> it<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:10.750> figuring<00:02:10.989> out

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
we've been planning it and figuring out

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.660 
we've been planning it and figuring out
how<00:02:11.200> we<00:02:11.260> could<00:02:11.380> do<00:02:11.530> it<00:02:11.650> in<00:02:11.769> and<00:02:12.130> Mozilla<00:02:12.640> has

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
how we could do it in and Mozilla has

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.940 
how we could do it in and Mozilla has
been<00:02:12.850> great<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.180> sent<00:02:13.690> like<00:02:13.840> 67<00:02:14.380> engineers<00:02:14.739> to

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
been great and sent like 67 engineers to

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.130 
been great and sent like 67 engineers to
come<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:15.489> do<00:02:15.730> really<00:02:16.090> cool<00:02:16.299> workshops<00:02:16.720> we

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
come and do really cool workshops we

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.570 
come and do really cool workshops we
demonstrated<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:18.070> vulnerable<00:02:18.400> web

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
demonstrated a vulnerable web

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.330 
demonstrated a vulnerable web
application<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:20.079> the<00:02:20.230> students<00:02:20.650> and<00:02:20.739> we

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
application to the students and we

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.830 
application to the students and we
taught<00:02:21.519> them<00:02:21.549> about<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:22.060> different<00:02:22.360> security

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
taught them about the different security

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.259 
taught them about the different security
issues<00:02:23.230> that<00:02:23.920> hands-on<00:02:24.430> experience<00:02:24.910> let<00:02:25.090> them

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
issues that hands-on experience let them

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:26.910 
issues that hands-on experience let them
actually<00:02:25.600> realize<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.530> know<00:02:26.620> how<00:02:26.769> an

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
actually realize you know how an

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.660 
actually realize you know how an
attacker<00:02:27.190> can<00:02:27.430> get<00:02:27.579> into<00:02:27.820> the<00:02:27.910> application

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
attacker can get into the application

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.040 
attacker can get into the application
and<00:02:28.970> later<00:02:29.420> when<00:02:29.569> they're<00:02:29.720> building

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
and later when they're building

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.720 
and later when they're building
applications<00:02:30.620> themselves<00:02:30.770> they<00:02:31.430> can<00:02:31.580> think

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
applications themselves they can think

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.160 
applications themselves they can think
back<00:02:31.910> to<00:02:32.120> these<00:02:32.209> experience<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:32.750> say<00:02:32.840> oh<00:02:32.900> well

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
back to these experience and say oh well

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.510 
back to these experience and say oh well
this<00:02:33.200> is<00:02:33.319> vulnerable<00:02:33.860> i<00:02:33.980> need<00:02:34.130> to<00:02:34.190> think<00:02:34.370> about

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
this is vulnerable i need to think about

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.309 
this is vulnerable i need to think about
how<00:02:34.640> this<00:02:34.910> is<00:02:35.000> happening<00:02:35.150> i<00:02:35.630> need<00:02:35.959> to<00:02:36.020> protect

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
how this is happening i need to protect

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.890 
how this is happening i need to protect
with<00:02:36.500> these<00:02:36.620> different<00:02:36.920> security<00:02:37.250> controls

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
with these different security controls

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.479 
with these different security controls
students<00:02:38.900> were<00:02:39.020> really<00:02:39.230> engaged<00:02:39.349> we<00:02:40.160> saw<00:02:40.340> them

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
students were really engaged we saw them

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.430 
students were really engaged we saw them
in<00:02:40.640> different<00:02:40.819> classrooms<00:02:41.510> like<00:02:41.989> you<00:02:42.319> know

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
in different classrooms like you know

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.100 
in different classrooms like you know
I'm<00:02:42.770> that<00:02:43.340> computers<00:02:43.790> hacking<00:02:44.300> we<00:02:44.810> try<00:02:45.050> to

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
I'm that computers hacking we try to

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.960 
I'm that computers hacking we try to
really<00:02:45.440> give<00:02:45.680> him<00:02:45.770> the<00:02:45.890> tools<00:02:46.100> before<00:02:46.370> him<00:02:46.700> so

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
really give him the tools before him so

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.670 
really give him the tools before him so
they<00:02:47.090> could<00:02:47.270> have<00:02:47.360> access<00:02:47.780> to<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.020> files<00:02:48.230> and

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
they could have access to the files and

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.979 
they could have access to the files and
really<00:02:49.190> get<00:02:49.310> prepared<00:02:49.670> so<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.450> 90<00:02:50.750> minutes

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
really get prepared so the 90 minutes

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.110 
really get prepared so the 90 minutes
are<00:02:51.140> dead<00:02:51.290> with<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.830> engineers<00:02:52.280> in<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.000> room

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
are dead with the engineers in the room

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.259 
are dead with the engineers in the room
we're<00:02:53.930> really<00:02:54.140> like<00:02:54.380> hands-on<00:02:54.860> labs<00:02:55.700> type<00:02:56.090> of

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
we're really like hands-on labs type of

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.650 
we're really like hands-on labs type of
work<00:02:56.540> running<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:57.050> workshop<00:02:58.150> without<00:02:59.150> having

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
work running a workshop without having

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.500 
work running a workshop without having
any<00:02:59.989> slides<00:03:00.500> in<00:03:00.860> advance<00:03:01.220> actually<00:03:01.640> worked

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
any slides in advance actually worked

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.759 
any slides in advance actually worked
really<00:03:02.690> well<00:03:02.810> because<00:03:03.170> we<00:03:03.410> could<00:03:03.590> work

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
really well because we could work

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.559 
really well because we could work
directly<00:03:04.310> hands-on<00:03:04.670> with<00:03:04.819> the<00:03:04.970> students<00:03:05.390> and

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
directly hands-on with the students and

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.390 
directly hands-on with the students and
get<00:03:06.019> them<00:03:06.050> working<00:03:06.530> with<00:03:06.799> directly<00:03:07.160> with<00:03:07.340> the

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
get them working with directly with the

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.400 
get them working with directly with the
code<00:03:07.549> some<00:03:08.510> of<00:03:08.569> the<00:03:08.660> best<00:03:08.810> feedback<00:03:09.019> that<00:03:09.380> I

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
code some of the best feedback that I

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.809 
code some of the best feedback that I
got<00:03:09.530> today<00:03:09.709> was<00:03:10.010> where<00:03:10.220> can<00:03:10.370> I<00:03:10.430> go<00:03:10.549> for<00:03:10.730> more

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
got today was where can I go for more

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.100 
got today was where can I go for more
information<00:03:11.330> so<00:03:11.569> that's<00:03:11.750> always<00:03:11.959> a

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
information so that's always a

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.750 
information so that's always a
indication<00:03:12.920> that<00:03:13.160> it<00:03:13.280> was<00:03:13.400> a<00:03:13.459> good

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
indication that it was a good

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.449 
indication that it was a good
presentation<00:03:14.209> I<00:03:14.600> hope<00:03:15.140> we<00:03:15.380> see<00:03:15.590> that<00:03:15.799> more<00:03:16.400> and
