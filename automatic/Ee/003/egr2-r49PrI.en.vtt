this<00:01:22.530> one<00:01:22.680> doesn't<00:01:22.860> work<00:01:23.070> 100%<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.270> time

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
this one doesn't work 100% of the time

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.810 
this one doesn't work 100% of the time
so<00:01:24.960> that's<00:01:25.110> why<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.290> decided<00:01:25.860> not<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.189> do<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
so that's why I decided not to do the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.190 
so that's why I decided not to do the
tutorial<00:01:27.210> on<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.390> one<00:01:27.540> but<00:01:27.689> sometimes<00:01:28.080> it

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
tutorial on this one but sometimes it

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.960 
tutorial on this one but sometimes it
does<00:01:28.320> see<00:01:28.530> sometimes<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.369> will<00:01:29.549> work<00:01:29.759> but

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
does see sometimes it will work but

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.609 
does see sometimes it will work but
other<00:01:30.180> times<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.720> won't<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.110> mean<00:01:31.409> it's<00:01:31.530> not

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
other times it won't I mean it's not

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.810 
other times it won't I mean it's not
going<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.829> kill<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.100> if<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.280> doesn't<00:01:32.549> work<00:01:32.670> I

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
going to kill you if it doesn't work I

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.069 
going to kill you if it doesn't work I
mean<00:01:32.970> if<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.240> fight<00:01:33.479> if<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.659> get<00:01:33.780> hit<00:01:33.930> by<00:01:33.960> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
mean if you fight if you get hit by the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.539 
mean if you fight if you get hit by the
glass<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.740> won't<00:01:34.950> kill<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.130> that's<00:01:35.369> why<00:01:35.460> I'm

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
glass it won't kill you that's why I'm

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.550 
glass it won't kill you that's why I'm
using<00:01:35.670> glass<00:01:36.150> here<00:01:36.509> too<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.049> don't<00:01:37.200> die

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
using glass here too so you don't die

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.469 
using glass here too so you don't die
but<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.400> will<00:01:38.610> show<00:01:38.759> how<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.880> build<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.210> one<00:01:39.390> at

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
but I will show how to build this one at

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.910 
but I will show how to build this one at
the<00:01:39.600> end<00:01:39.689> as<00:01:39.840> well<00:01:39.960> it's<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.409> pretty<00:01:40.530> much<00:01:40.740> a

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
the end as well it's just pretty much a

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.160 
the end as well it's just pretty much a
hook<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.579> one<00:01:41.790> over<00:01:41.820> here<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.930> for

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
hook on to this one over here so for

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.020 
hook on to this one over here so for
this<00:01:43.259> build<00:01:43.439> we're<00:01:43.530> going<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.710> need<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.100> five<00:01:44.549> by

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
this build we're going to need a five by

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.670 
this build we're going to need a five by
three<00:01:45.060> spacing<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.140> we're<00:01:46.259> also<00:01:46.409> going<00:01:46.619> to

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
three spacing and we're also going to

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.859 
three spacing and we're also going to
dig<00:01:47.040> down<00:01:47.220> at<00:01:47.460> least<00:01:47.729> two<00:01:48.180> now<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.750> course

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
dig down at least two now of course

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.300 
dig down at least two now of course
since<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.170> are<00:01:49.290> falling<00:01:49.500> through<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.979> floor

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
since you are falling through the floor

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.730 
since you are falling through the floor
you<00:01:50.790> can<00:01:51.030> do<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.390> on<00:01:51.570> flatland<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.500> can<00:01:52.649> do

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
you can do this on flatland you can do

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.350 
you can do this on flatland you can do
it<00:01:52.829> on<00:01:52.890> flatland<00:01:53.310> but<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.759> will<00:01:53.909> hit<00:01:54.119> bedrock

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
it on flatland but you will hit bedrock

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.999 
it on flatland but you will hit bedrock
but<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.439> still<00:01:55.710> works

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
but it still works

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.399 
but it still works
it<00:01:56.310> still<00:01:56.549> works<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:56.820> flat<00:01:57.030> lines<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.899> once<00:01:58.350> you

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
it still works on flat lines so once you

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.749 
it still works on flat lines so once you
got<00:01:58.530> your<00:01:58.590> five<00:01:58.770> by<00:01:58.920> three<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.280> dug<00:01:59.430> down<00:01:59.610> to

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
got your five by three you dug down to

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.069 
got your five by three you dug down to
you're<00:01:59.909> also<00:02:00.060> going<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.299> need<00:02:00.420> three<00:02:00.719> sticky

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
you're also going to need three sticky

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.109 
you're also going to need three sticky
pistons<00:02:01.469> four<00:02:02.189> pressure<00:02:02.430> plates<00:02:02.759> don't<00:02:03.030> know

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
pistons four pressure plates don't know

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.490 
pistons four pressure plates don't know
why<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.240> have<00:02:03.360> two<00:02:03.600> we're<00:02:03.750> going<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.020> need<00:02:04.170> four

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
why I have two we're going to need four

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.859 
why I have two we're going to need four
I<00:02:04.710> recommend<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.729> stone<00:02:06.000> ones<00:02:06.270> just<00:02:06.570> because

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
I recommend the stone ones just because

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.389 
I recommend the stone ones just because
you<00:02:06.990> can't<00:02:07.200> throw<00:02:07.380> items<00:02:07.680> on<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.099> activate

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
you can't throw items on it and activate

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.340 
you can't throw items on it and activate
it<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:09.000> that's<00:02:09.209> why<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.360> recommend<00:02:09.509> that

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
it so that's why I recommend that

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.430 
it so that's why I recommend that
two<00:02:11.280> pieces<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.700> glass<00:02:11.880> one<00:02:12.660> half<00:02:12.870> slab<00:02:13.170> or

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
two pieces of glass one half slab or

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.770 
two pieces of glass one half slab or
staircase<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.130> really<00:02:14.310> doesn't<00:02:14.610> matter<00:02:14.780> one

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
staircase it really doesn't matter one

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.840 
staircase it really doesn't matter one

of choice and then of course I have my

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.990 
of choice and then of course I have my
red<00:02:22.110> wool<00:02:22.290> for<00:02:22.440> my<00:02:22.560> input<00:02:22.740> block<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:23.430> my<00:02:23.730> green

red wool for my input block and my green
mole<00:02:24.210> is<00:02:24.390> just<00:02:24.690> for<00:02:24.810> extra<00:02:25.230> stuff<00:02:25.530> along<00:02:26.100> the

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
mole is just for extra stuff along the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.160 
mole is just for extra stuff along the
way<00:02:26.280> let's<00:02:26.520> get<00:02:26.640> my<00:02:26.700> red<00:02:26.880> one<00:02:27.000> out<00:02:27.120> actually<00:02:27.330> so

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
way let's get my red one out actually so

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.540 
way let's get my red one out actually so
once<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:28.380> got<00:02:28.440> your<00:02:28.560> five<00:02:28.770> by<00:02:28.950> three<00:02:28.980> spacing

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
once you got your five by three spacing

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
once you got your five by three spacing
down<00:02:29.640> we're<00:02:29.790> going<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:29.970> pretty<00:02:30.120> much<00:02:30.180> go<00:02:30.390> all

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
down we're going to pretty much go all

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.970 
down we're going to pretty much go all
the<00:02:30.660> way<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.960> end<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.620> middle

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
the way to the end and to the middle

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.320 
the way to the end and to the middle
part<00:02:32.190> of<00:02:32.280> your<00:02:32.340> five<00:02:32.610> by<00:02:32.760> three<00:02:32.790> all<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.210> way

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
part of your five by three all the way

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.820 
part of your five by three all the way
over<00:02:33.450> here<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:34.290> we're<00:02:34.380> pretty<00:02:34.470> much<00:02:34.560> going<00:02:34.770> to

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
over here and we're pretty much going to

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.740 
over here and we're pretty much going to
come<00:02:34.950> up<00:02:35.100> four<00:02:35.490> blocks<00:02:35.850> from<00:02:36.000> here<00:02:36.300> so<00:02:36.450> let's

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
come up four blocks from here so let's

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.890 
come up four blocks from here so let's
just<00:02:36.900> use<00:02:36.990> my<00:02:37.110> red<00:02:37.260> one<00:02:37.380> here<00:02:37.500> so<00:02:37.680> one<00:02:37.920> two<00:02:38.900> two

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
just use my red one here so one two two

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.380 
just use my red one here so one two two

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
going to delete this one and put a half

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.330 
going to delete this one and put a half
slab<00:02:45.420> upside<00:02:46.080> down<00:02:46.260> like<00:02:46.860> that

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
slab upside down like that

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.530 
slab upside down like that
and<00:02:47.580> then<00:02:47.820> we're<00:02:47.910> gonna<00:02:48.030> delete<00:02:48.300> these<00:02:48.480> two

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
and then we're gonna delete these two

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.050 
and then we're gonna delete these two
and<00:02:49.080> put<00:02:49.110> glass<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.310> pretty<00:02:50.520> much<00:02:50.580> just<00:02:50.670> did

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
and put glass I pretty much just did

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.460 
and put glass I pretty much just did
that<00:02:51.180> just<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.540> show<00:02:51.600> you<00:02:51.750> where<00:02:52.020> you<00:02:52.170> have<00:02:52.200> to

put the stuff so there you go it should
look<00:02:54.210> something<00:02:54.510> like<00:02:54.540> this<00:02:54.780> right<00:02:54.960> now<00:02:55.640> next

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
look something like this right now next

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.800 
look something like this right now next
we're<00:02:56.790> going<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:56.940> do<00:02:57.030> is<00:02:57.120> come<00:02:57.270> three<00:02:57.570> blocks

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
we're going to do is come three blocks

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.570 
we're going to do is come three blocks
out<00:02:58.020> from<00:02:58.380> our<00:02:58.530> hat<00:02:58.740> upside<00:02:59.070> down<00:02:59.160> half<00:02:59.340> slab

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
out from our hat upside down half slab

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.360 
out from our hat upside down half slab
so<00:02:59.760> one<00:02:59.940> two<00:03:00.720> three<00:03:00.860> delete<00:03:01.860> these<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.100> we're

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
so one two three delete these and we're

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.980 
so one two three delete these and we're
gonna<00:03:02.430> put<00:03:02.670> sticky<00:03:02.940> pistons<00:03:03.360> facing<00:03:03.510> our<00:03:03.810> half

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
gonna put sticky pistons facing our half

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.040 
gonna put sticky pistons facing our half
slab<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.470> our<00:03:04.920> glass<00:03:05.220> so<00:03:05.520> one<00:03:05.730> two<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:06.660> three

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
slab and our glass so one two and three

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.550 
slab and our glass so one two and three
like<00:03:07.470> that<00:03:08.600> next<00:03:09.600> we're<00:03:09.720> gonna<00:03:09.810> put<00:03:09.930> our<00:03:10.200> input

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
like that next we're gonna put our input

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.780 
like that next we're gonna put our input
block<00:03:10.710> right<00:03:10.860> here<00:03:10.920> this<00:03:11.190> is<00:03:11.250> our<00:03:11.490> input<00:03:11.580> block

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
block right here this is our input block

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.670 
block right here this is our input block
this<00:03:12.000> makes<00:03:12.210> everything<00:03:12.720> work<00:03:13.080> and<00:03:13.530> then

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
this makes everything work and then

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.290 
this makes everything work and then
we're<00:03:13.770> gonna<00:03:13.860> put<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.070> torch<00:03:14.400> on<00:03:14.550> top<00:03:14.760> of<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:15.060> and

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
we're gonna put a torch on top of it and

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.660 
we're gonna put a torch on top of it and
then<00:03:15.930> a<00:03:15.990> block<00:03:16.260> on<00:03:16.470> top<00:03:16.680> of<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:16.860> torch<00:03:17.130> let<00:03:17.580> me

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
then a block on top of the torch let me

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.770 
then a block on top of the torch let me
get<00:03:17.760> out<00:03:17.850> my<00:03:17.880> green<00:03:18.180> actually<00:03:18.480> we<00:03:18.540> don't<00:03:18.690> need

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
get out my green actually we don't need

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.250 
get out my green actually we don't need
this<00:03:18.900> one<00:03:19.080> anymore<00:03:19.580> like<00:03:20.580> that<00:03:20.820> so<00:03:21.480> now<00:03:21.630> he

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
this one anymore like that so now he

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.690 
this one anymore like that so now he
sent<00:03:22.470> me<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.590> picture<00:03:22.800> of<00:03:22.920> his<00:03:23.160> his<00:03:23.340> worked<00:03:23.550> with

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
sent me a picture of his his worked with

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.310 
sent me a picture of his his worked with
a<00:03:23.730> button<00:03:24.090> I'm<00:03:24.180> using<00:03:24.360> a<00:03:24.600> pressure<00:03:25.050> place

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
a button I'm using a pressure place

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.450 
a button I'm using a pressure place
because<00:03:25.530> I<00:03:25.590> don't<00:03:25.740> know<00:03:25.800> why<00:03:25.890> I<00:03:25.920> just<00:03:26.160> think<00:03:26.370> it

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
because I don't know why I just think it

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.920 
because I don't know why I just think it
works<00:03:26.640> better<00:03:26.820> with<00:03:27.030> pressure<00:03:27.210> plates<00:03:27.450> but

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
works better with pressure plates but

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.960 
works better with pressure plates but
this<00:03:28.110> is<00:03:28.230> it<00:03:28.380> this<00:03:28.680> is<00:03:28.740> the<00:03:28.860> whole<00:03:28.980> thing<00:03:29.010> this

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
this is it this is the whole thing this

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.060 
this is it this is the whole thing this
is<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.270> inception<00:03:30.570> door<00:03:30.870> that<00:03:31.260> is<00:03:31.440> it<00:03:31.620> so<00:03:32.040> I

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
is the inception door that is it so I

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.430 
is the inception door that is it so I
put<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.310> button<00:03:32.550> right<00:03:32.700> here<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:32.850> click<00:03:33.090> it

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
put a button right here and click it

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.910 
put a button right here and click it
there<00:03:34.440> you<00:03:34.530> go

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
there you go

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.090 
there you go
that's<00:03:35.370> how<00:03:35.610> small<00:03:35.940> this<00:03:36.150> thing<00:03:36.390> is<00:03:36.570> it's<00:03:37.320> it's

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
that's how small this thing is it's it's

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.830 
that's how small this thing is it's it's
incredibly<00:03:39.030> small<00:03:39.360> it<00:03:39.510> might<00:03:39.630> be<00:03:39.750> the

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
incredibly small it might be the

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.120 
incredibly small it might be the
smallest<00:03:40.140> inception<00:03:40.710> door<00:03:40.860> ever

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
smallest inception door ever

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.920 
smallest inception door ever
he<00:03:41.490> showed<00:03:41.730> me<00:03:41.850> one<00:03:42.000> that<00:03:42.150> was<00:03:42.270> about<00:03:42.540> three

he showed me one that was about three

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.750 
he showed me one that was about three
blocks<00:03:43.080> out<00:03:43.380> but<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:43.680> was<00:03:43.770> still<00:03:43.800> super<00:03:44.340> small

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
blocks out but it was still super small

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.350 
blocks out but it was still super small
guys<00:03:45.030> but<00:03:45.330> this<00:03:45.480> one<00:03:45.660> is<00:03:45.840> extremely<00:03:46.560> small<00:03:47.430> but

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
matter so now if I go like this if I hit

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.100 
matter so now if I go like this if I hit
the<00:04:44.310> pressure<00:04:44.490> plate<00:04:44.760> stand<00:04:45.420> inside<00:04:45.720> fall

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
the pressure plate stand inside fall

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.080 
the pressure plate stand inside fall
through<00:04:46.380> and<00:04:46.590> there<00:04:46.770> you<00:04:46.830> go<00:04:46.920> eggs<00:04:47.070> go<00:04:47.280> super

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
through and there you go eggs go super

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.390 
through and there you go eggs go super
super<00:04:48.300> small<00:04:48.720> inception<00:04:49.380> door<00:04:49.560> that<00:04:49.980> easy<00:04:50.220> to

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
super small inception door that easy to

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.620 
super small inception door that easy to
build<00:04:50.520> and<00:04:50.700> of<00:04:50.790> course<00:04:51.000> you<00:04:51.120> don't<00:04:51.360> need<00:04:51.510> the

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
build and of course you don't need the

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.360 
build and of course you don't need the
green<00:04:51.840> wool<00:04:52.020> I<00:04:52.170> probably<00:04:52.740> recommend<00:04:53.010> putting

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
green wool I probably recommend putting

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.740 
green wool I probably recommend putting
blocks<00:04:53.550> of<00:04:53.760> choice<00:04:53.910> there<00:04:54.090> so<00:04:54.210> you<00:04:54.300> can't<00:04:54.510> see

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
blocks of choice there so you can't see

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.500 
blocks of choice there so you can't see
well<00:04:55.320> that<00:04:55.350> when<00:04:55.890> you<00:04:55.980> fall<00:04:56.250> through<00:04:56.520> it<00:04:57.300> kind

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
well that when you fall through it kind

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.330 
well that when you fall through it kind
of<00:04:57.660> looks<00:04:57.840> ugly<00:04:58.170> there<00:04:58.470> but<00:04:58.980> I<00:04:59.010> mean<00:04:59.070> you're

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
of looks ugly there but I mean you're

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.620 
of looks ugly there but I mean you're
the<00:04:59.460> only<00:04:59.490> one<00:04:59.760> who'll<00:04:59.910> know<00:05:00.090> about<00:05:00.450> this

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
the only one who'll know about this

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.360

little inception door so now let's just

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.100 
little inception door so now let's just
do<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:02.730> other<00:05:02.760> side<00:05:03.150> as<00:05:03.330> well<00:05:03.360> just<00:05:03.900> to<00:05:03.990> show

sticky<00:05:18.150> pistons<00:05:18.510> facing<00:05:18.660> upwards<00:05:19.170> like<00:05:19.410> that

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
sticky pistons facing upwards like that

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.950 
sticky pistons facing upwards like that
and<00:05:20.250> then<00:05:20.940> next<00:05:21.090> we're<00:05:21.300> going<00:05:21.420> to<00:05:21.510> take<00:05:21.750> out

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
and then next we're going to take out

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.360 
and then next we're going to take out
well<00:05:22.200> we<00:05:22.560> don't<00:05:22.740> really<00:05:22.830> need<00:05:22.980> our<00:05:23.130> input

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
well we don't really need our input

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.790 
well we don't really need our input
blocks<00:05:23.580> since<00:05:23.820> we<00:05:24.360> have<00:05:24.480> two<00:05:24.660> of<00:05:24.840> them<00:05:24.930> now<00:05:24.990> so

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
blocks since we have two of them now so

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.050 
blocks since we have two of them now so
we're<00:05:25.920> just<00:05:25.950> gonna<00:05:26.130> put<00:05:26.340> that<00:05:26.370> there<00:05:26.520> torch

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
we're just gonna put that there torch

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.180 
we're just gonna put that there torch
there<00:05:27.300> torch<00:05:27.690> on<00:05:27.840> top<00:05:28.140> a<00:05:28.380> block<00:05:28.650> on<00:05:28.830> top<00:05:28.950> of<00:05:29.100> the

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
there torch on top a block on top of the

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.280 
there torch on top a block on top of the
torch<00:05:29.460> then<00:05:30.360> we're<00:05:30.480> to<00:05:30.540> come<00:05:30.660> out<00:05:30.780> one<00:05:31.050> more

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
torch then we're to come out one more

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.740 
torch then we're to come out one more
putting<00:05:31.620> our<00:05:32.060> pressure<00:05:33.060> plates<00:05:33.390> here<00:05:33.540> now<00:05:33.690> the

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
putting our pressure plates here now the

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.480 
putting our pressure plates here now the
reason<00:05:34.140> why<00:05:34.260> I'm<00:05:34.380> showing<00:05:34.410> you<00:05:34.890> is<00:05:35.130> because

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
reason why I'm showing you is because

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.770 
reason why I'm showing you is because
the<00:05:35.670> pressure<00:05:35.850> plates<00:05:36.210> are<00:05:36.330> going<00:05:36.450> to<00:05:36.510> work<00:05:36.690> a

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
the pressure plates are going to work a

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.510 
the pressure plates are going to work a
little<00:05:36.990> bit<00:05:37.200> different<00:05:37.590> in<00:05:37.650> this<00:05:37.770> one<00:05:38.010> this

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
little bit different in this one this

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.160 
little bit different in this one this
one<00:05:38.760> you<00:05:38.910> can<00:05:39.030> only<00:05:39.150> go<00:05:39.360> out<00:05:39.390> one<00:05:39.900> way<00:05:40.110> you

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
one you can only go out one way you

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.350 
one you can only go out one way you
can't<00:05:40.500> go<00:05:40.620> out<00:05:40.740> everywhere<00:05:41.400> like<00:05:41.670> the<00:05:41.910> smaller

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
can't go out everywhere like the smaller

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.290 
can't go out everywhere like the smaller
one<00:05:42.570> and<00:05:42.780> I'll<00:05:43.380> show<00:05:43.530> you<00:05:43.590> why<00:05:44.000> so<00:05:45.000> next<00:05:45.150> what

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
one and I'll show you why so next what

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.400 
one and I'll show you why so next what
we're<00:05:45.390> gonna<00:05:45.480> do<00:05:45.570> is<00:05:45.660> come<00:05:45.810> down<00:05:45.840> one<00:05:46.230> block

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
we're gonna do is come down one block

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.490 
we're gonna do is come down one block
and<00:05:47.090> this<00:05:48.090> would<00:05:48.270> probably<00:05:48.540> be<00:05:48.840> easier<00:05:49.380> if<00:05:49.440> I

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
and this would probably be easier if I

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.660 
and this would probably be easier if I
had<00:05:49.530> the<00:05:49.740> white<00:05:49.920> wool<00:05:50.100> there<00:05:50.250> but<00:05:50.400> you<00:05:50.550> know

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:50.670 
had the white wool there but you know

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.760 
had the white wool there but you know
whatever<00:05:51.060> we're<00:05:51.990> gonna<00:05:52.110> come<00:05:52.290> down<00:05:52.440> on<00:05:52.590> one

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
whatever we're gonna come down on one

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.380 
whatever we're gonna come down on one
block<00:05:52.950> on<00:05:53.130> both<00:05:53.280> sides<00:05:53.550> where<00:05:53.760> our<00:05:53.910> pressure

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
block on both sides where our pressure

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.360 
block on both sides where our pressure
plates<00:05:54.690> are<00:05:54.900> and<00:05:55.470> then<00:05:56.040> we're<00:05:56.130> gonna<00:05:56.220> come

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
plates are and then we're gonna come

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.360 
plates are and then we're gonna come
down<00:05:56.550> one<00:05:56.790> more<00:05:57.620> and<00:05:58.620> we're<00:05:58.740> gonna<00:05:58.860> swing<00:05:59.220> them

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
down one more and we're gonna swing them

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.650 
down one more and we're gonna swing them
together<00:05:59.490> like<00:05:59.790> that<00:05:59.820> and<00:06:00.180> we're<00:06:00.270> gonna<00:06:00.360> put

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
together like that and we're gonna put

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.500 
together like that and we're gonna put
dust<00:06:01.080> along<00:06:01.260> all<00:06:01.560> these<00:06:01.710> blocks<00:06:02.270> and<00:06:03.270> then

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
dust along all these blocks and then

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.370 
dust along all these blocks and then
right<00:06:03.660> in<00:06:03.750> the<00:06:03.810> middle<00:06:03.960> we're<00:06:04.080> gonna<00:06:04.230> come<00:06:04.350> out

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
right in the middle we're gonna come out

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.980 
right in the middle we're gonna come out
one<00:06:04.590> more<00:06:04.860> putting<00:06:05.130> a<00:06:05.220> repeater<00:06:05.610> here<00:06:05.940> on<00:06:06.330> one

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
one more putting a repeater here on one

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.930 
one more putting a repeater here on one
take<00:06:07.200> the<00:06:07.320> leg<00:06:07.500> put<00:06:07.980> a<00:06:08.010> block<00:06:08.340> in<00:06:08.370> front<00:06:08.760> of<00:06:08.850> it

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
take the leg put a block in front of it

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.580 
take the leg put a block in front of it
with<00:06:09.300> us<00:06:09.480> like<00:06:09.690> I<00:06:09.750> said<00:06:09.930> it's<00:06:10.050> the<00:06:10.110> same<00:06:10.350> thing

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
with us like I said it's the same thing

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.890 
with us like I said it's the same thing
on<00:06:10.740> both<00:06:10.980> sides<00:06:11.370> now<00:06:12.120> this<00:06:12.270> is<00:06:12.390> why<00:06:12.510> I<00:06:12.540> said<00:06:12.690> you

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
on both sides now this is why I said you

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.360 
on both sides now this is why I said you
can't<00:06:13.170> do<00:06:13.320> it<00:06:13.410> on<00:06:13.500> both<00:06:13.680> sides<00:06:13.950> it's<00:06:14.160> because

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
can't do it on both sides it's because

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.530 
can't do it on both sides it's because
you<00:06:14.430> got<00:06:14.550> to<00:06:14.640> do<00:06:14.730> this<00:06:14.850> on<00:06:15.060> this<00:06:15.150> side<00:06:15.210> you<00:06:15.480> have

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540 
you got to do this on this side you have

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.140 
you got to do this on this side you have
to<00:06:15.660> go<00:06:15.780> like<00:06:15.960> this<00:06:16.460> doo<00:06:17.460> doo<00:06:17.700> doo<00:06:17.940> doo<00:06:18.120> and

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
to go like this doo doo doo doo and

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.760 
to go like this doo doo doo doo and
connect<00:06:18.600> these<00:06:18.720> two<00:06:18.930> together<00:06:19.050> because<00:06:19.650> you

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
connect these two together because you

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.230 
connect these two together because you
want<00:06:19.950> the<00:06:20.040> doors<00:06:20.280> to<00:06:20.430> open<00:06:20.640> up<00:06:20.730> at<00:06:20.820> the<00:06:20.940> same

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
want the doors to open up at the same

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.090 
want the doors to open up at the same
time<00:06:21.270> and<00:06:21.870> the<00:06:22.200> reason<00:06:22.440> why<00:06:22.530> I<00:06:22.560> do<00:06:22.680> it<00:06:22.800> all<00:06:23.010> the

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100 
time and the reason why I do it all the

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.590 
time and the reason why I do it all the
way<00:06:23.160> over<00:06:23.250> here<00:06:23.490> is<00:06:23.610> because<00:06:23.760> when<00:06:24.030> we<00:06:24.120> put<00:06:24.360> our

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 
way over here is because when we put our

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.140 
way over here is because when we put our
walling<00:06:25.590> in<00:06:25.710> and<00:06:25.860> stuff<00:06:26.100> like<00:06:26.220> that<00:06:26.490> and<00:06:27.030> our

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
walling in and stuff like that and our

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.150 
walling in and stuff like that and our
flooring<00:06:27.570> it<00:06:28.170> uh<00:06:28.350> disconnects<00:06:28.950> it<00:06:29.040> right

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 
flooring it uh disconnects it right

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.860 
flooring it uh disconnects it right
there<00:06:29.340> so<00:06:29.730> they

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
there so they

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.210 
there so they
is<00:06:29.990> our<00:06:30.110> floor<00:06:30.350> right<00:06:30.500> here<00:06:31.600> this<00:06:32.600> is<00:06:32.750> our<00:06:32.870> wall

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:33.220 
is our floor right here this is our wall

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.690 
is our floor right here this is our wall
like<00:06:34.220> that

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.700 
like that

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.670 
like that
and<00:06:35.330> then<00:06:35.780> this<00:06:35.870> side<00:06:36.080> you<00:06:36.200> can<00:06:36.320> leave<00:06:36.440> it<00:06:36.560> like

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
and then this side you can leave it like

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.200 
and then this side you can leave it like
this<00:06:36.830> because<00:06:37.010> you<00:06:37.430> only<00:06:37.550> need<00:06:37.760> one<00:06:37.970> side

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210 
this because you only need one side

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.550 
this because you only need one side
doing<00:06:38.510> that<00:06:39.610> so<00:06:40.610> there<00:06:40.760> we<00:06:40.850> go<00:06:41.140> so<00:06:42.140> now<00:06:42.170> if<00:06:42.380> I<00:06:42.440> go

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 
doing that so there we go so now if I go
