 on Friday , July 13 from 8 in the morning 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.800
 At 2 and 30 in the afternoon, the 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.690
 induction process to students 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.750
 new this day counted on the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.640
 participation of about 540 young people 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.070
 those who were explained the services and 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.810
 benefits offered by the institution 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.790
 They also had a tour of 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.590
 the entire campus that allowed to clear 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.870
 some doubts and have a first 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.010
 approach to university life I 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.630
 it seems that every life is a university 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.760
 excellent and one of the best 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.730
 universities in the country comes from many 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.140
 academic opportunities it seems to me that 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.579
 communication is a very career 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.250
 cool because it has a very wide field 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.980
 has from the radio since journalism 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.350
 until the good multimedia part during 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.100
 the academic time I want to achieve as 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.129
 goals 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.199
 yesterday then exchanges with other 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.750
 universities abroad make a 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.239
 good practice to have obviously the 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.199
 possibility of being in seedbeds of 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.729
 investigation 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.799
 I want to be professional 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.560
 specialize in the area of ​​structures 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:14.280
 leave the country acquire 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.750
 experiences working abroad and 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.280
 work directly with companies 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.570
 of the country and with the 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.610
 university continue to work with the 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.080
 university also the students of 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.299
 other parts of the country or the so-called 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.460
 outsiders received information about 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.929
 of procedures and services of the 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.330
 institution and on the routes of 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:33.810
 transportation to get to campus between 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.810
 others 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.850
 the induction seemed very good to me 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.640
 which is very necessary because one always 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.310
 comes in as the first value is that all 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.740
 you know and this induction formula 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.900
 basically it helps one to recognize 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.540
 your space recognize your hour classes 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:55.440
 to feel like around the people of 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.360
 afip feel more part of the world of 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.490
 evidence therefore this type of processes 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.530
 as the induction provide tools 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.720
 fundamentals that increase trust 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.880
 and the interest of new students for 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.210
 the challenges they will face in their soul 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.210
