why did I save this map or this match I

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.860 
why did I save this map or this match I
didn't<00:00:10.889> do<00:00:11.219> particularly<00:00:11.849> well<00:00:12.120> but<00:00:12.389> then

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
didn't do particularly well but then

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.120 
didn't do particularly well but then

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.740 
when I reviewed it I said hey there's a
pretty<00:00:14.400> decent<00:00:14.880> lesson<00:00:15.210> that<00:00:15.360> can<00:00:15.480> be<00:00:15.570> learned

from this it's a really quick tip a lot

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.740 
from this it's a really quick tip a lot
of<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.609> guys<00:00:17.640> probably<00:00:17.910> already<00:00:18.150> know<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.690> and

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
of you guys probably already know it and

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.800 
of you guys probably already know it and
that's<00:00:18.840> fine<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.439> understand<00:00:20.369> but<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.090> do<00:00:21.480> feel

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
that's fine I understand but I do feel

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.929 
that's fine I understand but I do feel
what<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.320> amount<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.560> people<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.100> do<00:00:23.189> not

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
what the amount of people that I do not

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.720 
what the amount of people that I do not
seek<00:00:24.480> or<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.289> i<00:00:25.320> do<00:00:25.410> not<00:00:25.650> see<00:00:25.949> using<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.490> tip

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
seek or that i do not see using this tip

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.849 
seek or that i do not see using this tip
I<00:00:26.849> figure<00:00:27.119> hey<00:00:27.269> maybe<00:00:28.140> it'd<00:00:28.320> be<00:00:28.439> worth<00:00:28.590> putting

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
I figure hey maybe it'd be worth putting

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.830 
I figure hey maybe it'd be worth putting
out<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.099> video<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.939> that's<00:00:30.480> basically

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
out a video for and that's basically

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.240 
out a video for and that's basically
when<00:00:31.260> you're<00:00:31.380> playing<00:00:31.590> rust<00:00:31.859> offense

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
when you're playing rust offense

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.639 
when you're playing rust offense

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
especially it's too well first of all

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.170 
especially it's too well first of all
never<00:00:34.950> give<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.550> match<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.880> over<00:00:36.000> I

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
never give in to the match is over I

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.850 
never give in to the match is over I
know<00:00:36.300> it's<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.690> cliche<00:00:37.050> statement<00:00:37.590> but<00:00:37.710> it's

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
know it's a cliche statement but it's

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.590

em calm so quick that we couldn't even
get<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.660> position<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.199> put<00:00:58.350> up<00:00:58.440> an

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
get in the position and put up an

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.139 
get in the position and put up an
effective<00:00:58.949> strategy<00:00:59.010> before<00:00:59.579> they<00:00:59.879> already

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
effective strategy before they already

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.840 
effective strategy before they already
pushed<00:01:00.480> quite<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> bit<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.079> ground<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.530> us<00:01:01.850> but

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
pushed quite a bit of ground on us but

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.479 
pushed quite a bit of ground on us but
my<00:01:02.969> basic<00:01:03.390> tip<00:01:03.600> here<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.189> especially<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.280> rush

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
my basic tip here is especially in rush

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.820 
my basic tip here is especially in rush
but<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.299> course<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.780> map<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.200> situation

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
but of course it is map in situation

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.260 
but of course it is map in situation
dependent<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.400> course<00:01:08.670> I'm<00:01:08.850> not<00:01:09.030> going<00:01:09.210> to

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
dependent of course I'm not going to

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.450 
dependent of course I'm not going to
push<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.630> sort<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.320> strategy<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.189> as<00:01:11.400> a

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
push this sort of strategy on you as a

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.250 
push this sort of strategy on you as a
blanket<00:01:12.210> statement<00:01:12.240> for<00:01:12.720> every<00:01:12.930> conceivable

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
blanket statement for every conceivable

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.679 
blanket statement for every conceivable
angle<00:01:13.590> because<00:01:13.979> it's<00:01:14.130> just<00:01:14.310> not<00:01:14.490> plausible

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
angle because it's just not plausible

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.390 
angle because it's just not plausible
but<00:01:15.689> when<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:15.960> look<00:01:16.170> at<00:01:16.320> how<00:01:16.619> things<00:01:17.070> break

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
but when you look at how things break

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.670 
but when you look at how things break
down<00:01:17.430> for<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.000> most<00:01:18.180> part<00:01:18.390> what<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.350> want<00:01:19.590> to

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
down for the most part what you want to

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.399 
down for the most part what you want to
do<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.799> lot<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.189> time<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.640> keep<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:22.080> enemy

center here where I'm looking is the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.050 
center here where I'm looking is the
right<00:01:28.200> side<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.770> behind<00:01:29.310> me<00:01:29.610> toward<00:01:29.880> that

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
right side and behind me toward that

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.670

tower<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.720> left<00:01:30.930> side<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.259> what<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.500> want

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
tower is the left side and what you want

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.170 
tower is the left side and what you want
to<00:01:31.770> do<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.009> keep<00:01:32.189> them<00:01:32.400> out<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.820> middle<00:01:33.060> if

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
to do is keep them out of the middle if

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.840 
to do is keep them out of the middle if
they're<00:01:33.720> able<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.020> push<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.470> middle<00:01:34.850> then

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
they're able to push the middle then

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.700 
they're able to push the middle then
they're<00:01:36.000> able<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.360> keep<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.840> isolated<00:01:37.049> and

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
they're able to keep you isolated and

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.980 
they're able to keep you isolated and
it's<00:01:38.130> well<00:01:38.759> let's<00:01:38.970> simple<00:01:39.540> logic<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
it's well let's simple logic the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.100 
it's well let's simple logic the
quickest<00:01:40.409> way<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.680> any<00:01:41.430> point<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.240> any<00:01:42.869> map

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
quickest way to any point on any map

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.560 
quickest way to any point on any map
anywhere<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.860> straight<00:01:44.250> line<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.729> usually

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
anywhere is a straight line and usually

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.850 
anywhere is a straight line and usually
since<00:01:45.810> where<00:01:46.409> they're<00:01:46.560> going<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.770> be

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
since where they're going to be

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.649 
since where they're going to be
attacking<00:01:47.159> from<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.490> M<00:01:47.790> comes<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.299> straight

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
attacking from the M comes is a straight

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.749 
attacking from the M comes is a straight
line<00:01:48.869> forcing<00:01:49.649> them<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.220> left<00:01:50.430> or<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.640> the

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
line forcing them to the left or to the

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.370 
line forcing them to the left or to the
right<00:01:50.850> usually<00:01:51.299> will<00:01:51.630> just<00:01:51.840> buy<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.049> more

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
right usually will just buy you more

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.289 
right usually will just buy you more
time<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.040> you're<00:01:53.189> able<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.579> push<00:01:53.790> up<00:01:54.000> further

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
time and you're able to push up further

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.109 
time and you're able to push up further
based<00:01:55.049> on<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:56.219> as<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.490> can<00:01:56.610> see<00:01:56.790> most<00:01:57.000> of

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
based on that so as you can see most of

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.999 
based on that so as you can see most of
my<00:01:57.240> teammates<00:01:57.570> are<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.020> left<00:01:58.290> side<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.890> if

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
my teammates are on that left side so if

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.530 
my teammates are on that left side so if
I'm<00:01:59.159> able<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.520> make<00:01:59.700> an<00:01:59.850> effort<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.180> keep<00:02:00.329> them

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
I'm able to make an effort to keep them

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.760 
I'm able to make an effort to keep them
out<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.869> middle<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.200> pushed<00:02:01.409> them<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.680> the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
out of the middle and pushed them to the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.620 
out of the middle and pushed them to the
left<00:02:01.950> it's<00:02:02.399> really<00:02:02.820> going<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.149> slow<00:02:03.390> them<00:02:03.600> down

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
left it's really going to slow them down

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.039 
left it's really going to slow them down
it<00:02:04.409> might<00:02:04.649> even<00:02:04.680> be<00:02:04.950> able<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.600> push<00:02:06.600> them<00:02:06.840> back

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
it might even be able to push them back

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.839 
it might even be able to push them back
further<00:02:07.409> because<00:02:07.979> Russia<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.399> basically<00:02:08.819> a

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
further because Russia is basically a

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.760 
further because Russia is basically a
battle<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.270> positioning<00:02:09.869> let's<00:02:10.319> be<00:02:10.470> honest

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
battle of positioning let's be honest

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.490 
battle of positioning let's be honest
here<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.009> really<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.430> if<00:02:11.640> you're<00:02:12.270> able<00:02:12.420> to

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
here it really is if you're able to

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.440 
here it really is if you're able to
as<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:14.070> walk<00:02:14.310> into<00:02:14.490> bullets<00:02:14.850> I<00:02:15.120> should<00:02:15.360> have

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
as I walk into bullets I should have

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.090 
as I walk into bullets I should have
checked<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:15.780> corner<00:02:16.140> before<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.440> ran<00:02:16.680> out<00:02:16.860> but

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
checked that corner before I ran out but

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.600 
checked that corner before I ran out but
if<00:02:17.280> you're<00:02:18.000> able<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.920> control<00:02:19.920> positioning

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
if you're able to control positioning

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.340 
if you're able to control positioning
you<00:02:20.880> will<00:02:21.090> win<00:02:21.300> rush<00:02:21.540> matches<00:02:21.990> almost<00:02:22.140> a

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
you will win rush matches almost a

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.540 
you will win rush matches almost a
hundred<00:02:22.470> percent<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:22.980> time<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.490> know

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
hundred percent of the time and I know

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.730 
hundred percent of the time and I know
there's<00:02:23.880> lots<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.150> factors<00:02:24.510> at<00:02:24.660> play<00:02:24.740> there's

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
there's lots of factors at play there's

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.320 
there's lots of factors at play there's
horrible<00:02:26.040> team<00:02:26.340> balance<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:26.880> rushed<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.180> lot

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
horrible team balance and rushed a lot

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.580 
horrible team balance and rushed a lot
of<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.510> time<00:02:27.690> there's<00:02:27.930> nothing<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.320> can<00:02:28.470> do

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
of the time there's nothing you can do

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.170 
of the time there's nothing you can do
about<00:02:28.710> it<00:02:28.890> but<00:02:29.130> if<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.250> employ<00:02:29.520> this<00:02:29.760> strategy

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
about it but if you employ this strategy

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.460 
about it but if you employ this strategy
for<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.360> most<00:02:30.540> part<00:02:30.690> at<00:02:30.870> least<00:02:30.900> gives<00:02:31.320> you<00:02:31.440> a

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
for the most part at least gives you a

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.820 
for the most part at least gives you a
fighting<00:02:31.800> shot<00:02:32.990> there<00:02:33.990> are<00:02:34.170> on<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.470> flanks

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
fighting shot there are on the flanks

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.199 
fighting shot there are on the flanks
here<00:02:34.980> as<00:02:35.100> you<00:02:35.220> can<00:02:35.370> tell<00:02:35.520> you<00:02:35.700> try<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.060> keep

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
here as you can tell you try and keep

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.030 
here as you can tell you try and keep
them<00:02:36.450> away<00:02:36.720> from<00:02:36.750> getting<00:02:37.170> this<00:02:37.410> deep<00:02:37.650> into

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
them away from getting this deep into

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.420 
them away from getting this deep into
your<00:02:38.130> territory<00:02:39.800> but<00:02:40.800> if<00:02:40.920> they<00:02:41.070> are<00:02:41.190> on<00:02:41.340> the

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
your territory but if they are on the

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.710 
your territory but if they are on the
flanks<00:02:41.730> like<00:02:41.880> this<00:02:42.060> you're<00:02:42.240> doing<00:02:42.360> a<00:02:42.540> good<00:02:42.660> job

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
flanks like this you're doing a good job

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.180 
flanks like this you're doing a good job
because<00:02:43.140> if<00:02:43.350> they're<00:02:43.500> able<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.800> go<00:02:43.920> directly

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
because if they're able to go directly

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.560 
because if they're able to go directly
up<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.520> middle<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.850> your<00:02:45.030> m<00:02:45.150> comms<00:02:45.390> you're

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
up the middle to your m comms you're

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.000 
up the middle to your m comms you're
going<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.750> fail<00:02:45.930> one<00:02:46.350> hundred<00:02:46.650> percent<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:46.950> the

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
going to fail one hundred percent of the

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.490 
going to fail one hundred percent of the
time<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:47.940> keep<00:02:48.150> them<00:02:48.330> on<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.600> flanks<00:02:48.989> my

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
time so keep them on the flanks my

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.020 
time so keep them on the flanks my
teammates<00:02:49.830> like<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:50.220> said<00:02:50.459> we're<00:02:50.610> on<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.820> left

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
teammates like I said we're on the left

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.790 
teammates like I said we're on the left
side<00:02:51.239> so<00:02:51.570> if<00:02:51.660> we<00:02:51.780> were<00:02:51.870> able<00:02:51.989> to<00:02:52.170> push<00:02:52.380> them<00:02:52.590> for

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
side so if we were able to push them for

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.290 
side so if we were able to push them for
life<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:53.190> was<00:02:53.340> able<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.640> push<00:02:53.820> them<00:02:54.000> from<00:02:54.180> the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
life I was able to push them from the

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.000 
life I was able to push them from the
right<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.750> out<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.200> middle<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.770> left

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
right and out of the middle to the left

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.220 
right and out of the middle to the left
they'll<00:02:56.580> be<00:02:56.730> running<00:02:56.910> into<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.300> buzz<00:02:57.600> saw<00:02:57.660> which

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
they'll be running into a buzz saw which

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.380 
they'll be running into a buzz saw which
is<00:02:58.380> our<00:02:58.530> team<00:02:58.770> so<00:02:59.489> that's<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.820> effective

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
is our team so that's the effective

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.060 
is our team so that's the effective
strategy<00:03:00.870> keep<00:03:01.380> them<00:03:01.560> out<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.830> middle

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
strategy keep them out of the middle

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.680 
strategy keep them out of the middle
post<00:03:02.400> them<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.730> flanks<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.300> then<00:03:03.480> once

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
post them to the flanks and then once

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.360 
post them to the flanks and then once
they're<00:03:03.840> on<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.170> flanks<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.650> can<00:03:04.800> spawn<00:03:05.100> back

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
they're on the flanks you can spawn back

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.370 
they're on the flanks you can spawn back
and<00:03:05.610> take<00:03:05.760> them<00:03:05.970> out<00:03:06.060> strategically<00:03:06.840> like

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
and take them out strategically like

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.080 
and take them out strategically like
this<00:03:07.560> role<00:03:07.770> right<00:03:07.950> side<00:03:08.250> we<00:03:08.489> just<00:03:08.730> cleared

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
this role right side we just cleared

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.850 
this role right side we just cleared
it's<00:03:09.630> going<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.840> buy<00:03:09.959> us<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.260> lot<00:03:10.440> more<00:03:10.470> time<00:03:10.830> and

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
it's going to buy us a lot more time and

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.670 
it's going to buy us a lot more time and
a<00:03:11.130> lot<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:11.340> position<00:03:11.850> which<00:03:12.030> is<00:03:12.209> good<00:03:12.530> but<00:03:13.530> in

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
a lot of position which is good but in

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.229 
a lot of position which is good but in
addition<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:14.160> that<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:14.550> clears<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:14.910> middle

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
addition to that it clears the middle

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.970 
addition to that it clears the middle
and<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.540> right<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:15.959> now<00:03:16.350> we<00:03:16.410> can<00:03:16.650> just<00:03:16.680> focus

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
and the right and now we can just focus

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.800 
and the right and now we can just focus
on<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.400> left<00:03:17.580> until<00:03:17.790> they<00:03:18.030> regroup<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:18.630> push

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
on the left until they regroup and push

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.410 
on the left until they regroup and push
again<00:03:19.170> so<00:03:19.860> it's<00:03:20.040> about<00:03:20.160> buying<00:03:20.549> time<00:03:20.850> but<00:03:21.269> look

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
again so it's about buying time but look

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.120 
again so it's about buying time but look
at<00:03:21.510> what<00:03:21.540> I'm<00:03:21.690> doing<00:03:21.720> here<00:03:22.170> this<00:03:22.320> isn't<00:03:22.560> well

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
at what I'm doing here this isn't well

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.580 
at what I'm doing here this isn't well
you'll<00:03:23.670> see<00:03:23.880> in<00:03:23.940> a<00:03:24.000> minute<00:03:24.170> when<00:03:25.170> you<00:03:25.350> get<00:03:25.560> your

you'll see in a minute when you get your

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.470 
you'll see in a minute when you get your
flanks<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:26.250> timing<00:03:26.700> back<00:03:26.880> what<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.299> should

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480

the n columns but you want to push up to
gain<00:03:47.790> some<00:03:48.290> basic<00:03:49.290> area<00:03:49.980> back<00:03:50.250> because<00:03:51.030> if<00:03:51.150> you

do clear an area push up gain some area

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.870 
do clear an area push up gain some area
back<00:04:01.049> and<00:04:01.320> that's<00:04:01.410> even<00:04:01.890> further<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.549> enemy

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
back and that's even further the enemy

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.150 
back and that's even further the enemy
now<00:04:03.030> has<00:04:03.239> to<00:04:03.510> actually<00:04:03.690> push<00:04:04.410> up<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:04.829> try<00:04:05.010> and

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
now has to actually push up and try and

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.310

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
gather ground on you it's a key point to

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.780 
gather ground on you it's a key point to
know<00:04:07.530> it's<00:04:07.860> something<00:04:08.160> that<00:04:08.430> is<00:04:08.549> fairly
