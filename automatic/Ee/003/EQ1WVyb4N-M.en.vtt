00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:06.519
 now let's talk about the essential radiotherapy that is important in the treatment of 

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:12.280
 tumors we visited a specialized center at the European Institute of 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.759
 milan oncology 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.579
 aci 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:21.539
 treating a tumor with radiotherapy the treatment today increasingly sophisticated 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.599
 it begins 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.609
 it is about integrating systems that produce images and examples in this 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.609
 case ultrasound in treatments 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.980
 patient in this way can be checked every day by 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.170
 the execution of a rapid, certainly echographic, for example in the position 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.440
 of the prostate relative to the organs on the right near the bladder r 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.510
 this fact of being able to control the position 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.310
 in real time regarding the complaint of the treatment 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.370
 allows greater precision and reduces images of the treatment e 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.670
 therefore to be able to reduce the effects of healthy tissues 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.910
 to increase the dose to the target then to increase the chances of 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.390
 local control 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.090
 and last but not least to reduce the overall duration of the treatment 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.420
 possible then today edil michela pisapia amazing siguindo exactly the movements 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.630
 of breathing 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.390
 this is another example of what is considered today 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.720
 as a definition, image-guided radiotherapy, that is this rapid 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.880
 development from a technological point of view that integrates 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.030
 acquisitions on what is the real state of the patient and also the 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.310
 movement control 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.610
 of the patient due for example to physiological data such as breathing 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.310
 and the ability to follow in some way 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.950
 these movements in order to 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.320
 irradiate the target to be in a very specific way 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.650
 hit it 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.890
 this is an extremely significant progress 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.880
 which determines the possibility of applying so-called radio techniques 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.429
 surgical 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.639
 there is the possibility of giving very high costs 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:17.179
 in a few fractions in extreme cases 1 2 3 fraction at most 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:21.930
 evoking what is surgery but without but 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.930
 no invasive patience maneuver 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.329
 not just 15 high technology for radiotherapy 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:34.639
 but even in nuclear physics in pavia a center of you opens tours via broni 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:39.819
 with the same physical grades they have the ability to break the DNA and therefore to 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.749
 kill cancer cells that are 4 4 ​​times greater 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:46.799
 compared to radiation convention 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.760
 this causes that band of tumors so-called radio resistance into 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.699
 which it is not possible to obtain satisfactory results with radiation 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:02.759
 conventional can and should be treated in particular coliandro
