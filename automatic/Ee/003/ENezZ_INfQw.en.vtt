00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.450
 namely when I go to October and 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.110
 white fled when I do not even 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.179
 decry 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.980
 i can only do one thing i can only 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.530
 the thumbs and hope that it 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.329
 really goes so well even though she is not in 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.329
 first passage relatively much ahead 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:52.480
 not quite ready at the six 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.340
 meter far 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.670
 16 For by yet was the 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.329
 leadership was the lead from the first 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.850
 passage and now dieter thomas 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.580
 reumann in front of weissflog and the 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.729
 decision now falls in the last 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.900
 Something hard to earn 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.830
 consist 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.830
 it looks normal 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:30.100
 very clean so hard it's hard 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.100
 runkel 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.000
 vattenfall with 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.220
 that was around ten or a hundred 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:55.869
 eleven meters that's enough anyway 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.940
 that is probably a result as is 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.010
 the german skiverband in such a 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.750
 Great contestants never party him 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.680
 could 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:11.050
 first dieter thoma from hinterzarten 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:14.770
 second man from oberaudorf then third 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.870
 jens flew the big springer from the 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.950
 ddr the world champion once again 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.290
 victory jump from dieter thoma the boy 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.580
 seems to have nerves good the air in 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:30.910
 Schwarzwald helps the points so for 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.090
 Well, do not tell the well here 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.860
 very first favorite yesterday after the 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:41.960
 training was so good 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:44.250
 among the first five we try 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.620
 yes, I see Thomas cock already 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.770
 maybe he can get some of the winners 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.150
 things thomas please dieter thoma josef 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.130
 heumann congratulations 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.080
 there was never that at one 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.090
 jumping tour jump two 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.920
 Federal German jump to place one and 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.140
 two were how could this happen, the 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.430
 date was 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.430
 because everything fit like last year 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.680
 the weather was beautiful many spectators the 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.180
 motivation and that has everything together 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.040
 we are a team and that has fit 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.290
 Mainz proved that other drivers are strong 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.170
 and I hope that it this way not 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.730
 much is known for her a fantastic 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.640
 Success on you have never been on the spot 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.650
 two of the best were third and so far 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.940
 author ian oberstdorf to become second 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.130
 is the highest ever 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.250
 they are still in the 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.570
 training and are also in the meantime 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.670
 athlete how to create now 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:36.570
 all at once difficult to say 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.360
 what matters is that my training 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.830
 makes no mistakes and where just a little 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.720
 then he does not do much training 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.940
 fewest errors of the dieter thoma 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.490
 why suddenly two jumps equally well 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.959
 me because I think it was yesterday 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.490
 training i did two good jumps 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.810
 and it was the decisive factor that I was good 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.040
 I can play a bit more games 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.310
 become calmer and more relaxed 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.600
 sovereign sat still further me 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:10.489
 was just as nervous as last year 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:10.489
 Now a good one and celebrate somewhere 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.220
 all together give back here 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.970
 to the ecology and deacons cordial 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:27.030
 Congratulations you two who are in there 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.160
 interior there are suddenly several 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.650
 a hundred people is all black and 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.330
 Although amazing that thomas 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.919
 so man could fight through 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.690
 here once again that appears 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.480
 end result of the advancement of dieter 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.930
 dream thoma warden is now 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:45.360
 reasonably big five points then 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.449
 third jens flew two points behind 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.270
 heumann 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.949
 nicola piesch so now and today would 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.430
 I say in this illustrious one 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:57.589
 circle the two big surprises 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.210
 dieter thoma has just explained again 

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:01.129
 that very obviously the 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.770
 boosting yesterday's workout results 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:04.909
 have given two days ago saw there 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.089
 quite different 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:09.919
 he seemed a bit unsure 

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:12.469
 different jumps but none 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:15.889
 special here and trainer rudi tusch 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:17.379
 meant that did not necessarily have with him 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:20.360
 to mean something 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:22.580
 It's not like this this season 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.499
 sure as confident as in the 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.849
 last year 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:29.139
 is still experimenting but it can just in 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:31.129
 this completely inscrutable 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:35.539
 mysterious sport ski jumping 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:38.629
 every day of the knot burst rené 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:41.060
 take care of the ddr is the last 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:43.819
 those who get the World Cup points for 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.529
 There is a starting place for the 15th place 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:47.899
 also gets one from the 

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:51.499
 Czechoslovakia a point dieter thoma 

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:53.240
 and serious vettori from austria 

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:55.639
 So far, the two springer already 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.860
 Two World Cup jump this season 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:00.319
 have won 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.930
 the atoms now has 67 points so it is 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:05.959
 reasonably advanced should be so 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.159
 third fourth place now in the World Cup 

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:10.159
 this season 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:11.930
 well, the next jump find 

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:15.139
 instead of in garmisch partenkirchen am 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.689
 New Year's Day also with security 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:20.719
 great backdrop for this upbeat in 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:23.449
 Oberstdorf naturally has a mood 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:26.569
 made causes that the graphically 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:29.180
 the olympia ski stadium certainly too 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:31.159
 fully occupied should be sold out 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.649
 and then it goes on the fourth 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:38.680
 january in innsbruck on 6 of the conclusion 

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:41.510
 in bischofshofen and this first 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:45.200
 competition day despite 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:47.050
 green slopes in the allgäu brought but on 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.450
 this very well prepared chance 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:52.130
 first-class competition among athletic 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:56.500
 perfect conditions 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:59.570
 they are rarely as good as 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:02.510
 I would say as in the spring here 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.880
 World Cup evaluation of the goal led still ahead 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:08.540
 start two Austrians in front then two 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:11.630
 film dieter thoma tied with 

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.950
 restaurators andreas fields is now 

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:17.230
 sixth so for the austrians 

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:21.250
 find and the Germans one so far 

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:21.250
 excellent competition season 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:27.620
 Finally, how do you judge the 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.450
 chances the further chances with the 

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:32.150
 Tournee was there last year 

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:34.430
 very close to winning 4 points 

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:39.830
 he finally missed him in bischofshofen 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:41.600
 he had to go to garmisch and innsbruck and 

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.880
 Also in this search every time relatively 

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.920
 weak first jump behind 

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.560
 panting and then brought but still 

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.020
 so good places together 

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:53.240
 up to four points at the first in the 

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:55.520
 Appreciation at the many risko laugh 

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:59.180
 So it can be so the culprit has 

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:02.170
 now quite a bit ahead 

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.170
 without
