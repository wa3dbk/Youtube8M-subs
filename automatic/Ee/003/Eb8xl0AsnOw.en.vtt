00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.470
 so a mode 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.450
 a leader 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.530
 2nd in 2007 that I knew afterwards 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.610
 late 2009 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.110
 see and wanted to do an internship when I 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.000
 got to the chalkboards I'm going 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.840
 wait and in 2011 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.090
 2000 and late 2010 he came 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.910
 to do a few weeks at home 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.400
 cooked 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.380
 to draw inspiration also from 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.210
 champenois but especially wanted him 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.160
 to learn something else had already done 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.140
 internships in other houses and they 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.640
 wanted to see something else it's a leader 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.989
 I appreciate his personality and there 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.290
 really a personality in relation to 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.510
 other Japanese and is not confused in 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.390
 the ain in a mold 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:58.010
 he's really very particular does not get 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.620
 risk not at that sakho were very very 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.540
 ancestral we will say but when we can 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.100
 nothing somewhere and it comes out all in 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.259
 his way of cooking in his way of 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.479
 see things in his philosophy his 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.600
 philosophy because there is a kitchen 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.300
 very much to a passionate in me a very big 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.979
 passionate about French cuisine but a 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.039
 passionate about his products his products 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.950
 from his region of his country on his side 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:24.590
 local which is very important I had the 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.270
 chance to eat at home we have 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.030
 found all this kitchen 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.830
 around them 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.580
 the salmon that comes this river that 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.710
 is right next door or the sea trout the 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.270
 his little vegetable garden or market gardener 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.280
 comes who makes vegetables that for him 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.810
 and then here we feel that in his 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.220
 cooking me vegetables are really 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.660
 cook slowly 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.200
 with precision also once again 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:51.200
 but it's a chef who will speak his 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.260
 heart and who has that at a very kitchen 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.190
 very precise in his plates and nothing 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:02.090
 moreover it is the product the fish the 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.250
 small accompaniment the small condiments 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.210
 who just picked up the product 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:11.980
 but very aesthetic a kitchen to 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:15.069
 visuals really exceptional 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.800
 it looks like pictures every time in 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.310
 The dishes 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:24.270
 mecha of taste too is who who asks 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.130
 to be known because he is not sure 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.610
 tokyo domain alas an hour and a half 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.230
 i believe from tokyo and he needs them 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.860
 I think to be known and to be 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.390
 recognized and the golden bocuse dreamed it and 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.460
 I hope he will reveal it even more 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.140
 in the next year a leader 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.620
 that self-taught who made a lot of 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.860
 trainings in France what did 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.850
 internships in different restaurants 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:53.580
 triple starry stars but is who 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.220
 who who cook with his heart that a 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:00.030
 personality and who you really want 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:03.560
 go after things that learned 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.060
 a lot of two cooking techniques 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.940
 of a very particular reasoning in 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.460
 every house and who knows he took 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.500
 he sorted nuts here that's it 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.250
 look like it does not look like I 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.040
 take that and I 'll adapt relative 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.140
 to my life to my philosophy and he did not 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.610
 needed them it was also 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.620
 what makes the difference maybe by 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.440
 compared to other Japanese 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.010
 is that he does not have to give an account to 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.849
 other people 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.220
 he does what he wants is his little 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.230
 jewel there whenever they have who 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.060
 talk about cooking and I think 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.159
 differently we 'll say it but here we go 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.900
 will cook them like that then the 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:45.060
 product tell him the product comes from there 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.400
 the fish he swam like this 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.620
 well, no, we believe them in the plate ok 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.239
 there are some dishes ben here we see 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.409
 there the form of fish they have 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.599
 the impression that he is still swimming in 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:56.790
 trim 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.560
 or so the me I remember a 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.840
 orange 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.360
 a news or for a year with 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.840
 meringues on that was it purity 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.520
 of the product 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.680
 kurt the products in the plate 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.810
 did not have any superfluous 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.280
 it was the product a beautiful decoration 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:16.169
 but who really came to 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:18.989
 value this this dessert this is the 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.959
 Product quintessential taste the 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.910
 highlighted and with his humility this 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.460
 that he is very humble also as the 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.290
 Japanese but here it is and here I am 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.639
 did that because I thought it was 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.919
 he fell from the tree he did like 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.430
 if he does it that way when he has 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.250
 fallen from the tree 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.060
 he made a small trace on the on the 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.150
 soil and is found in bin 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.160
 the plate writes around there is a little bit of 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.530
 youzhou powder but really limits 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.479
 is also the place where you came across 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.870
 the plate had splashed on one on 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.550
 trim 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.760
 so me this is this philosophy that 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.490
 I love and who really shows all his 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.950
 know how and I hope I hope the 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.669
 see in chalkboards I hope we will do a 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.500
 meal both do two blockade of 11 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.960
 it would be a nice wink and then 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.400
 well it will be their turn his return is not 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.889
 more or less to chalkboards after his 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.419
 traineeship 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.879
 show us that he too has evolved 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:14.120
 and that there is also to gain points 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:15.740
 who also gained notoriety and for 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.490
 make a menu together to be able to 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.779
 to discover 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.330
 he could discover our 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:21.889
 customer also really knows where for 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.779
 me it is one of the best restaurants 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.039
 I want kitchens the kitchen type 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:27.199
 French Japanese is not a 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:30.710
 sushi restaurant separates restaurants 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:32.449
 of pure Japanese cuisine then a 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.330
 French with Japanese products 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:36.710
 really from his area that are put in 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.310
 value and that I think it's 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.650
 important and it will pay 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:45.050
 and in addition this month 600 his book 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.699
 as expected it will be a hit because 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.110
 that visually it's a kitchen that 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:50.110
 is in very very very beautiful
