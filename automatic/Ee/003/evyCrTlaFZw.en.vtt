00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.880
 hello friends I'm copper fix in this video 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:10.749
 let's change the dns on the server 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:13.000
 of domain names in windows 8 for 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:15.639
 we're going 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.550
 down here and click with the button 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:21.010
 right over this icon here you 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.660
 we open the network center and 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.330
 shared resources 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.110
 and here on the left we give to change 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.260
 adapter configuration 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:35.080
 we choose our network card or if 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:38.040
 out wifi our wifi controller and 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.040
 we click with the right button and 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.040
 properties 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.970
 here we choose internet protocol 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:50.060
 version 4 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.190
 and we give properties 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:56.530
 now here where he says use the 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:59.530
 following dns server addresses 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:06.299
 let's put the google ones that are very 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:06.299
 reliable that is 8.8 points 8.8 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:14.020
 8.8 points 4.4 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.350
 we give you to accept 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.080
 we close this dialogue and we already have it 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.410
 modified 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.490
 what happens that the dns takes a while 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:29.250
 to be effective to try to accelerate 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.500
 a little bit that process we go to the 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.360
 lower left corner with the button 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:40.830
 right system symbol 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.830
 and we wrote ipconfig space 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:50.549
 ns flash we press intro and it tells us 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.700
 which he emptied the cache correctly 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.470
 resolution of dns which accelerates the 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:01.080
 process for the new dns to act 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:04.649
 so that to make a change of dns then in 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:08.220
 some occasions that youtube 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:11.039
 other pages are slower than we 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.980
 usual or we suspect that they are going too 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.580
 slow a change of dns can solve 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.180
 that slowness may be that the ips that 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:24.360
 the company that gives us connection gives us 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:27.060
 adsl have their dns saturated and for that 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.160
 reason it is sometimes convenient to change it 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.600
 another free as in this case those of 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.210
 Google 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.280
 and this is all I hope you find useful 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.280
 this mini tutorial and until another
