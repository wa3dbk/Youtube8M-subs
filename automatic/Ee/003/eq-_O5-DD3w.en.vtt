00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:12.259
 I am the stage and good the idea of â€‹â€‹this 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.790
 project arises because we want 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.280
 that people find a place to 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.960
 extend relax 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.700
 comfortable in which to enjoy a 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.490
 regional craft beer from here 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.620
 zone and then accompany with a stage the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.360
 Going for tapas is a custom 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.400
 excellence of the Spanish at the moment 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.340
 of leaving work the idea arises 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.350
 also because the beer culture of 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.200
 silver is growing a lot and 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.450
 there would have to be a place for it 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.340
 they can sell their beer and the 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.020
 tapas were the ideal excuse for 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.140
 accompany that craft beer to 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.640
 Unlike a conventional restaurant 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.010
 the tapas are served at the centerpiece and 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.100
 They are shared among all diners 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.409
 so lets share a good time 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.800
 a good talk without the need for 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:04.309
 be waiting for the dish you understand 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.260
 it's like you forget about food 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.650
 spending the night and you're eating all the 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.119
 time different things never look at that 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.260
 dish next door because he chose better than 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:17.119
 you those issues that make you 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.530
 forget that you are eating a 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.900
 restaurant and can spend it at home 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.030
 focuses on people being able to 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.810
 extend you can relax found a 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.390
 comfortable place not supported by consumption 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.630
 that all the time stalks us today for 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.700
 today a quiet place surrounded by art 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.560
 of good music with a conscience 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:42.000
 interesting gastronomic 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.040
 that's why we hid we started a 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.650
 group of friends and they will help me 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.020
 very much the truth that 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.270
 little by little day to day and we go 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.120
 building something that does overcome 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.240
 when you put in a lot of effort and a lot 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:01.140
 love something ends up giving a result in 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:05.070
 imagined imagined that you do not expect it 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.880
 surprises and creates something unique that 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:12.540
 it tells me a lot today what what 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.250
 it generated encourage me to do something the house the 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.630
 first day that you see that this is the 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.580
 house where I have with the restaurant 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.610
 stages because it's old I love the 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.840
 old thing that's why it's the decoration 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.480
 He also respects what he has to 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.740
 see with the house the chairs are here are 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.190
 same as my grandfather had in the 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.550
 tapestry house of nothing and they are here to the 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:37.440
 moment to decorate the place they made 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:40.320
 missing a lot of real estate decorate 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.850
 the walls then nothing a friend of the 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.430
 childhood 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:49.100
 digestate has to come to paint and 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:51.620
 decorate this and nothing came 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.510
 That same day we started to see what 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.810
 I could do here to explain better 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.580
 this is no one better than sato hello 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.360

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.310
 sato am friend indicated since boy and a 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.440
 day he called me how is he with an idea of 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.560
 create a place where there is food and there 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.900
 art and that the Spanish tapas and that the 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.090
 number of tastes and the rooms of 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.680
 the house I had that I had seen and how 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.140
 the only one who convinces you good we came 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.570
 here he was open to pass all 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.220
 invite an artist to intervene 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.650
 every space of the place 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.250
 well I did this the blue one that is 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.690
 behind me and well I was map is a 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.200
 genia which is the room where they were 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.530
 tails 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.530
 santiago ambrosio which is the front to 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.290
 face with a very ephemeral of silver in 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.750
 the bathroom women drawer in the bathroom 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.940
 mens 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.150
 and good in this room I also have 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.670
 that name her what lucre 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.370
 the one known in a course and she always 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.530
 I wanted to play with clouds and with the 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.870
 clouds and when he says the room of his 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.310
 line was pulled and I said has to 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:04.849
 come the clouds of profit and here are a 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.879
 of the ideas that were given while 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.829
 we tried all the google food and the 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.709
 chef nico tells me he wanted a 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.000
 room that is quiet that like 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.489
 that he can be relaxed that he had 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.670
 thought that the furniture and the 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.620
 seats are low 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.690
 and I said good I chose this 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.610
 mainly because I'm half fanatic 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.939
 of the blue color 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:31.330
 It is a color that brings that water and 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:32.750
 florida of peace and good I freedom 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.440
 to do this 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.440
 I stay 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.800
 my name is Rodrigo beyond 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.290
 gastronomic professional I am the 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.970
 gastronomic manager of the club 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:00.390
 tapas 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:03.930
 the idea we had to follow a 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.490
 gastronomic line of the place is to bring 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.000
 to people to what is the variety of the 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:13.290
 variety of tapas here in Argentina 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.770
 similarity to the Spanish tapas in 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:21.360
 that same line we chose to specify with 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:23.830
 certain dishes that are already made 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.590
 with products 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.550
 common that all the people who know 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:33.250
 but hey, you've been looking for them over there 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:37.030
 those dishes to show gastronomy of 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:40.530
 italy italy from india within what 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.490
 that we could put together the basic idea is that 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.670
 bring people closer to what tapas is 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:48.280
 what are normal products 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:51.250

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.900
 way or with other flavors and good for 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:57.250
 put them a little in what is a tapas 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.630
