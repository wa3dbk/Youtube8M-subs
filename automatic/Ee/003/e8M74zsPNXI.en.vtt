00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.069
 how to use a float 

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:14.259
 the pools the sea and the lakes only cares of relaxation and fun for all the 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:15.219
 family 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.669
 but water can also be dangerous especially for children 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.400
 that's why you always have to be very cautious 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.639
 the life-saving floats assures us an unpayable tranquility when 

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:32.809
 our children are playing in the water there are several types of floats or 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.070
 Inflatable elements that provide both protection and fun 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.600
 but the problem is when the children do not want to use it either because they 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.300
 are uncomfortable or for another reason this is where we must turn to 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.470
 more creative solutions 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.660
 For example, buy floats with drawings or characters that you like 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.930
 boy let's see different types of floats and how to use them 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.350
 a classic are the sleeves 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.840
 Inflatable items that are placed one on each arm of the child are very useful 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.470
 for the pools made special for children between 1 and six years 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.950
 Another traditional float is the inflatable in the form of a thread 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.250
 The best way to use it is to place it around the waist of the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.630
 child this will provide you with a bra so you can float 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.820
 The size of the float must be according to the size of the child 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.200
 This is very important 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.510
 because if not the child can slide through the hole of the float and let go 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.570
 a very safe system is the classic inflatable vest 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.160
 Once inflated you put it on the child and you make sure to tie it fasten it well 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.310
 so they are not owed 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.310
 It's easy to use 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.510
 a very good flotation element for children who are learning to swim 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.719
 are the rubber tables 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:20.599
 the child grabs hold of it and pushes with his feet this table allows him to 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.459
 child let go occasionally and regain grip when feeling insecure 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:34.769
 Finally a very popular accessory is a long tube of foam rubber that 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.599
 You can use it in various ways this element is recommended for children who 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.379
 they are learning to swim not for babies 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.769
 We have seen many types of floats that protect our children 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.859
 and they give us peace of mind when I was playing in the water 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:54.870
 however the most important thing is to never lose sight of them and supervise them 

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:57.869
 whenever they are in the water 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:05.010

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.250
