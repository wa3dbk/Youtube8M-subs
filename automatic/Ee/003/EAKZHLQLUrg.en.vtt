the bend next thing we're going to do

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.590 
the bend next thing we're going to do
because<00:00:53.780> we're<00:00:54.109> gonna<00:00:54.199> dub<00:00:54.589> the<00:00:55.329> body<00:00:56.329> of<00:00:56.510> the

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
because we're gonna dub the body of the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.189 
because we're gonna dub the body of the
fly<00:00:57.399> and<00:00:58.399> with<00:00:58.699> this<00:00:58.820> fly<00:00:59.089> you<00:00:59.149> can<00:00:59.539> be<00:00:59.719> fairly

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
fly and with this fly you can be fairly

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.549 
fly and with this fly you can be fairly
generous<00:01:01.070> with<00:01:01.280> the<00:01:01.399> Devon<00:01:02.109> compared<00:01:03.109> to<00:01:03.260> your

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
generous with the Devon compared to your

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:12.760 
generous with the Devon compared to your
small<00:01:04.479> trout<00:01:05.479> flies<00:01:11.229> here<00:01:12.229> I'm<00:01:12.350> just<00:01:12.560> using

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
small trout flies here I'm just using

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:28.200 
small trout flies here I'm just using
the<00:01:13.119> peat<00:01:14.119> and<00:01:14.360> dubbing

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.220 

and<00:01:28.780> it<00:01:28.990> takes<00:01:29.170> a<00:01:29.320> few<00:01:29.530> times<00:01:29.800> to<00:01:30.870> get<00:01:31.870> it<00:01:32.020> built

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
and it takes a few times to get it built

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:41.230 
and it takes a few times to get it built
up

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.680 

and<00:01:41.960> I'm<00:01:42.110> gonna<00:01:42.260> go<00:01:42.729> around<00:01:43.729> those<00:01:44.150> eyes<00:01:44.360> as

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
and I'm gonna go around those eyes as

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:52.359 
and I'm gonna go around those eyes as
well

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:02:02.020 

build<00:01:52.909> up<00:01:53.090> a<00:01:53.210> little<00:01:53.420> bit<00:01:53.690> behind<00:01:53.869> them

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.100 

it's<00:02:03.030> probably<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.390> most<00:02:03.570> labor-intensive

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
it's probably the most labor-intensive

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:11.150 
it's probably the most labor-intensive
part<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.100> fly<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:06.740> dubbing<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:10.039> there<00:02:11.039> we

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
part of the fly is dubbing it there we

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.479 
part of the fly is dubbing it there we
go<00:02:12.560> now<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.590> next<00:02:13.980> thing<00:02:14.040> we're<00:02:14.190> gonna<00:02:14.250> do<00:02:14.459> is

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
go now the next thing we're gonna do is

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:15.860 
go now the next thing we're gonna do is
we're<00:02:14.670> gonna<00:02:14.730> take<00:02:15.000> this<00:02:15.239> hook<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.780> we're

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
we're gonna take this hook and we're

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.559 
we're gonna take this hook and we're
actually<00:02:16.020> going<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.380> invert<00:02:16.739> it<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.069> our<00:02:17.569> in

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
actually going to invert it in our in

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.750 
actually going to invert it in our in
our<00:02:18.720> vise<00:02:19.400> just<00:02:20.400> like<00:02:20.520> so<00:02:22.160> now<00:02:23.160> it's<00:02:23.489> time<00:02:23.730> for

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
our vise just like so now it's time for

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.340 
our vise just like so now it's time for
the<00:02:24.739> marabou<00:02:26.569> I'm<00:02:27.569> gonna<00:02:27.750> be<00:02:27.870> tying<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.260> in

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
the marabou I'm gonna be tying it in

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.500 
the marabou I'm gonna be tying it in
brown<00:02:28.590> here<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.700> length<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.239> marabou

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
brown here and the length of the marabou

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.170 
brown here and the length of the marabou
you<00:02:30.780> want<00:02:30.959> it<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.170> be<00:02:31.370> roughly<00:02:32.370> one-and-a-half

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
you want it to be roughly one-and-a-half

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.170 
you want it to be roughly one-and-a-half
times<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.050> length<00:02:34.440> of<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.739> fly<00:02:35.130> so<00:02:35.489> like

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
times the length of the fly so like

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.960 
times the length of the fly so like
there<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:36.959> one<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.590> add<00:02:38.280> just<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.640> little<00:02:38.880> bit

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
there is one I add just a little bit

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.490 
there is one I add just a little bit
more<00:02:39.150> so<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.540> hangs<00:02:39.720> off<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.170> back<00:02:40.319> of<00:02:40.440> the

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
more so it hangs off of the back of the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.120 
more so it hangs off of the back of the
hook<00:02:42.019> we're<00:02:43.019> gonna<00:02:43.170> tie<00:02:43.380> that<00:02:43.530> in<00:02:43.769> on<00:02:44.040> the

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
hook we're gonna tie that in on the

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:52.340 
hook we're gonna tie that in on the
underside<00:02:44.580> of<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.760> fly<00:02:50.630> I'm<00:02:51.630> gonna<00:02:51.930> trim<00:02:52.230> out

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:32.190 
underside of the fly I'm gonna trim out
the<00:02:53.840> excess<00:02:59.630> clean<00:03:00.630> it<00:03:00.780> up<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:01.049> little
