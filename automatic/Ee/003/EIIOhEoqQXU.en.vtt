there you can do some cool stuff with

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.350 
there you can do some cool stuff with
stairs<00:01:15.890> because<00:01:16.130> they<00:01:16.430> don't<00:01:16.580> make<00:01:16.730> a<00:01:16.790> whole

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
stairs because they don't make a whole

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.420 
stairs because they don't make a whole
half<00:01:17.630> block<00:01:17.960> so<00:01:18.320> ass<00:01:18.710> like<00:01:18.920> on<00:01:19.100> it<00:01:19.220> granulates

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
half block so ass like on it granulates

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.270 
half block so ass like on it granulates
a<00:01:19.730> drain<00:01:20.030> right<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:21.080> naturally<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.040> lever

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
a drain right and naturally the lever

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.700 
a drain right and naturally the lever
for<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:23.480> shower<00:01:23.720> spigot<00:01:24.110> I<00:01:24.440> could<00:01:24.650> have

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
for the the shower spigot I could have

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.060 
for the the shower spigot I could have
used<00:01:24.920> a<00:01:25.130> young<00:01:25.400> a<00:01:26.110> trip<00:01:27.110> wire<00:01:27.290> hook<00:01:27.530> too<00:01:27.770> but<00:01:28.040> I

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
used a young a trip wire hook too but I

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.380 
used a young a trip wire hook too but I
figured<00:01:28.430> that<00:01:28.580> the<00:01:28.670> level<00:01:28.970> worked<00:01:29.150> pretty

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
figured that the level worked pretty

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.800 
figured that the level worked pretty
well<00:01:29.630> and<00:01:29.870> a<00:01:30.650> nice<00:01:30.830> cut<00:01:31.250> yeah<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:32.630> little

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
well and a nice cut yeah and the little

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.420 
well and a nice cut yeah and the little
blue<00:01:33.350> curtains<00:01:33.770> it's<00:01:33.950> hard<00:01:34.130> to<00:01:34.220> emulate

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
blue curtains it's hard to emulate

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.010 
blue curtains it's hard to emulate
curtains<00:01:34.880> in<00:01:35.000> Minecraft<00:01:35.450> but<00:01:35.540> these<00:01:35.810> do<00:01:35.990> a

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
curtains in Minecraft but these do a

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.160 
curtains in Minecraft but these do a
pretty<00:01:36.260> good<00:01:36.350> job<00:01:36.500> with<00:01:36.710> it<00:01:37.120> on<00:01:38.120> top<00:01:38.450> also<00:01:38.720> use

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
pretty good job with it on top also use

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.750 
pretty good job with it on top also use
those<00:01:39.380> daylight<00:01:39.710> sensors<00:01:40.190> just<00:01:40.430> to<00:01:40.549> draw<00:01:40.729> a

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
those daylight sensors just to draw a

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.780 
those daylight sensors just to draw a
little<00:01:41.030> bit<00:01:41.150> of<00:01:41.270> attention<00:01:42.140> to<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.680> light<00:01:42.860> the

actually ever tried because then they

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.639 
actually ever tried because then they
like<00:02:07.560> if<00:02:07.890> we<00:02:08.009> actually<00:02:08.160> cave<00:02:08.580> yes<00:02:09.270> but<00:02:09.869> if<00:02:10.380> you

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
did a cauldron and you do the same

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.980 
did a cauldron and you do the same
design<00:02:14.100> like<00:02:14.520> this<00:02:14.700> with<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:14.940> toilet<00:02:15.390> then<00:02:15.720> it

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
design like this with a toilet then it

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.020 
design like this with a toilet then it
kind<00:02:16.230> of<00:02:16.380> leaves<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:17.040> thinking<00:02:17.490> like<00:02:17.700> what

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
kind of leaves you thinking like what

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.690 
kind of leaves you thinking like what
are<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:18.270> what<00:02:18.660> is<00:02:18.780> it<00:02:18.990> let's<00:02:19.740> assess<00:02:20.160> toilet

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
are you what is it let's assess toilet

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.980 
are you what is it let's assess toilet
toilet<00:02:22.520> right<00:02:23.520> what<00:02:24.060> was<00:02:24.270> it<00:02:24.450> wet<00:02:24.630> again<00:02:26.990> so

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
toilet right what was it wet again so

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.020 
toilet right what was it wet again so
it's<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.440> little<00:02:28.620> bit<00:02:28.709> hard<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.160> decide<00:02:29.760> what<00:02:30.000> I

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
it's a little bit hard to decide what I

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.990 
it's a little bit hard to decide what I
was<00:02:30.180> going<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.420> do<00:02:30.540> with<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.720> but<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:32.160> then

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
was going to do with that but and then

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.300 
was going to do with that but and then
that's<00:02:33.450> why<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.630> just<00:02:34.350> put<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:35.130> dyed

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
that's why I just put the the dyed

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.070 
that's why I just put the the dyed
leather<00:02:35.550> vest<00:02:35.940> because<00:02:36.209> it<00:02:36.480> was<00:02:36.570> like<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.750> shirt

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
leather vest because it was like a shirt

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.250 
leather vest because it was like a shirt
to<00:02:37.350> emulate<00:02:37.980> like<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.190> hamper<00:02:38.850> idea<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:40.110> make

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
to emulate like a hamper idea to make

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.720 
to emulate like a hamper idea to make
sense<00:02:40.500> in<00:02:40.890> just<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.310> couple<00:02:41.459> little

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
sense in just a couple little

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.340 
sense in just a couple little

layer<00:04:48.790> deal<00:04:49.120> and<00:04:49.330> it's<00:04:49.930> very<00:04:50.230> very<00:04:50.350> hard<00:04:50.770> to<00:04:50.890> do

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
layer deal and it's very very hard to do

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.800 
layer deal and it's very very hard to do
that<00:04:51.220> without<00:04:51.400> making<00:04:51.850> the<00:04:51.970> bathtub<00:04:52.420> seem

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
that without making the bathtub seem

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.950

like<00:04:53.080> it's<00:04:53.350> way<00:04:53.860> way<00:04:54.160> too<00:04:54.190> tall<00:04:54.610> to<00:04:54.820> get<00:04:55.000> in<00:04:55.210> so

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
like it's way way too tall to get in so

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.810 
like it's way way too tall to get in so
I<00:04:55.990> can<00:04:56.200> imagine<00:04:56.350> just<00:04:57.130> like<00:04:57.310> one<00:04:57.580> and<00:04:57.730> a<00:04:57.790> half
