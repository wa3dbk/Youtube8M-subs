00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
we're back with another video of

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.180 
we're back with another video of
Transformers<00:00:15.570> rise<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.170> dark<00:00:16.410> spark<00:00:16.560> and

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
Transformers rise of the dark spark and

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.550 
Transformers rise of the dark spark and
what<00:00:17.609> we're<00:00:17.730> looking<00:00:17.880> at<00:00:18.150> today<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.810> Ultra

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
what we're looking at today is Ultra

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.359 
what we're looking at today is Ultra
Magnus<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:21.529> thought<00:00:22.529> this<00:00:22.830> character<00:00:23.220> was

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
Magnus and I thought this character was

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.660 
Magnus and I thought this character was
pretty<00:00:23.580> cool<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.439> Transformers<00:00:25.439> Prime<00:00:25.920> that's

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
pretty cool in Transformers Prime that's

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.509 
pretty cool in Transformers Prime that's
because<00:00:27.060> if<00:00:27.240> he<00:00:27.779> looked<00:00:28.080> like<00:00:28.260> Optimus<00:00:28.920> in<00:00:29.369> my

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
because if he looked like Optimus in my

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.220 
because if he looked like Optimus in my
opinion<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.119> guess<00:00:30.150> they<00:00:30.420> had<00:00:30.539> like<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.019> same

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
opinion I guess they had like the same

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.060 
opinion I guess they had like the same
kind<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.130> height<00:00:32.399> body<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.590> it<00:00:34.590> was<00:00:34.829> just

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
kind of height body and it was just

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.639 
kind of height body and it was just
similar<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.730> course<00:00:36.030> people<00:00:36.630> didn't<00:00:36.930> like<00:00:37.140> him

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
can't get along but anyways i thought i

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.849 
can't get along but anyways i thought i
like<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.149> blue<00:00:57.360> color<00:00:57.590> anyways<00:00:58.590> we're<00:00:58.770> gonna

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
like the blue color anyways we're gonna

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.529 
like the blue color anyways we're gonna
go<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.280> here<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.609> take<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.940> look<00:01:00.180> at<00:01:00.300> his

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
go in here and take a look at his

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.439 
go in here and take a look at his
autobot<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.559> mean<00:01:01.770> his<00:01:01.920> vehicle<00:01:02.340> form<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.940> I

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
autobot I mean his vehicle form and I

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.179 
autobot I mean his vehicle form and I
guess<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:04.080> bit<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.619> how<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.280> looks<00:01:05.610> like<00:01:05.970> in

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
guess a bit of a how it looks like in

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.320 
guess a bit of a how it looks like in
Transformers<00:01:08.189> right<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> dark<00:01:09.000> spark

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
Transformers right of the dark spark

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.270 
Transformers right of the dark spark
hopefully<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:09.930> get<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.140> game<00:01:10.439> going<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.979> here

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
hopefully we get a game going in here

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.370 
hopefully we get a game going in here
not<00:01:11.909> with<00:01:12.119> just<00:01:12.299> one<00:01:12.540> person<00:01:12.990> though<00:01:13.140> because

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
not with just one person though because

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.410 
not with just one person though because
then<00:01:13.860> we'd<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.460> exit<00:01:14.939> out<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.240> game

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
then we'd have to exit out of a game

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.960 
then we'd have to exit out of a game
after<00:01:15.659> we're<00:01:16.140> done<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.439> video<00:01:16.710> because<00:01:17.070> you

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
after we're done the video because you

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.149 
after we're done the video because you
know<00:01:18.200> playing<00:01:19.200> with<00:01:19.350> one<00:01:19.619> person<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.100> this

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
know playing with one person in this

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.310 
know playing with one person in this
game<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.549> isn't<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.090> great<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.600> isn't<00:01:22.020> easy

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
game is isn't that great it isn't easy

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.590 
game is isn't that great it isn't easy
you<00:01:23.100> have<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.400> have<00:01:23.549> four<00:01:23.880> people<00:01:23.909> that'll

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
you have to have four people that'll

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.569 
you have to have four people that'll
make<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.840> much<00:01:25.200> easier<00:01:25.560> than<00:01:27.049> not<00:01:28.340> but<00:01:29.340> anyways

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
make it much easier than not but anyways

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.300 
make it much easier than not but anyways
we're<00:01:30.420> gonna<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:31.200> guess<00:01:31.439> we're<00:01:31.799> going<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:31.979> start

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
we're gonna I guess we're going to start

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.240 
we're gonna I guess we're going to start
because<00:01:32.790> there's<00:01:33.030> twelve<00:01:33.720> ten<00:01:34.200> minutes<00:01:34.979> or

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
because there's twelve ten minutes or

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.910 
because there's twelve ten minutes or
twenty<00:01:35.579> ten<00:01:35.790> seconds<00:01:36.390> left<00:01:36.570> rather<00:01:36.869> for<00:01:37.829> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
twenty ten seconds left rather for the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:46.820 
twenty ten seconds left rather for the
game<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.490> load

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:02:12.360 

you

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.500

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
all right looks like we're starting but

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.059 
all right looks like we're starting but
hopefully<00:02:17.510> some<00:02:17.689> players<00:02:17.959> join<00:02:18.349> within<00:02:18.950> the

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
hopefully some players join within the

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.759 
hopefully some players join within the
next<00:02:19.340> 10<00:02:19.670> seconds<00:02:20.299> probably<00:02:21.260> not<00:02:21.409> going<00:02:21.650> to

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
next 10 seconds probably not going to

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.160 
next 10 seconds probably not going to
happen<00:02:21.980> but<00:02:22.459> oh<00:02:22.579> wow<00:02:22.780> we're<00:02:23.780> going<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:23.989> leave
