while I would probably say total um

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.009 
while I would probably say total um
three<00:00:20.220> years<00:00:20.670> around<00:00:21.449> there<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.320> have<00:00:24.019> had

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
three years around there that I have had

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.920 
three years around there that I have had
experience<00:00:25.529> dyeing<00:00:25.740> my<00:00:25.920> hair<00:00:25.949> at<00:00:26.130> home<00:00:26.160> and

experience dyeing my hair at home and

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.040 
experience dyeing my hair at home and
the<00:00:27.930> reason<00:00:28.230> why<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.410> do<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.340> because<00:00:30.119> for

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
the reason why I do it is because for

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.720 
the reason why I do it is because for
one<00:00:31.199> it's<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.619> lot<00:00:31.800> cheaper<00:00:31.830> than<00:00:32.790> going<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:34.730> a

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
one it's a lot cheaper than going to a

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.410 
one it's a lot cheaper than going to a
salon<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:37.219> the<00:00:38.219> other<00:00:38.370> reason<00:00:38.910> would<00:00:39.210> be

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
salon and the other reason would be

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.619 
salon and the other reason would be
because<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:40.530> kind<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.460> hate<00:00:41.790> going<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.390> salon

just reading through the instruction

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.420 
just reading through the instruction
manual<00:04:26.530> here<00:04:27.600> it'll<00:04:28.950> come<00:04:29.950> like<00:04:30.130> they<00:04:30.250> also

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
manual here it'll come like they also

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
applying here dye and I think it was

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.710 
applying here dye and I think it was
only<00:04:36.250> like<00:04:36.460> a<00:04:36.520> couple<00:04:36.610> dollars<00:04:36.940> or<00:04:37.330> something

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720
