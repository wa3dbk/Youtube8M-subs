as<00:01:56.539> a<00:01:56.570> bioengineer<00:01:57.530> now<00:01:58.009> for<00:01:58.250> over<00:01:58.310> 25<00:01:58.850> years

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
as a bioengineer now for over 25 years

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.060 
as a bioengineer now for over 25 years
that<00:01:59.390> he<00:01:59.509> died<00:01:59.720> and<00:02:00.140> started<00:02:00.590> working<00:02:00.830> in

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
that he died and started working in

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.219 
that he died and started working in
artificial<00:02:01.369> heart<00:02:01.759> valves<00:02:02.180> and<00:02:02.600> moved<00:02:02.899> on<00:02:03.110> to

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
artificial heart valves and moved on to

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.139 
artificial heart valves and moved on to
working<00:02:03.470> in<00:02:03.710> artificial<00:02:04.310> hip<00:02:04.460> joints<00:02:04.909> and

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
working in artificial hip joints and

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.029 
working in artificial hip joints and
then<00:02:05.929> they'll<00:02:06.080> then<00:02:06.350> in<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.590> last<00:02:06.770> 10<00:02:07.009> years

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
then they'll then in the last 10 years

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:08.969 
then they'll then in the last 10 years
we<00:02:07.520> started<00:02:07.970> look<00:02:08.209> at<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.720> biological

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
we started look at the biological

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.860 
we started look at the biological
scaffolds<00:02:09.979> tissue<00:02:10.700> regeneration<00:02:10.970> a

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
scaffolds tissue regeneration a

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.050 
scaffolds tissue regeneration a
biological<00:02:12.800> scaffold<00:02:13.310> is<00:02:13.489> a<00:02:13.519> structure<00:02:13.970> we

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
biological scaffold is a structure we

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.930 
biological scaffold is a structure we
can<00:02:14.209> put<00:02:14.330> into<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.630> body<00:02:14.780> which<00:02:15.019> helps<00:02:15.260> the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
can put into the body which helps the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.580 
can put into the body which helps the

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
tissue repairing generates itself with

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.680 
tissue repairing generates itself with
the<00:02:18.680> patient's<00:02:19.069> own<00:02:19.160> cells<00:02:19.519> the<00:02:20.330> unique

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
the patient's own cells the unique

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.300 
the patient's own cells the unique
feature<00:02:21.050> about<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.680> tissue<00:02:21.950> regeneration

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
feature about the tissue regeneration

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.940 
feature about the tissue regeneration
biological<00:02:23.090> scaffolds<00:02:23.720> is<00:02:23.840> that<00:02:24.380> it<00:02:24.590> has<00:02:24.769> the

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
biological scaffolds is that it has the

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.699 
biological scaffolds is that it has the
architecture<00:02:25.130> of<00:02:25.700> natural<00:02:26.569> tissue<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:27.170> so

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
architecture of natural tissue and so

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.740 
architecture of natural tissue and so
that<00:02:27.920> provides<00:02:28.100> a<00:02:28.400> right<00:02:28.610> environment<00:02:29.180> for

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
that provides a right environment for

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.070 
that provides a right environment for
the<00:02:29.930> cells<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.470> regenerate<00:02:31.269> the<00:02:32.269> novelty<00:02:32.750> is

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
the cells to regenerate the novelty is

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.900 
the cells to regenerate the novelty is
is<00:02:33.440> that<00:02:33.709> it<00:02:33.860> is<00:02:34.069> essentially<00:02:34.549> reversed

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
is that it is essentially reversed

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.630 
is that it is essentially reversed
engineered<00:02:35.090> so<00:02:36.079> we<00:02:36.200> start<00:02:36.530> off<00:02:36.769> with<00:02:37.280> animal

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
engineered so we start off with animal

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.600 
engineered so we start off with animal
tissue<00:02:37.850> and<00:02:38.299> we<00:02:38.959> remove<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.739> cells<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.370> the

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
tissue and we remove the cells and the

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.960 
tissue and we remove the cells and the
DNA<00:02:41.150> from<00:02:41.480> it<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:42.190> we're<00:02:43.190> left<00:02:43.400> with<00:02:43.640> is<00:02:43.790> the

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
DNA from it and we're left with is the

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.090 
DNA from it and we're left with is the
tissues<00:02:44.420> architecture<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.560> natural<00:02:45.890> tissue

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
tissues architecture the natural tissue

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.539 
tissues architecture the natural tissue
architecture<00:02:47.470> what's<00:02:48.470> unique<00:02:48.859> about<00:02:49.010> the

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
architecture what's unique about the

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.960 
architecture what's unique about the
tissue<00:02:50.090> genex<00:02:50.600> process<00:02:51.019> is<00:02:51.200> that<00:02:51.500> we<00:02:52.459> derive

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
tissue genex process is that we derive

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.360 
tissue genex process is that we derive
it<00:02:53.209> from<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:54.049> tissue<00:02:54.440> that<00:02:54.620> were<00:02:54.859> wanting<00:02:55.250> to

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
it from the tissue that were wanting to

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.789 
it from the tissue that were wanting to
treat<00:02:55.579> so<00:02:56.359> let's<00:02:56.720> say<00:02:56.930> we're<00:02:57.200> going<00:02:57.440> to

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
treat so let's say we're going to

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.490 
treat so let's say we're going to
prepare<00:02:58.670> our<00:02:59.060> hearts<00:02:59.120> off<00:02:59.540> so<00:02:59.840> we<00:02:59.959> start<00:03:00.230> with

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
prepare our hearts off so we start with

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.370 
prepare our hearts off so we start with
an<00:03:00.829> aortic<00:03:01.160> valve<00:03:01.549> on<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.850> pig<00:03:02.060> we<00:03:02.870> put<00:03:03.260> it

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
an aortic valve on the pig we put it

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.410 
an aortic valve on the pig we put it
through<00:03:03.410> a<00:03:03.620> series<00:03:03.920> of<00:03:03.950> washes<00:03:04.459> which<00:03:05.000> remove

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
through a series of washes which remove

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.830 
through a series of washes which remove
the<00:03:05.600> cells<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.290> then<00:03:06.890> take<00:03:07.160> out<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.430> DNA<00:03:07.840> from

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
the cells and then take out the DNA from

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.920 
the cells and then take out the DNA from
the<00:03:09.019> tissue<00:03:09.200> and<00:03:09.680> then<00:03:10.549> essentially<00:03:11.390> that<00:03:11.750> is

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
the tissue and then essentially that is

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.280 
the tissue and then essentially that is
then<00:03:12.170> packaged<00:03:12.680> as<00:03:12.890> a<00:03:13.640> d-cell<00:03:14.570> biological

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
then packaged as a d-cell biological

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.500 
then packaged as a d-cell biological
scaffold

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
scaffold

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.650 
scaffold
we<00:03:17.260> know<00:03:17.410> it's<00:03:17.560> a<00:03:17.620> safe<00:03:17.830> product<00:03:18.160> we've<00:03:18.879> shown

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
we know it's a safe product we've shown

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.350 
we know it's a safe product we've shown
it<00:03:19.840> works<00:03:20.459> then<00:03:21.459> the<00:03:21.610> next<00:03:21.970> thing<00:03:22.150> would<00:03:22.300> be

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
it works then the next thing would be

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.800 
it works then the next thing would be
really<00:03:22.780> to<00:03:23.709> create<00:03:24.190> a<00:03:24.370> way<00:03:24.670> of<00:03:24.879> delivering<00:03:25.540> mr.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
really to create a way of delivering mr.

we've got with tissue eugenics

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.680 
we've got with tissue eugenics
particularly<00:03:38.739> for<00:03:38.860> the<00:03:38.920> NHS<00:03:39.459> so<00:03:40.209> it<00:03:40.269> does<00:03:40.450> me

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
particularly for the NHS so it does me
