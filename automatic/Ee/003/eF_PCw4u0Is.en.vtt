00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
releases so there are still hope for

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.280 
releases so there are still hope for
movie<00:01:37.979> characters<00:01:38.990> considering<00:01:39.990> movie

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290

characters<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.860> mean<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.039> would<00:02:08.310> be<00:02:08.640> excited<00:02:09.000> to

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
characters I mean I would be excited to

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.910 
characters I mean I would be excited to
see<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.869> few<00:02:10.530> more<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.830> them<00:02:11.009> I

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
see a few more of them I

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.280 
see a few more of them I
regarding<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.300> main<00:02:15.300> character<00:02:15.989> saga

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
regarding the main character saga

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.809 
regarding the main character saga
character<00:02:16.860> list<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.220> seems<00:02:17.489> pretty<00:02:17.700> good

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
character list that seems pretty good

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.539 
character list that seems pretty good
right<00:02:18.720> at<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.930> moment<00:02:19.049> but<00:02:19.549> definitely

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
right at the moment but definitely

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.780 
right at the moment but definitely
having<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.180> battle<00:02:22.080> of<00:02:22.379> gods<00:02:22.680> cast<00:02:23.220> in<00:02:23.580> this

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
having a battle of gods cast in this

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.839 
having a battle of gods cast in this
game<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:25.019> me<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.470> makes<00:02:25.620> me<00:02:25.890> feel<00:02:26.099> hopeful<00:02:26.580> for

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
game to me it makes me feel hopeful for

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.259 
game to me it makes me feel hopeful for
any<00:02:27.209> other<00:02:27.840> sort<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.680> movie<00:02:29.670> characters<00:02:30.150> that

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
any other sort of movie characters that

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.500 
any other sort of movie characters that
have<00:02:30.390> been<00:02:30.540> left<00:02:30.720> out<00:02:30.959> in<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.110> past<00:02:31.790> ie<00:02:32.790> elbow

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
have been left out in the past ie elbow

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.600 
have been left out in the past ie elbow
and<00:02:33.720> Carol<00:02:34.319> I<00:02:34.410> think<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.739> is<00:02:34.769> and<00:02:35.129> even<00:02:35.340> their

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
and Carol I think it is and even their

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.050 
and Carol I think it is and even their
fusion<00:02:35.879> that<00:02:36.540> would<00:02:36.660> be<00:02:36.780> pretty<00:02:36.930> cool<00:02:37.049> to<00:02:37.260> see

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
fusion that would be pretty cool to see

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.460 
fusion that would be pretty cool to see
so<00:02:39.230> we<00:02:40.230> speak<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:41.360> character<00:02:42.360> who<00:02:42.569> wields<00:02:43.319> a

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
so we speak a character who wields a

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.650 
so we speak a character who wields a
staffed<00:02:43.860> sort<00:02:44.519> of<00:02:44.640> like<00:02:44.819> trunks<00:02:45.329> and<00:02:45.480> his

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
staffed sort of like trunks and his

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.729 
staffed sort of like trunks and his
sword<00:02:46.019> we<00:02:46.560> haven't<00:02:46.739> really<00:02:46.890> seen<00:02:47.280> much<00:02:48.269> of<00:02:48.739> any

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
sword we haven't really seen much of any

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.920 
sword we haven't really seen much of any
character<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.609> uses<00:02:51.120> anything<00:02:51.569> apart<00:02:51.900> from

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
character that uses anything apart from

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.520 
character that uses anything apart from
their<00:02:52.170> fists<00:02:52.650> i<00:02:52.829> can<00:02:53.640> assume<00:02:53.760> that<00:02:54.030> we<00:02:54.599> in<00:02:54.959> the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
their fists i can assume that we in the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.880 
their fists i can assume that we in the
movie<00:02:55.950> would<00:02:56.400> actually<00:02:57.359> do<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.540> fist<00:02:58.319> fight<00:02:58.590> he

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
movie would actually do a fist fight he

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.500 
movie would actually do a fist fight he
probably<00:02:59.250> wouldn't<00:02:59.579> necessarily<00:02:59.760> use<00:03:00.209> his

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
probably wouldn't necessarily use his

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.539 
probably wouldn't necessarily use his
scepter<00:03:00.930> his<00:03:01.410> scepters<00:03:01.799> probably<00:03:02.129> just<00:03:02.310> sort

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
scepter his scepters probably just sort

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.449 
scepter his scepters probably just sort
of<00:03:02.609> like<00:03:02.790> there<00:03:03.750> is<00:03:03.930> an<00:03:04.079> accessory<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.829> kind<00:03:05.340> of

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
of like there is an accessory to kind of

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.699 
of like there is an accessory to kind of
like<00:03:05.670> show<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.180> he<00:03:06.359> is<00:03:06.390> sort<00:03:06.810> of<00:03:06.900> then<00:03:07.140> I'd

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
like show that he is sort of then I'd

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.180 
like show that he is sort of then I'd
know<00:03:08.069> a<00:03:08.280> higher-up<00:03:08.760> figurer<00:03:09.480> like<00:03:10.079> a<00:03:10.129> sort<00:03:11.129> of

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
know a higher-up figurer like a sort of

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.330 
know a higher-up figurer like a sort of
godly<00:03:11.959> sort<00:03:12.959> of<00:03:13.079> not<00:03:13.560> godly<00:03:13.829> but<00:03:14.129> you<00:03:14.220> know

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
godly sort of not godly but you know

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.839 
godly sort of not godly but you know
like<00:03:14.519> King<00:03:14.910> like<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.810> things<00:03:16.109> like<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.349> so

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
like King like and things like that so

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.400 
like King like and things like that so
maybe<00:03:17.849> it'll<00:03:18.120> sort<00:03:18.329> of<00:03:18.419> be<00:03:18.510> like<00:03:18.690> how<00:03:18.900> trunks

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
maybe it'll sort of be like how trunks

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.830 
maybe it'll sort of be like how trunks
had<00:03:19.560> his<00:03:19.709> sword<00:03:20.069> and<00:03:20.370> if<00:03:21.120> they<00:03:21.480> bring<00:03:21.810> back

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
had his sword and if they bring back

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.349 
had his sword and if they bring back
some<00:03:22.380> sort<00:03:22.680> of<00:03:22.799> signature<00:03:23.549> move<00:03:23.849> you<00:03:24.120> know<00:03:24.209> how

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
some sort of signature move you know how

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.020 
some sort of signature move you know how
trunks<00:03:25.290> would<00:03:25.410> use<00:03:25.590> his<00:03:25.709> sword<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.310> then<00:03:26.910> you

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
trunks would use his sword and then you

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.400 
trunks would use his sword and then you
put<00:03:27.209> it<00:03:27.299> away<00:03:27.389> and<00:03:27.630> then<00:03:27.750> it<00:03:27.959> would<00:03:28.079> be<00:03:28.169> back<00:03:28.319> to

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
put it away and then it would be back to

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.960 
put it away and then it would be back to
fighting<00:03:28.620> maybe<00:03:29.010> maybe<00:03:29.370> we'll<00:03:29.609> see<00:03:29.730> something

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
fighting maybe maybe we'll see something

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.720 
fighting maybe maybe we'll see something
like<00:03:30.120> that<00:03:30.419> I<00:03:30.690> mean<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.769> last<00:03:32.010> character<00:03:32.280> to

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
like that I mean the last character to

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.809 
like that I mean the last character to
actually<00:03:33.239> use<00:03:33.780> a<00:03:34.139> weapon<00:03:34.769> besides<00:03:35.220> their<00:03:35.459> fist

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
actually use a weapon besides their fist

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.050 
actually use a weapon besides their fist
was<00:03:36.090> I<00:03:36.150> believe<00:03:36.660> taffie<00:03:37.169> on<00:03:37.319> in<00:03:38.060> budokai

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
was I believe taffie on in budokai

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.629 
was I believe taffie on in budokai
tenkaichi<00:03:39.540> 3<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:39.900> think<00:03:40.230> all<00:03:40.680> with<00:03:40.980> his<00:03:41.190> like

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
tenkaichi 3 I think all with his like

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.720 
tenkaichi 3 I think all with his like
square<00:03:42.239> punching<00:03:42.810> moves<00:03:43.049> used<00:03:43.739> his<00:03:43.950> sword<00:03:44.250> so

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
square punching moves used his sword so

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.620 
square punching moves used his sword so
who<00:03:44.880> knows<00:03:45.000> maybe<00:03:45.299> we'll<00:03:45.540> see<00:03:45.810> a<00:03:46.019> return<00:03:46.260> of

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
who knows maybe we'll see a return of

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.300 
who knows maybe we'll see a return of
someone<00:03:48.630> fighting<00:03:48.959> with<00:03:49.349> something<00:03:50.280> that

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
someone fighting with something that

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.030 
someone fighting with something that
isn't<00:03:50.880> necessarily<00:03:51.299> their<00:03:51.599> fists<00:03:52.049> that<00:03:52.919> would

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
isn't necessarily their fists that would

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.640 
isn't necessarily their fists that would
be<00:03:53.130> kind<00:03:53.340> of<00:03:53.430> cool<00:03:53.489> to<00:03:53.639> see<00:03:53.880> I<00:03:53.910> mean<00:03:54.440> like<00:03:55.440> I

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
be kind of cool to see I mean like I

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.770 
be kind of cool to see I mean like I
know<00:03:55.769> unless<00:03:56.459> they<00:03:56.639> have<00:03:56.760> a<00:03:56.790> reason<00:03:57.269> to<00:03:57.389> use<00:03:57.599> it

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
know unless they have a reason to use it

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.960 
know unless they have a reason to use it
they<00:03:57.959> probably<00:03:58.349> won't<00:03:58.709> but<00:03:59.069> I<00:03:59.340> know<00:03:59.639> I<00:03:59.760> think

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
they probably won't but I know I think

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.550 
they probably won't but I know I think
it<00:04:00.060> would<00:04:00.150> be<00:04:00.239> different<00:04:00.450> to<00:04:00.660> see<00:04:00.900> maybe

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
it would be different to see maybe

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.039 
it would be different to see maybe
another<00:04:01.950> character<00:04:02.579> that<00:04:02.849> doesn't<00:04:03.840> fight

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
another character that doesn't fight

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.670 
another character that doesn't fight
with<00:04:04.290> these<00:04:04.470> fists<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.579> uses<00:04:06.569> the<00:04:07.019> scepter<00:04:07.470> as

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
with these fists and uses the scepter as

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.300 
with these fists and uses the scepter as
such<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.569> beat<00:04:09.569> the<00:04:09.720> crap<00:04:09.900> out<00:04:10.139> of<00:04:10.169> like<00:04:10.530> an<00:04:11.010> oak

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
such to beat the crap out of like an oak

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.520 
such to beat the crap out of like an oak
Crillon<00:04:11.790> maybe<00:04:12.209> but<00:04:12.780> yeah<00:04:12.870> I<00:04:12.900> just<00:04:13.199> think<00:04:13.470> that

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
Crillon maybe but yeah I just think that

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.080 
Crillon maybe but yeah I just think that
would<00:04:13.650> be<00:04:13.739> interesting<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.280> see<00:04:14.519> if<00:04:14.730> they

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
would be interesting to see if they

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.729 
would be interesting to see if they
don't<00:04:15.389> put<00:04:15.599> tapi<00:04:15.930> on<00:04:16.049> in<00:04:16.229> that<00:04:16.440> they<00:04:16.560> could

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
don't put tapi on in that they could

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.330 
don't put tapi on in that they could
even<00:04:16.889> put<00:04:17.250> give<00:04:17.970> a<00:04:18.209> note<00:04:18.630> weise<00:04:19.349> the<00:04:19.829> ability

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
even put give a note weise the ability

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.790 
even put give a note weise the ability
to<00:04:20.459> hit<00:04:20.909> with<00:04:21.060> his<00:04:21.150> scepter<00:04:21.659> I<00:04:21.900> know<00:04:22.320> it's<00:04:22.500> it's

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
to hit with his scepter I know it's it's

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.219 
to hit with his scepter I know it's it's
weirding<00:04:23.340> games<00:04:23.580> when<00:04:23.849> they<00:04:24.030> give<00:04:24.330> or<00:04:24.960> when

weirding games when they give or when

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.300 
weirding games when they give or when
they<00:04:25.349> show<00:04:25.560> for

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
they show for

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.610

of<00:04:26.490> a<00:04:26.610> character<00:04:26.940> that<00:04:27.090> has<00:04:27.389> like<00:04:27.690> a<00:04:27.900> scepter

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
of a character that has like a scepter

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.909 
of a character that has like a scepter
or<00:04:28.889> a<00:04:28.950> sword<00:04:29.370> or<00:04:29.580> a<00:04:29.760> rod<00:04:30.060> but<00:04:30.720> yet<00:04:31.080> they<00:04:31.350> they

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
or a sword or a rod but yet they they

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.790 
or a sword or a rod but yet they they
never<00:04:32.130> use<00:04:32.370> it<00:04:32.400> so<00:04:32.940> hopefully<00:04:33.470> one<00:04:34.470> way<00:04:34.620> or

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
never use it so hopefully one way or

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.320 
never use it so hopefully one way or
another<00:04:34.830> we<00:04:35.280> susceptor<00:04:35.940> is<00:04:36.060> somehow

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
another we susceptor is somehow

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.530 
another we susceptor is somehow
integrated<00:04:37.020> into<00:04:37.950> his<00:04:38.100> moveset<00:04:38.370> I<00:04:38.910> think<00:04:39.450> that

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
integrated into his moveset I think that

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.690 
integrated into his moveset I think that
would<00:04:39.660> be<00:04:39.750> pretty<00:04:39.900> cool<00:04:40.400> so<00:04:41.400> yeah<00:04:41.550> I<00:04:41.580> think

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
would be pretty cool so yeah I think

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.280 
would be pretty cool so yeah I think
that's<00:04:42.000> pretty<00:04:42.150> much<00:04:42.330> it<00:04:42.540> Reese<00:04:42.900> is<00:04:43.080> being

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
that's pretty much it Reese is being

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.710 
that's pretty much it Reese is being
confirmed<00:04:43.770> so<00:04:44.250> that's<00:04:45.150> pretty<00:04:45.360> cool<00:04:45.450> we've

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
confirmed so that's pretty cool we've

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.400 
confirmed so that's pretty cool we've
got<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:45.960> battle<00:04:46.200> of<00:04:46.260> gods<00:04:46.470> cast<00:04:46.830> as<00:04:48.169> a<00:04:49.169> as
