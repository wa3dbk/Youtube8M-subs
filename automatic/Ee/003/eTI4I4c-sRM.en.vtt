00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.310 
don't really think it's neon I don't
know<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:20.189> kind<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.490> see<00:00:20.670> there<00:00:20.910> it's<00:00:21.810> dusty<00:00:22.289> I

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
know and kind of see there it's dusty I

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.990 
know and kind of see there it's dusty I
haven't<00:00:22.710> used<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.220> really<00:00:23.550> long<00:00:23.730> time

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
haven't used it in a really long time

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.820 
haven't used it in a really long time
because<00:00:24.210> it's<00:00:24.480> quite<00:00:24.750> fragile

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
because it's quite fragile

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.120 
because it's quite fragile
I<00:00:25.859> remember<00:00:26.699> getting<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:27.150> when<00:00:28.130> Walmart

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
I remember getting this when Walmart

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.209 
I remember getting this when Walmart
didn't<00:00:29.880> have<00:00:30.060> super<00:00:30.539> stores<00:00:30.869> yet<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:32.130> was

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
didn't have super stores yet and it was

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.830 
didn't have super stores yet and it was
in<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.489> old<00:00:32.669> Walmart<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.390> was<00:00:33.480> quite

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
in the old Walmart and it was quite

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.110 
in the old Walmart and it was quite
interesting<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.590> see<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.250> there<00:00:35.850> are<00:00:35.969> many

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
interesting to see this there are many

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.240 
interesting to see this there are many
different<00:00:36.510> shapes<00:00:36.809> but<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.680> thought<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.040> one

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
different shapes but I thought this one

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.799 
different shapes but I thought this one
was<00:00:38.280> neat<00:00:38.640> because<00:00:38.879> my<00:00:39.090> favorite<00:00:39.420> color<00:00:39.629> at

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
was neat because my favorite color at

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.910 
was neat because my favorite color at
the<00:00:39.899> time<00:00:40.110> was<00:00:40.320> yellow<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.430> yellow<00:00:42.270> star

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
the time was yellow so a yellow star

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.560 
the time was yellow so a yellow star
anyway<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.129> 7<00:00:44.489> watts<00:00:45.620> 120<00:00:46.620> volt<00:00:46.829> obviously

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
anyway it's 7 watts 120 volt obviously

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.950 
anyway it's 7 watts 120 volt obviously
2004<00:00:48.570> that's<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.020> long<00:00:49.170> time<00:00:49.379> ago<00:00:52.879> so<00:00:53.879> set<00:00:54.750> down

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
2004 that's a long time ago so set down

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.959 
2004 that's a long time ago so set down
for<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> second

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
for a second

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.340 
for a second
seems<00:00:56.969> like<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.180> lot<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.539> watts<00:00:57.780> for<00:00:58.109> such<00:00:58.320> a

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
seems like a lot of watts for such a

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.139 
seems like a lot of watts for such a
small<00:00:58.680> thing<00:00:58.710> I<00:01:00.020> haven't<00:01:01.020> turned<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.320> on<00:01:01.559> in

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
small thing I haven't turned this on in

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.820 
small thing I haven't turned this on in
years<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.049> don't<00:01:04.290> know<00:01:04.470> if<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.650> works

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
years so I don't know if it works

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.780 
years so I don't know if it works
anymore<00:01:05.659> when<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.780> does<00:01:07.220> it's<00:01:08.220> not<00:01:08.310> as<00:01:08.549> bright

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
anymore when it does it's not as bright

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.870 
anymore when it does it's not as bright
as<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.000> semi<00:01:09.210> bob<00:01:09.450> bulb<00:01:09.750> at<00:01:09.990> all<00:01:10.520> it's<00:01:11.520> actually
