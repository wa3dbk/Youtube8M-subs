00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 
this car on eBay you can tell the engine

this car on eBay you can tell the engine
won't<00:00:27.919> wait<00:00:28.160> but<00:00:28.369> at<00:00:28.460> least<00:00:28.579> it<00:00:28.849> sounded<00:00:29.210> ok

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
won't wait but at least it sounded ok

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.569 
won't wait but at least it sounded ok
the<00:00:30.200> ride<00:00:30.380> home<00:00:30.649> was<00:00:30.800> about<00:00:31.009> a<00:00:31.040> hundred<00:00:31.250> miles

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
the ride home was about a hundred miles

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.060 
the ride home was about a hundred miles
and<00:00:31.910> all<00:00:32.059> the<00:00:32.180> way<00:00:32.329> the<00:00:32.870> exhaust<00:00:33.230> leak<00:00:33.500> started

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
and all the way the exhaust leak started

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.310 
and all the way the exhaust leak started
and<00:00:34.520> now<00:00:34.700> just<00:00:34.969> a<00:00:35.059> couple<00:00:35.210> weeks<00:00:35.510> later<00:00:35.690> this

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
and now just a couple weeks later this

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:43.340 
and now just a couple weeks later this
is<00:00:36.500> what<00:00:36.710> you<00:00:36.860> get

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.479 

so<00:00:44.350> he<00:00:44.440> goes<00:00:44.620> to<00:00:44.680> the<00:00:44.860> top<00:00:45.160> of<00:00:45.340> the<00:00:45.399> list

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
so he goes to the top of the list

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.360 
so he goes to the top of the list
the<00:00:47.450> solution<00:00:48.050> at<00:00:48.230> least<00:00:48.260> for<00:00:48.649> me<00:00:48.829> is<00:00:49.100> to

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
the solution at least for me is to

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.100 
the solution at least for me is to
install<00:00:49.730> a<00:00:49.760> set<00:00:50.030> of<00:00:50.059> stage<00:00:50.390> 8<00:00:50.660> header<00:00:50.899> bolts

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
install a set of stage 8 header bolts

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.200 
install a set of stage 8 header bolts
they<00:00:51.680> lock<00:00:51.949> in<00:00:52.160> place<00:00:52.340> so<00:00:52.610> once<00:00:52.850> you<00:00:53.000> get<00:00:53.120> them

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
they lock in place so once you get them

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.270 
they lock in place so once you get them
installed<00:00:53.570> and<00:00:54.199> not<00:00:54.470> going<00:00:54.649> to<00:00:54.710> back<00:00:54.890> off<00:00:54.920> the

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
installed and not going to back off the

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.200 
installed and not going to back off the
beer<00:00:57.010> step<00:00:58.010> one<00:00:58.250> is<00:00:58.399> to<00:00:58.489> get<00:00:58.610> the<00:00:58.699> old<00:00:58.879> headers

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
beer step one is to get the old headers

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.939 
beer step one is to get the old headers
off<00:00:59.390> and<00:00:59.629> make<00:00:59.809> sure<00:01:00.050> that<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.410> source<00:01:00.680> of<00:01:00.860> the

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
off and make sure that the source of the

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:02.860 
off and make sure that the source of the
leak<00:01:01.100> isn't<00:01:01.640> a<00:01:01.699> cracked<00:01:01.969> header<00:01:02.180> flange<00:01:02.480> or<00:01:02.839> a

leak isn't a cracked header flange or a

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.740 
leak isn't a cracked header flange or a
broken<00:01:03.290> wheel<00:01:06.670> we're<00:01:07.670> lucky<00:01:08.000> in<00:01:08.240> this<00:01:08.509> case

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
broken wheel we're lucky in this case

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.540 
broken wheel we're lucky in this case
those<00:01:08.960> grungy<00:01:09.380> headers<00:01:09.649> may<00:01:09.800> be<00:01:09.860> ugly<00:01:10.100> but

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
those grungy headers may be ugly but

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.639 
those grungy headers may be ugly but
they're<00:01:10.729> still<00:01:10.940> good<00:01:11.240> it's<00:01:11.810> just<00:01:12.080> a<00:01:12.170> couple<00:01:12.409> of

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.770 
on the threads and run the rest of the
fasteners<00:02:01.159> in<00:02:01.280> place<00:02:01.329> bolting<00:02:02.329> the<00:02:02.390> header<00:02:02.600> up

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
fasteners in place bolting the header up

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:12.300 
fasteners in place bolting the header up
tight<00:02:03.079> in<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.350> process

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.800 

once<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.430> header<00:02:13.579> bolts<00:02:13.760> are<00:02:14.000> on<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.480> next

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
once the header bolts are on the next

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.780 
once the header bolts are on the next
step<00:02:15.019> is<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.290> install<00:02:15.409> the<00:02:15.650> retainer<00:02:16.129> there's

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
step is to install the retainer there's

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.670 
step is to install the retainer there's
a<00:02:16.879> semicircular<00:02:17.390> notch<00:02:17.900> cut<00:02:18.290> out<00:02:18.409> of<00:02:18.530> each

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
a semicircular notch cut out of each

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.589 
a semicircular notch cut out of each
then<00:02:19.099> creates<00:02:19.400> clearance<00:02:19.909> for<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.150> header<00:02:20.359> to

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
then creates clearance for the header to

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.780 
then creates clearance for the header to
now<00:02:21.379> the<00:02:21.439> header<00:02:21.680> bolt<00:02:21.890> can't<00:02:22.159> rotate<00:02:22.400> because

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
now the header bolt can't rotate because

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.149 
now the header bolt can't rotate because
the<00:02:23.030> retainer<00:02:23.420> will<00:02:23.629> hit<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.900> tube<00:02:24.140> once<00:02:25.040> the

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
the retainer will hit the tube once the

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:26.860 
the retainer will hit the tube once the
retainer<00:02:25.489> is<00:02:25.670> on<00:02:25.819> pop<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.269> spring<00:02:26.569> clip<00:02:26.840> and

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
retainer is on pop the spring clip and

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.539 
retainer is on pop the spring clip and
the<00:02:27.230> machine<00:02:27.590> groove<00:02:27.920> on<00:02:28.099> the<00:02:28.219> head<00:02:28.370> of<00:02:28.459> the

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
the machine groove on the head of the

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:29.800 
the machine groove on the head of the
boat<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:29.000> you're<00:02:29.120> all<00:02:29.239> set

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
boat and you're all set

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.080 
boat and you're all set
in<00:02:30.769> some<00:02:30.980> places<00:02:31.219> you<00:02:31.400> may<00:02:31.609> find<00:02:31.819> that<00:02:31.909> the

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
in some places you may find that the

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.720 
in some places you may find that the
header<00:02:32.299> tube<00:02:32.540> is<00:02:32.659> too<00:02:32.810> close<00:02:33.049> to<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.379> boat

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
header tube is too close to the boat

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.399 
header tube is too close to the boat
this<00:02:34.730> situation<00:02:35.420> it's<00:02:35.599> okay<00:02:35.719> to<00:02:35.930> grind<00:02:36.290> some

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
this situation it's okay to grind some
