GT online several occasions a lot of
people<00:00:24.300> only<00:00:24.600> know<00:00:24.720> one<00:00:25.019> location<00:00:25.650> where<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
people only know one location where the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.769 
people only know one location where the
spawns<00:00:26.310> at<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.580> top<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.000> map<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.359> it's

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
spawns at the top of the map and it's

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.269 
spawns at the top of the map and it's
probably<00:00:28.140> one<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.349> slowest<00:00:28.740> vehicles<00:00:29.130> in

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
probably one of the slowest vehicles in

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.490 
probably one of the slowest vehicles in
the<00:00:29.429> games<00:00:29.699> it's<00:00:29.970> not<00:00:30.060> very<00:00:30.240> helpful<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:31.080> have

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
the games it's not very helpful to have

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.620 
the games it's not very helpful to have
a<00:00:31.529> vehicle<00:00:31.830> that's<00:00:32.279> only<00:00:32.489> known<00:00:32.820> in<00:00:33.059> one<00:00:33.270> spot

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
a vehicle that's only known in one spot

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.060 
a vehicle that's only known in one spot
so<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:33.989> video<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.350> hopefully<00:00:34.739> going<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.920> show

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
so this video is hopefully going to show

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.760 
so this video is hopefully going to show
you<00:00:35.160> several<00:00:35.399> locations<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.690> can<00:00:37.050> use<00:00:37.590> it

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
you several locations so you can use it

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.350 
you several locations so you can use it
in<00:00:37.890> locations<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.700> want<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.000> use<00:00:39.210> that

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
in locations that you want to use that

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.910 
in locations that you want to use that
happen<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.660> drag<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.020> all<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.559> way<00:00:40.649> across

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
happen to drag it all the way across

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.770 
happen to drag it all the way across
their<00:00:41.250> map<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.030> one<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.270> my<00:00:42.360> favorite

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
their map so this is one of my favorite

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.810 
their map so this is one of my favorite
vehicles<00:00:42.989> because<00:00:43.469> it's<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:43.860> much<00:00:44.100> fun<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.579> use

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
vehicles because it's so much fun to use

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.760 
vehicles because it's so much fun to use
and<00:00:44.940> there's<00:00:45.570> one<00:00:45.809> location<00:00:46.140> you'll<00:00:46.379> find<00:00:46.620> it

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
and there's one location you'll find it

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.069 
and there's one location you'll find it
is<00:00:46.860> paleto<00:00:47.399> Bay<00:00:47.430> area<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.809> very

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
is paleto Bay area and this is the very

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.750 
is paleto Bay area and this is the very
very<00:00:49.260> north<00:00:49.440> point<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.070> map<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:50.520> in<00:00:50.640> this

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
very north point of the map it's in this

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.209 
very north point of the map it's in this
kind<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.059> construction<00:00:51.930> area<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.800> you'll

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
kind of construction area and you'll

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.490 
kind of construction area and you'll
find<00:00:53.489> even<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.090> spot<00:00:54.420> or<00:00:54.629> maybe<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.170> spot

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
find even this spot or maybe the spot

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.479 
find even this spot or maybe the spot
over<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.039> right

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
over to the right

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.920 
over to the right
it's<00:00:56.760> just<00:00:56.910> kind<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.120> like<00:00:57.239> one<00:00:57.480> block<00:00:57.750> over

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
it's just kind of like one block over

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.139 
it's just kind of like one block over
and<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.530> might<00:00:58.739> find<00:00:59.070> one<00:00:59.309> line<00:00:59.550> around<00:00:59.879> there

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
and you might find one line around there

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.420 
and you might find one line around there
and<00:01:00.390> then<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.809> second<00:01:01.109> location<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.890> at<00:01:02.309> this

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
and then the second location is at this

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.939 
and then the second location is at this
excavation<00:01:03.239> site<00:01:03.480> or<00:01:03.629> quarry<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.589> center

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
excavation site or quarry in the center

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.770 
excavation site or quarry in the center
of<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.189> spiral<00:01:05.549> shape<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.360> can<00:01:06.510> see

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.359 
of this spiral shape that you can see
here<00:01:07.049> on<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.380> map<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.799> it's<00:01:08.159> funny<00:01:08.310> because

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
here on the map and it's funny because

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.160 
here on the map and it's funny because
in<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.790> quarry<00:01:09.119> air<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.630> construction

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
in this quarry air the construction

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.780 
in this quarry air the construction
workers<00:01:10.560> will<00:01:10.710> actually<00:01:10.979> try<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.220> fight<00:01:11.580> you

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.490 
several of them you might find three or
four<00:01:32.189> at<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.549> time<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.990> spot<00:01:34.320> that's

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
four at a time and this is a spot that's

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.810 
four at a time and this is a spot that's
probably<00:01:34.829> going<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.009> be<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.159> lot<00:01:35.400> more<00:01:35.549> useful

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
probably going to be a lot more useful

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.760 
probably going to be a lot more useful
to<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.270> seeing<00:01:36.509> as<00:01:36.659> everything<00:01:37.110> tends<00:01:37.650> to

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
to you seeing as everything tends to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.490 
to you seeing as everything tends to
happen<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.610> center<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.270> map<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.659> more

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
happen in the center of the map and more

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.289 
happen in the center of the map and more
towards<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.979> city<00:01:41.250> area<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.790> it's<00:01:41.909> very<00:01:41.939> kind

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
towards the city area and it's very kind

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.149 
towards the city area and it's very kind
of<00:01:42.390> out<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.990> way<00:01:43.170> it's<00:01:43.409> very<00:01:43.470> difficult<00:01:44.009> to

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
of out of the way it's very difficult to

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.649 
of out of the way it's very difficult to
have<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.340> drive<00:01:44.549> all<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.000> way<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.180> top<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.600> the

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
have to drive all the way to top of the

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.910 
have to drive all the way to top of the
map<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:45.990> try<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.290> bring<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.619> thing<00:01:46.860> back

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
map and try and bring this thing back

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.950 
map and try and bring this thing back
because<00:01:47.549> honestly<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.299> would<00:01:48.689> probably

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
because honestly I would probably

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.050 
because honestly I would probably
estimate<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.710> thing<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.189> take<00:01:50.490> around<00:01:50.729> 30

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
estimate this thing to take around 30

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.630 
estimate this thing to take around 30
minutes<00:01:51.750> or<00:01:51.930> maybe<00:01:52.049> an<00:01:52.320> hour<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.950> real<00:01:53.399> life

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
minutes or maybe an hour in real life

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.609 
minutes or maybe an hour in real life
time<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.060> drive<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.570> from<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.869> top<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
time to drive this from the top to the

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.560 
time to drive this from the top to the
bottom<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.369> it's<00:01:56.490> very<00:01:56.700> useful<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.090> memorize

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
bottom so it's very useful to memorize

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.510 
bottom so it's very useful to memorize
these<00:01:57.780> multiple<00:01:58.409> locations<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.280> make<00:01:59.369> sure

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
these multiple locations and make sure

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.010 
these multiple locations and make sure
you're<00:01:59.640> not<00:01:59.729> wasting<00:02:00.450> time<00:02:00.479> having<00:02:00.990> to

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
you're not wasting time having to

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.230 
you're not wasting time having to
transport<00:02:01.439> this<00:02:01.710> thing<00:02:01.920> around<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:02.430> where<00:02:03.060> you

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
transport this thing around so where you

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.090 
transport this thing around so where you
can't<00:02:03.479> put<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:03.990> your<00:02:04.110> garage<00:02:04.350> or<00:02:04.680> take<00:02:04.920> it

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
can't put this in your garage or take it

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.350 
can't put this in your garage or take it
to<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.250> paying<00:02:05.549> spree<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:05.939> case<00:02:06.180> you're

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
to a paying spree in case you're

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.359 
to a paying spree in case you're
wondering<00:02:06.540> but<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.560> best<00:02:07.740> thing<00:02:07.950> about<00:02:07.979> this

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
wondering but the best thing about this

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.550 
wondering but the best thing about this
vehicle<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:09.270> why<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.539> love<00:02:09.810> using<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.410> is

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
vehicle and why I love using it is

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.890 
vehicle and why I love using it is
probably<00:02:11.190> because<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.610> has<00:02:11.819> an<00:02:12.120> actual<00:02:12.420> fully

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
probably because it has an actual fully

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.940 
probably because it has an actual fully
functional<00:02:13.620> front

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
functional front

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.589 
functional front
loading<00:02:14.280> scoops<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:14.819> can<00:02:15.030> actually<00:02:15.330> scoop

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
loading scoops you can actually scoop

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.809 
loading scoops you can actually scoop
cars<00:02:15.959> up<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.530> can<00:02:16.770> just<00:02:16.920> drive<00:02:17.190> around<00:02:17.370> on<00:02:17.790> a

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
cars up you can just drive around on a

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.640 
cars up you can just drive around on a
complete<00:02:18.209> rampage<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.989> you<00:02:19.110> can<00:02:19.290> move<00:02:19.440> this

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
complete rampage and you can move this

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.589
