the<00:01:18.240> center<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.659> your<00:01:19.520> storages<00:01:20.520> are<00:01:20.759> more

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
the center and your storages are more

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.990 
the center and your storages are more
into<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.439> outer<00:01:23.130> layer<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.960> base<00:01:26.000> we're

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
into the outer layer of the base we're

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.420 
into the outer layer of the base we're
also<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.450> be<00:01:27.570> doing<00:01:28.009> well<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.280> that
