00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
we're moving right along it doesn't take

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.380 
we're moving right along it doesn't take
very<00:02:37.390> long<00:02:37.690> to<00:02:37.750> install<00:02:39.030> package<00:02:40.030> five<00:02:40.209> of

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
very long to install package five of

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.110 
very long to install package five of
eight<00:02:40.570> six<00:02:41.019> of<00:02:41.140> eight<00:02:41.260> now<00:02:42.130> on<00:02:42.459> I<00:02:42.730> think<00:02:42.850> it's

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
eight of eight this screen will actually

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:53.150 
eight of eight this screen will actually
go<00:02:44.800> blank<00:02:45.190> for<00:02:45.820> a<00:02:45.850> second<00:02:47.549> so<00:02:48.549> we'll<00:02:48.700> lose<00:02:48.910> that

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
planning on posting some more videos

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.680 
planning on posting some more videos
here<00:03:38.130> about<00:03:38.490> you<00:03:38.880> know<00:03:38.940> other<00:03:39.180> things<00:03:39.450> you<00:03:39.570> can

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
here about you know other things you can

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.000 
here about you know other things you can
do<00:03:39.780> with<00:03:39.930> it<00:03:40.080> like<00:03:40.230> how<00:03:40.320> to<00:03:40.380> set<00:03:40.590> up<00:03:40.620> things

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
do with it like how to set up things

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.120 
do with it like how to set up things
so<00:03:42.000> here's<00:03:42.150> package<00:03:42.450> eight<00:03:42.600> and<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:43.650> think<00:03:43.980> this

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
so here's package eight and I think this

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.340 
so here's package eight and I think this
screen<00:03:44.400> goes<00:03:44.550> blank<00:03:44.850> for<00:03:45.090> a<00:03:45.120> second<00:03:45.510> yep<00:03:45.990> there

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
screen goes blank for a second yep there

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.350 
screen goes blank for a second yep there
it<00:03:46.410> goes

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
it goes

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.190 
it goes
so<00:03:48.360> while<00:03:48.480> dating<00:03:48.870> this<00:03:50.600> he<00:03:51.600> goes<00:03:51.720> blank<00:03:51.990> for<00:03:52.140> a

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
so while dating this he goes blank for a

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.810 
so while dating this he goes blank for a
second<00:03:52.530> and<00:03:52.650> then<00:03:52.830> it<00:03:52.980> comes<00:03:53.160> back<00:03:53.220> on<00:03:55.820> and

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
second and then it comes back on and

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.120 
second and then it comes back on and
you'll<00:03:57.060> see<00:03:57.470> you<00:03:58.470> know<00:03:58.530> progress<00:03:58.740> pretty

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
and you know it definitely adds a little

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.990 
and you know it definitely adds a little
bit<00:05:24.890> more<00:05:24.980> functionality<00:05:25.430> now<00:05:25.730> I<00:05:25.760> don't<00:05:25.880> know

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
bit more functionality now I don't know

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.200 
bit more functionality now I don't know
what<00:05:26.120> this<00:05:26.210> button<00:05:26.420> does<00:05:27.220> nope<00:05:28.220> it<00:05:28.790> just<00:05:28.850> shows

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
what this button does nope it just shows

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.300

ability do that now and then after

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.910 
ability do that now and then after
you're<00:05:40.700> done<00:05:40.820> start<00:05:41.780> you<00:05:42.170> just<00:05:42.410> go<00:05:42.680> in<00:05:42.770> here

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:42.920 
you're done start you just go in here

and you remove your Intune just be stick

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.580 
and you remove your Intune just be stick
now<00:05:46.850> let's<00:05:47.030> say<00:05:47.150> you<00:05:47.720> want<00:05:47.870> to<00:05:47.900> keep<00:05:48.080> this<00:05:48.290> in

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
now let's say you want to keep this in

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.110 
now let's say you want to keep this in
case<00:05:49.130> you<00:05:49.250> have<00:05:49.340> other<00:05:49.460> upgrades<00:05:49.610> to<00:05:49.880> install

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
case you have other upgrades to install

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.900 
case you have other upgrades to install
but<00:05:50.300> it's<00:05:50.390> also<00:05:50.510> two<00:05:50.750> gig<00:05:50.900> USB<00:05:51.080> stick<00:05:51.560> so<00:05:51.950> it's

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
but it's also two gig USB stick so it's

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.340 
but it's also two gig USB stick so it's
probably<00:05:53.210> useful<00:05:53.330> for<00:05:53.600> other<00:05:53.720> stuff<00:05:53.960> even<00:05:54.230> if

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350 
probably useful for other stuff even if

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.280 
probably useful for other stuff even if
there<00:05:54.500> is<00:05:54.620> no<00:05:54.800> more<00:05:55.010> Intune<00:05:55.820> upgrades<00:05:56.290> this

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.290 
there is no more Intune upgrades this

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.930 
there is no more Intune upgrades this
one<00:05:57.500> is<00:05:57.650> supposed<00:05:57.830> to<00:05:58.190> enable<00:05:58.550> over-the-air

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
one is supposed to enable over-the-air

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.090 
one is supposed to enable over-the-air
upgrades<00:05:59.420> so<00:05:59.830> hopefully<00:06:00.830> you<00:06:00.950> will<00:06:01.040> never

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 
upgrades so hopefully you will never

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.060 
upgrades so hopefully you will never
have<00:06:01.460> to<00:06:01.610> use<00:06:01.820> the<00:06:02.090> USB<00:06:02.510> stick<00:06:02.660> to<00:06:02.960> do<00:06:03.050> it<00:06:03.170> hope

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
have to use the USB stick to do it hope

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.050 
have to use the USB stick to do it hope
everyone<00:06:04.370> finds<00:06:04.550> it<00:06:04.610> useful

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
everyone finds it useful

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.300 
everyone finds it useful
