00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
need to be answered it's like one of

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.609 
need to be answered it's like one of
those<00:01:34.740> moments<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.280> history<00:01:35.479> where<00:01:36.619> people

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
those moments in history where people

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.560 
those moments in history where people
will<00:01:37.770> talk<00:01:37.950> about<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.520> centuries<00:01:39.000> afterwards

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
will talk about the centuries afterwards

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.319 
will talk about the centuries afterwards
that<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.710> knew<00:01:40.890> someone<00:01:41.189> was<00:01:41.280> there<00:01:41.549> or<00:01:42.149> read

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.050 
pivotal moment so we got together to
talk<00:01:49.049> about<00:01:49.680> ways<00:01:49.979> we<00:01:50.040> can<00:01:50.369> do<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.729> way

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
talk about ways we can do this the way

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.600 
talk about ways we can do this the way
we<00:01:51.090> could<00:01:51.479> tell<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> decade<00:01:52.380> worth<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.979> history

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
we could tell a decade worth of history

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.990 
we could tell a decade worth of history
in<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.969> single<00:01:54.000> game<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.750> out<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.229> those

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
in a single game and out of those

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.039 
in a single game and out of those
explorations<00:01:57.000> that's<00:01:57.299> where<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.600> frame<00:01:57.840> air

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
explorations that's where the frame air

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.950 
explorations that's where the frame air
became<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.710> story<00:01:59.280> within<00:01:59.729> a<00:02:00.060> story<00:02:00.090> became<00:02:00.689> key

traveling through time we're focused on

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.140 
traveling through time we're focused on
a<00:03:14.230> more<00:03:14.620> specific<00:03:14.859> area<00:03:15.310> you<00:03:15.459> see<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:15.760> over

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
a more specific area you see it over

this<00:03:18.489> I<00:03:18.760> think<00:03:19.090> gives<00:03:19.299> it<00:03:19.480> more<00:03:19.930> depth

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670
