there and now we're going to measure out

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.559 
there and now we're going to measure out
two<00:03:11.730> cups<00:03:12.090> of<00:03:13.280> cold<00:03:14.280> water<00:03:14.519> actually<00:03:15.299> it's

two cups of cold water actually it's
it's<00:03:16.439> all<00:03:16.590> been<00:03:16.799> in<00:03:16.829> the<00:03:16.920> fridge<00:03:17.219> for<00:03:17.280> about<00:03:17.640> 10

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
it's all been in the fridge for about 10

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.099 
it's all been in the fridge for about 10
minutes<00:03:18.810> but<00:03:19.260> um<00:03:19.980> with<00:03:20.819> a<00:03:20.939> sencha<00:03:21.420> it's<00:03:21.840> really

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
minutes but um with a sencha it's really

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.770 
minutes but um with a sencha it's really
important<00:03:22.439> they<00:03:22.530> use<00:03:22.939> quality<00:03:23.939> water<00:03:24.359> sore

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
important they use quality water sore

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.479 
important they use quality water sore
today<00:03:25.049> we're<00:03:25.260> using<00:03:25.409> bottled<00:03:25.709> water<00:03:26.099> yeah

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
today we're using bottled water yeah

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.130 
today we're using bottled water yeah
that's<00:03:26.700> why<00:03:26.849> we<00:03:27.030> were<00:03:27.150> using<00:03:27.359> the<00:03:27.659> ball<00:03:27.840> dwark

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
that's why we were using the ball dwark

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.339 
that's why we were using the ball dwark
because<00:03:28.950> since<00:03:29.489> it's<00:03:29.640> cold<00:03:29.849> the<00:03:30.420> different

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
because since it's cold the different

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.610 
because since it's cold the different
kind<00:03:31.590> of<00:03:32.540> war<00:03:33.540> can<00:03:33.720> really<00:03:34.139> make<00:03:34.319> a<00:03:34.349> difference

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
kind of war can really make a difference

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:44.899 
kind of war can really make a difference
on<00:03:40.400> how<00:03:41.840> we<00:03:42.840> drink<00:03:43.230> it<00:03:43.379> there's<00:03:44.250> how<00:03:44.579> you<00:03:44.639> make

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:44.909 
on how we drink it there's how you make

00:03:44.909 --> 00:04:02.720 
on how we drink it there's how you make
I<00:03:45.180> sancha

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.009

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
second way of how to make ice center in

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.520 
second way of how to make ice center in
this<00:04:08.439> way<00:04:08.620> is<00:04:08.829> called<00:04:09.069> cold<00:04:09.459> brewing<00:04:10.170> okay<00:04:11.170> I'm

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
this way is called cold brewing okay I'm

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.069 
this way is called cold brewing okay I'm
gonna<00:04:11.680> begin<00:04:12.719> by<00:04:13.719> putting<00:04:13.930> my<00:04:14.459> cold<00:04:15.459> water

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
gonna begin by putting my cold water

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.499 
gonna begin by putting my cold water
into<00:04:17.079> the<00:04:17.320> guts<00:04:17.620> to<00:04:17.829> measure<00:04:18.039> it<00:04:18.329> yeah<00:04:19.329> he's

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:19.509 
into the guts to measure it yeah he's

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.080 
into the guts to measure it yeah he's
going<00:04:19.690> to<00:04:19.750> do<00:04:19.810> three<00:04:20.049> cups<00:04:20.380> because<00:04:20.759> I'm<00:04:21.759> gonna

put some ice in to our teapot so when
the<00:04:25.930> ice<00:04:26.050> melts<00:04:26.620> or<00:04:27.250> gets<00:04:27.669> it<00:04:28.449> because<00:04:28.990> we're

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
the ice melts or gets it because we're

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.230 
the ice melts or gets it because we're
gonna<00:04:29.289> put<00:04:29.470> it<00:04:29.560> into<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:29.979> refrigerator<00:04:30.240> it

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.809 

once<00:05:12.360> again<00:05:12.710> while<00:05:13.710> brewing<00:05:14.039> I<00:05:14.129> sancho<00:05:14.610> we're

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:14.819 
once again while brewing I sancho we're

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:17.089 
once again while brewing I sancho we're
using<00:05:15.030> bottled<00:05:15.449> water<00:05:15.870> because<00:05:16.710> you<00:05:16.919> want

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
using bottled water because you want

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:23.269 
using bottled water because you want
really<00:05:17.819> good<00:05:18.120> water<00:05:18.360> with<00:05:18.870> ice<00:05:19.050> gotcha<00:05:22.279> okay

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:23.279 
really good water with ice gotcha okay

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:31.260 
really good water with ice gotcha okay
so<00:05:23.639> I'm<00:05:23.759> gonna<00:05:23.879> pour<00:05:24.060> this<00:05:24.120> into<00:05:24.629> the

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.050 

alright<00:05:32.340> and<00:05:33.340> we're<00:05:33.460> going<00:05:33.580> to<00:05:33.610> put<00:05:33.730> this<00:05:33.850> into

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
alright and we're going to put this into

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.550 
alright and we're going to put this into
the<00:05:34.210> refrigerator<00:05:34.360> for<00:05:34.870> about<00:05:36.000> three<00:05:37.000> hours

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
the refrigerator for about three hours

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.660 
the refrigerator for about three hours
this<00:05:38.560> is<00:05:38.680> where<00:05:38.800> it<00:05:38.890> gets<00:05:38.980> a<00:05:39.100> little<00:05:39.310> tricky

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.670 
this is where it gets a little tricky

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.060 
this is where it gets a little tricky
because<00:05:39.760> there's<00:05:40.240> no<00:05:40.360> exact<00:05:40.960> set<00:05:41.320> time<00:05:41.680> for

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
because there's no exact set time for

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.400 
because there's no exact set time for
this<00:05:42.160> so<00:05:42.910> but<00:05:43.270> we<00:05:43.390> think<00:05:43.630> three<00:05:43.930> hours<00:05:44.200> will

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
this so but we think three hours will

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.600 
this so but we think three hours will
give<00:05:44.620> you<00:05:44.740> the<00:05:45.550> best<00:05:45.820> outcome<00:05:47.190> so<00:05:48.190> we're<00:05:48.490> going

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
give you the best outcome so we're going

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.310 
give you the best outcome so we're going
to<00:05:48.700> clean<00:05:48.850> up<00:05:49.000> and<00:05:49.180> we'll<00:05:49.510> put<00:05:50.050> this<00:05:50.140> on<00:05:50.290> the

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
to clean up and we'll put this on the

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.220 
to clean up and we'll put this on the
refrigerator<00:05:50.590> and<00:05:51.070> we'll<00:05:51.840> show<00:05:52.840> you<00:05:52.870> it<00:05:53.200> in

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.230 
refrigerator and we'll show you it in

00:05:53.230 --> 00:06:02.690 
refrigerator and we'll show you it in
three<00:05:53.590> hours<00:05:53.710> time

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:02.700 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.310 

okay<00:06:03.700> so<00:06:03.760> it's<00:06:04.120> been<00:06:04.390> about<00:06:04.420> three<00:06:04.870> hours<00:06:05.020> now

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
okay so it's been about three hours now

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.880 
okay so it's been about three hours now
and<00:06:05.620> we're<00:06:05.920> going<00:06:06.040> to<00:06:06.150> take<00:06:07.150> our<00:06:07.210> ice<00:06:08.140> sencha

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 
and we're going to take our ice sencha

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:16.050 
and we're going to take our ice sencha
out<00:06:09.490> of<00:06:09.670> the<00:06:09.760> fridge<00:06:09.970> and<00:06:14.610> pour<00:06:15.610> it<00:06:15.730> right<00:06:15.880> into
