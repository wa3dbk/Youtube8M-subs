when you guys are doing dumbbell bench
presses<00:00:30.630> there's<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.199> lot<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.740> different

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
presses there's a lot of different

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.040 
presses there's a lot of different
things<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.279> have<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.610> think<00:00:33.000> about<00:00:33.120> when

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
things you have to think about when

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.450 
things you have to think about when
you're<00:00:34.170> doing<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.590> bench<00:00:34.770> presses<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.340> how

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
you're doing the bench presses and how

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.370 
you're doing the bench presses and how
you're<00:00:35.640> doing<00:00:35.910> them<00:00:36.000> just<00:00:36.270> because<00:00:36.780> something

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
you're doing them just because something

says hey I'm gonna go do dumbbell bench
it<00:00:39.899> doesn't<00:00:40.320> always<00:00:40.440> mean<00:00:40.969> getting<00:00:41.969> on<00:00:42.059> a

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
it doesn't always mean getting on a

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.030 
it doesn't always mean getting on a
bench<00:00:42.390> grabbing<00:00:43.170> both<00:00:43.290> dumbbells<00:00:43.620> and

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
bench grabbing both dumbbells and

pressing them together

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.940 
pressing them together
alright<00:00:45.539> that's<00:00:46.110> probably<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.590> most<00:00:46.829> common

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
alright that's probably the most common

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.010 
alright that's probably the most common
and<00:00:47.430> easy<00:00:47.579> easy<00:00:48.090> thing<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.539> think<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.899> when

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
and easy easy thing to think of when

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.060 
and easy easy thing to think of when
you're<00:00:49.140> actually<00:00:49.260> doing<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.620> dumbbell<00:00:49.800> bench

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
you're actually doing a dumbbell bench

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.709 
you're actually doing a dumbbell bench
but<00:00:50.280> if<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.399> fall<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.730> program<00:00:51.149> fall<00:00:51.510> any<00:00:51.629> of

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
but if you fall in a program fall any of

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.209 
but if you fall in a program fall any of
my<00:00:51.899> programs<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:53.000> clearly<00:00:54.000> lay<00:00:54.210> out<00:00:54.590> seated<00:00:55.590> or

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
my programs I clearly lay out seated or

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.569 
my programs I clearly lay out seated or

differences<00:01:05.189> truly<00:01:05.939> matter<00:01:06.240> when<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.689> comes

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
differences truly matter when it comes

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.050 
differences truly matter when it comes
to<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.500> biomechanic<00:01:08.250> advantage<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.030> you

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
to the biomechanic advantage that you

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.060 
to the biomechanic advantage that you
have<00:01:09.200> when<00:01:10.200> you're<00:01:10.229> doing<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.650> movement<00:01:11.010> and

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
have when you're doing the movement and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.380 
have when you're doing the movement and
how<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.250> muscle<00:01:11.640> responds<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.270> that

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
how the muscle responds to that

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.410 
how the muscle responds to that
advantage<00:01:12.900> or<00:01:13.140> disadvantage<00:01:13.850> an<00:01:14.850> advantage

of<00:01:15.630> being<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.140> bench<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.799> you're<00:01:16.950> more

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
of being on a bench is that you're more

stable advantage of being on a ball is
you're<00:01:19.890> more<00:01:20.009> unstable<00:01:20.549> okay<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.119> there<00:01:21.360> are

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
you're more unstable okay so there are

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.030 
you're more unstable okay so there are

entire rep scheme versus the other is

a regular bench press my feet through
the<00:04:09.730> ground<00:04:09.940> now<00:04:10.570> I'm<00:04:10.810> driving<00:04:11.049> just<00:04:11.530> the

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
the ground now I'm driving just the

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.210 
the ground now I'm driving just the
right<00:04:11.860> leg<00:04:12.100> through<00:04:12.459> the<00:04:12.640> ground<00:04:12.910> and<00:04:14.040> as<00:04:15.040> I

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
right leg through the ground and as I

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.039 
right leg through the ground and as I
press<00:04:15.489> up<00:04:15.670> here<00:04:15.970> I'm<00:04:16.150> tightening<00:04:16.479> my<00:04:16.660> stomach

press up here I'm tightening my stomach

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.080 
press up here I'm tightening my stomach
and<00:04:17.590> guys<00:04:17.799> you're<00:04:18.010> gonna<00:04:18.160> feel<00:04:18.489> that<00:04:18.729> in<00:04:19.000> the

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
and guys you're gonna feel that in the

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.390 
and guys you're gonna feel that in the
opposite<00:04:19.570> side<00:04:19.810> of<00:04:19.840> your<00:04:20.049> core<00:04:20.470> and<00:04:21.250> the

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
opposite side of your core and the

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.240 
opposite side of your core and the
reason<00:04:21.700> why

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
reason why

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.780 
reason why
is<00:04:24.180> because<00:04:25.010> as<00:04:26.010> that<00:04:26.310> load<00:04:26.670> comes<00:04:27.480> down<00:04:28.790> and

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
is because as that load comes down and

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.350 
is because as that load comes down and
you're<00:04:29.940> driving<00:04:30.300> and<00:04:30.840> you<00:04:31.050> engage<00:04:31.440> this<00:04:31.860> leg

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
you're driving and you engage this leg

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.080 
you're driving and you engage this leg
that<00:04:33.360> driving<00:04:33.990> force<00:04:34.230> here<00:04:34.320> tilts<00:04:35.160> your<00:04:35.820> hip

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
that driving force here tilts your hip

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.280 
that driving force here tilts your hip
up<00:04:36.300> as<00:04:36.860> this<00:04:37.860> comes<00:04:38.160> down<00:04:38.400> now<00:04:39.210> your<00:04:39.510> core<00:04:39.840> your

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
up as this comes down now your core your

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.320 
up as this comes down now your core your
body<00:04:40.530> is<00:04:40.710> torquing<00:04:41.280> and<00:04:41.820> it's<00:04:42.000> putting<00:04:42.210> the

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
body is torquing and it's putting the

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.620 
body is torquing and it's putting the
huge<00:04:42.930> amount<00:04:43.230> of<00:04:43.290> emphasis<00:04:43.470> onto<00:04:44.010> your<00:04:44.280> core

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
huge amount of emphasis onto your core

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.560 
huge amount of emphasis onto your core
it<00:04:45.630> also<00:04:45.990> allowing<00:04:46.260> you<00:04:46.500> to<00:04:46.650> really<00:04:46.980> emphasize

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
it also allowing you to really emphasize

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.470 
it also allowing you to really emphasize
the<00:04:48.570> PEC<00:04:48.870> on<00:04:49.170> just<00:04:49.950> the<00:04:50.160> one<00:04:50.340> working<00:04:50.850> part<00:04:51.330> of

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
the PEC on just the one working part of

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.550 
the PEC on just the one working part of
the<00:04:51.540> body<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:52.050> really<00:04:52.770> press<00:04:53.130> it<00:04:53.340> up<00:04:53.460> okay

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
the body to really press it up okay

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.650 
the body to really press it up okay
the<00:04:55.560> benefit<00:04:56.100> of<00:04:56.280> this<00:04:57.060> so<00:04:57.330> that's<00:04:57.480> the

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
the benefit of this so that's the

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.710 
the benefit of this so that's the
technique<00:04:58.080> the<00:04:58.440> benefit<00:04:58.950> of<00:04:59.130> this<00:04:59.610> is<00:04:59.850> that

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
technique the benefit of this is that

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.150 
technique the benefit of this is that
when<00:05:01.080> you<00:05:01.290> are<00:05:01.320> looking<00:05:01.590> to<00:05:01.919> overcome

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
when you are looking to overcome

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.980 
when you are looking to overcome
strength<00:05:02.790> and<00:05:03.030> balances<00:05:03.510> and<00:05:03.540> what<00:05:03.870> does<00:05:03.960> that

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
strength and balances and what does that

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.290 
strength and balances and what does that
mean<00:05:04.320> one<00:05:04.770> side<00:05:05.040> of<00:05:05.130> your<00:05:05.250> body<00:05:05.400> is<00:05:05.820> stronger

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
mean one side of your body is stronger

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.180 
mean one side of your body is stronger
than<00:05:06.419> the<00:05:06.540> other<00:05:06.950> aesthetic<00:05:07.950> differences

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
than the other aesthetic differences

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.180 
than the other aesthetic differences
what<00:05:09.030> is<00:05:09.150> that<00:05:09.330> one<00:05:10.169> side<00:05:10.410> of<00:05:10.440> your<00:05:10.620> body<00:05:10.800> is

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
what is that one side of your body is

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.670 
what is that one side of your body is
bigger<00:05:11.580> or<00:05:11.820> smaller<00:05:12.030> than<00:05:12.330> the<00:05:12.570> other<00:05:12.750> one<00:05:13.440> arm

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
bigger or smaller than the other one arm

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.100 
bigger or smaller than the other one arm
bigger<00:05:14.250> than<00:05:14.520> the<00:05:14.610> other<00:05:14.760> one<00:05:15.360> pack<00:05:15.660> bigger

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
bigger than the other one pack bigger

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.530 
bigger than the other one pack bigger
than<00:05:16.350> the<00:05:16.440> other<00:05:16.580> it's<00:05:17.580> not<00:05:17.790> symmetrical

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
than the other it's not symmetrical

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.450 
than the other it's not symmetrical

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
able to do in the gym and understand why

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.600 
able to do in the gym and understand why
you're<00:05:22.530> doing<00:05:22.740> them<00:05:22.830> to<00:05:22.950> overcome<00:05:23.430> those

you're doing them to overcome those

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.000 
you're doing them to overcome those
things<00:05:23.870> plus<00:05:24.870> it's<00:05:25.080> a<00:05:25.140> great<00:05:25.380> way<00:05:25.560> to<00:05:25.590> throw<00:05:25.830> in

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
some variables have rate of change

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.420 
some variables have rate of change
they're<00:05:28.440> gonna<00:05:28.560> allow<00:05:28.770> you<00:05:28.830> guys<00:05:29.040> to<00:05:29.250> break

through<00:05:29.610> some<00:05:29.790> of<00:05:29.880> those<00:05:29.970> plateaus<00:05:30.419> if<00:05:30.660> I<00:05:30.840> were

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
through some of those plateaus if I were

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.040 
through some of those plateaus if I were
to<00:05:31.110> do<00:05:31.260> just<00:05:31.470> a<00:05:31.560> single<00:05:31.890> arm<00:05:32.130> benchpress<00:05:33.020> for<00:05:34.020> a

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
to do just a single arm benchpress for a

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.240 
to do just a single arm benchpress for a
month<00:05:34.350> and<00:05:34.650> then<00:05:35.460> come<00:05:35.669> back<00:05:35.700> and<00:05:36.210> now<00:05:37.020> do

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
month and then come back and now do

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.310 
month and then come back and now do
double<00:05:38.250> with<00:05:38.700> both<00:05:38.940> I'm<00:05:39.810> gonna<00:05:39.960> find<00:05:40.169> that<00:05:40.200> I

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
double with both I'm gonna find that I

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.710 
double with both I'm gonna find that I
can<00:05:40.500> press<00:05:40.680> a<00:05:40.710> lot<00:05:40.950> more<00:05:41.160> weight<00:05:41.430> with<00:05:42.030> using

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
can press a lot more weight with using

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.630 
can press a lot more weight with using
both<00:05:42.870> arms<00:05:42.919> that's<00:05:43.919> just<00:05:44.160> the<00:05:44.250> way<00:05:44.340> it<00:05:44.460> works

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
both arms that's just the way it works

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.659 
both arms that's just the way it works
guys<00:05:44.880> and<00:05:45.270> I<00:05:45.660> have<00:05:45.870> many<00:05:46.560> of<00:05:46.650> my<00:05:46.919> own<00:05:47.130> people

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
guys and I have many of my own people

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.580 
guys and I have many of my own people
who<00:05:47.729> have<00:05:47.820> trained<00:05:48.090> in<00:05:48.180> the<00:05:48.270> past<00:05:48.590> research

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
who have trained in the past research

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.830 
who have trained in the past research
actually<00:05:49.890> proves<00:05:50.400> this<00:05:50.580> myself<00:05:51.510> have<00:05:51.660> seen

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
actually proves this myself have seen

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.990 
actually proves this myself have seen
differences<00:05:52.350> and<00:05:52.740> you<00:05:53.160> guys<00:05:53.340> will<00:05:53.550> too<00:05:53.729> if<00:05:53.910> you

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
differences and you guys will too if you

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.820 
differences and you guys will too if you
incorporate<00:05:54.270> it<00:05:54.600> into<00:05:54.690> your<00:05:54.810> programs<00:05:55.320> but<00:05:55.590> I

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
incorporate it into your programs but I

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.490 
incorporate it into your programs but I
don't<00:05:56.729> think<00:05:56.910> that<00:05:57.300> many<00:05:57.510> of<00:05:57.600> you<00:05:57.720> may<00:05:58.140> have<00:05:58.169> a

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
don't think that many of you may have a
