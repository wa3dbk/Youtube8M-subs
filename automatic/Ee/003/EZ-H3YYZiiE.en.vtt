expression as much time they're even

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.810 
expression as much time they're even
different<00:00:39.270> all<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.899> need<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.200> root<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.820> 4.4

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
different all you need is root and 4.4

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.310 
different all you need is root and 4.4
or<00:00:42.030> above<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:42.750> I'm<00:00:42.809> not<00:00:42.960> sure<00:00:43.079> if<00:00:43.140> other

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
or above so I'm not sure if other

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.540 
or above so I'm not sure if other
versions<00:00:43.739> work

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
versions work

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.180 
versions work
I<00:00:44.610> know<00:00:45.059> 4.4<00:00:45.960> works<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.530> here<00:00:46.710> are<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.890> emoji

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
I know 4.4 works so here are the emoji

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.250 
I know 4.4 works so here are the emoji

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
so when I go to the same keyboard to the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.889

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
did find one on a forum but it was

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.109 
did find one on a forum but it was
really<00:01:16.979> complicated<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.549> have<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:18.000> go

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
really complicated you have to go

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.480 
really complicated you have to go
through<00:01:18.330> some<00:01:18.810> program<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> computer<00:01:19.770> and

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
through some program on a computer and

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.190 
through some program on a computer and
coding<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.210> all<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.540> stuff<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.049> was

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
coding and all that stuff it was

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.200 
coding and all that stuff it was
confusing<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:23.460> couldn't<00:01:23.729> do<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.090> through

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
confusing you couldn't do it through

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.390

your<00:01:24.270> phone<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.930> I'm<00:01:25.619> pretty<00:01:25.979> sure<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.280> is

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
your phone and I'm pretty sure this is

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.679 
your phone and I'm pretty sure this is
