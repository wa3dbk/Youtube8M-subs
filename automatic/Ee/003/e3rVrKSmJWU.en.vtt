00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
usually the results end up looking very

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.470 
usually the results end up looking very
well<00:00:50.160> filtered<00:00:50.730> looked<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.090> something<00:00:51.329> that

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
well filtered looked like something that

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.439 
well filtered looked like something that
was<00:00:51.690> done<00:00:51.870> by<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.020> machine<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.530> just

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
was done by a machine that just

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.729 
was done by a machine that just
mechanically<00:00:54.449> applies<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.020> certain<00:00:55.440> affect

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
no account for how the photo itself is

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.930 
no account for how the photo itself is

before<00:01:08.369> we<00:01:08.430> begin<00:01:08.549> I'm<00:01:08.939> gonna<00:01:09.119> go<00:01:09.299> ahead<00:01:09.450> and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
before we begin I'm gonna go ahead and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.300 
before we begin I'm gonna go ahead and
convert<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> smart<00:01:10.590> object<00:01:10.770> because

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
convert this to a smart object because

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.280 
convert this to a smart object because
the<00:01:11.430> oil<00:01:11.610> paint<00:01:11.850> filter<00:01:11.909> does<00:01:12.360> work<00:01:12.869> with

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
the oil paint filter does work with

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.260 
the oil paint filter does work with
smart<00:01:13.710> objects<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.400> as<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.000> point<00:01:15.180> of

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
smart objects and as a point of

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.480 
smart objects and as a point of
comparison<00:01:15.590> first<00:01:16.590> I'd<00:01:16.799> like<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:17.070> run<00:01:17.220> some<00:01:17.460> of

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
comparison first I'd like to run some of

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.310 
comparison first I'd like to run some of
one<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.150> old<00:01:18.360> filters<00:01:18.780> just<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.200> can

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.850 
one of the old filters just so you can
see<00:01:19.560> it

see it

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.270 
see it
incidentally<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.640> cs6<00:01:21.570> now<00:01:22.290> most<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.220> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
incidentally in cs6 now most of the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.719 
incidentally in cs6 now most of the
filters<00:01:23.640> have<00:01:24.240> been<00:01:24.479> moved<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:26.460> filter

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
filters have been moved to the filter

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.149 
filters have been moved to the filter
gallery<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.810> if<00:01:27.930> you're<00:01:28.049> looking<00:01:28.170> for<00:01:28.680> like

the brushstroke filters or any of those

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.319 
the brushstroke filters or any of those
you're<00:01:32.070> not<00:01:32.130> gonna<00:01:32.369> find<00:01:32.700> them<00:01:32.880> down<00:01:33.090> here

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329

anymore the whole artistic menu of
filters<00:01:36.659> are<00:01:36.930> not<00:01:37.470> found<00:01:38.390> well<00:01:39.390> because

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
filters are not found well because

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:40.819 
filters are not found well because
they're<00:01:39.810> all<00:01:39.930> hidden<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.470> filter

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
they're all hidden in this filter

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.889 
they're all hidden in this filter
gallery<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.939> now<00:01:42.060> we<00:01:42.119> have<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.450> artistic

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
that let's look at some of these the

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.850 
that let's look at some of these the
stylization<00:03:20.870> all<00:03:21.870> right<00:03:22.050> zoom<00:03:22.500> in<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.680> little

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
stylization all right zoom in a little

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.900 
stylization all right zoom in a little
more<00:03:22.950> so<00:03:23.100> you<00:03:23.130> can<00:03:23.280> see<00:03:23.430> what<00:03:23.550> that<00:03:23.670> does<00:03:23.850> you

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
more so you can see what that does you

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.880 
more so you can see what that does you
bring<00:03:24.300> it<00:03:24.390> down<00:03:24.570> low<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.140> it<00:03:25.380> gets<00:03:25.620> more<00:03:25.830> of

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
bring it down low and it gets more of

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.700 
bring it down low and it gets more of
the<00:03:26.420> yeah<00:03:27.420> sort<00:03:27.870> of<00:03:27.960> more<00:03:28.080> of<00:03:28.110> like<00:03:28.410> an<00:03:28.500> an<00:03:28.620> old

the yeah sort of more of like an an old

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.820 
the yeah sort of more of like an an old
filter<00:03:29.010> look<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.430> it<00:03:29.900> go<00:03:30.900> really<00:03:31.290> high<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.740> you

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830

the<00:04:05.520> shine<00:04:05.790> turned<00:04:06.120> up<00:04:06.330> so<00:04:07.260> let's<00:04:07.680> do<00:04:07.920> that<00:04:08.070> but

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
the shine turned up so let's do that but

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.860 
the shine turned up so let's do that but
turn<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.459> shine<00:04:08.760> up<00:04:08.940> which<00:04:09.300> makes<00:04:09.600> it<00:04:09.750> look

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
turn the shine up which makes it look

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.250 
turn the shine up which makes it look
absolutely<00:04:10.410> horrendous<00:04:11.630> the<00:04:12.630> bristle<00:04:12.930> detail

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
absolutely horrendous the bristle detail

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.550 
absolutely horrendous the bristle detail
you<00:04:13.800> can<00:04:13.920> see<00:04:13.980> some<00:04:14.340> changes<00:04:14.760> there<00:04:18.470> and<00:04:19.470> also

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
you can see some changes there and also

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.229 
you can see some changes there and also
the<00:04:19.770> scale<00:04:20.070> is<00:04:20.190> a<00:04:20.280> little<00:04:20.310> more<00:04:20.670> obvious<00:04:21.090> if

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
the scale is a little more obvious if

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.310 
the scale is a little more obvious if
that<00:04:21.359> shine<00:04:21.720> is<00:04:22.020> turned<00:04:22.350> way<00:04:22.530> up

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.520 

okay<00:04:26.320> angular<00:04:26.740> direction<00:04:27.960> that's<00:04:28.960> just<00:04:29.380> the

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
okay angular direction that's just the

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.380 
okay angular direction that's just the
light<00:04:29.740> angle<00:04:31.140> that<00:04:32.140> comes<00:04:32.350> through<00:04:33.300> okay<00:04:34.300> I'm

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
light angle that comes through okay I'm

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.670 
light angle that comes through okay I'm
gonna<00:04:34.480> turn<00:04:34.600> this<00:04:34.750> shine<00:04:34.990> way<00:04:35.230> back<00:04:35.440> down

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
gonna turn this shine way back down

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.100 
gonna turn this shine way back down
because<00:04:35.920> that's<00:04:36.510> let's<00:04:37.510> just<00:04:37.720> way<00:04:37.810> too<00:04:37.870> much

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
because that's let's just way too much

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.930 
because that's let's just way too much
there<00:04:39.960> I'm<00:04:40.960> hit<00:04:41.050> okay<00:04:41.490> we'll<00:04:42.490> take<00:04:42.610> a<00:04:42.640> look<00:04:42.880> at

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
there I'm hit okay we'll take a look at

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.060 
there I'm hit okay we'll take a look at
this<00:04:43.120> now<00:04:44.850> not<00:04:45.850> too<00:04:46.060> bad<00:04:46.620> especially<00:04:47.620> for<00:04:47.920> a

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
this now not too bad especially for a

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.630 
this now not too bad especially for a
filter<00:04:48.430> now<00:04:49.150> it<00:04:49.240> can<00:04:49.390> be<00:04:49.510> improved<00:04:50.610> take<00:04:51.610> a

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
filter now it can be improved take a

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.270 
filter now it can be improved take a
look<00:04:51.850> at<00:04:51.910> this<00:04:52.060> file<00:04:52.420> here<00:04:52.890> where<00:04:53.890> here's<00:04:54.100> what

look at this file here where here's what
I've<00:04:54.400> done<00:04:54.640> is<00:04:55.260> I've<00:04:56.260> run<00:04:56.590> the<00:04:56.740> smart<00:04:57.010> filter

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
I've done is I've run the smart filter

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.480 
I've done is I've run the smart filter
I'm<00:04:58.840> sorry<00:04:59.080> I've<00:04:59.200> run<00:04:59.380> the<00:04:59.530> filter<00:04:59.950> on<00:05:00.130> a<00:05:00.190> smart

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
I'm sorry I've run the filter on a smart

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.660 
I'm sorry I've run the filter on a smart
object<00:05:00.610> here<00:05:01.000> I<00:05:01.180> then<00:05:01.870> duplicated<00:05:02.500> it<00:05:02.710> and<00:05:02.920> in

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
object here I then duplicated it and in

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.240 
object here I then duplicated it and in
the<00:05:04.240> secondary<00:05:04.870> smart<00:05:05.290> object<00:05:05.680> and<00:05:05.770> changed

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
the secondary smart object and changed

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.280 
the secondary smart object and changed
the<00:05:06.490> the<00:05:07.150> settings<00:05:07.360> a<00:05:07.570> little<00:05:07.780> bit<00:05:07.900> so<00:05:08.170> the

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
the the settings a little bit so the

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.770 
the the settings a little bit so the
shine<00:05:08.500> was<00:05:08.740> increased<00:05:09.130> but<00:05:09.370> then<00:05:09.490> I<00:05:09.600> use<00:05:10.600> the

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
shine was increased but then I use the

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.360 
shine was increased but then I use the
mask<00:05:11.430> to<00:05:13.080> isolate<00:05:14.080> the<00:05:14.230> shine<00:05:14.470> effect<00:05:14.830> only<00:05:15.250> to

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
mask to isolate the shine effect only to

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.410 
mask to isolate the shine effect only to
the<00:05:15.460> background<00:05:15.820> area<00:05:16.060> to<00:05:16.180> give<00:05:16.300> the

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:16.420 
the background area to give the

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.080 
the background area to give the
background<00:05:16.600> less<00:05:17.350> of<00:05:17.530> a<00:05:17.590> smooth<00:05:18.040> look<00:05:18.790> and

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
background less of a smooth look and

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.770 
background less of a smooth look and
more<00:05:19.450> of<00:05:19.570> a<00:05:20.520> harder<00:05:21.520> dried<00:05:22.240> acrylic<00:05:22.780> look

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
more of a harder dried acrylic look

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.000 
more of a harder dried acrylic look
another<00:05:25.780> version<00:05:25.990> set<00:05:26.290> the<00:05:26.380> soft<00:05:26.620> light<00:05:26.830> with

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
another version set the soft light with

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.790 
another version set the soft light with
the<00:05:27.130> opacity<00:05:27.550> pulled<00:05:28.180> down<00:05:28.390> a<00:05:28.420> little<00:05:28.720> bit<00:05:28.840> and

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
the opacity pulled down a little bit and

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.380 
the opacity pulled down a little bit and
that's<00:05:29.920> what<00:05:30.070> gives<00:05:30.220> us<00:05:30.400> our<00:05:33.390> finished

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
that's what gives us our finished

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:35.940 
that's what gives us our finished
product<00:05:34.900> here<00:05:35.050> so<00:05:35.200> that's<00:05:35.440> the<00:05:35.500> oil<00:05:35.560> paint

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
product here so that's the oil paint

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.570 
product here so that's the oil paint
filter<00:05:36.010> in<00:05:36.580> Photoshop<00:05:36.730> cs6<00:05:37.270> I<00:05:38.460> think<00:05:39.460> it's

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
filter in Photoshop cs6 I think it's

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.670 
filter in Photoshop cs6 I think it's
more<00:05:39.730> useful<00:05:39.970> than<00:05:40.510> a<00:05:40.750> lot<00:05:40.960> of<00:05:40.990> the<00:05:41.260> previous

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
more useful than a lot of the previous

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.710 
more useful than a lot of the previous
filters<00:05:41.980> have<00:05:42.130> been<00:05:42.160> looks<00:05:43.150> more<00:05:43.300> like<00:05:43.450> a<00:05:43.480> hand

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
filters have been looks more like a hand

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.210 
filters have been looks more like a hand
done<00:05:43.960> painting<00:05:44.140> than<00:05:44.410> previously<00:05:44.980> done

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
done painting than previously done

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.780 
done painting than previously done
before

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
before

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.090 
before
it<00:05:46.150> still<00:05:46.420> doesn't<00:05:46.630> quite<00:05:46.960> look<00:05:47.380> exactly<00:05:47.890> like

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
it still doesn't quite look exactly like

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.160 
it still doesn't quite look exactly like
I<00:05:48.310> painted<00:05:48.610> this<00:05:48.760> by<00:05:48.880> hand<00:05:49.150> it<00:05:49.690> does<00:05:49.960> have<00:05:50.140> a

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.170 
I painted this by hand it does have a

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.940 
I painted this by hand it does have a
sill<00:05:50.500> filter<00:05:50.950> ish<00:05:51.210> appearance<00:05:52.210> to<00:05:52.420> it<00:05:52.950> but

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
sill filter ish appearance to it but

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.500 
sill filter ish appearance to it but
overall<00:05:54.220> it's<00:05:54.580> not<00:05:54.640> bad<00:05:54.940> I<00:05:54.970> think<00:05:55.300> it's<00:05:55.420> a

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
overall it's not bad I think it's a

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:56.790 
overall it's not bad I think it's a
pretty<00:05:55.660> good<00:05:55.750> direction<00:05:56.110> for<00:05:56.260> Adobe<00:05:56.650> to<00:05:56.740> be

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
pretty good direction for Adobe to be

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.430 
pretty good direction for Adobe to be
