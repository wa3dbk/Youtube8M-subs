00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:08.059
 5000 meters high in the mountains 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:10.820
 from the himalayas a small lake rests 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:14.900
 glacier known today as the 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:19.189
 lake of the skeletons is here where more 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.970
 of 600 people died and today I come to 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.070
 tell the surprising and rare story 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.410
 of some people who do not know how 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.609
 they had arrived at that place since they did not 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:34.100
 there was no route drawn until nepal 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:36.559
 nor do you know why they were so many 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.770
 because they were so many pilgrims 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.800
 people more than 5,000 meters high 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.620
 in that area 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.260
 say that good died frozen 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.840
 due to a hail rain that 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.720
 buried and thawed alive and 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.120
 later let's say that the rocks that 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.900
 they were falling off they went down 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.430
 the corpses until arriving at the lake 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.620
 when the thaw arrives it can be seen 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.530
 you can see some of these skeletons 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.900
 emerge 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.470
 I'm going to put some pretty pictures 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.280
 amazing real photos of the acquaintance 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.600
 lake of the skeletons in this place the 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.270
 conditions are hard 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.799
 the cold is extreme and moving through the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.799
 snow costs more and more 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.520
 this group of mountaineers did not suspect 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.090
 that in a few moments a tremendous 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.790
 hail would kill all of them and that 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.630
 the small lake that was at its 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.850
 feet would be known years later as the 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.790
 lake of the skeletons being their 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.470
 own bones that would give him the 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.390
 name to that distant place 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.640
 the lake also with the lake of the 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.520
 skeletons also known as rup 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.730
 cant is located in india in the 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:01.350
 state of uttarakhand very close to 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:03.830
 himalaya in the year 1942 a guardian of the 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.620
 area found on the shores of the lake 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.979
 heaps of human bones the first 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.290
 investigations that were carried out 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.440
 they pointed out that some nomadic group had 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.930
 died in the place by some epidemic or 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.630
 Maybe some storm or avalanche 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.290
 snow 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.440
 had been responsible in 2004 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.930
 another more serious investigation was made 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.410
 and with much more accurate results 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.150
 about what happened there centuries before 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.100
 they investigated many skulls and they 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.650
 they found some peculiar 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.950
 fractures that later became related 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.140
 with hail impacts of one size 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.300
 considerable the cold that it does in the area 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.320
 throughout the year he helped conserve 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.360
 many remains in acceptable conditions 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.810
 even a nearly mummified body 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.030
 intact the DNA studies concluded 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.730
 that there were two differentiated tribes 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.850
 among the deceased some lower and 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.670
 possibly indigenous and other forts 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.640
 higher but related too 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.820
 with the former it is estimated that the 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.150
 bones of almost 600 people rest in 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.160
 the edge and bottom slopes of the lake and that 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.590
 all died in a short period of 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.590
 weather by the hail storm 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.569
 nobody knows what a group was doing so 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:33.260
 numerous people in a place like 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:36.210
 they did not know where they came from or 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.730
 where they were going 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.460
 at present a cult is celebrated in 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.320
 the lake that takes place every 12 years in 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.720
 which the faithful bathe in its waters 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.190
 and honor those who lost there 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.530
 lifetime 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.630
 interesting to know that the hail was so 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.240
 strong that caused damage to the structure 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.310
 of the bones of people and to you 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.460
 you can imagine the size and strength 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.230
 with which the hail fell to kill them 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.660
 in fact many of them according to 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.000
 tests died even before 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.690
 freeze died by the blows of the 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.320
 hail in the head 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:16.840
 a little-known hallucinatory case of the 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.840
 called lake of the skeletons
