00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
in this video I'm going to show you how

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.530 
in this video I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:02.010> connect<00:00:02.399> Bettinger<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.210> spreadsheet

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
to connect Bettinger to a spreadsheet

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.450 
to connect Bettinger to a spreadsheet
and<00:00:04.200> there<00:00:04.410> are<00:00:04.500> actually<00:00:04.770> two<00:00:04.980> ways<00:00:05.009> of<00:00:05.339> doing

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
and there are actually two ways of doing

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.610 
and there are actually two ways of doing
this<00:00:05.810> most<00:00:06.810> people<00:00:06.930> are<00:00:07.080> familiar<00:00:07.200> with<00:00:07.440> the

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
this most people are familiar with the

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.940 
this most people are familiar with the
excel<00:00:07.980> tab<00:00:08.700> on<00:00:08.970> betangel<00:00:09.630> but<00:00:10.590> most<00:00:10.740> people

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
excel tab on betangel but most people

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.499 
excel tab on betangel but most people
don't<00:00:11.099> realize<00:00:11.309> that<00:00:11.340> there's<00:00:11.730> two<00:00:12.150> ways<00:00:12.179> of

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
don't realize that there's two ways of

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.200 
don't realize that there's two ways of
connecting<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.259> spreadsheet<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.120> one<00:00:15.120> of

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
connecting to spreadsheet and one of

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.150 
connecting to spreadsheet and one of
them<00:00:15.330> uses<00:00:16.049> this<00:00:16.170> tab<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.890> other<00:00:16.980> one

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
them uses this tab and the other one

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.980 
them uses this tab and the other one
doesn't<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.330> I'm<00:00:18.449> going<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.600> explain<00:00:18.869> the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
doesn't and I'm going to explain the

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.880 
doesn't and I'm going to explain the
difference<00:00:19.230> between<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.500> two<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.710> how<00:00:19.830> to

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
difference between the two and how to

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.050 
difference between the two and how to
connect<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.670> spreadsheet<00:00:22.820> why<00:00:23.820> would<00:00:24.000> you

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
connect to a spreadsheet why would you

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.310 
connect to a spreadsheet why would you
connect<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.420> spreadsheet<00:00:24.660> well<00:00:24.900> there's<00:00:25.050> so

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
connect to a spreadsheet well there's so

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.400 
connect to a spreadsheet well there's so
many<00:00:25.439> different<00:00:25.800> ways<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:27.019> use<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.050> spreadsheet

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
many different ways to use a spreadsheet

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.569 
many different ways to use a spreadsheet

people maybe don't have looking at the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.900 
people maybe don't have looking at the
market<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.219> slightly<00:00:35.460> different<00:00:35.579> way

market I'm not going to do that at

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.119 
market I'm not going to do that at
length<00:02:06.329> now<00:02:06.540> but<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:06.750> just<00:02:06.930> show<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.140> how<00:02:08.069> you

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
length now but I just show you how you

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.729 
length now but I just show you how you
have<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.700> blank<00:02:09.000> spreadsheet<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.810> then<00:02:10.560> you

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
have a blank spreadsheet and then you

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.800 
have a blank spreadsheet and then you
basically<00:02:11.039> start<00:02:11.700> populating<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.390> within

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
basically start populating that within

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.030 
basically start populating that within
from

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
from

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.339 
from
nation<00:02:13.280> so<00:02:13.939> we<00:02:14.269> could<00:02:14.420> put<00:02:14.780> that<00:02:14.810> on<00:02:15.019> top<00:02:15.200> of

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
nation so we could put that on top of

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.819 
nation so we could put that on top of
there<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:15.769> then<00:02:16.519> say<00:02:16.849> we'll<00:02:17.750> take<00:02:18.349> the<00:02:18.530> volume

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
there and then say we'll take the volume

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.149 
there and then say we'll take the volume
data<00:02:19.069> there<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.959> we'll<00:02:20.959> take<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.920> volume

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
data there and we'll take the volume

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.420 
data there and we'll take the volume
data<00:02:22.489> there<00:02:22.879> and<00:02:23.620> we'll<00:02:24.620> put<00:02:24.890> in<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.099> string

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
data there and we'll put in the string

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.949 
data there and we'll put in the string
time<00:02:26.209> and<00:02:26.980> then<00:02:27.980> take<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:29.030> countdown<00:02:29.510> timer

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
time and then take the countdown timer

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.050 
time and then take the countdown timer
and<00:02:30.260> so<00:02:30.920> on<00:02:31.069> so<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:31.310> can<00:02:31.489> see<00:02:31.670> that's<00:02:31.819> how<00:02:32.000> you

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
the spreadsheet at that point so that's

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.649 
the spreadsheet at that point so that's
how<00:03:45.049> you<00:03:45.109> connect<00:03:45.459> one<00:03:46.459> market<00:03:47.299> to<00:03:47.510> a

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
what you can see the difference here is

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
4 or 5 and this can go on for infinity

here is if I click on connect what I can

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.680 
here is if I click on connect what I can
actually<00:06:04.460> do<00:06:04.730> is<00:06:04.880> select<00:06:05.060> from<00:06:05.420> a<00:06:05.480> drop-down

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
actually do is select from a drop-down

it's all connected automatically and

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.560 
it's all connected automatically and
obviously<00:06:22.430> the<00:06:22.580> advantage<00:06:23.000> of<00:06:23.120> this<00:06:23.240> is<00:06:23.450> it

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
obviously the advantage of this is it

or under one work

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.530 
or under one work
I<00:06:38.870> should<00:06:39.169> say<00:06:39.350> on<00:06:39.470> separate<00:06:39.830> sheets<00:06:40.300> and<00:06:41.300> this

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.540 
I should say on separate sheets and this

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.460 
I should say on separate sheets and this
is<00:06:41.810> how<00:06:42.290> you<00:06:42.350> connect<00:06:42.860> multiple<00:06:43.520> markets<00:06:44.470> in

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.470 
is how you connect multiple markets in

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.270 
compare the over-and-under to the Turner

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.879 
compare the over-and-under to the Turner
after<00:06:50.510> the<00:06:50.600> earth<00:06:50.690> go<00:06:50.960> to<00:06:51.139> an<00:06:51.500> under

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:51.889 
after the earth go to an under
