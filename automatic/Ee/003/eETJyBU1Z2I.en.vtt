00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.540
 hi friends my name is Sergey and you 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.960
 see video reviews of the most relevant 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.520
 offers on the market of equipment from the company 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.430
 Mobile phone today we look 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.820
 relatively compact mirror full 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.630
 staffing camera from the company nikon for 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:32.399
 being asked 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:33.899
 relatively small money design 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.510
 SLR cameras 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.460
 like most professional 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.590
 tools is a secondary matter to my 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.670
 look more important ergonomics and 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.100
 functionality 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.750
 so here we go back to the design here he 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.850
 the most standard 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.020
 materials selected practical and 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.600
 pleasant to the touch 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.789
 assembly also did not pump up the body 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.980
 abound in rubberized inserts for 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.530
 best camera tenacity and this 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.750
 no wonder drop such a camera 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.820
 pleasure is not cheap 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.739
 there is a camera flash and 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.500
 hot shoe to connect 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.720
 accessories 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.100
 let's go to the organ about mike 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.049
 two-level mode dial 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.390
 fitted with detents to exclude 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.590
 random scroll also have 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.640
 programmable fn button also a lot 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.490
 function buttons and two wheels 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.500
 scrolling to change the parameters of the whole 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.930
 management like design tends to 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.729
 standardization so if you had 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.630
 experience with other mirror 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.060
 cameras 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.770
 even other manufacturers understand 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.590
 This case 10 minutes 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.720
 Package may vary but in 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.549
 In our case, besides the camera itself, 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.939
 battery charger kit 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.649
 device usb cable instruction booklet 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.189
 as well as a software CD 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.189
 by providing 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.170
 24 megapixel camera sensor is not 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.840
 skimp on good optics and you 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.540
 you will be rewarded full frame this 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.460
 full frame but should not be expected from 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.860
 him fantastic results 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.220
 but no less natural 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.470
 color rendering excellent detail 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.900
 nice depth of field all good 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.970
 level is not superfluous to mention that 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.370
 such good performance is not merit 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.760
 only cameras as well as optics 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.700
 In our case, this is not a Carat 1428 with 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.230
 aperture 2 and 8 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.880
 we will talk more about it in a separate 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.970
 review on our website 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.640
 for now let's get back to the camera 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.830
 gives out more than 5 frames per second and not 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.069
 stops after 10 frames 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.620
 as some of her colleagues, the matrix itself 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.540
 currently not a fur coat but you should not go to 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.840
 extremes exposing maximum 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.880
 iso value by the way here it is 25 thousand 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.530
 six hundred units 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.230
 automatic and sauce top line 6 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.360
 400 and reportage shooting takes place without 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.970
 problems also the camera is able to shoot 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.590
 video is not compressed passing it on 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.980
 hdmi interface 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.959
 at 720p resolution, this is 60 frames per 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.380
 second at 1080p 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.630
 it's 24 25 or 30 frames per second 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.060
 the sound is shot through the built 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.970
 microphone and through external which 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.340
 connects with a standard minijack for 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.440
 start recording video is special 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.930
 a button that is conveniently located a little 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.329
 to the left of the shutter button are also developers 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.910
 give us the opportunity to connect the camera 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:32.690
 headphone what was missing from more 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.690
 early models 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.250
 just sarcomeres are very smart and snapshots 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:43.010
 at maximum resolution scrolls without 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.439
 a single hint of any 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.560
 slowing down the size of the matrix 35 and 9 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:51.810
 at 24 millimeter on high iso itself 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.239
 it makes a noise but gives you great 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.060
 a couple of cameras of its price segment and 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.400
 even more trying to compete with 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.370
 more serious devices true 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.859
 very little yielding them the main lcd 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.189
 camera display has a diagonal of three and two 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.540
 inches and also the resolution of 921 thousand 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:11.579
 alas points 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.950
 it's not turning so if you 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:16.199
 want exquisite prospects will have 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.259
 a little bit to excel in acrobatic 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:21.449
 Etudes agree not very convenient however 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:24.300
 Your photo aerobics is necessarily good 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:26.669
 will affect your posture also have 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.300
 service display to the right of the hot 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.610
 shoe 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.530
 it is informative and convenient enough 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.440
 displays the necessary information 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.030
 optical viewfinder will help 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.010
 see frame more accurately 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.770
 abstracting from the light highlights and 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.169
 illuminations that are possible when working with 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.599
 external data storage screen 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:49.169
 the camera is equipped with two slots for 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:51.030
 memory card format sd whole company 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.830
 Nikon did not stint on the connectors and 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.960
 proof of this are two 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.050
 minijack for external microphone and 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.240
 hdmi and usb headphone jacks 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.870
 travelers are also not cheated 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.250
 equipping the camera with an input for an external 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.949
 gps receiver comes with a camera 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.789
 battery capacity from 1900 milliamps 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.860
 o'clock 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:12.930
 talk about some kind of lifespan without 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.820
 recharge, I think it is meaningless because 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.820
 how each uses the camera differently 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.590
 if in a nutshell, up to 600 is great 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.540
 the camera is relatively inexpensive full 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.940
 good frame 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.460
 natural color reproduction excellent 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.400
 sharpness and incredible speed 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:38.220
 ergonomics at the design level is not particularly 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.010
 stands out but as said earlier in 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.300
 such a device case design 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.729
 minor really difficult 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.770
 judge a professional device not 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:48.290
 being highly specialized 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.479
 professional in this direction 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:53.460
 therefore, all of the above was approved 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:59.340
 our staff photographer as well 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:06:01.919
