the rules are absolutely I know in
league<00:00:37.000> for<00:00:37.750> example<00:00:38.140> if<00:00:38.230> we're<00:00:38.410> bowling<00:00:38.620> on

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
league for example if we're bowling on

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.270 
league for example if we're bowling on
Lane<00:00:39.100> 1<00:00:39.430> if<00:00:39.790> you're<00:00:40.450> on<00:00:40.600> Lane<00:00:40.930> 3<00:00:41.410> you<00:00:41.860> can<00:00:42.070> bowl

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
Lane 1 if you're on Lane 3 you can bowl

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.040 
Lane 1 if you're on Lane 3 you can bowl
with<00:00:42.489> that<00:00:42.640> person<00:00:43.120> who's<00:00:43.270> on<00:00:43.420> Lane<00:00:43.660> 1<00:00:43.840> because

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
with that person who's on Lane 1 because

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.990 
with that person who's on Lane 1 because
that's<00:00:44.230> considered<00:00:44.440> one<00:00:44.980> lane<00:00:45.190> and<00:00:45.400> the

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
that's considered one lane and the

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.370 
that's considered one lane and the
league's<00:00:46.239> that<00:00:46.420> I<00:00:46.450> believe<00:00:46.840> the<00:00:46.960> majority<00:00:47.079> of

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
league's that I believe the majority of

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.340 
league's that I believe the majority of
the<00:00:47.440> time<00:00:47.620> it's<00:00:47.770> usually<00:00:48.130> one<00:00:48.520> Lane<00:00:48.700> courtesy

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
the time it's usually one Lane courtesy

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.139 
the time it's usually one Lane courtesy
but<00:00:50.350> one<00:00:50.530> of<00:00:50.560> the<00:00:50.739> things<00:00:50.950> that<00:00:51.070> people<00:00:51.670> do<00:00:51.940> get

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
but one of the things that people do get

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.110 
but one of the things that people do get
confused<00:00:52.450> about<00:00:52.899> is<00:00:53.290> the<00:00:53.649> spare<00:00:53.980> shot<00:00:54.250> so<00:00:55.000> when

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
confused about is the spare shot so when

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.639 
confused about is the spare shot so when
you<00:00:55.210> take<00:00:55.390> your<00:00:55.450> turn<00:00:55.720> and<00:00:55.899> you<00:00:55.960> leave<00:00:56.140> a<00:00:56.170> spare

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
you take your turn and you leave a spare

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.979 
you take your turn and you leave a spare
I<00:00:56.910> think<00:00:57.910> people<00:00:58.239> there<00:00:58.510> are<00:00:58.600> people<00:00:58.660> that

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
I think people there are people that

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.530 
I think people there are people that
wait<00:00:59.290> for<00:00:59.559> you<00:00:59.680> to<00:00:59.980> shoot<00:01:00.220> the<00:01:00.430> spare<00:01:00.730> so<00:01:01.390> now

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
wait for you to shoot the spare so now

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.030 
wait for you to shoot the spare so now
they're<00:01:01.719> waiting<00:01:01.899> extra<00:01:02.410> time<00:01:02.620> and<00:01:02.890> then

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
they're waiting extra time and then

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.619 
they're waiting extra time and then
there's<00:01:03.610> always<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:03.940> other<00:01:04.059> case<00:01:04.360> of

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
there's always the other case of

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.149 
there's always the other case of
somebody<00:01:05.079> just<00:01:05.290> going<00:01:05.590> up<00:01:05.740> there<00:01:05.920> while

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
somebody just going up there while

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:07.500

you're<00:01:06.340> in<00:01:06.399> the<00:01:06.520> middle<00:01:06.880> of<00:01:07.030> shooting<00:01:07.060> your

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
you're in the middle of shooting your
