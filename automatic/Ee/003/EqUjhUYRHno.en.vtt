00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.460
 no 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.160
 eh yes 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.770
 hi to all and reacher c6 nex jump 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.780
 so today I will introduce you 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.010
 a new glitch on battlefield 3 that 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.270
 will allow you and good to do 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.250
 several things at once 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.660
 and yes so things that we are that 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.940
 we'll see a little later in the 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.010
 video I'm going to explain to you directly 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.780
 the manipulation to follow for power and 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.640
 well done this famous goal 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.400
 so firstly you have to have a 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.930
 weapon with a beep is so it's very 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.090
 simple you head anywhere 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.100
 on the map you lie down you ask 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.360
 your foot ball and that's where the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.120
 manipulation is going to be a bit complicated 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.640
 you will have to start next 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.969
 exit the start menu and give a shot of 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.000
 knife 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.430
 so for me it'll be on ps3 it's going 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.690
 so be start game ferron and very quickly 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.490
 I'm stabbing right after 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.500
 if all goes well you will see and 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.090
 as soon as your guy your gun goes 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.550
 disappear and when you will try 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.380
 to actually get up your vision is going 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.619
 stay where you did the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.330
 manipulation but your body is going to get it 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.619
 move normally on the map as 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.970
 you can see it on the mini map 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.369
 which is at the bottom left 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.470
 as you see my view remain 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.770
 static while my body my 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.659
 character moves him and well elsewhere 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.610
 on the map but you do not see yourself 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.500
 not just to allies and your enemies 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.450
 and see your body well and you 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.450
 just see to the plane that is lying 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.039
 so what are you going to tell me 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.999
 serves to make this famous manipulation 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.039
 Well, I'll explain it to you 

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:54.539
 now this manipulation once 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.429
 that you have realized you are going 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.899
 to be able to point you towards an enemy 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.709
 so I remind you that you have to 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.399
 help the little one to move 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:04.079
 the best possible 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.030
 so direct you to the night and you 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.280
 go the side so if everything goes well 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.379
 you will see you are going to be holed 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.510
 carry to where he enemies and from 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.790
 shot well you will see the animation 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.040
 of the cut so be able to kill the enemy 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.650
 once it's good there it will be again 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.849
 more buggy you will see it if you 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.500
 try to move from vision to 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.750
 left to the right it will be blocked 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.560
 as if you were still with your 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.599
 ball feet and you will see your sight 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.700
 normal if you change weapons by 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.709
 against there the guide is fucked must 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.859
 really you keep the knife 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.420
 in hand and so in truth your body 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.730
 will be a little further compared to 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.840
 your view I explain myself example if you 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.329
 go around a building 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.780
 you will see that your view goes one 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.940
 skewer and quite a lot of wall is 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.859
 normal since your body actually 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.590
 is a little further in front of you it's 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.269
 for that, try to navigate with the 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.650
 mini card 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.980
 so that's one of the first 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.900
 possibilities that this glitch that this 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.900
 manipulation offers you 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.580
 we will see the last possibility 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.500
 what this village offers 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.780
 then you will do the manipulation 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.910
 like at the beginning of the video I did 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.690
 expressly take a map where there is a 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.040
 downhill, that is to say uneven, so you 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.959
 go do the manipulation and you 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.910
 go to the listened to your enemy I did 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.920
 purposely go far enough for that 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.930
 you see how much teleportation 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.940
 and fast is impressive 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.819
 so once you have your side 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.890
 your enemy you're going to be heading and 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.660
 well down the slope down the 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.160
 slope down the hill call it 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.830
 as you want and so you go 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.610
 see that your view she will stay at 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.290
 same place and where you did 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.510
 you have side of the enemy ie 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.730
 if you advance as you go down you 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.180
 will see your view that remains at the same 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.459
 level 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.720
 on the other hand, your body is down to him 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.880
 and well and so 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.380
 and so if you go down even more 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.150
 you will see that you are going to be very 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.370
 very high in the air with your sight 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.099
 is what is really really 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.989
 impressive so here it was 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.329
 last characteristic of this glitch 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.890
 I hope that this one will have pleased you 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.209
 give a wink to the evil team for 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.130
