happened in Zanzibar with snake burning
him<00:01:23.350> so<00:01:24.350> you<00:01:25.100> think<00:01:25.160> that<00:01:25.690> even<00:01:26.690> he's<00:01:27.560> in<00:01:27.680> a

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
him so you think that even he's in a

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.250 
him so you think that even he's in a
coma<00:01:27.890> so<00:01:28.160> he<00:01:28.250> still<00:01:28.580> has<00:01:28.820> ceased<00:01:29.150> he<00:01:29.720> still<00:01:30.080> is

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
coma so he still has ceased he still is

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.340 
coma so he still has ceased he still is
aware<00:01:30.860> you<00:01:31.850> know<00:01:31.940> he<00:01:32.060> still<00:01:32.270> has<00:01:32.360> a<00:01:32.390> brain<00:01:32.720> he

aware you know he still has a brain he
does<00:01:33.880> functioning<00:01:36.100> so<00:01:37.100> you<00:01:38.060> think<00:01:38.120> whether

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
does functioning so you think whether

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.510 
does functioning so you think whether
this<00:01:39.410> coma<00:01:39.920> is<00:01:40.910> just<00:01:41.180> to<00:01:41.270> him<00:01:41.420> it's<00:01:41.930> just<00:01:42.080> him

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
this coma is just to him it's just him

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.630 
this coma is just to him it's just him

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
however if this isn't to be the case

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.210 
however if this isn't to be the case
regardless<00:02:07.730> of<00:02:07.940> whether<00:02:08.090> it<00:02:08.390> is<00:02:08.450> or<00:02:09.050> not<00:02:09.110> I<00:02:09.649> do

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
regardless of whether it is or not I do

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.490 
regardless of whether it is or not I do
think<00:02:10.640> that<00:02:10.759> at<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.750> end<00:02:11.870> of<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.050> game<00:02:12.080> we

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
think that at the end of the game we

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.190 
think that at the end of the game we
will<00:02:12.650> have<00:02:12.890> our<00:02:13.040> to<00:02:13.400> heaven<00:02:13.730> established<00:02:14.420> now

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.110 
will have our to heaven established now
I'm<00:02:15.319> thinking<00:02:15.739> if<00:02:15.890> something<00:02:16.819> was<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.000> happen

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
I'm thinking if something was to happen

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.709 
I'm thinking if something was to happen
it<00:02:17.480> as<00:02:17.599> if<00:02:17.750> we<00:02:17.870> were<00:02:17.959> to<00:02:18.580> if<00:02:19.580> we<00:02:20.000> were<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.300> unlock

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:20.719 
it as if we were to if we were to unlock

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:23.319 
it as if we were to if we were to unlock

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.130 
coupe de terre that's how you said so in
my<00:04:13.190> opinion<00:04:13.310> I<00:04:13.700> I<00:04:13.730> definitely<00:04:14.660> do<00:04:14.870> think<00:04:15.080> that

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
my opinion I I definitely do think that

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.500 
my opinion I I definitely do think that
like<00:04:15.680> a<00:04:15.709> surprise<00:04:16.250> encounter<00:04:17.030> solid<00:04:17.359> snake

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
like a surprise encounter solid snake

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.990 
like a surprise encounter solid snake
could<00:04:17.660> definitely<00:04:17.930> be<00:04:18.140> the<00:04:18.169> way<00:04:18.440> forward<00:04:19.000> a

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
could definitely be the way forward a

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.789 
could definitely be the way forward a
good<00:04:20.299> way<00:04:20.660> to<00:04:20.690> end<00:04:20.840> the<00:04:21.049> game<00:04:21.080> nevertheless

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
good way to end the game nevertheless

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.530 
good way to end the game nevertheless
have<00:04:22.190> alt<00:04:22.400> haven't<00:04:22.729> get<00:04:22.820> destroyed<00:04:23.150> you<00:04:23.450> know

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
have alt haven't get destroyed you know

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.450 
have alt haven't get destroyed you know
you<00:04:23.600> build<00:04:23.900> it<00:04:24.110> and<00:04:24.260> it<00:04:24.830> gets<00:04:24.979> the<00:04:25.130> story<00:04:25.370> again

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
you build it and it gets the story again

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.550 
you build it and it gets the story again
but<00:04:25.729> every<00:04:26.090> metric<00:04:26.840> a<00:04:26.900> sonic<00:04:27.169> that<00:04:27.290> will<00:04:27.470> know

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
but every metric a sonic that will know

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.800 
but every metric a sonic that will know
that<00:04:27.740> that<00:04:27.950> would<00:04:28.070> be<00:04:28.100> met

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
that that would be met

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.810 
that that would be met
and<00:04:29.860> you<00:04:30.860> definitely<00:04:31.040> need<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.370> end<00:04:31.490> in<00:04:31.580> some

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
and you definitely need to end in some

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.240 
and you definitely need to end in some
way<00:04:32.060> that<00:04:32.990> can<00:04:33.170> link<00:04:33.320> back<00:04:33.500> to<00:04:33.530> the<00:04:33.950> very<00:04:34.130> first

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
way that can link back to the very first

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.480 
way that can link back to the very first
series<00:04:34.790> I<00:04:34.880> mean<00:04:35.030> at<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:35.540> same<00:04:35.750> time<00:04:36.490> maybe

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
series I mean at the same time maybe

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.940 
series I mean at the same time maybe
might<00:04:37.910> be<00:04:38.270> going<00:04:38.540> to<00:04:38.780> farfetch<00:04:39.320> because<00:04:39.710> the

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
might be going to farfetch because the

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.590 
might be going to farfetch because the
further<00:04:40.190> the<00:04:40.370> actual<00:04:40.670> very<00:04:40.850> first<00:04:41.120> met<00:04:41.300> to<00:04:41.450> get

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
further the actual very first met to get

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.050 
further the actual very first met to get
involved<00:04:42.230> solid<00:04:42.620> snake<00:04:42.800> and<00:04:43.040> big<00:04:43.190> boss<00:04:43.430> so

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
involved solid snake and big boss so

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.580 
involved solid snake and big boss so
maybe<00:04:44.270> going<00:04:44.540> from<00:04:44.690> big<00:04:44.840> bosses<00:04:45.140> perspective

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
maybe going from big bosses perspective

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.310 
maybe going from big bosses perspective
might<00:04:45.800> not<00:04:45.980> need<00:04:46.580> to<00:04:46.790> be<00:04:46.820> done<00:04:47.120> since<00:04:47.540> since<00:04:48.170> we

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
might not need to be done since since we

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.720 
might not need to be done since since we
already<00:04:48.500> know<00:04:48.740> what<00:04:48.890> happened<00:04:49.220> in<00:04:49.310> out<00:04:49.400> Devon

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
already know what happened in out Devon

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:50.950 
already know what happened in out Devon
so<00:04:49.820> they<00:04:49.940> could<00:04:50.090> just<00:04:50.240> go<00:04:50.360> all<00:04:50.450> the<00:04:50.540> way<00:04:50.600> to

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
so they could just go all the way to

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.630 
so they could just go all the way to
after<00:04:51.350> heaven<00:04:51.620> and<00:04:51.740> then<00:04:51.830> like<00:04:51.980> I<00:04:52.010> said<00:04:52.250> the

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
after heaven and then like I said the

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.280 
after heaven and then like I said the
conversation<00:04:53.090> was<00:04:53.180> odd<00:04:53.330> its<00:04:53.480> name<00:04:53.720> meaning

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
conversation was odd its name meaning

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.200 
conversation was odd its name meaning
that<00:04:54.440> basically<00:04:55.280> this<00:04:55.490> whole<00:04:55.550> story<00:04:56.000> would

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
that basically this whole story would

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.950 
that basically this whole story would
have<00:04:56.300> been<00:04:56.390> wrapped<00:04:56.660> so<00:04:57.590> you<00:04:58.580> know<00:04:58.670> well<00:04:59.000> we'll
