00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.580
 in the fastest growing program in the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.799
 Puerto Rican family from which he lives 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.449

 dad uncle nephew the neighbor title 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.840
 that are next we are growing up so 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.920
 thanks to you but to grow more 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.930
 We need you to communicate with 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.900
 technology facebook twitter running 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.850
 fields luisa of the rivers and wilton vargas 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.880
 that is also here is the technician 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.009
 point and that's when your twitter in 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.230
 wilton cloud and of course technet and 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.660
 things as separate because this is the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.269
 website and I am me or a thing is a 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.249
 thing and another thing is something else like 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:43.739
 example are you do not have two phones 

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:46.019
 a good if what happens is that before 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.679
 start with what we have for today 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:51.659
 was that I came to fall into my hands the o 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:54.719
 the voice of low humility I hear the voice 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:56.609
 of the little humility came to fall in my 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.199
 hands that fell into your hands this 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:01.620
 phone that is the same stage was one 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.229
 of which was presented in Barcelona ago 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.350
 and a couple of weeks left in 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.510
 March and this phone comes to attracting 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.820
 bring something very interesting is he 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.590
 the former says wang s 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.990
 in the t mobile network and most 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.159
 interesting about this is the camera this 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.320
 camera that we have them so that now 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.240
 same apart from having a great big lens 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.010
 so that more light and better 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.310
 photos has a good feature 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.260
 particular and that is that you can take pictures 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.660
 extremely fast so that if you 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.259
 are you capturing your son or your daughter 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:37.530
 is making movement you can in 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.630
 seconds capture 99 photos in succession and 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.250
 then it allows you to fill the memory not 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.910
 then it allows you to choose the best 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.600
 photo that you have chosen and then you 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.369
 you stay with her 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.610
 ok the others are deleted are the erases 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.610
 alone 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:57.520
 that's the quick succession 99 photos 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:04.290
 then there you choose in the part of 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:07.710
 down for example I'm going to choose here 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.710
 move for what 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.080
 so here we are going to demonstrate it here to 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.959
 the camera to make it easier see here 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.430
 down everything you choose which is the one you 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.910
 better you want 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.890
 with the hair you are seeing and if you 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.500
 you want for example is then then 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.200
 there you give it that is the weight or the best 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.730
 takes and then says yes and that's it 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.020
 is the photo that is owing you is very 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.940
 very good idea very good idea then 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.890
 wilton in technology is moving 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.739
 to put better camera phones and 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.080
 that you used the cameramen you're going to follow 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:44.709
 working because remember more the 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.780
 arrow in the Indian you have a good point 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.940
 so photojournalist friends are 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.769
 sure that it forms a camera that you have 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.269
 and for more phone if you do not know how to go 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.100
 the photo does not know how to shoot photos contacts 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:57.670
 but I have to tell you something that happened and 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:04.360
 is that we will be reaching the era of 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:05.590
 Taguasco 70 and they had them put something 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.610
 on the floor and so there is an image 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.410
 exact in the famous scene where the 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.200
 princess leia asks for help to obi wan 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.700
 kenobi coming out the projected image of 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.370
 arturito 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:22.980
 it turns out that this had started 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:25.510
 to good as you can be real and tasks 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.800
 similar are beginning to emerge and 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.319
 using the means that we are 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.150
 seeing now are images that during the 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.450
 campaign was already selecting in 2008 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.280
 cnn used a technique that gave the 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.380
 impression that it was a hologram in the 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.420
 study the person on the right is a 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.069
 reporter in atlanta and s-pulse blitzer 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.630
 which is in the studios of Atlanta and 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.099
 then they used this technique that I 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.390
 they called him a hologram but that 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.030
 it really is not , but it gives the impression 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.380
 and one swears that it is the same that and 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.290
 then the reason why I bring 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.630
 this topic is because this weekend 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.130
 a concert was held an event 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.769
 a festival called coachella in 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.290
 this 21 h of the then coachella then 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.849
 It gives the opportunity to be big 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.549
 great music acts this 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:08.860
 personalities then you want from there 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.930
 so then of a concert that 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.019
 It happens that someone who died 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.590
 some time ago to sing to sing how 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.889
 make 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.930
 tupac shakur that you pass because if I do not 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.790
 It was wrong to be murdered, it turns out that 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.710
 Well, a concert was presented 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.280
 sharing the stage making a 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:31.550
 featuring as they call him with snoop doggy 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.410
 dogg and 233 game but I am vÃ­ctor and 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.870
 we have images of what we want 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.150
 see them because they can dominate it in 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.980
 full better to be able to observe it well if 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.930
 Well, this is the result of making 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.160
 impress many people because it is 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.810
 Many people did not expect it even though 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.190
 he had liquidated he had already known 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.740
 how a surprise came from this 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.160
 kind but then it turns out to be ronnie 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.570
 who presented the man on the platform 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.550
 as if it came out or are these 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.490
 elevators that upload artists 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.530
 experiences and it looked like that and then what 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.510
 that people were seeing was a 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.540
 graphic representation was an animation 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.690
 by tupac shakur terry 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:11.080
 distrit and well I did not give you but I could not 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.080
 neither 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:18.380
 it's not that I have got this exactly and 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:21.050
 So what this allowed was that 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.669
 could interact on stage and the 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.410
 people see it acting and the 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.750
 graphic representation the animation by 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.130
 computer so and so real that you could 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.630
 see the chain the world type are the 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.400
 pants here by the knees good 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.979
 a really impressive thing that yes 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.340
 and that I think is certainly this 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:40.460
 could open the doors so that 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:42.380
 exceed more events of this type and 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:46.130
 it's even being talked about that tupac 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.660
 shakur could go on tour by means of 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.000
 what they call the holograms you say 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.230
 you then ask you running 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.990
 hype 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:56.630
 what artist would you like to have 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.430
 revived when I this technique that 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.980
 was morita wow 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.440
 there they make it very difficult for me but I think 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.060
 why do not you send it for 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.860
 live would be good to look for the 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.600
 sure and then if you tell us 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.640
 what artist would you like to see from vivid 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.350
 Puerto Ricans through twitter and 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.330
 God will know and it becomes reality because with 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.980
 that we will return in the next 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.180
 program is the assignment that we have 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:21.340
 wilton thank you for being here with 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.340
