simulation<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.509> world<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.990> use

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
simulation of the world I use

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.539 
simulation of the world I use
everything's<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.920> block<00:01:26.130> yeah<00:01:26.369> and

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
everything's in a block yeah and

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.100 
everything's in a block yeah and
sometimes<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.970> cut<00:01:27.119> down<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.270> tree<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.810> you

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
sometimes you cut down a tree and you

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.480 
sometimes you cut down a tree and you
know<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.350> block<00:01:28.500> doesn't<00:01:28.740> fall<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.220> kind<00:01:29.460> of

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
know the block doesn't fall that kind of

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.160 
know the block doesn't fall that kind of
thing<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:30.000> what<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.630> lot<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.869> science<00:01:31.079> teachers

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
thing but what a lot of science teachers

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.140 
thing but what a lot of science teachers
are<00:01:31.530> doing<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:31.979> they're<00:01:32.130> having<00:01:32.400> kids<00:01:32.610> map<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
are doing is they're having kids map the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.850 
are doing is they're having kids map the
physics<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.930> world<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.470> where<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.770> it

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
physics of this world and where is it

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.560 
physics of this world and where is it
the<00:01:34.950> same<00:01:35.100> as<00:01:35.159> as<00:01:35.520> real<00:01:35.790> world<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.329> where<00:01:36.479> is

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
the same as as real world and where is

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.910 
the same as as real world and where is
it<00:01:36.689> different<00:01:36.900> okay<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.590> they're<00:01:37.799> having

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
it different okay and they're having

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.550 
it different okay and they're having
kids<00:01:38.220> design<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.850> experiments<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:40.200> chart

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
kids design the experiments to chart

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.230 
kids design the experiments to chart
this<00:01:40.799> different<00:01:41.250> it's<00:01:41.790> teaching<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
this different it's teaching the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.480 
this different it's teaching the
scientific<00:01:42.780> method<00:01:43.110> using<00:01:43.590> Minecraft<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.280> feel

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
scientific method using Minecraft I feel

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.819 
scientific method using Minecraft I feel
like<00:01:44.610> there's<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:44.850> criticism<00:01:45.540> um<00:01:46.170> things

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
like there's this criticism um things

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.590 
like there's this criticism um things
like<00:01:46.979> teaching<00:01:47.640> using<00:01:47.850> Minecraft<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.450> maybe

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
like teaching using Minecraft and maybe

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.969 
like teaching using Minecraft and maybe
game<00:01:48.840> based<00:01:49.020> learning<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.409> general<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.860> don't

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
game based learning in general I don't

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.429 
game based learning in general I don't
think<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.820> game<00:01:51.329> based<00:01:51.540> learning<00:01:51.689> is<00:01:52.140> but<00:01:52.320> it

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
think that game based learning is but it

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.109 
think that game based learning is but it
should<00:01:52.590> supplant<00:01:53.070> any<00:01:53.490> traditional<00:01:54.030> learning

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
should supplant any traditional learning

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.870 
should supplant any traditional learning
methods<00:01:54.630> what<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.049> about<00:01:55.170> for<00:01:55.350> me<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:56.070> using

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
methods what it's about for me is using

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.490 
methods what it's about for me is using
a<00:01:56.969> teaching<00:01:57.329> tool<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:57.840> really<00:01:58.079> relevant

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
a teaching tool that is really relevant

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.469 
a teaching tool that is really relevant
to<00:01:58.710> your<00:01:58.979> kids<00:01:59.250> when<00:01:59.610> they're<00:01:59.820> in<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.149> moment

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
to your kids when they're in the moment

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.850 
to your kids when they're in the moment
when<00:02:00.600> they're<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.899> game<00:02:01.079> when<00:02:01.320> they're<00:02:01.500> in

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
when they're in the game when they're in

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.889 
when they're in the game when they're in
the<00:02:01.950> world<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.610> I've<00:02:02.880> created<00:02:03.240> block<00:02:03.689> by

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
the world that I've created block by

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.810 
the world that I've created block by
block<00:02:04.049> surrounded<00:02:04.710> by<00:02:04.799> content<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.549> want

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
block surrounded by content that I want

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.740 
block surrounded by content that I want
them<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.119> learn<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.600> have<00:02:06.990> never

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
them to learn I have never

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.900 
them to learn I have never
and<00:02:07.840> such<00:02:08.440> access<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:09.100> the<00:02:09.220> brains<00:02:09.520> of<00:02:09.789> these

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
and such access to the brains of these

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.760 
and such access to the brains of these
these<00:02:10.149> children<00:02:10.720> and<00:02:10.899> it's<00:02:11.320> been<00:02:11.500> really

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
these children and it's been really

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.620 
these children and it's been really
rewarding<00:02:11.980> for<00:02:12.280> me<00:02:12.340> professionally<00:02:12.670> and<00:02:13.480> the

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
rewarding for me professionally and the

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.180 
rewarding for me professionally and the
science<00:02:14.020> is<00:02:14.080> starting<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.710> catch<00:02:14.920> up<00:02:14.950> with

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
science is starting to catch up with

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.710 
science is starting to catch up with
this<00:02:15.460> if<00:02:15.670> it's<00:02:15.790> been<00:02:15.940> really<00:02:16.270> fascinating<00:02:16.690> to

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
this if it's been really fascinating to

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.690 
this if it's been really fascinating to
see<00:02:16.930> some<00:02:17.110> early<00:02:17.260> work<00:02:17.500> being<00:02:17.740> done<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:18.280> prove

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
see some early work being done to prove

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.130 
see some early work being done to prove
that<00:02:18.970> there<00:02:19.450> is<00:02:19.600> a<00:02:19.630> direct<00:02:19.780> connection

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
that there is a direct connection

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.110 
that there is a direct connection
between<00:02:20.440> this<00:02:20.800> increased<00:02:21.220> engagement<00:02:21.460> and

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
between this increased engagement and

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.910 
between this increased engagement and
the<00:02:22.720> amount<00:02:22.990> of<00:02:23.080> information<00:02:23.230> that's<00:02:23.710> that

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
the amount of information that's that

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.590 
the amount of information that's that
children<00:02:24.430> are<00:02:24.490> retaining<00:02:24.820> so<00:02:25.240> if<00:02:25.330> there<00:02:25.480> are

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
children are retaining so if there are

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.730 
children are retaining so if there are
teachers<00:02:25.810> out<00:02:26.050> there<00:02:26.080> who<00:02:26.260> want<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.620> get

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
teachers out there who want to get

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.380 
teachers out there who want to get
started<00:02:27.040> teaching<00:02:27.280> with<00:02:27.459> Minecraft<00:02:27.940> what<00:02:28.270> is

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
started teaching with Minecraft what is

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.090 
started teaching with Minecraft what is
the<00:02:28.600> what<00:02:28.990> what's<00:02:29.380> like<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.680> first<00:02:29.890> step

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
the what what's like the first step

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.290 
the what what's like the first step

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.390 
can go to my website minecraft edu
dot-com<00:02:33.550> and<00:02:33.880> we<00:02:34.150> have<00:02:34.390> some<00:02:35.380> materials<00:02:36.160> to

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
dot-com and we have some materials to

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.550 
dot-com and we have some materials to
get<00:02:36.760> started<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.390> some<00:02:37.840> ideas<00:02:38.110> for<00:02:38.320> things

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
get started and some ideas for things

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.870 
get started and some ideas for things
you<00:02:38.740> can<00:02:38.890> do<00:02:39.010> with<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.250> game<00:02:39.430> so<00:02:39.760> I<00:02:39.790> think

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
you can do with the game so I think

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.979 
you can do with the game so I think
that's<00:02:40.060> everything<00:02:40.150> that<00:02:40.420> we<00:02:40.600> have<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.840> ask
