00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.210

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.890
 every time you are in friesland she is 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.820
 stuck that these are the bread and 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.190
 butter and olives on the table 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.760
 everything has to be free no you have to 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.879

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.160

 something for the wiso is it twice 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.879
 that I thought 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.920
 because all the little things you have to 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:51.250
 pay the first annoying one 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:55.390
 the number one bureaucratic and number two 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.430
