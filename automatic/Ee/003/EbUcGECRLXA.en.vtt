00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
some of the pink wards actually timer I

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.560 
some of the pink wards actually timer I
don't<00:01:44.229> think<00:01:44.320> liquid<00:01:44.890> got<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.820> actual<00:01:46.299> timer

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.499 
don't think liquid got the actual timer
for<00:01:46.810> this<00:01:46.990> so<00:01:47.170> that's<00:01:47.350> why<00:01:48.149> TSM<00:01:49.149> are<00:01:49.240> able<00:01:49.420> to
