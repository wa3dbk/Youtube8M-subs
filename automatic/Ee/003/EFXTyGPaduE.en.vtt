00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
you don't know how to do this that's

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.070 
you don't know how to do this that's
probably<00:04:17.970> what<00:04:18.239> you're<00:04:18.359> going<00:04:18.540> to<00:04:18.630> need<00:04:18.780> so

probably what you're going to need so
we're<00:04:19.200> going<00:04:19.350> to<00:04:19.470> draw<00:04:19.680> on<00:04:19.709> the<00:04:20.070> face<00:04:20.400> with<00:04:20.970> a

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
we're going to draw on the face with a

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.140 
we're going to draw on the face with a
brown<00:04:21.630> TLS<00:04:22.320> mixture<00:04:22.950> and<00:04:23.130> it's<00:04:23.670> just<00:04:23.790> two<00:04:24.000> eyes

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
brown TLS mixture and it's just two eyes

brown TLS mixture and it's just two eyes
in<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.480> little<00:04:24.750> knows<00:04:24.960> nothing<00:04:25.500> special<00:04:25.830> and

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
in the little knows nothing special and

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:38.650 
in the little knows nothing special and
then<00:04:26.580> there<00:04:27.420> are<00:04:27.450> some<00:04:28.140> rosy<00:04:28.680> cheeks

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:58.150 

you

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.070 

so<00:04:59.160> that's<00:04:59.310> what<00:04:59.430> we<00:04:59.550> have<00:04:59.730> so<00:04:59.970> far<00:05:02.360> so<00:05:03.360> the

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
so that's what we have so far so the

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.920 
so that's what we have so far so the
next<00:05:04.410> and<00:05:05.040> final<00:05:05.070> step<00:05:05.880> is<00:05:06.120> making<00:05:06.360> the<00:05:06.660> little

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
next and final step is making the little

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.070 
next and final step is making the little
leaf<00:05:07.280> litter<00:05:08.280> like<00:05:08.850> the<00:05:09.000> leaf<00:05:09.180> hat<00:05:09.420> for<00:05:09.900> our

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
leaf litter like the leaf hat for our
