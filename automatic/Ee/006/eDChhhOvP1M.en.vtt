00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
right there so and now we need the hinge

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.430 
right there so and now we need the hinge
like<00:04:06.239> this<00:04:07.430> should<00:04:08.430> go<00:04:08.580> right<00:04:08.970> in<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.360> front

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
like this should go right in the front

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:20.750 
like this should go right in the front
right<00:04:11.430> there<00:04:13.430> and<00:04:14.430> now<00:04:16.130> back<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.160> finish<00:04:17.580> it<00:04:19.760> go

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
right there and now back to finish it go

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:30.800 
right there and now back to finish it go
