00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.270
 beautiful to everyone and league are always that 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.380
 speaks of the tenth filipi 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.749
 let's go back to making videos after a while 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.509
 of time meanwhile we apologize guys 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:15.719
 however it was not a very good time for 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.260
 us because some were too busy 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:23.009
 with the school check in 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.310
 that is, to be honest there was not 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:28.199
 however, not even the desire is more than that 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.359
 other also from your give up in the 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.759
 comparisons with you 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.559
 it seemed right to me to come back because 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.110
 we had given it no sign of life 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.660
 it was two weeks and I do it now 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.010
 what from a deck profile I had 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.840
 already posted though that they did one 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.190
 version of 2014 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.309
 a leap that I believe with the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.910
 next sachet will become a lot 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.590
 strong I think that jones and enclose the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.579
 its strength also seems however not a 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:00.600
 which psycho bunch compare and socom 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.679
 cyberduck bowling of these in this 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.510
 period 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:06.330
 nothing but we are directly from 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.799
 profile you already understood from the title 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.689
 that we talk about ourselves but sweet but sweet 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.470
 we start directly agree what to do 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.610
 then 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.430
 we have three of magic at once 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.210
 I played it in two pairs but I think that 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.240
 is really very strong and the absence of 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.600
 this step will therefore always see three 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:36.320
 couples or beirut cake will spin the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:40.500
 bunch is put to an ice cream then we have 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.110
 let's go for now we have 2 my game 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.020
 leaves and therefore a con because I liked it 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.040
 that I show you enough staff for i 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.979
 levels and in any case is a sweet more than 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.960
 deck that never hurts 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:02:01.250
 this is the sweet part but one 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:03.500
 sweet we have triple speed triple 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.500
 stryker 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.850
 excellent as a paper and also able to rotate 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:14.720
 double tg warhol and walk those 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:19.010
 monsters game to double rail and me 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:24.620
 also access to high sync 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:28.060
 wanting magic cards obviously double 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.310
 ticket was a bit alcohol post 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.170
 double castle increased by a 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.580
 ticket 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:41.989
 then we have a double typhoon game or not 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.630
 to the big ones because I like it but sincerely and 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.989
 then because he wanted some papers in place 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:52.760
 of well founded making then see as if 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:57.350
 no siphon circumstance and we have the 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:04.910
 double throw and a note these are from 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:07.489
 magic of course stryker sports e 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.390
 the thing lines in ice cream as we have 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:18.890
 cards in place 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:20.750
 art trap we want double palooza la 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:29.600
 game two because it has 3 seems to me 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:33.260
 quite heavy yes and then we have been 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.390
 with the tripe fien it says excellent game 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:44.630
 even with the hvaler but certainly not me 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:49.310
 weighs at all and then we play double 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:51.019
 prize that is too good against him 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.870
 strong even now there is a team 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:57.320
 however it is but in general the card that a 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:00.270
 I really like is a tt a hole 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:09.180
 trap trap not be a contest of 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:13.940

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.190
 find 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:56.180

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:58.590

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:04.940
