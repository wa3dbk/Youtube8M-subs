00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:32.500
 I'm Bent and I'm here on behalf of YouthBank. And take over in YouthBank internal 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:39.540
 I almost the entire content of this week's leadership. So I'm about one 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.910
 The content of the project was three quarters of a year, and I heard about the first conversation 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.710
 with the school management to the last - now almost a few hours ago - everything here too 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.980
 clarified with the school. The team still consists of a few more people and we have 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.540
 also divided between organization and content management, quasi. So I am 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.710
 not alone on the way here. But everything here is substantive and conceptual 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.280
 somehow had to be thought by me or at least I have 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.900
 because in any way spoken. And finally, the whole thing works 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.270
 In addition to that, I work for all persons in any way with this 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.420
 Project - not only from YouthBank - but somehow also from the HumboldtSchule 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.159
 even contact person is easy. We have 700 students in small groups of 25 who 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.090
 go through the entire process of a future workshop and emerge in such a process 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:36.310
 massive ideas. And the individual small groups - 28 in number - have each up 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.450
 to agree on the ten of her favorite project ideas. That means we have 28 small groups 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.049
 Received 10 project ideas and therefore there are currently 280 project ideas in circulation here, 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:02:03.810
 which we at best - so much of it - edit. Today we are at the 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.830
 Point at which the small groups are dissolved for the first time - easily - and the students 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.190
 and students work in topic groups. That means the topic groups are concerned 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.709
 with a concrete topic; Within the topic, people are looking for concrete problems 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.790
 and create solutions - projects - with which you can change them. And 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.310
 Tomorrow we will continue exactly with it. We have the chance again - so 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.650
 to work on these solutions, on these projects. There are parallel offers 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.120
 - Workshops offered to advance the students professionally 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.040
 in their project management activity and afterwards there is a big closing event 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.489
 - so a big final presentation - the whole school will be open; the theme rooms 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.150
 imagine; the pupils painted posters or painted posters 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.569
 and to guests, in this case to all the students who attend 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.280
 have worked on another topic and also all the teachers of this school, they will 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.209
 to introduce her project. There will also be a chance during this phase that 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.750
 All students of this school have the chance for their favorite project 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:04:47.090
 to vote. The idea of ​​the Humboldt Revolution came from the 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.530
 Student body. We support this idea very much - think that it is a good idea 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.060
 that there are no devalued projects, but all projects are supported 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:02.520
 and we will also support all projects - as far as we can - and find that 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.039
 that was a great success. Because it is just through this Humboldt revolution 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.380
 - it has just come about that the original gradation of projects - what 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.639
 Max just said - that practically a few practically fall under the table and worse 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.570
 stand as they really are - if only the best eight are chosen for 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.169
 the financing - that's exactly what happened through this action practically. Because 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:29.350
 the school has overwhelmingly argued that all projects 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:47.860
 should be treated the same, because all projects are good. 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.259
 Dear students of the Humboldt Gymnasium, I hope you could do the week 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:56.919
 enjoy, enjoy so much responsibility for you and your school itself. 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:00.860
 What you started with the Humboldt Revolution you continue and I'm sure 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.360
 that then this school will evolve into a dream school of hopefully everybody and us soon 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.750
 hopefully everyone likes to go to school.
