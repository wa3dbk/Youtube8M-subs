00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.910 
saying like your income and all that
really<00:03:47.880> you<00:03:48.600> know<00:03:48.860> determines<00:03:49.860> your

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
really you know determines your

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.410 
really you know determines your
lifestyle<00:03:50.340> which<00:03:50.490> I<00:03:50.640> know<00:03:50.700> I'm<00:03:50.850> key<00:03:51.090> on<00:03:51.240> and

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
lifestyle which I know I'm key on and

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.680 
lifestyle which I know I'm key on and
getting<00:03:51.570> way<00:03:51.930> out<00:03:52.200> of<00:03:52.610> you<00:03:53.610> know<00:03:53.760> out<00:03:54.060> of<00:03:54.570> my

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
getting way out of you know out of my

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.600 
getting way out of you know out of my
review<00:03:55.050> but<00:03:55.110> I<00:03:55.590> just<00:03:56.070> thought<00:03:56.220> that<00:03:56.280> was

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
review but I just thought that was

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.370 
review but I just thought that was
really<00:03:56.760> effective<00:03:57.360> in<00:03:57.510> this<00:03:57.660> series<00:03:57.900> because

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
really effective in this series because

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.530 
really effective in this series because
they<00:03:59.190> are<00:03:59.430> supposed<00:03:59.850> to<00:03:59.880> be<00:04:00.000> kind<00:04:00.240> of<00:04:00.270> like<00:04:00.420> the

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
they are supposed to be kind of like the

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.480 
they are supposed to be kind of like the
same<00:04:00.720> person<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:01.200> even<00:04:01.260> stated<00:04:01.800> in<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.340> book

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
same person and even stated in the book

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.310 
same person and even stated in the book
so<00:04:02.760> I<00:04:03.060> did<00:04:03.540> not<00:04:03.690> really<00:04:03.900> understand<00:04:04.200> why

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
so I did not really understand why

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.250 
so I did not really understand why
people<00:04:04.620> were<00:04:04.709> complaining<00:04:04.950> I<00:04:05.900> again<00:04:06.900> I

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
people were complaining I again I

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.900 
people were complaining I again I
thought<00:04:07.800> the<00:04:07.950> two<00:04:08.100> characters<00:04:08.520> were<00:04:08.670> great

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
thought the two characters were great

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.170

dystopian is uh you know obviously this

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.710 
dystopian is uh you know obviously this
society<00:05:13.100> again<00:05:13.340> like<00:05:13.490> most<00:05:13.760> dystopian<00:05:14.330> it

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
society again like most dystopian it

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.060 
society again like most dystopian it
used<00:05:14.990> to<00:05:15.050> be<00:05:15.169> the<00:05:15.289> United<00:05:15.590> States<00:05:15.740> and<00:05:15.979> now

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070

used to be the United States and now
it's<00:05:16.340> no<00:05:16.490> longer<00:05:16.520> the<00:05:16.940> United<00:05:17.240> States<00:05:17.389> well

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
it's no longer the United States well

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.990 
it's no longer the United States well
what's<00:05:18.139> really<00:05:18.289> interesting<00:05:18.770> is<00:05:19.280> that<00:05:19.370> and

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
what's really interesting is that and

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.689 
what's really interesting is that and
they<00:05:20.900> really<00:05:21.380> just<00:05:21.410> briefly<00:05:21.949> touch<00:05:22.250> on<00:05:22.490> it

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:22.699 
they really just briefly touch on it

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:25.839 
they really just briefly touch on it
that<00:05:23.389> the<00:05:24.259> United<00:05:24.620> States<00:05:24.740> is<00:05:25.190> like<00:05:25.430> a<00:05:25.460> myth

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:25.849 
that the United States is like a myth

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:28.330 
that the United States is like a myth
like<00:05:26.210> its<00:05:26.720> people<00:05:27.320> think<00:05:27.530> that<00:05:27.620> that's<00:05:27.830> just

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
like its people think that that's just

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.180 
like its people think that that's just
like<00:05:28.550> a<00:05:28.699> story<00:05:29.120> that<00:05:29.690> that<00:05:29.900> never<00:05:30.110> existed<00:05:30.320> so

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
like a story that that never existed so

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.430 
like a story that that never existed so
they<00:05:31.520> didn't<00:05:31.699> really<00:05:31.849> touch<00:05:32.060> much<00:05:32.539> on<00:05:32.810> how

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
they didn't really touch much on how

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.640 
they didn't really touch much on how
this<00:05:34.310> world<00:05:34.520> became<00:05:34.880> to<00:05:35.120> be<00:05:35.150> this<00:05:35.960> Republic

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
this world became to be this Republic

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.270 
this world became to be this Republic
I'm<00:05:36.919> curious<00:05:37.639> to<00:05:37.849> see<00:05:38.060> if<00:05:38.710> Murray<00:05:39.710> lose<00:05:39.979> other

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280
