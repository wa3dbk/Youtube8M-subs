00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
the rich pin video which I highly

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.589 
the rich pin video which I highly
suggest<00:00:15.330> it's<00:00:15.809> very<00:00:16.109> very<00:00:16.379> helpful<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:17.640> the

good<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.989> air<00:00:22.169> channel<00:00:22.710> works<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.449> I<00:00:24.649> cleaned

00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:25.649 
good the air channel works I I cleaned

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:31.879 
good the air channel works I I cleaned
out<00:00:28.519> the<00:00:29.749> stainless<00:00:30.749> steel<00:00:30.779> tube<00:00:31.409> which<00:00:31.739> was

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:31.889 
out the stainless steel tube which was

00:00:31.889 --> 00:00:34.160 
out the stainless steel tube which was
packed<00:00:32.130> with<00:00:32.279> carbon<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.510> if<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:33.989> do<00:00:34.140> all

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
packed with carbon and if you do all

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.650 
packed with carbon and if you do all
that<00:00:34.350> stuff<00:00:34.769> and<00:00:35.579> your<00:00:35.699> solenoids<00:00:36.269> working

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
that stuff and your solenoids working

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.319 
that stuff and your solenoids working
and<00:00:36.780> you've<00:00:36.870> got<00:00:37.050> vacuumed<00:00:37.649> then<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:39.030> next

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
and you've got vacuumed then the next

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.389 
and you've got vacuumed then the next
thing<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.660> do<00:00:39.839> which<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.440> kind<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.710> painful<00:00:40.980> is

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
thing to do which is kind of painful is

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.750 
thing to do which is kind of painful is
to<00:00:41.550> take<00:00:41.789> off<00:00:42.030> your<00:00:42.269> manifold<00:00:44.989> and<00:00:45.989> make<00:00:46.289> sure

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
to take off your manifold and make sure

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.540 
to take off your manifold and make sure
that<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.059> air<00:00:48.269> channels<00:00:49.129> right<00:00:50.129> here<00:00:52.280> are<00:00:53.280> all

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
that the air channels right here are all

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.110 
that the air channels right here are all
clear<00:00:53.999> of<00:00:54.149> carbon<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.129> also<00:00:56.129> you're<00:00:56.940> going<00:00:57.059> to

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
clear of carbon and also you're going to

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.200 
clear of carbon and also you're going to
take<00:00:57.359> all<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.749> off<00:00:58.010> make<00:00:59.010> sure<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.999> you

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
take all that off make sure that you

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.639 
take all that off make sure that you
clear<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.589> air<00:01:01.739> channels<00:01:02.339> right<00:01:02.609> here<00:01:03.239> and

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
clear the air channels right here and

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.960 
clear the air channels right here and
there<00:01:04.649> and<00:01:04.970> there<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.409> there<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.640> it<00:01:08.640> can<00:01:08.820> be

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
there and there and there and it can be

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.730 
there and there and there and it can be
really<00:01:09.149> hard<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.540> tell<00:01:09.810> if<00:01:09.930> these<00:01:10.079> are<00:01:10.320> clear

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
really hard to tell if these are clear

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.870 
really hard to tell if these are clear
so<00:01:11.579> here<00:01:12.479> let<00:01:12.659> me<00:01:12.689> show<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.439> just<00:01:13.670> used<00:01:14.670> a

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
so here let me show you I just used a

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.749 
so here let me show you I just used a
wire<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:16.130> you<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.340> see<00:01:17.780> that<00:01:19.610> that<00:01:20.610> when

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
wire and you can see that that when

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.530 
wire and you can see that that when
they're<00:01:20.939> clear<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:22.530> wire<00:01:22.829> should<00:01:23.430> with<00:01:24.210> some

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
they're clear the wire should with some

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:32.959 
they're clear the wire should with some
finagling<00:01:30.140> be<00:01:31.140> able<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.619> go<00:01:31.799> all<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.579> way<00:01:32.610> in

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969 
finagling be able to go all the way in

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:36.980 
finagling be able to go all the way in
see<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.380> took<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.770> little<00:01:34.950> bit<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.990> working

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
see that it took a little bit of working

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.779 
see that it took a little bit of working
but<00:01:37.670> you<00:01:38.670> see<00:01:38.909> how<00:01:39.090> far<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:40.399> goes<00:01:41.399> back

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
but you see how far that goes back

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.899 
but you see how far that goes back
probably<00:01:42.479> goes<00:01:42.840> back<00:01:43.109> further<00:01:43.409> but<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:44.250> had<00:01:44.759> to

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
probably goes back further but I had to

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.999 
probably goes back further but I had to
dig<00:01:45.149> at<00:01:45.359> it<00:01:45.539> and<00:01:45.689> pick<00:01:45.899> at<00:01:46.109> it<00:01:46.289> with<00:01:46.469> this<00:01:46.649> wire

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
dig at it and pick at it with this wire

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.330 
dig at it and pick at it with this wire
and<00:01:47.399> with<00:01:48.000> carburetor<00:01:48.570> cleaner<00:01:48.950> for<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> very

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
and with carburetor cleaner for a very

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.969 
and with carburetor cleaner for a very
long<00:01:50.670> time<00:01:50.700> before<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.899> got<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.829> what

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
long time before I got this this is what

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.160 
long time before I got this this is what
you<00:01:53.100> want<00:01:53.340> right<00:01:53.609> here<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.659> want<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.049> be

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
you want right here you want it to be

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.340 
you want right here you want it to be
able<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.500> go<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.039> out<00:01:56.960> clean<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.109> out<00:01:58.170> with

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
able to go in and out clean it out with

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.609 
able to go in and out clean it out with
carb<00:01:58.710> cleaner

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
carb cleaner

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.380 
carb cleaner
I<00:01:59.649> also<00:02:00.340> used<00:02:00.909> a<00:02:02.070> shop-vac<00:02:03.070> which<00:02:03.880> I<00:02:04.030> fitted

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
I also used a shop-vac which I fitted

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.869 
I also used a shop-vac which I fitted
with<00:02:04.570> some<00:02:04.960> vinyl<00:02:05.380> tubes<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:08.580> suck<00:02:09.580> everything

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
with some vinyl tubes to suck everything

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:15.780 
with some vinyl tubes to suck everything
out<00:02:10.179> but<00:02:10.840> now<00:02:11.110> here's<00:02:12.040> how<00:02:12.250> I<00:02:12.280> tested<00:02:12.879> it<00:02:14.790> this

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
out but now here's how I tested it this

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.009 
out but now here's how I tested it this
is<00:02:16.319> this<00:02:17.319> is<00:02:17.530> from<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:17.920> cheap<00:02:18.190> Harbor<00:02:18.670> Freight

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
is this is from a cheap Harbor Freight

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:25.500 
is this is from a cheap Harbor Freight
leader<00:02:20.019> valve<00:02:20.319> kit<00:02:21.000> just<00:02:22.000> a<00:02:24.060> it's<00:02:25.060> just<00:02:25.209> a
