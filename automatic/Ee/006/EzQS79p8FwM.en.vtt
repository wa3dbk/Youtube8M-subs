this<00:00:22.530> is<00:00:22.740> 1,200<00:00:23.640> watts<00:00:23.790> of<00:00:24.150> pure<00:00:24.660> power<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.650> mean

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
this is 1,200 watts of pure power I mean

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.400 
this is 1,200 watts of pure power I mean
I<00:00:26.400> had<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.580> kit<00:00:26.850> with<00:00:26.970> two<00:00:27.210> lights<00:00:27.420> I'm<00:00:27.780> shooting

so<00:01:46.670> today<00:01:46.970> for<00:01:47.180> storage<00:01:47.479> solutions<00:01:48.020> I'm<00:01:48.320> using

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
so today for storage solutions I'm using

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.359 
so today for storage solutions I'm using

it's<00:01:52.880> a<00:01:53.000> 160<00:01:53.570> megabyte<00:01:53.990> card<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:54.560> in<00:01:54.950> this

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
it's a 160 megabyte card and in this

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.609 
it's a 160 megabyte card and in this
case<00:01:55.310> I'm<00:01:55.490> using<00:01:55.520> a<00:01:55.850> 64<00:01:56.360> gigabyte<00:01:56.600> these<00:01:57.229> cards

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
case I'm using a 64 gigabyte these cards

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.200 
case I'm using a 64 gigabyte these cards
are<00:01:57.770> just<00:01:57.799> extremely<00:01:58.490> fast<00:01:58.729> I<00:01:58.909> mean<00:01:59.090> they're

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
are just extremely fast I mean they're

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.910 
are just extremely fast I mean they're
really<00:01:59.360> taking<00:01:59.659> the<00:01:59.869> most<00:02:00.080> potential<00:02:00.560> out<00:02:00.740> of

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
really taking the most potential out of

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.980 
really taking the most potential out of
your<00:02:01.070> camera<00:02:01.280> possible<00:02:01.909> I'm<00:02:02.479> shooting<00:02:02.869> with

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
your camera possible I'm shooting with

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.800 
your camera possible I'm shooting with
the<00:02:03.110> mark<00:02:03.320> 3<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:03.850> I'm<00:02:04.850> doing<00:02:05.240> continuous

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
the mark 3 and I'm doing continuous

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.290 
the mark 3 and I'm doing continuous
shots<00:02:06.770> and<00:02:07.130> it's<00:02:07.340> as<00:02:07.490> fast

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
shots and it's as fast

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.930 
shots and it's as fast
buffering<00:02:09.080> speed<00:02:09.440> is<00:02:09.709> like<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.160> none<00:02:10.519> so

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
buffering speed is like to none so

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.750 
buffering speed is like to none so
you're<00:02:11.120> easily<00:02:11.540> getting<00:02:11.750> 10<00:02:12.620> 12<00:02:13.069> 14<00:02:13.310> more

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
you're easily getting 10 12 14 more

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.370 
you're easily getting 10 12 14 more
shots<00:02:14.060> than<00:02:14.300> you<00:02:14.390> would<00:02:14.540> with<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.870> previous

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
shots than you would with the previous
