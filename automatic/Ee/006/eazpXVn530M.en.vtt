00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
impact on the two-party system I think a

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.039 
impact on the two-party system I think a
lot<00:04:09.849> of<00:04:09.879> voters<00:04:10.239> probably<00:04:10.659> feel<00:04:10.810> like<00:04:10.930> they

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
lot of voters probably feel like they

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.780 
lot of voters probably feel like they

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
just kind of going for the least bad

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.129 
just kind of going for the least bad
option<00:04:15.489> we've<00:04:16.060> seen<00:04:16.329> a<00:04:16.359> lot<00:04:16.449> of<00:04:16.599> tearing<00:04:17.049> the

time<00:04:28.360> for<00:04:28.750> that<00:04:28.900> kind<00:04:29.110> of<00:04:29.169> foolishness

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
time for that kind of foolishness

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.290 
time for that kind of foolishness
anymore<00:04:30.070> if<00:04:30.400> you<00:04:30.550> want<00:04:30.729> to<00:04:30.820> change<00:04:31.060> something

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
anymore if you want to change something

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.540 
anymore if you want to change something
this<00:04:31.900> is<00:04:32.050> one<00:04:32.349> way<00:04:32.560> to<00:04:32.620> do<00:04:32.860> it<00:04:33.039> it's<00:04:33.310> something

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
this is one way to do it it's something

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.430 
this is one way to do it it's something
new<00:04:33.880> it's<00:04:34.120> something<00:04:34.449> to<00:04:34.539> try<00:04:34.750> you<00:04:35.139> know<00:04:35.259> get

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
new it's something to try you know get

00:04:35.440 --> 00:05:09.989 
new it's something to try you know get
involved<00:04:35.710> and<00:04:36.009> find<00:04:36.190> out<00:04:36.340> what<00:04:36.490> it<00:04:36.580> is

00:05:09.989 --> 00:05:09.999 

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:13.059 

this<00:05:10.999> this<00:05:11.330> movement<00:05:11.599> I<00:05:11.929> think<00:05:12.229> might<00:05:12.709> become

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:13.069 
this this movement I think might become

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:14.679 
this this movement I think might become
something<00:05:13.339> big<00:05:13.699> by<00:05:13.879> waking<00:05:14.119> up<00:05:14.389> the<00:05:14.539> two

00:05:14.679 --> 00:05:14.689 
something big by waking up the two

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:16.329 
something big by waking up the two
parties<00:05:15.139> that<00:05:15.409> if<00:05:15.559> not<00:05:15.739> but<00:05:15.919> neither<00:05:16.099> one<00:05:16.309> of

00:05:16.329 --> 00:05:16.339 
parties that if not but neither one of

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:17.949 
parties that if not but neither one of
them<00:05:16.580> doing<00:05:16.699> their<00:05:16.849> job<00:05:17.059> very<00:05:17.269> well<00:05:17.389> I<00:05:17.809> think

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:17.959 
them doing their job very well I think

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:20.049 
them doing their job very well I think
Americans<00:05:18.469> elect<00:05:18.619> is<00:05:18.799> important<00:05:19.279> because<00:05:19.759> it

00:05:20.049 --> 00:05:20.059 
Americans elect is important because it

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:22.059 
Americans elect is important because it
does<00:05:20.239> give<00:05:20.449> a<00:05:20.479> third<00:05:20.719> option<00:05:20.869> vote<00:05:21.619> for<00:05:21.919> who

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:22.069 
does give a third option vote for who

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:24.309 
does give a third option vote for who
you<00:05:22.339> want<00:05:22.549> to<00:05:22.669> see<00:05:22.849> as<00:05:23.149> president<00:05:23.689> not<00:05:23.929> vote

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:24.319 
you want to see as president not vote

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:27.399 
you want to see as president not vote
for<00:05:24.369> the<00:05:25.369> party<00:05:25.629> every<00:05:26.629> movement<00:05:26.809> starts<00:05:27.259> with

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.409 
for the party every movement starts with

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.469 
for the party every movement starts with
a<00:05:27.439> little<00:05:27.679> tiny<00:05:27.919> thing<00:05:28.399> somewhere<00:05:28.909> get

a little tiny thing somewhere get

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:30.999 
a little tiny thing somewhere get
