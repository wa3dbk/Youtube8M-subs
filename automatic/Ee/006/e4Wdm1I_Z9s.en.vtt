00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.700 
parking brake shoes and hardware on a 65
to<00:00:06.990> 80<00:00:07.230> two<00:00:07.470> Corvettes<00:00:09.230> let's<00:00:10.230> start<00:00:10.469> out<00:00:10.559> with

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
to 80 two Corvettes let's start out with

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.759 
to 80 two Corvettes let's start out with
the<00:00:10.860> parking<00:00:11.250> brake<00:00:11.400> shoes<00:00:11.670> here<00:00:12.530> what<00:00:13.530> we<00:00:13.620> do

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
the parking brake shoes here what we do

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.140 
the parking brake shoes here what we do
is<00:00:13.860> we<00:00:14.009> install<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:15.199> adjuster<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.880> the<00:00:17.880> lower

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
is we install the adjuster and the lower

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.070 
is we install the adjuster and the lower
spring<00:00:18.630> on<00:00:18.869> first<00:00:21.410> then<00:00:22.410> we<00:00:23.750> take<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.810> piece<00:00:25.019> of

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
spring on first then we take a piece of

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.370 
spring on first then we take a piece of
tape<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.710> tape<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.490> one<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.939> spring

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
tape and tape it to one of the spring

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.529 
tape and tape it to one of the spring
pins<00:00:28.550> and<00:00:29.550> tape<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:29.970> back<00:00:30.060> side<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.449> the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
pins and tape it to the back side of the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.870 
pins and tape it to the back side of the
assembly<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.289> keeps<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.189> from<00:00:32.309> pushing<00:00:32.730> out

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
assembly so it keeps it from pushing out

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.910 
assembly so it keeps it from pushing out
what<00:00:33.809> we're<00:00:33.930> going<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.079> do<00:00:34.200> first<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.649> we're

going to take the shoes and wrap it
around<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.570> assembly<00:00:39.570> here

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.459

and you'll notice that there's a pin in

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:48.040 
and you'll notice that there's a pin in
here<00:00:45.739> this<00:00:46.489> pin<00:00:46.789> should<00:00:47.030> always<00:00:47.420> be<00:00:47.719> in<00:00:47.839> there

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
here this pin should always be in there

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.319 
here this pin should always be in there
and<00:00:48.530> we're<00:00:48.739> going<00:00:48.859> to<00:00:48.949> install<00:00:49.309> it<00:00:49.370> into<00:00:50.210> this

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.100 

next<00:01:03.579> we'll<00:01:03.730> take<00:01:03.910> our<00:01:04.120> spring<00:01:04.780> and<00:01:04.960> spring

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
next we'll take our spring and spring

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.550 
next we'll take our spring and spring
cup<00:01:05.409> and<00:01:05.820> use<00:01:06.820> a<00:01:06.850> thin<00:01:07.210> set<00:01:07.450> of<00:01:07.630> needle<00:01:08.440> nose

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.359 

and<00:01:15.860> slide<00:01:16.700> it<00:01:17.000> over<00:01:17.210> top<00:01:19.750> of<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:20.990> spring<00:01:21.369> pin

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
and slide it over top of the spring pin

00:01:22.369 --> 00:02:08.660 
and slide it over top of the spring pin
and<00:01:22.640> then<00:01:23.630> you<00:01:23.720> push<00:01:23.899> it<00:01:23.930> down
