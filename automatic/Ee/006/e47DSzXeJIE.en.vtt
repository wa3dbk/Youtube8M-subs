good portion of them hard to remember
all<00:03:32.870> of<00:03:32.900> them<00:03:33.140> especially<00:03:33.260> when<00:03:33.680> I'm<00:03:33.799> kind<00:03:33.890> of

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
all of them especially when I'm kind of

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.339 
all of them especially when I'm kind of
rush<00:03:34.129> into<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.519> area<00:03:34.840> so<00:03:35.840> I<00:03:36.340> got<00:03:37.340> all<00:03:37.459> this

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
rush into the area so I got all this

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:47.500 
rush into the area so I got all this
dispels<00:03:41.200> and<00:03:42.200> I<00:03:42.349> got<00:03:42.970> all<00:03:43.970> of<00:03:44.239> the<00:03:46.239> statues<00:03:47.239> I

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
dispels and I got all of the statues I

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.259 
dispels and I got all of the statues I
think<00:03:47.930> that<00:03:48.230> is<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:49.430> only<00:03:49.519> thing<00:03:49.790> that<00:03:49.940> really

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
think that is the only thing that really

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.319 
think that is the only thing that really
goes<00:03:50.450> on<00:03:50.659> to<00:03:51.379> the<00:03:51.500> next<00:03:51.739> level<00:03:52.250> I<00:03:52.519> don't<00:03:52.879> think

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
goes on to the next level I don't think

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.960 
goes on to the next level I don't think
it<00:03:53.540> cares<00:03:53.959> how<00:03:54.349> many<00:03:54.409> of<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.769> plants<00:03:55.489> you<00:03:55.639> get

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
it cares how many of the plants you get

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.000 
it cares how many of the plants you get

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.540 

and<00:04:47.449> then<00:04:47.990> a<00:04:48.020> little<00:04:48.169> let<00:04:48.350> me<00:04:48.500> go<00:04:49.009> to<00:04:49.070> the<00:04:49.340> third

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
and then a little let me go to the third

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.140 
and then a little let me go to the third
level<00:04:49.880> um<00:04:50.360> it's<00:04:51.610> think<00:04:52.610> that<00:04:52.729> this<00:04:52.880> is<00:04:53.030> gonna

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
level um it's think that this is gonna

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.879 
level um it's think that this is gonna
be<00:04:53.389> the<00:04:53.570> end<00:04:53.690> of<00:04:53.780> my<00:04:53.900> request<00:04:54.229> set<00:04:54.440> or<00:04:54.740> my

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
be the end of my request set or my

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.279 
be the end of my request set or my
initial<00:04:55.220> set<00:04:55.370> it's<00:04:56.180> an<00:04:56.330> okay<00:04:56.630> game<00:04:56.840> it's<00:04:57.110> not

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 
initial set it's an okay game it's not

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:58.060

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
incredible

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.450 
incredible
I<00:04:58.360> like<00:04:59.360> the<00:04:59.509> repeatable<00:04:59.990> nature<00:05:00.380> of<00:05:00.470> it<00:05:00.800> it<00:05:01.340> is

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
I like the repeatable nature of it it is

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.340 
I like the repeatable nature of it it is
a<00:05:01.490> really<00:05:01.940> good<00:05:02.090> time<00:05:02.419> wasting<00:05:02.870> type<00:05:03.050> of<00:05:03.199> game

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
a really good time wasting type of game

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.270 
a really good time wasting type of game
especially<00:05:03.560> if<00:05:03.860> you<00:05:03.919> want<00:05:04.070> to<00:05:04.130> catch

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
especially if you want to catch

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.620 
especially if you want to catch
everything<00:05:04.729> or<00:05:04.880> collect<00:05:05.120> everything<00:05:05.330> or

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
everything or collect everything or

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.999 
everything or collect everything or
