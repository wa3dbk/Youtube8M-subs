00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.650
 Hello there I am I would like you once 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.370
 Show a bit like me with one 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:12.690
 suitcase made of short bin currently level 68 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:16.949
 and have around seven farmers 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.750
 which arranged so that I single 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.060
 I'll tell you once 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.920
 that means that many are like that 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.789
 if you build a wall around it 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.769
 as soon as it is broken you are 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.900
 throughout the camp that's not me 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.510
 so that really means every single one 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.579
 a bit demarcated that you just 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.390
 not completely empty so quickly 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.730
 can be 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.309
 Now you want to show attack on me 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.629
 is it so I mostly go to bubis 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.649
 I really buuntil lots of 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.700
 publisher that I still have one 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.430
 a little something can tear 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:01:03.830
 and then let's see what was there 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:01:07.439
 So it can get that way here 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.479
 striking feature with the with the 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.040
 devices 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.040
 I'm basically attacking that 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.400
 Relatively like because I know that he 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.259
 itself or the opponent just a whole 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.840
 time long i was online because im 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.790
 normal case I say the front door one has 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.650
 yes always his graves away when 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.860
 you get a bit of lexi for that 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.329
 and if the graves are still there 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.680
 then I know okay he just does not have 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.030
 He has done that, too 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.490
 most likely the bombs are not 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.479
 reactivated and so is the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.090
 Probably very big that me 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.000
 without bombs the then really nice 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.220
 can make 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.220
 we look times which is nothing here 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:58.720
 nothing too little 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.910
 only there is always a reasonably good 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:21.640
 it was already against the gold 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.820
 97000 but the hero is still 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.820
 Not 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.180
 but that looks like I said just now 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.430
 again paraguay was there then try 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.800
 we are lucky we try it 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.440
 here only times just gently 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.500
 I can see that I'm there 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.200
 quite a bit of gold since then I've ever 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.780
 neatly kranenburg also teacher 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.680
 clearly because he was not online anymore 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.000
 since the last attack and its 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.410
 just a little something easy 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.630
 just look for the graves because they yes 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.850
 okay that was not quite a while 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.890
 on-line 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.350
 so now we're going to watch hofer the best 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:15.390
 I would almost say it in here 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:17.250
 the area and during the attack week 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.950
 Let's see I always try it 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.450
 a blue alex here actually the 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.160
 Mine launcher already out of service too 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.230
 put that I only had now 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.000
 once blue as alex you are now 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.010
 not different if I am myself 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.040
 a mine-thrower her especially now 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.930
 just with bobbies not so much on one 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.330
 build grape because clear 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.450
 the bullet comes and all bubis gone 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:43.380
 That's why I always say in small steps 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.000
 something they buuntil 567 and if it 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.290
 be made as in television halt 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.390
 hit it out so look what have 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.690
 we still here 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.380
 but there is still a little small load 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.940
 to do a job 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:05.880
 there is still something russian was here 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:13.920
 times by after him throwers finished there 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:15.630
 is still a bit of what the yes 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.980
 Super 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.390
 I will not become the city hall like this 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.090
 get broken but that's enough for me 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:27.060
 I'm totally 60 percent so 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.460
 otherwise that does not fit in the beginning either 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.530
 too much for the bookies because you will 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.660
 you will remember later 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.100
 happy if you lose or 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.740
 maybe even deliberately lose 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.630
 because you just really from poe so far 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.790
 you are too high up and a lot 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.920
 harder opponents have just as a tip 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.990
 as I said it was a first 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.540
 video and if you liked it 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.110
 just comment on how to subscribe 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.370
 you want 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.570
 and then maybe we'll see each other 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.570
 next time bite then
