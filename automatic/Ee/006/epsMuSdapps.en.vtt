00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:13.630
 or the snake is what needs to be done 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:17.880
 to be able to take advantage of that we go 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.880
 well it has to do with something very simple 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.930
 how do you know how to leave loyalties wrong 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.120
 understood from the side that means 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.190
 misunderstood loyalties for example 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.590
 a year and we do not know what we've talked about 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:37.190
 of our videos are produced 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.070
 they give many new opportunities from 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:44.110
 It's shady business until you partner with 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.110
 someone very careful with that 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.300
 there is a lot of possibility of changes of 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.700
 work 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.829
 good thing is that 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.960
 in some way to the best 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:59.859
 to take advantage of the opportunities 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.860
 it is again I insist to start being loyal 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:05.640
 with yourself 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.370
 here I mean I have a job 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.159
 and I'm not comfortable at work there's no 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.630
 a good environment do not treat me well no 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.470
 they earn enough 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.630
 although it takes years 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.450
 Many people do not dare to change 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.930
 that work because there's going to be all of 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.580
 the years that I've been here most likely 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.220
 is that with some excuse I do not have 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.380
 pay 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.260
 then the truth is that one has to 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.090
 for yourself by your pocket then 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.580
 what would I recommend york a year 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.780
 of the snake like this is you or the 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.780
 new labor authority 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.410
 think about it and change 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.560
 for waivers this did with 30 days of 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.920
 anticipation you speak at work that you 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.870
 interest and start in a new job 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.870
 that is the best option now 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.430
 something we had also talked about that 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.930
 this year is a year in which things 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.900
 they are not what they seem in which there is 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.950
 be careful where you have to know 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.630
 move 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.240
 Surf the year speak 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.380
 good if I change to a job that 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.610
 later I did not like it 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.690
 but another voice appears and the one of work 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.970
 you will see that a can if it is a 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:30.840
 can but you're looking for a better 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.840
 convenience for one s pocket 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.290
 it really can be the possibility to do 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.540
 a business of your own someone suddenly you 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.370
 I talk about food at risk in chile 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.519
 let's talk about how I do Siege of the 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.140
 corfo and it turns out that for an idea that you 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.780
 you have I'm going to lend you money is going to be 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.610
 the reality and your partner is the bank that 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.610
 it could be interesting to get ahead 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.609
 you have the possibility of having a 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.490
 partnership with someone in a business a lot 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.410
 watch out 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.180
 first as long as you know him 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.520
 I asked him in the who 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.800
 I would ask the date of birth thing 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.380
 is to know by Chinese signs and if I do not feel 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.090
 exactly like that person and if there 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.819
 something that does not give me good thorn is not going 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.489
 and it's over 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.230
 many times that I had the idea of 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.879
 do something with you when a partner is 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.499
 too interested some in turns 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:25.530
 indispensable and indispensable 

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:25.530
 for one until then the governments 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.240
 when the opportunities of the 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.240
 style 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.580
 a construction company for example wants 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.650
 buy the place where you live because 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.180
 they want to make a building 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.480
 great care 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.140
 the adviser of well make sure well of 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.680
 to know 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.680
 what 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.360
 with the tax assessment of being what it gives 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:05.030
 what is the commercial appraisal if you have it 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.030
 for the solid location 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.550
 and now in prices and the price much 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.640
 smaller than what you would like 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.470
 then the sales in the company in 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.970
 this case in this example which is 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.519
 desperate to buy it title these 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.780
 desperate because they pay you less than 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:25.610
 what they are worth, they ask you 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:30.430
 and presents for example the opportunity 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.430
 and continue to another city or another country 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.390
 and is now presented in the attending gent 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.560
 I 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:42.520
 look 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.919
 on a trip to investigate the place and see 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.440
 the possibility of finding a place 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.780
 Where is comfortable for a price that is 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.669
 relatively reasonable relatively 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.250
 near where you could supposedly 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:56.350
 work this kind of thing but not 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.389
 will be changed to take risks 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.330
 like that in the year of the dragon the year 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.070
 previous in this case 2012 if not what 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.860
 you did in the year of the dragon not you 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.720
 you risk in the year of the snake 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.960
 except 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.960
 have a snake in your family 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.960
 except
