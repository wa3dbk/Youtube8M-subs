00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040
 Memories of Gunpla Kit Review Collection Mobile Fighter g Gundam 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:11.750
 Speed ​​Grade Collection God Gundam 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:15.740
 The Speed ​​Grade Collection God Gundam was released in 2008 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.430
 The 4th edition of the Speed ​​Grade Collection Series-The Last Kit in the Series 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.700
 It 's 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:23.570
 Just like when it was time for Gundam Towing Gundam 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:27.030
 There are no snacks in the sack, but the box with a small window 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.730
 Even if it is the best package , there is nothing to say 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:33.290
 Hey it was 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.950
 The price of the fit is 933 yen, which is about 200 yen higher than Gundam and Wing Gundam 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.710
 You 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:41.040
 I'm cheesy sizing of the four corners of what a bummer 0 after all this box fee Is box is dislodged 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.190
 Hey But 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.330
 Tito is proportional to the master grade version 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.450
 The overall design is slim, thanks to the lower body 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:55.890
 The upper body can take various poses 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:58.260
 Moreover, there are six types of hand parts with expressions and an energy multiplier 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.610
 Chest cover parts of the state that was exposed Ya the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.239
 Can reproduce the various scenes we have that also comes with the waist of the armor of the state you remove the beam Sword 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.560
 It is 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:13.030
 But there is no roll axis at the waist because the weapon beam is useless at this size 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:17.740
 I can't get it that only one sword is attached, I just want Japan 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.820
 I'm sure as soon as Why play by moving Gashigashi joint And not being used Nante poly cap 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.370
 Let's get rid of 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:28.260
 I was wreck'm axis itself of the joint is and unreasonable Nde thin 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:30.390
 So it's better not to wear parts directly from the runner 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.810
 There are parts that can be taken from the runner 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.520
 Tohoho 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:39.479
 How is it , I put it with cellophane tape in the video Yes 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.970
 Painting is not as good as Wing Gundam 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.960
 Well, I really 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.150
 It's pretty small, so I can't help it-the marking of the annual printout 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:52.250
 I'm here and there, especially 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:56.120
 The printing of the King of Hearts emblem is excellent but it was too small and I thought it was dirty at first. 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:59.130
 The battle type of the corelander is ommited but hyper mode can be reproduced 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:03.990
 I'm sure the play value is high 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.399
 Whole style's a preeminent Chitto leaving the nest is remodeling school for the modeler Nde determined pat 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.209
 It may be good to say 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.330
 The high Gundam does not come out with God Gundam, so this size kit is in some sense valuable 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.330
 In Ah
