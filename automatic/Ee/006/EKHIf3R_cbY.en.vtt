will<00:01:47.189> be<00:01:47.399> upgraded<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.909> course<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.780> looks

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
will be upgraded of course and it looks

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.630 
will be upgraded of course and it looks
like<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.200> power<00:01:49.409> button<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.829> now<00:01:49.979> moved<00:01:50.310> to

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
like the power button is now moved to

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.370 
like the power button is now moved to
the<00:01:50.909> right<00:01:51.210> hand<00:01:51.479> side<00:01:51.600> from<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.020> top<00:01:52.200> because

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
the right hand side from the top because

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.039 
the right hand side from the top because
I<00:01:52.619> guess<00:01:52.799> Apple<00:01:53.399> feels<00:01:53.640> it'd<00:01:53.790> be<00:01:53.939> too<00:01:54.240> high<00:01:54.600> to

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
I guess Apple feels it'd be too high to

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.749 
I guess Apple feels it'd be too high to
actually<00:01:55.380> hit<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.530> button<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.130> then<00:01:56.729> that

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
actually hit that button and then that

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.639 
actually hit that button and then that
of<00:01:56.969> course<00:01:57.180> would<00:01:57.600> be<00:01:57.630> easier<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.170> hold<00:01:58.320> there

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
of course would be easier to hold there

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.620 
of course would be easier to hold there
this<00:01:59.340> case<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.700> actually<00:02:00.000> nice<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.270> like<00:02:00.479> this

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
this case is actually nice I like this

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.410 
this case is actually nice I like this
crystal<00:02:01.110> clear<00:02:01.140> case<00:02:01.680> it's<00:02:01.920> too<00:02:02.700> cool<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.240> love

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
crystal clear case it's too cool I love

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.139 
crystal clear case it's too cool I love
the<00:02:03.659> feel<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.020> it's<00:02:04.259> very<00:02:04.500> nice<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:05.579> course

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
the feel of it's very nice of course

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.660 
the feel of it's very nice of course
your<00:02:06.450> headphone<00:02:07.259> as<00:02:07.469> well<00:02:07.799> as<00:02:07.950> your<00:02:08.160> lightning

connector so taking our iPhone 5 here as

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.920 
connector so taking our iPhone 5 here as
we

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
we

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.270 
we
swipe<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.379> down<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.680> haven't<00:02:13.890> charged<00:02:14.129> this

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
swipe it down I haven't charged this

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.459 
swipe it down I haven't charged this
thing<00:02:14.489> so<00:02:14.640> it's<00:02:14.760> off<00:02:15.000> we<00:02:15.629> slide<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.079> in<00:02:16.109> here

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:16.469 
thing so it's off we slide it in here

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.599 
thing so it's off we slide it in here
you<00:02:16.620> can<00:02:16.739> see<00:02:17.040> how<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.730> fits<00:02:18.349> clearly<00:02:19.579> for<00:02:20.579> the

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
you can see how it fits clearly for the

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.130 
you can see how it fits clearly for the
volume<00:02:21.209> so<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.420> looks<00:02:21.719> at<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.870> volume

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
volume so that looks at the volume

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.020 
volume so that looks at the volume
buttons<00:02:22.379> will<00:02:22.590> change<00:02:22.620> because<00:02:23.250> it's<00:02:23.400> larger

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
buttons will change because it's larger

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.809 
buttons will change because it's larger
and<00:02:24.269> also<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:24.870> can<00:02:25.049> see<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.500> lock<00:02:25.890> button

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
and also you can see the lock button

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.479 
and also you can see the lock button
right<00:02:27.569> there<00:02:27.599> is<00:02:28.109> also<00:02:28.379> a<00:02:28.859> little<00:02:29.370> bit

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
right there is also a little bit

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.520 
right there is also a little bit
different<00:02:29.939> in<00:02:30.180> totality<00:02:31.019> we<00:02:31.170> check<00:02:31.349> it<00:02:31.469> out

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
different in totality we check it out

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.589 
different in totality we check it out
with<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.680> black<00:02:31.829> case<00:02:32.040> also<00:02:32.400> at<00:02:32.879> the<00:02:33.000> very<00:02:33.030> top

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
with a black case also at the very top

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.349 
with a black case also at the very top
you<00:02:34.260> can<00:02:34.409> see<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:35.189> camera<00:02:35.790> still<00:02:35.969> aligns

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:36.359 
you can see that the camera still aligns

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:39.110 
you can see that the camera still aligns
technically<00:02:37.019> you<00:02:37.950> can<00:02:38.129> align<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.459> there<00:02:38.939> and

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
technically you can align it there and

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.839 
technically you can align it there and
then<00:02:39.719> at<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.139> very<00:02:40.170> bottom<00:02:40.519> right<00:02:41.519> hand<00:02:41.639> side

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
then at the very bottom right hand side

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.879 
then at the very bottom right hand side
you<00:02:41.969> can<00:02:42.030> see<00:02:42.239> also<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:42.599> that<00:02:43.170> also<00:02:43.560> aligns

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
you can see also that that also aligns

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.240 
you can see also that that also aligns
for<00:02:44.670> your<00:02:44.909> power<00:02:45.389> button<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:45.889> if<00:02:46.889> we<00:02:47.010> align

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
for your power button and if we align

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.099 
for your power button and if we align
this<00:02:47.459> properly<00:02:47.970> you<00:02:48.090> can<00:02:48.209> see<00:02:48.389> also<00:02:48.689> it<00:02:48.780> fits

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
this properly you can see also it fits

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.869 
this properly you can see also it fits
right<00:02:49.590> there<00:02:49.650> in<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.069> spaces<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.549> can<00:02:50.669> see

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
right there in the spaces so you can see

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.000 
right there in the spaces so you can see
the<00:02:51.359> difference<00:02:51.870> in<00:02:52.049> size<00:02:52.260> there<00:02:52.709> that<00:02:52.919> the

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
the difference in size there that the

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.640 
the difference in size there that the
iPhone<00:02:53.400> 6<00:02:53.700> brings<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.329> table<00:02:54.480> it's<00:02:54.840> 4.7

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
iPhone 6 brings to the table it's 4.7

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.039 
iPhone 6 brings to the table it's 4.7
inches<00:02:55.859> is<00:02:56.040> larger<00:02:56.519> point<00:02:56.970> 7<00:02:57.299> inches<00:02:57.569> across

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
inches is larger point 7 inches across

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.599 
inches is larger point 7 inches across
larger<00:02:58.590> from<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.859> iPhone<00:02:59.930> 5<00:03:00.930> or<00:03:00.959> 5s<00:03:01.409> and<00:03:01.919> also

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
larger from the iPhone 5 or 5s and also

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.399 
larger from the iPhone 5 or 5s and also
you<00:03:02.669> can<00:03:02.879> see<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.299> width<00:03:03.629> the<00:03:03.870> extra<00:03:04.200> width

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
you can see the width the extra width

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.190 
you can see the width the extra width
you<00:03:04.590> get<00:03:04.950> from<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.489> iPhone<00:03:06.000> 6<00:03:06.389> so<00:03:06.510> that's

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
you get from the iPhone 6 so that's

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.589 
you get from the iPhone 6 so that's
something<00:03:07.469> to<00:03:07.980> note<00:03:08.730> is<00:03:08.909> not<00:03:09.120> as<00:03:09.239> wide<00:03:09.450> as

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
something to note is not as wide as

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.949 
something to note is not as wide as
something<00:03:09.930> like<00:03:10.169> the<00:03:10.439> Droid<00:03:10.709> RAZR<00:03:11.010> MAXX<00:03:11.719> HD<00:03:12.719> if

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
something like the Droid RAZR MAXX HD if

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.440 
something like the Droid RAZR MAXX HD if
we<00:03:13.290> take<00:03:13.739> that<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.310> just<00:03:14.340> apply<00:03:14.909> it<00:03:14.969> next<00:03:15.389> to

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
we take that and just apply it next to

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.110 
we take that and just apply it next to
the<00:03:15.540> case<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:15.959> can<00:03:16.109> see<00:03:16.439> that<00:03:17.190> it's<00:03:17.400> I<00:03:17.579> mean<00:03:17.970> in

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
the case you can see that it's I mean in

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.399 
the case you can see that it's I mean in
the<00:03:18.180> front<00:03:18.419> side<00:03:18.599> it<00:03:18.750> feels<00:03:18.780> like<00:03:19.079> it's<00:03:19.229> wide

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
the front side it feels like it's wide

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.860 
the front side it feels like it's wide
but<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:19.739> really<00:03:19.889> isn't<00:03:20.099> doesn't<00:03:20.340> fit<00:03:20.870> this

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
but it really isn't doesn't fit this

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.629 
but it really isn't doesn't fit this
device<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.440> believe<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.859> Droid<00:03:23.099> RAZR<00:03:23.250> MAXX<00:03:23.370> is

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
device I believe the Droid RAZR MAXX is

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.969 
device I believe the Droid RAZR MAXX is
about<00:03:23.840> 4.7<00:03:24.840> inches<00:03:25.079> that<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:25.319> could<00:03:25.620> be<00:03:25.769> wrong

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:25.979 
about 4.7 inches that I could be wrong

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:28.640 
about 4.7 inches that I could be wrong
just<00:03:26.879> to<00:03:27.000> show<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.239> what<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.720> wider<00:03:28.169> device

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
just to show you what a wider device

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.800 
just to show you what a wider device
will<00:03:28.919> actually<00:03:29.400> look<00:03:29.609> like<00:03:29.639> so<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.150> iPhone<00:03:30.479> 6

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
will actually look like so the iPhone 6

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.439 
will actually look like so the iPhone 6
is<00:03:30.989> wider<00:03:31.769> but<00:03:32.129> not<00:03:32.489> as<00:03:32.639> wide<00:03:32.879> as<00:03:33.060> something

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:33.449 
is wider but not as wide as something

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:36.229 
is wider but not as wide as something
like<00:03:33.629> the<00:03:33.870> Droid<00:03:34.250> RAZR<00:03:35.250> MAXX<00:03:35.430> which<00:03:35.849> is<00:03:35.970> about

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
like the Droid RAZR MAXX which is about

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.289 
like the Droid RAZR MAXX which is about
the<00:03:36.449> same<00:03:36.659> size<00:03:36.930> so<00:03:37.370> now<00:03:38.370> let's<00:03:38.909> take<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.090> look

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
the same size so now let's take a look

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.979 
the same size so now let's take a look
at<00:03:39.419> it<00:03:39.659> in<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.049> black<00:03:40.260> case<00:03:40.829> here<00:03:41.189> so<00:03:41.280> we<00:03:41.609> get<00:03:41.759> a

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
at it in the black case here so we get a

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.050 
at it in the black case here so we get a
different<00:03:42.989> perspective<00:03:43.489> altogether<00:03:44.489> what<00:03:44.819> I

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
different perspective altogether what I

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.300 
different perspective altogether what I
the<00:03:45.209> iPhone<00:03:45.780> 6<00:03:46.139> will<00:03:46.409> look<00:03:46.680> like<00:03:46.859> now<00:03:47.189> of

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
the iPhone 6 will look like now of

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.949 
the iPhone 6 will look like now of
course<00:03:47.489> we<00:03:47.819> don't<00:03:47.909> know<00:03:48.180> specifically<00:03:48.750> we've

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
course we don't know specifically we've

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.170 
course we don't know specifically we've
seen<00:03:49.169> different<00:03:49.470> mock-ups<00:03:50.030> people<00:03:51.030> like

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
seen different mock-ups people like

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.539 
seen different mock-ups people like
mkbhd<00:03:51.689> so<00:03:52.349> there's<00:03:52.470> no<00:03:52.590> special<00:03:52.769> done<00:03:53.129> mock-up

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
mkbhd so there's no special done mock-up

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.449 
mkbhd so there's no special done mock-up
videos<00:03:53.879> with<00:03:54.569> mock-up<00:03:55.379> of<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.530> iPhone<00:03:55.919> 6<00:03:56.280> and

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
videos with mock-up of the iPhone 6 and

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.460 
videos with mock-up of the iPhone 6 and
we've<00:03:56.609> seen<00:03:56.879> also<00:03:57.150> uses<00:03:57.479> it<00:03:57.689> will<00:03:57.930> probably

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
we've seen also uses it will probably

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.369 
we've seen also uses it will probably
use<00:03:58.530> sapphire<00:03:59.069> glass<00:03:59.280> but<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.629> casing<00:04:01.199> from

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
use sapphire glass but the casing from

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.559 
use sapphire glass but the casing from
speaking<00:04:01.739> gives<00:04:02.040> us<00:04:02.129> a<00:04:02.159> good<00:04:02.459> idea<00:04:02.519> of<00:04:02.939> how

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
speaking gives us a good idea of how

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.300 
speaking gives us a good idea of how
this<00:04:03.840> will<00:04:04.079> look<00:04:04.109> in<00:04:04.500> film<00:04:04.709> on<00:04:04.799> hands<00:04:05.009> so<00:04:05.159> this

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
this will look in film on hands so this

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.589 
this will look in film on hands so this
is<00:04:05.430> what<00:04:05.579> the<00:04:05.669> iPhone<00:04:05.790> because<00:04:06.269> this<00:04:06.449> is<00:04:06.569> a

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
is what the iPhone because this is a

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.499 
is what the iPhone because this is a
very<00:04:07.049> thin<00:04:07.620> case<00:04:07.949> so<00:04:08.250> it's<00:04:08.729> not<00:04:08.909> adding<00:04:09.299> much

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:09.509 
very thin case so it's not adding much

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:11.780 
very thin case so it's not adding much
to<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:10.169> thickness<00:04:10.560> of<00:04:10.889> the<00:04:11.040> iPhone<00:04:11.400> 6<00:04:11.669> and

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
to the thickness of the iPhone 6 and

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.819 
to the thickness of the iPhone 6 and
span<00:04:11.970> you<00:04:12.329> can<00:04:12.389> see<00:04:12.629> how<00:04:12.750> thin<00:04:13.109> this<00:04:13.290> case<00:04:13.560> is

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
span you can see how thin this case is

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.159 
span you can see how thin this case is
altogether<00:04:14.519> I<00:04:15.060> can<00:04:15.479> see<00:04:15.629> it's<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:15.810> very<00:04:15.989> thin

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
altogether I can see it's a very thin

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.620 
altogether I can see it's a very thin
case<00:04:16.409> so<00:04:16.590> in<00:04:17.009> terms<00:04:17.400> of<00:04:17.639> the<00:04:17.820> thickness<00:04:18.060> iPhone

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
case so in terms of the thickness iPhone

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.019 
case so in terms of the thickness iPhone
6<00:04:18.870> I<00:04:19.019> would<00:04:19.079> say<00:04:19.380> it's<00:04:19.680> pretty<00:04:20.220> much<00:04:20.370> close<00:04:20.789> to

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:21.029 
6 I would say it's pretty much close to

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.269 
6 I would say it's pretty much close to
this<00:04:21.180> so<00:04:21.779> me<00:04:22.079> holding<00:04:22.349> in<00:04:22.409> my<00:04:22.529> hands<00:04:22.979> I<00:04:23.070> have

00:04:23.269 --> 00:04:23.279 
this so me holding in my hands I have

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:26.120 
this so me holding in my hands I have
access<00:04:23.639> to<00:04:23.700> my<00:04:23.820> volume<00:04:24.419> my<00:04:24.930> lock<00:04:25.139> button<00:04:25.469> and

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
access to my volume my lock button and

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.610 
access to my volume my lock button and
how<00:04:26.370> button<00:04:26.730> right<00:04:27.060> there<00:04:27.110> because<00:04:28.110> yes<00:04:28.410> this

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
how button right there because yes this

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:29.960 
how button right there because yes this
would<00:04:28.800> be<00:04:28.950> annoying<00:04:29.160> for<00:04:29.280> me<00:04:29.400> I<00:04:29.490> can<00:04:29.700> do<00:04:29.850> it

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
would be annoying for me I can do it

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.850 
would be annoying for me I can do it
this<00:04:30.090> I<00:04:30.330> can<00:04:30.540> do<00:04:30.630> this<00:04:30.840> easily<00:04:31.110> but<00:04:31.500> for<00:04:31.680> most

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
this I can do this easily but for most

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.980 
this I can do this easily but for most
people<00:04:32.160> when<00:04:32.280> I<00:04:32.340> have<00:04:32.490> bigger<00:04:32.670> hands<00:04:32.940> so<00:04:33.570> this

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
people when I have bigger hands so this

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.230 
people when I have bigger hands so this
is<00:04:34.170> what<00:04:34.320> Apple<00:04:34.740> is<00:04:34.860> going<00:04:34.920> with<00:04:35.370> and<00:04:35.580> this<00:04:36.030> is

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
is what Apple is going with and this is

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.980 
is what Apple is going with and this is
how<00:04:36.450> my<00:04:37.080> black<00:04:37.440> iPhone<00:04:37.830> 6<00:04:38.160> will<00:04:38.700> probably<00:04:39.420> fit

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
how my black iPhone 6 will probably fit

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.090 
how my black iPhone 6 will probably fit
into<00:04:40.290> my<00:04:41.120> speaking<00:04:42.120> place<00:04:42.390> here<00:04:42.720> so<00:04:42.960> again<00:04:43.100> if

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
into my speaking place here so again if

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.740 
into my speaking place here so again if
we<00:04:44.130> check<00:04:44.460> out<00:04:44.610> this<00:04:44.820> the<00:04:45.120> camera<00:04:45.480> buttons

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
we check out this the camera buttons

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.420 
we check out this the camera buttons
here<00:04:45.960> take<00:04:46.200> a<00:04:46.230> better<00:04:46.560> look<00:04:46.650> at<00:04:46.950> that<00:04:46.980> I'm

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
here take a better look at that I'm

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.640 
here take a better look at that I'm
sorry<00:04:47.700> the<00:04:47.850> volume<00:04:48.390> and<00:04:48.600> the<00:04:49.110> lock<00:04:49.290> button<00:04:49.500> is

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
sorry the volume and the lock button is

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.410 
sorry the volume and the lock button is
right<00:04:49.800> there<00:04:50.040> you<00:04:50.490> can<00:04:50.670> see<00:04:50.880> that<00:04:51.150> will

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
right there you can see that will

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.350 
right there you can see that will
probably<00:04:51.810> change<00:04:51.870> cuz<00:04:52.200> it's<00:04:52.440> much<00:04:52.620> wider<00:04:53.360> in

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
probably change cuz it's much wider in

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.510 
probably change cuz it's much wider in
that<00:04:54.540> department<00:04:54.870> and<00:04:55.380> also<00:04:55.710> there's<00:04:56.190> a<00:04:56.280> power

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
that department and also there's a power

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.370 
that department and also there's a power
button<00:04:56.730> will<00:04:56.940> come<00:04:57.060> here<00:04:57.360> and<00:04:57.540> then<00:04:58.140> looking

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
button will come here and then looking

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.180 
button will come here and then looking
at<00:04:58.470> the<00:04:58.590> camera<00:04:58.980> camera<00:04:59.370> position<00:05:00.150> will<00:05:00.330> also

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
at the camera camera position will also

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.410 
at the camera camera position will also
will<00:05:02.190> probably<00:05:02.610> still<00:05:02.790> remain<00:05:03.030> the<00:05:03.120> same<00:05:03.270> not

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
will probably still remain the same not

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.060 
will probably still remain the same not
change<00:05:03.630> where<00:05:03.840> it<00:05:03.900> main<00:05:04.020> same<00:05:04.230> as<00:05:04.380> well<00:05:05.040> as

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
change where it main same as well as

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.930 
change where it main same as well as
your<00:05:05.910> lightning<00:05:06.630> port<00:05:07.050> and<00:05:07.380> your<00:05:07.830> 3.5<00:05:08.550> mm<00:05:08.910> jack

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
your lightning port and your 3.5 mm jack

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.810 
your lightning port and your 3.5 mm jack
so<00:05:09.720> oh<00:05:09.960> and<00:05:10.590> that's<00:05:10.740> interesting<00:05:11.250> too<00:05:11.460> so<00:05:11.700> we

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
so oh and that's interesting too so we

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.880
