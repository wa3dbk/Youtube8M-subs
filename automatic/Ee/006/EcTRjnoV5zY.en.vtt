 abuses with the nuon solar team of tu delft and they have a complete 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.490
 electric car that runs on solar energy 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.310
 the intention is not as hard as the boy's defense 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.680
 evident man 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.040
 it is not clear yet 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.660

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.010
 with the energy from directly to the mattresses about 90 kilometers per hour 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.030
 to drive 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.150
 one can drive slower on sending 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.900
 And then we let so many companies 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.620
 drive right in the middle of the grocery store 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.530
 wolfis can continue as a result of which some people want to have 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.600
 there was also 140 people driving at top speed in the afternoon 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.660
 and only 20 years old actor 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.860
 the opponent feels like catching up 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.150

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.560

 it is a biennial prize from australia 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.619
 if there is now the audi q7 that is in french 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.920
 jef neve last year is becoming world champion 2013 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.310
 at the end of the new team 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.070
 to start building the end 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.250
 to take an extra that part in one it deserves afp ka 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.410
 the value thereof the suffocating fit 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.830
 be prepared even better 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.909
 so germany traffic seats in the ep 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:10.339
 and then an appearance 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:13.489
 and heijmans performs 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.489
 there is a lot of success this year 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.180
 the so-called said the future begins 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.380
 Now in this case when the press lets mores he is already on the market 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:30.559
 there is the politically late version with the rate, but now it is very interesting 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:32.059
 the family can pay 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:35.029
 and then you can clearly see that the battery is completely eliminated in the least 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:37.829
 that optimum use is also made of the possibilities of the electric 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.829
 car 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:46.179
 renting 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:49.809
 az yes yes yes yes that's a lot of fun the child comes up again 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:54.309
 March puts a serious per that you want this is latch eds cars hydrogen cars 

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:57.279
 prepare during the day sony the huizer are sitting there they are kind of 

00:02:57.279 --> 00:03:00.489
 energy source after the engine is used when you stand still when you stand still 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.979
 will be used to generate energy for the house from hydrogen 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:07.159
 this all becomes much worse in the distant future and until then 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.159
 play nice with this 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:17.119
 it must all be very green, but for now I am better with 

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:18.409
 gasoline engines 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:23.849
 yes and first in the center of the car let the mercedes benz the f125 a whole 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.969
 yes and very rare he is one of concept car and read or neighborhood here 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:30.599
 almost lived with your nose on top 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.879
 talking about rare conceptcars this is the peso already nothing and the interior is 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.819
 made from newsprint, better said you can just use Dutch newsprint 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.069
 en route via this lecture 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.040
 less future music maybe this is 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.220
 2008 and a hybrid car, but instead of an electric motor 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:51.590
 powered compressed air and the ford fusion 2014 should be possible there 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.069
 ommen a top 5 drive 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.039
 October the future in a car we are now moving on to this one too is the other side 

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.349
