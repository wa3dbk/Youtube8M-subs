00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:20.150
 For example, we have to calculate the fifth root of 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.150
 minus 32 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.869
 fifths root of minus 32 then 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.170
 we started first by asking ourselves who 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.050
 it's rock who would be rock 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.970
 you are the module of the complex in this 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.060
 case would be 32 as the value was 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.060
 absolute 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.180
 now we also need to know who is 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.910
 how much is worth m 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.740
 and now let's make a drawing for 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.900
 help us find the argument in 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.630
 this the truth I believe that it is always 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:57.530
 important until the drawing -32 where 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:00.320
 remains if this is the part part 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.739
 real and this is the imaginary part of the 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.050
 complex the -32 would be on this side 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.200
 so then the angle that goes to rhythms 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.440
 how much is skin then that already 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.190
 now I can put that 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.610
 tit is equal to 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.610
 i 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:25.320
 I'm going to write the general form of 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.930
 roots that would be w sub k is equal to what 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.220
 raised to 1 over n which is thirty and 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.220
 two fifths that's 2 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:39.280
 the root of the fifth root of 32 on 2 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:48.650
 all that multiplied by the cost not 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:58.300
 I had +2 capi on n that 5 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:02:00.610
 more and for the sine of pi +2 happy about 5 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.240
 and it would already be the general form of the root 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.190
 from us we already know that here here 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.580
 varies in 0 1 2 3 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:14.170
 4 up to -1 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.959
 but they are 5 root in certain 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.330
 now another thing that I prefer is 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.550
 calculate the angles separately is 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.680
 say 'good the first angle that is 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.780
 when theta is equal to 0 is equal to pi 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.850
 fifth 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.100
 the second angle that is when you're 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:37.060
 equal to one equals 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.060
 two bonuses would be three fifths of pi 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.190
 tempted that would be when it is equal to 2 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:45.450
 we would have 45 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.410
 would be 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.410
 of theaters 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:03:03.599
 3 x 2 677 and fifth of hour 30 4 is 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.599
 equal to 4.89 fifth of pin 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.300
 and it would have happened if I evaluate 5 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.300
 I have 10 left 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.970
 5.10 11 fifths of paint that is already the 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.640
 same 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.300
 piquÃ­n everything what from two 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.950
 crooks better than a fifth up 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.470
 then I go back to cycling again but 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.480
 these are not on top of each other 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.459
 that's that amount now 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.880
 we started to put the solutions we 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:42.950
 they would be 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:50.090
 wb sub one equals two times cosine 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:51.200
 of fifths more and by the breast of pi 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.960
 fifth 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:04:00.050
 it would be the first root 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:05.790
 w 2 would be 2 for the cosine of three 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:09.379
 fifths of pi more and by the breast of 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.379
 three fifths of pi 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:16.859
 wv sub 13 is equal to 2 for the co 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.790
 iu 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:27.100
 more and by the breast of pi 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:30.040
 wv three doubles or four equals 1 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:34.530
 is that the order is the one that took this 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.530
 0 1 and 2 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.460
 0 1 and 2 that would be double of its 3 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:54.190
 who would be double of subtes 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:54.190
 that 2 by the breast of 7 and fifth 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.719
 more and for the bosom of 7 pintos 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:11.619
 and the last one that is w 4 would be 2 x 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:13.670
 the cosine of nine fifths more and for 

00:05:11.619 --> 00:05:17.980
 the breast of 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:20.230
 it would be nine fifths 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.820
 well we can evaluate or simply 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.800
 leave it like that because they're going to stay 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.690
 decimals what interests me a lot 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:30.810
 is the drawing that is generated from these 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.810
 roots then let's draw the roots 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.900
 and now I know that all roots already 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.940
 that we have the drawing and we have it 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.920
 separated by each of the angles 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.530
 I know that all roots have the 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:45.350
 same true magnitude what is that 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.360
 magnitude 2 then I'm going to give a circle 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.310
 radio 2 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.070
 now if we put where the roots are 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:55.660
 the first root 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:59.560
 that is the next root is this the 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:02.350
 next is this the next sixth and 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.860
 the following extraction and now we join 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.860
 points 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:12.740
 very inside the idea we have graphics 

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:14.960
 our whole root if they realize the 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.999
 idea is that the next root after 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.309
 nine fifth falls again here returns to 

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:22.419
 fall back to fall here and we already know how 

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:22.419
 the figure must remain
