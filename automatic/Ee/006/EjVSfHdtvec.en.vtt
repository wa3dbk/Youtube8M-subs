but our work is not done yet we take

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.360 
but our work is not done yet we take
further<00:00:05.390> steps<00:00:05.600> to<00:00:06.200> break<00:00:06.379> down<00:00:06.620> the<00:00:06.859> extract

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.120 
further steps to break down the extract
materials<00:00:08.150> so<00:00:08.570> they<00:00:08.690> can<00:00:08.840> be<00:00:08.960> reused<00:00:09.590> most

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.130
