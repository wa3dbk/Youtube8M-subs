00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.909
 and the 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.660
 hello hello welcome to the lane and in 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.660
 this video I will teach you how to ride 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.150
 points on a circular loom also in 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.680
 right point and the reverse point now 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.340
 you will see that it is very easy 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.519
 we begin we make a nudito in our 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.519
 wool 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.610
 a normal scream 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.770
 and we put it here you see what there is as a 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.720
 piecita to be a is the beginning very 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.720
 well then in the next dessert 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.100
 now the needle is for the first 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.269
 with the hands 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.269
 what we are going to do is 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:59.410
 where I pick it up so you can see it from 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:59.410
 here it's worth, look, let's go do 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.360
 and all round this is to assemble the 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:11.190
 points 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.310
 what happens that we stay too high is 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.550
 very tense then we can download it like this 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.190
 that we better go down a 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.650
 little bit is always worth the return has to 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.860
 to be around the back is worth us 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.860
 we have to see it like that in a single piece 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:33.260
 let's say it's worth here are the doublets of 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.260
 the turns very well 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.840
 very well because we have reached the end 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.220
 you see here how I started then now what 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.880
 I do down here to keep it 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.880
 simply 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.140
 I'm going to lower them a little bit 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.180
 and now we would go back 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.040
 and exactly alike agree 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.970
 very well now we already have like the 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.610
 double layer arrived come to the end 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.660
 we tie it here 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:14.390
 and now what do we have to do 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:17.990
 pass what is the one below 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:21.050
 I pick it up and have fun watching than 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:24.819
 up there stay there I will pass this by 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.819
 on top of this and passing it through here 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.110
 we continue 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:51.680
 this that serves to mount points worth 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.659
 this second pass is already a direct point 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.239
 since the right point is passed from 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:58.239
 down holding it up 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:43.310
 very well , we already have it as I have 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.850
 said the right point is made of the 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.850
 next way we went over 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.850
 round 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.850
 and we get those points right there 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.720
 many people who also directly the 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.720
 passes over yes 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:08.170
 and we collect and we already take it out 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.170
 I will make the point is the reverse point 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:16.229
 the reverse point is put below is 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.759
 say then raise a little the 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.680
 dots 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:22.660
 and I put below 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.470
 now 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.290
 This is the first touching them 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.450
 you see that the thread the wool comes here 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:35.630
 below I suggest it so that it does not 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:38.730
 go and take the one above we turn it 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:42.960
 you see that this little slot serves 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:44.850
 to put the leaves and take the one below 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.860
 I do it great to play what you play 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:52.599
 to do is to take it out 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.599
 whole whole and put here 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.529
 loop that we have left is worth 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:02.579
 we do it again 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:05.990
 and we take it from here we put it 

00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:08.139
 inside the sacks 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.120
 and we get everything 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:11.949
 and we put 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.030
 nothing more than the new loop that has 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:16.400
 stay here 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.720
 and we close 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.720
 we put it back under 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:25.950
 we take this look 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.680
 we take the one above we go through the one 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:31.090
 down we take out 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:36.090
 now I take it all 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.090
 the new loop we introduce here 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:44.240
 well as you know knitting 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.220
 reverse right point and ride points 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:50.150
 Now work with a circular loom 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:54.110
 It is a more convenient and faster way 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:57.230
 to be able to make our skirts caps 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:59.750
 Well, I encourage you to do little things 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.280
 circular entertainers I hope you have 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.180
