00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:14.230
 and well, today is Monday and today 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.450
 I finally bring the nail design that 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.190
 so much you asked me on instagram so 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.960
 this video goes especially for my 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.750
 followers of instagram that we are 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.010
 five thousand doubles and a normal hairstyle that 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.990
 you also asked me a lot and 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.869
 well in another video I will do all the 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.580
 kawaii hairstyles that I can think of and this 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.319
 hairstyle seems very nice to me and is the one 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.179
 I have in the last video of the tag 

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:36.489
 bag so watch nothing and watch 

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:38.829
 let's start and by the way if you want 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.359
 videos of outfits and things back to 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.359
 dale class I like this video 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.310
 Well, the first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.900
 put music to entertain us and I'm going to 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.670
 use cottons just in case 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.740
 blue white paint and pink protective 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:06.590
 nail polish remover and two brush jealousy 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:09.020
 scissors so let's start good what 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.780
 first thing we're going to do is with zeal 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.710
 we are going to fold it to paste it but without 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.080
 paste it a lot and we'll cut it as the 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.630
 half of a heart and then open it and 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.759
 I have a heart I do not know if I explain 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.800
 it does not look very good because zeal is 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.750
 transparent but I already tell you that 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.119
 you just have to cut half 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.119
 of a heart and we reserve them there 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.130
 now the first thing I do is to get 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.590
 a layer of enamel protector in 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.750
 all the nails wait for it to dry and 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.630
 Now I'm going to put my zeal on my thumb 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.700
 I'm going to paint the entire nail white 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.070
 because then when you remove it you will see 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.100
 the heart and good now the shape of the 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.800
 following nails is simply doing what 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.200
 above the heart like that on the little tip 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.020
 of the nail then in the middle one the 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.900
 I paint all white has a pinky 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.600
 all white also as you see there and 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.920
 then I will review me with color as 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.920
 You see that I paint it blue 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.810
 and the last one also in the by the way 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.610
 the other hand is simply doing 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.710
 exactly the same thing but changing the 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.110
 colors and now I'm going to draw a 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.420
 little heart in the nail of the middle 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.570
 I just make two dots then one 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.830
 down and I'm going to join it little by little the 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.610
 truth is that it is very simple and is 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.610
 well the heart 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.989
 on my way 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:39.370
 as you see there and then in the other nail that 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.370
 I'll make a line in pink 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.880
 and it would be like that later when it dries 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.459
 totally as you see you have a 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.260
 little bit of the heart and it stays that way and now 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.640
 do not worry about the edges because 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.640
 with that little brush and the nail polish remover 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.650
 let's go over everything and when 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.950
 we have everything reviewed we are going to give 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.890
 all the nails a layer of protector and 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.230
 ready would be like that you can see that it is 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.209
 just the same in the other hand 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.340
 but changing color and now the 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.920
 combed the truth is that it is super super 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.840
 simple let's take a lock of the 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.900
 side we want and we 're going to 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.060
 start rolling on itself 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.190
 catching as we go further 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.870
 hair I do not know if I explain myself but with the 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.700
 video I think you understand and when 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.830
 we get to the end we tie it like that with 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.440
 a fork up 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.970
 and it would stay that way I think it is understood and 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.080
 then we will do the same with a 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.080
 tuft below 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.760
 when we finish we tie it with a 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.760
 fork and it would be like that 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.310
 and now let's put all our 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.890
 hair on the side we've made the 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.230
 rolls and we're just going to make a 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.810
 normal braid but with each 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.960
 tuft we are going to roll it over itself 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.460
 then it is simply to braid like a 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.610
 normal braid and current of all the 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:09.100
 life but doing little curls and that's how it is 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.350
 different and I do not know I think it gives you another 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.770
 aspect and I think there is much more 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.770
 beautiful 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.230
 I hope you liked this one 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.740
 video and the next bye comes to you 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.310
 to me 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.310
 yes 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.280
 Sir
