created<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:22.030> roast<00:03:22.299> now<00:03:22.660> this<00:03:22.840> is<00:03:22.900> what<00:03:23.319> this

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
created the roast now this is what this

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.199 
created the roast now this is what this
is<00:03:24.250> about<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.630> two<00:03:25.630> inch<00:03:26.019> rows<00:03:26.650> it<00:03:27.069> was<00:03:27.639> cut<00:03:27.910> from

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
is about a two inch rows it was cut from

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.569 
is about a two inch rows it was cut from
the<00:03:28.660> vineyard<00:03:29.139> berry<00:03:29.530> paper<00:03:29.859> it's<00:03:30.160> double

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
the vineyard berry paper it's double

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.430 
the vineyard berry paper it's double
sided<00:03:30.730> so<00:03:31.150> i<00:03:31.209> use<00:03:31.389> the<00:03:31.569> vineyard<00:03:31.870> berry<00:03:32.139> side

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
sided so i use the vineyard berry side

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.370 
sided so i use the vineyard berry side
and<00:03:33.060> this<00:03:34.060> is<00:03:34.239> how<00:03:34.359> it<00:03:34.510> comes<00:03:34.750> when<00:03:35.019> it's<00:03:35.139> cut

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
and this is how it comes when it's cut

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.229 
and this is how it comes when it's cut
out<00:03:35.530> so<00:03:35.889> how<00:03:36.040> do<00:03:36.099> you<00:03:36.250> get<00:03:36.430> it<00:03:36.549> into<00:03:36.730> that<00:03:36.880> row

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
out so how do you get it into that row

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.409 
out so how do you get it into that row
shape<00:03:37.600> well<00:03:37.840> let<00:03:38.019> me<00:03:38.199> show<00:03:38.229> you<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:40.120> could<00:03:40.269> do

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
shape well let me show you you could do

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.350 
shape well let me show you you could do
this<00:03:40.600> by<00:03:40.780> hand<00:03:41.019> but<00:03:41.229> i<00:03:41.290> found<00:03:41.560> that<00:03:41.739> using

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
this by hand but i found that using

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.740 
this by hand but i found that using
weezer's<00:03:42.660> works<00:03:42.960> really<00:03:43.290> well<00:03:44.210> what<00:03:45.210> I<00:03:45.270> do<00:03:45.360> is

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
weezer's works really well what I do is

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.090

the<00:04:33.760> flower<00:04:34.090> around<00:04:34.840> the<00:04:35.050> tweezer<00:04:35.610> you<00:04:36.610> can<00:04:36.820> go

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
the flower around the tweezer you can go

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.060 
the flower around the tweezer you can go
as<00:04:37.300> tightly<00:04:37.750> or<00:04:38.410> as<00:04:38.740> loosely<00:04:39.280> as<00:04:39.640> you<00:04:40.000> want<00:04:40.330> I

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
then you end up with this piece here

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.760 
then you end up with this piece here
this<00:04:48.400> is<00:04:48.580> where<00:04:48.730> you'll<00:04:48.910> stop<00:04:49.410> you<00:04:50.410> can<00:04:50.560> put<00:04:50.740> a

this is where you'll stop you can put a

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.970 
this is where you'll stop you can put a
glue<00:04:51.070> dot<00:04:51.100> here<00:04:51.820> or<00:04:52.390> some<00:04:53.580> liquid<00:04:54.580> glass<00:04:54.880> and

then once you dab that there you would

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.690 
then once you dab that there you would
fault<00:04:59.080> you<00:04:59.260> know<00:04:59.500> fold<00:05:00.130> that<00:05:01.830> push<00:05:02.830> it<00:05:03.010> push<00:05:03.670> it

glue and then slowly remove the tweezers

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.400 
glue and then slowly remove the tweezers
from<00:05:17.620> the<00:05:17.740> inside<00:05:18.100> I<00:05:18.130> see<00:05:18.490> I<00:05:18.930> mess<00:05:19.930> it<00:05:19.960> up<00:05:20.260> a

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
from the inside I see I mess it up a

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.090 
from the inside I see I mess it up a
little<00:05:20.560> bit<00:05:20.770> but<00:05:21.160> and<00:05:21.840> it's<00:05:22.840> going<00:05:23.080> to<00:05:23.140> inspire

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
little bit but and it's going to inspire

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.680 
little bit but and it's going to inspire
a<00:05:24.310> little<00:05:24.850> bit<00:05:25.030> on<00:05:25.810> its<00:05:26.200> own<00:05:27.360> and<00:05:28.360> then<00:05:28.540> the

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
a little bit on its own and then the

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.440 
a little bit on its own and then the
finished<00:05:29.020> product<00:05:29.470> is<00:05:29.620> like<00:05:29.890> this<00:05:30.330> like<00:05:31.330> I

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
finished product is like this like I
