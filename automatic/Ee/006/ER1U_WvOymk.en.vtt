00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.959 
tighter sense of control over in-game
actions<00:01:39.780> we<00:01:40.530> also<00:01:40.679> took<00:01:41.609> this<00:01:41.729> as<00:01:41.880> an

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
actions we also took this as an

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.059 
actions we also took this as an
opportunity<00:01:42.149> to<00:01:42.509> enhance<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.740> rumble
