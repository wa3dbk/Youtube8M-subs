comparing<00:00:22.769> them<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.100> decos<00:00:24.890> yeah<00:00:25.890> we'll<00:00:26.070> start

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
comparing them to decos yeah we'll start

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:35.030 
comparing them to decos yeah we'll start
with<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.460> painters<00:00:30.800> so<00:00:31.800> yeah<00:00:32.360> I<00:00:33.710> think<00:00:34.710> they

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
with the painters so yeah I think they

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.670 
with the painters so yeah I think they
write<00:00:35.280> pretty<00:00:35.520> well<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:36.719> don't<00:00:36.870> streak<00:00:37.260> up<00:00:37.440> I

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
write pretty well you don't streak up I

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.590 
write pretty well you don't streak up I
mean<00:00:38.489> every<00:00:38.790> once<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.090> while<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.270> got<00:00:39.450> to

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
mean every once in a while you got to

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.299 
mean every once in a while you got to
juice<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.079> up<00:00:40.290> because<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.710> gets<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.920> little<00:00:41.040> dry

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
juice it up because it gets a little dry

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.970 
juice it up because it gets a little dry
but<00:00:41.690> other<00:00:42.690> than<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.020> you're<00:00:43.590> pretty<00:00:43.829> good

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
like weird yeah anyway that goes have a

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:35.729 
like weird yeah anyway that goes have a
more<00:02:25.160> broad<00:02:25.430> tip<00:02:31.150> it's<00:02:32.150> definitely<00:02:32.329> wider

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:50.740 

stupid<00:02:36.739> shit<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:39.200> red<00:02:39.410> I<00:02:49.030> think<00:02:50.030> that<00:02:50.090> decals

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
stupid shit the red I think that decals

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.030 
stupid shit the red I think that decals
are<00:02:51.170> a<00:02:51.200> little<00:02:51.410> more<00:02:51.590> vibrant<00:02:52.099> than<00:02:52.430> the

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
are a little more vibrant than the

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.030 
are a little more vibrant than the
painters<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.750> your<00:02:56.750> wider<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.620> nibs<00:02:57.889> are

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
painters and your wider the nibs are

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.990 
painters and your wider the nibs are
definitely<00:02:58.370> softer<00:02:58.579> and<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.209> painters<00:03:01.000> yeah

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
definitely softer and the painters yeah

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.809 
definitely softer and the painters yeah
so<00:03:02.600> now<00:03:02.750> we'll<00:03:02.870> do<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.019> white<00:03:03.400> so<00:03:04.400> now<00:03:04.549> we<00:03:04.609> got
