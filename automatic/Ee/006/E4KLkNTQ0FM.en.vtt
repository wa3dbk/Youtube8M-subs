00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.520 
all the time and everything but then
recently<00:01:44.460> there<00:01:45.000> was<00:01:45.500> something<00:01:46.500> that

things<00:01:50.399> were<00:01:50.520> kind<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.790> awkward<00:01:51.149> between<00:01:51.240> them

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
things were kind of awkward between them

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.569 
things were kind of awkward between them
but<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.350> whole<00:01:52.560> Facebook<00:01:53.040> thing<00:01:53.070> brought

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
but this whole Facebook thing brought

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.719

them<00:01:53.790> back<00:01:53.909> together<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:55.159> so<00:01:56.159> they<00:01:56.189> just<00:01:56.399> sort

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729

but<00:03:53.090> it<00:03:54.049> was<00:03:54.260> overall<00:03:54.650> really<00:03:54.799> good<00:03:54.920> and<00:03:55.190> I

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
but it was overall really good and I

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.390 
but it was overall really good and I
really<00:03:55.549> liked<00:03:55.790> what<00:03:56.329> it<00:03:56.450> was<00:03:56.540> about<00:03:56.690> and<00:03:57.400> the

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
really liked what it was about and the

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.330 
really liked what it was about and the
whole<00:03:58.519> idea<00:03:58.579> behind<00:03:59.000> it<00:03:59.299> and<00:03:59.420> everything<00:03:59.720> and

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
whole idea behind it and everything and

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.650 
whole idea behind it and everything and
so<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:01.459> only<00:04:01.579> thing<00:04:01.700> this<00:04:02.150> is<00:04:02.299> the<00:04:02.450> last

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
so the only thing this is the last

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.150 
so the only thing this is the last
couple<00:04:02.930> lines<00:04:03.260> in<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:03.620> book<00:04:03.769> were<00:04:03.890> kind<00:04:04.100> of

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
couple lines in the book were kind of

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.410 
couple lines in the book were kind of
cheesy<00:04:04.430> but<00:04:05.739> what<00:04:06.739> can<00:04:06.890> you<00:04:07.010> do<00:04:07.160> and<00:04:07.430> but<00:04:08.329> it

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
cheesy but what can you do and but it

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.660 
cheesy but what can you do and but it
was<00:04:08.540> pretty<00:04:08.720> good<00:04:08.930> overall<00:04:09.290> and<00:04:09.560> lots<00:04:10.519> of

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
was pretty good overall and lots of

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.220 
was pretty good overall and lots of
people<00:04:10.910> didn't<00:04:11.450> like<00:04:11.510> this<00:04:11.780> book<00:04:11.840> for<00:04:12.079> some

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
people didn't like this book for some

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.330 
people didn't like this book for some
reason<00:04:12.470> like<00:04:12.590> all<00:04:12.709> people<00:04:12.859> saw<00:04:13.100> that<00:04:13.220> it

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
reason like all people saw that it

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.620 
reason like all people saw that it
wasn't<00:04:13.459> what<00:04:13.670> they're<00:04:13.819> expecting<00:04:14.389> when<00:04:14.600> I

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
wasn't what they're expecting when I

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.569 
wasn't what they're expecting when I
Kate<00:04:14.840> went<00:04:14.989> into<00:04:15.170> it<00:04:15.290> but<00:04:15.440> I<00:04:15.650> really<00:04:15.920> liked<00:04:16.430> it
