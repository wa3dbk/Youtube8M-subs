really that hard to bed to the hostels
on<00:01:05.619> inter<00:01:06.460> box

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:44.760 

will<00:01:35.190> kill<00:01:35.460> any

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.350 

oh<00:01:44.829> no<00:01:45.549> I<00:01:45.579> got<00:01:45.700> a<00:01:45.759> grant

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.080 

hey<00:01:51.930> if<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.110> haven't<00:01:52.230> placed<00:01:52.350> example

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
hey if you haven't placed example

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.680 
hey if you haven't placed example
basically<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.170> rhythm<00:01:56.330> action<00:01:57.330> game<00:01:57.510> I

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
basically it's a rhythm action game I

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.250 
basically it's a rhythm action game I
guess<00:01:57.870> is<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.320> only<00:01:58.560> real<00:01:58.860> way<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.070> scrub<00:01:59.490> it

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
guess is the only real way to scrub it

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.820 
guess is the only real way to scrub it
and<00:02:02.660> probably<00:02:03.660> the<00:02:03.930> best<00:02:04.140> picture<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.740> is

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
and probably the best picture of it is

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.790 
and probably the best picture of it is
that<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:05.100> can<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:05.460> use<00:02:05.730> your<00:02:05.970> own<00:02:06.060> music

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.130 

which<00:02:09.800> I've<00:02:09.979> done<00:02:10.450> some<00:02:11.450> music<00:02:11.750> works<00:02:11.900> better

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
which I've done some music works better

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.630 
which I've done some music works better
than<00:02:12.230> others<00:02:12.320> so<00:02:13.070> you<00:02:13.190> can<00:02:13.310> pretty<00:02:13.430> much<00:02:13.520> use

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
than others so you can pretty much use

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:30.950 
than others so you can pretty much use
anything<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.510> has<00:02:14.900> a<00:02:15.290> pretty<00:02:15.620> good<00:02:15.710> B

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960

where you can't try the demo of it on
stain<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.900> believe<00:02:37.560> any<00:02:37.950> way<00:02:38.100> you<00:02:38.160> can<00:02:38.430> actually
