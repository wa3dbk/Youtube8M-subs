00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:34.200 
bought it's not any Gundam stuff first
of<00:01:33.189> all<00:01:33.280> they<00:01:33.369> just<00:01:33.549> didn't<00:01:33.850> really<00:01:34.060> have

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
of all they just didn't really have

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.480 
of all they just didn't really have
anything<00:01:34.420> Gundam<00:01:34.960> that<00:01:35.140> I<00:01:35.170> really<00:01:35.530> wanted<00:01:36.429> to

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
anything Gundam that I really wanted to

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.580 
anything Gundam that I really wanted to
buy<00:01:36.729> but<00:01:37.090> they<00:01:37.749> did<00:01:37.869> have<00:01:37.990> some<00:01:38.049> other<00:01:38.259> stuff

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.139 
buy but they did have some other stuff
that<00:01:38.770> looked<00:01:38.920> interesting<00:01:39.549> so<00:01:39.579> I<00:01:39.759> thought<00:01:39.999> I'd

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
that looked interesting so I thought I'd

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.139 
that looked interesting so I thought I'd
give<00:01:40.329> it<00:01:40.359> a<00:01:40.479> try<00:01:40.689> and<00:01:41.189> it's<00:01:42.189> good<00:01:42.399> to<00:01:42.520> try<00:01:42.700> other

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
give it a try and it's good to try other

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.690 
give it a try and it's good to try other
things<00:01:43.509> as<00:01:43.719> well<00:01:43.869> so<00:01:44.310> basically<00:01:45.310> everything

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
things as well so basically everything

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.879 
things as well so basically everything
in<00:01:45.789> here<00:01:46.030> is<00:01:46.060> going<00:01:46.389> to<00:01:46.479> be<00:01:46.719> some<00:01:47.259> other<00:01:47.469> non

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:47.889 
in here is going to be some other non

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:51.260 
in here is going to be some other non
Gundam<00:01:48.369> stuff<00:01:48.639> that<00:01:49.240> I<00:01:49.270> wanted<00:01:49.810> to<00:01:49.960> give<00:01:50.139> a<00:01:50.170> try

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
Gundam stuff that I wanted to give a try

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.959 
Gundam stuff that I wanted to give a try
so<00:01:52.270> obviously<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:52.959> first<00:01:52.990> thing<00:01:53.380> is<00:01:53.909> at<00:01:54.909> least

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
so obviously the first thing is at least

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.929 
so obviously the first thing is at least
slightly<00:01:55.659> Gundam<00:01:56.200> related<00:01:56.530> it's<00:01:56.679> a<00:01:56.939> action

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
slightly Gundam related it's a action

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.520 
slightly Gundam related it's a action
bass<00:01:58.359> one<00:01:58.780> in<00:01:59.109> grey<00:02:00.299> pretty<00:02:01.299> simple<00:02:02.200> I<00:02:02.289> just

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
needed another one of those

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.120 
needed another one of those

little change of pace from the plain
background<00:02:25.450> might<00:02:26.530> use<00:02:27.530> this<00:02:27.770> as<00:02:28.010> well<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:28.640> to

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
background might use this as well and to

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.260 
it I should probably look into it I
guess<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.979> designs<00:04:55.979> look<00:04:56.100> pretty<00:04:56.430> cool<00:04:56.639> but

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
guess the designs look pretty cool but

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.640 
guess the designs look pretty cool but
basically<00:04:57.630> just<00:04:57.780> wanted<00:04:57.990> to<00:04:58.080> give<00:04:58.199> the<00:04:58.320> kids<00:04:58.350> a

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
basically just wanted to give the kids a

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.510 
basically just wanted to give the kids a
try<00:05:00.139> so<00:05:01.139> I<00:05:01.169> got<00:05:01.440> a<00:05:01.470> couple<00:05:01.740> of<00:05:01.860> them<00:05:02.070> one<00:05:02.370> of

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
try so I got a couple of them one of

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.480 
try so I got a couple of them one of
them<00:05:02.669> is<00:05:02.880> this<00:05:03.090> one<00:05:03.150> which<00:05:03.660> is<00:05:03.870> the<00:05:04.490> Imperial

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490

Japanese<00:05:05.639> army<00:05:06.270> version<00:05:07.039> I<00:05:08.120> liked<00:05:09.120> this<00:05:09.300> one

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
Japanese army version I liked this one

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.930 
Japanese army version I liked this one
because<00:05:10.080> it's<00:05:10.440> just<00:05:10.620> kind<00:05:10.860> of<00:05:10.979> plain<00:05:11.520> gray

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
because it's just kind of plain gray

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.510 
because it's just kind of plain gray
color<00:05:12.840> scheme<00:05:13.169> is<00:05:13.349> pretty<00:05:13.590> cool<00:05:14.330> and<00:05:15.410> then

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
color scheme is pretty cool and then

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.650 
color scheme is pretty cool and then

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
they showed it on the channel and like I

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.580 
they showed it on the channel and like I
wasn't<00:05:47.910> really<00:05:48.030> all<00:05:48.150> that<00:05:48.240> interested<00:05:48.810> like

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
wasn't really all that interested like

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.560 
wasn't really all that interested like
the<00:05:49.740> armor<00:05:50.039> transforms<00:05:50.760> into<00:05:50.910> a<00:05:51.090> motorcycle

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
the armor transforms into a motorcycle

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.379 
the armor transforms into a motorcycle
or<00:05:52.020> something<00:05:52.229> like<00:05:52.770> a<00:05:52.910> thing<00:05:53.910> it<00:05:54.030> can<00:05:54.180> ride

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:54.389

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:56.870 
or something like a thing it can ride
they're<00:05:54.889> not<00:05:55.889> really<00:05:56.039> too<00:05:56.310> interested<00:05:56.789> in

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
they're not really too interested in

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.080 
they're not really too interested in
that<00:05:56.940> but<00:05:57.410> it's<00:05:58.410> a<00:05:58.530> pretty<00:05:58.710> cool<00:05:59.460> interesting

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090

that but it's a pretty cool interesting
design<00:06:00.419> anyway<00:06:00.900> just<00:06:01.380> in<00:06:01.560> this<00:06:01.710> form<00:06:02.280> so<00:06:02.639> I

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
design anyway just in this form so I

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.080 
design anyway just in this form so I
thought<00:06:03.330> just<00:06:03.630> like<00:06:04.550> not<00:06:05.550> doing<00:06:05.880> it<00:06:05.970> in<00:06:06.030> this

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
thought just like not doing it in this

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.029 
thought just like not doing it in this
colors<00:06:06.449> but<00:06:06.750> doing<00:06:06.960> this<00:06:07.080> in<00:06:07.349> a<00:06:07.380> more<00:06:07.680> just

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
colors but doing this in a more just

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:12.290 
colors but doing this in a more just
kind<00:06:08.190> of<00:06:08.280> militaristic<00:06:09.080> color<00:06:10.160> scheme<00:06:11.160> not<00:06:11.940> so

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
kind of militaristic color scheme not so

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.570 
kind of militaristic color scheme not so
like<00:06:13.110> fancy<00:06:13.560> with<00:06:13.680> the<00:06:13.800> gold<00:06:14.010> and<00:06:14.160> stuff<00:06:14.310> I

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
like fancy with the gold and stuff I

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.839 
like fancy with the gold and stuff I
don't<00:06:15.360> know<00:06:15.570> but<00:06:15.900> it<00:06:15.990> should<00:06:16.140> be<00:06:16.169> interesting

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:16.849 
don't know but it should be interesting

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:20.860
