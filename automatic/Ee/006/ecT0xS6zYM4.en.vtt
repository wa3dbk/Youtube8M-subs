00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.360
 Hello 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.730
 For example I think Yeah, and today want a little strange reviews 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.560
 When 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:23.470
 Do you know the polarity of the power supply? 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:24.640
 8 ordinary household that ac 100 v so-called AC 100 volt power supply 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.520
 Is it 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.520
 Because it is so- called exchange of maa 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.250
 It is always Kofu last- 4 group 4 guknogno 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:41.040
 What are you saying ? 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:46.290
 The Tteyuu and home of the light rays also said that it is 8 in fact have come electricity to that one 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:51.060
 Simply put, one is falling to the ground, that is, it is falling to the house. 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.200
 That is something outlet of Anomaa power Which I Apart say I was stabbed in Which direction 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:58.680
 But 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:00.130
 Actually, one side is hot and the other side is cold. 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.650
 is 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:07.390
 It is in, and this is it 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:10.420
 It is a fellow who say such a you easily can measure the things I said to electroscope 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.810
 Even though this it was like a form driver 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:18.130
 8 so-called yeah this is better than led here 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:22.330
 Kedomo so-called have entered into a battery I can be or measure conduction of things 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.049
 I can not do this because the code is disappearing. I can do something like this. 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:29.110
 is not it 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:30.440
 Which is the power supply is that which way it is when you plugged into an electrical outlet is coming power 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.680
 Air air 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.710
 You know what you mean by one shot 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.060
 Then why do you have to do it? 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.490
 Apart from that, it doesn't matter if you do 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.909
 It is 8 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.909
 The other I is Toka that audio products may Yes story 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:51.890
 People who are stuck mess in Toka sound quality because such is 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:55.190
 The Well extremely good power It is the power itself of audio 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:59.420
 I use that power plug that 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:06.619
 If you use a power cord that costs hundreds of thousands of yen or hundreds of thousands of yen 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:10.399
 I'd come I'm also not MAY Well that this superstition, but the polarity of the power supply 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:14.120
 Very this it is when I connect to the contrary is 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:19.640
 It is said that the sound quality is degraded 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:21.510
 However, there are so-called three pole outlets of that in the West, right? 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:26.159
 The so-called Ano 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:29.370
 It is a guy with three listed, so if you're sweating properly, if you drop it separately 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:35.849
 There should not be such a child problem at all, but 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:38.819
 In the case of a two-jack jack like a Japanese outlet, that hot gart cold face 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:44.579
 Well put the power together properly 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.999
 It is good to let me do it . If the number is improved a little, such a thing is said 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.370
 I will 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:50.670
 Just this to mother 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.040
 I do not know well how much credibility I have 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.120
 Hmm 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:58.569
 I think it is such that there is no by no means a bad thing because the match well but just polarity 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.709
 If'm nervous to do begin if You're home throughout the outlet everyone such a thing that 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.390
 Because it will not be 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:07.330
 Well I think it's a matter of taste 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:09.670
 By the way So you Tteyuu this matter electric or not this matter no etc. Den 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:14.680
 This this is it is it 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:16.140
 That's around 500 yen That's 500 yen or 2000 yen or 3000 yen 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.410
 But there is also 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:26.780
 Once it was only investigate curve It is enough to be gold of about the 500 yen 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:32.870
 Well then let's see that one This is the outlet 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:36.920
 We are looking at it a hole in the wall outlet carefully, is in, but I think there is also a person of notice everyone postpartum 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:42.220
 One side is long, and one side is boring. 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:45.420
 In fact, this is the way it represents this longer hole 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.480
 It is the so-called earth side 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.910
 It's the head that falls on the ground and this is the hot side 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.819
 In other words, 100 people are distributed 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:04:00.450
 So what happens if you measure this? 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:00.450
 So Then, like this I will stab the Puchi' to the ground side of the 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.850
 There is no change otherwise I put it on the side with a little relief 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.240
 LED was lit 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:15.210
 I'm gonna shine this is this hole no at this time 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.829
 Don't touch the metal parts here and so it is relevant 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:20.880
 Here 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:25.290
 I do not shine because I'm on the cold side because I'm falling to earth 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:28.520
 This is hot but the rail ed will shine This is the outlet side of this outlet 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:35.090
 There is a hot here or there is a structure 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:36.169
 This is the principle that is, I hole of this long 4 is what is the shorter hole in the cold side hot is 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.819
 I 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:43.169
 Eh This is a construction man by the time I do not care people who will improve 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:47.069
 It seems like that 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:52.349
 It is said that sometimes it is connected to the opposite if it is poor 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:53.879
 So, if you are concerned about it , do a mixed battle of the house and check with these things firmly 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:55.569
 I think it would be better 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:58.139
 However 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:59.980
 As I said 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:02.150
 It is 8 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.960
 I'm doing 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.960
 I tell you 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:13.150
 Compelling If you are audio to which way to dirt floor who to worry about the polarity of the power supply 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.520
 It is other than such one 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:20.460
 not really 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:25.139
 Switch to that hand in something that - Electrical stand that it is not I think of only having to worry about 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:30.200
 Pointing doing there and I said to match the I and neatly polarity of I say Ah Te Gatsui 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:33.980
 If you give it , it is good to prevent that outlet that outlet 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:38.120
 It is when we insert outlet of electric stand cherry tree in reverse 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:42.470
 In fact, there may be a switch on the cold side, and the installation of the desk lamp is 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:44.220
 Then on the stand even when the power is turned off than we are supposed to be the power is flowing 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:49.050
 I'm electromagnetic waves out 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:52.110
 It is that here shines better if just hot is rewarded with large neatly cut 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:57.030
 It would be nice if I cut it properly 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:59.910
 So when you turn off the lamp stand it will turn off properly 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:03.830
 It's the main part of my feeling, though 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:05.689
 Well it might be interesting to check a little 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.070
 For only 500 yen 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:09.540
 Can of household polarity 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:14.720
 It was a check 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.720
 you but is more than I think I do not stand in a too Auditors
