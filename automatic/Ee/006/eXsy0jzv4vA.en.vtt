00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.200 

I've<00:03:01.800> cut<00:03:02.040> were<00:03:02.220> coming<00:03:02.550> up<00:03:02.640> through<00:03:02.700> some

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
I've cut were coming up through some

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.960 
I've cut were coming up through some
trains<00:03:03.990> up<00:03:05.060> vegetation<00:03:06.060> which<00:03:06.690> I<00:03:06.960> think<00:03:07.380> has<00:03:07.710> a

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
trains up vegetation which I think has a

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.050 
trains up vegetation which I think has a
heavy<00:03:08.970> impact<00:03:09.240> on<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.750> frame<00:03:09.990> rates<00:03:10.790> but<00:03:11.790> just

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
heavy impact on the frame rates but just

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.630 
heavy impact on the frame rates but just
get<00:03:12.270> those<00:03:12.480> trees<00:03:13.230> out<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.770> of<00:03:14.490> the

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
get those trees out of the of the

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.070 
get those trees out of the of the
picture<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:16.890> frame<00:03:17.190> rates<00:03:18.080> improve

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
picture and the frame rates improve

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.040 
picture and the frame rates improve
immediately<00:03:19.790> got<00:03:20.790> about<00:03:20.970> twenty<00:03:21.390> now<00:03:21.570> we<00:03:21.630> had

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
immediately got about twenty now we had

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:37.949 
immediately got about twenty now we had
about<00:03:22.290> nine<00:03:22.620> before

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.229 

nineteen<00:03:38.799> frame<00:03:39.159> rates<00:03:39.430> at<00:03:39.609> the<00:03:39.700> per<00:03:39.849> second

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
nineteen frame rates at the per second

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:52.839 
nineteen frame rates at the per second
at<00:03:40.359> the<00:03:40.450> moment<00:03:41.040> no<00:03:42.040> real<00:03:42.370> lag

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.420 

so<00:03:53.450> you'll<00:03:53.659> find<00:03:53.959> those<00:03:54.200> two<00:03:54.530> interesting

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
so you'll find those two interesting

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.199 
so you'll find those two interesting
engines<00:03:56.079> on<00:03:57.079> the<00:03:57.409> download<00:03:57.859> station

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.289 

and<00:04:01.719> as<00:04:02.049> you<00:04:02.230> can<00:04:02.409> see<00:04:02.700> they<00:04:03.700> are<00:04:03.909> running

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
and as you can see they are running

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:10.020 
and as you can see they are running
without<00:04:04.810> any<00:04:05.200> problems<00:04:05.799> in<00:04:06.099> a<00:04:06.519> train<00:04:06.879> 12<00:04:09.000> so<00:04:10.000> I

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
without any problems in a train 12 so I

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:34.200 
without any problems in a train 12 so I
could<00:04:10.420> thoroughly<00:04:10.959> recommend<00:04:11.170> them

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.070 

so<00:04:34.810> here<00:04:35.050> we<00:04:35.169> are<00:04:35.199> the<00:04:35.440> latest<00:04:36.150> in<00:04:37.150> trains<00:04:37.630> 12

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
so here we are the latest in trains 12

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.889 
so here we are the latest in trains 12
keep<00:04:38.530> watching
