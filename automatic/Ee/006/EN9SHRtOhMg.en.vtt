00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
revzilla.com so from the impulse you're

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.590 
revzilla.com so from the impulse you're
looking<00:00:18.960> at<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.590> least<00:00:20.100> insulated<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.119> the

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
looking at the least insulated of the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.720 
looking at the least insulated of the
three<00:00:21.900> key<00:00:22.170> insulated<00:00:22.740> gore-tex<00:00:23.189> products<00:00:23.580> in

the climb line

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.410 
the climb line
so<00:00:25.350> remember<00:00:25.769> insulated<00:00:26.490> products<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:27.300> are

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
so remember insulated products that are

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.060 
so remember insulated products that are
gore-tex<00:00:27.779> are<00:00:27.900> really<00:00:28.109> for<00:00:28.289> more<00:00:28.470> bitter<00:00:28.740> cold

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
gore-tex are really for more bitter cold

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
lot of times on the west coast you're

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.910 
lot of times on the west coast you're
gonna<00:00:33.570> see<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.899> drier<00:00:34.170> powdery<00:00:34.680> type

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
gonna see that drier powdery type

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.260 
gonna see that drier powdery type
condition<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.700> might<00:00:35.850> just<00:00:35.880> go<00:00:36.120> with

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
condition and you might just go with

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.880 
condition and you might just go with
this<00:00:36.390> shell<00:00:36.570> now<00:00:37.079> thinking<00:00:37.500> through<00:00:37.739> this

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
this shell now thinking through this

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.889 
this shell now thinking through this
both<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.250> jacket<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:38.940> pant<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.600> remember<00:00:39.809> in

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
this video I'm gonna walk through both

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.190 
this video I'm gonna walk through both
independently<00:00:41.910> give<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.719> setup<00:00:42.960> here

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
independently give you the setup here

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.959 
independently give you the setup here
both<00:00:43.710> are<00:00:43.860> gonna<00:00:43.950> have<00:00:44.160> 100<00:00:44.370> grams<00:00:44.640> of

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
both are gonna have 100 grams of

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.790 
both are gonna have 100 grams of
Thinsulate<00:00:45.090> insulation<00:00:45.420> if<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.410> want<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.649> be

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
Thinsulate insulation if you want to be

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.020 
Thinsulate insulation if you want to be
a<00:00:46.829> bit<00:00:47.039> beefier<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.520> go<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.670> something<00:00:47.910> like

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
a bit beefier you go to something like

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.910 
a bit beefier you go to something like
the<00:00:48.329> climate<00:00:48.719> outfit<00:00:49.230> we're<00:00:49.530> just<00:00:49.649> going<00:00:49.860> to

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
the climate outfit we're just going to

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.529 
the climate outfit we're just going to
use<00:00:49.980> 200<00:00:50.489> grams<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.850> then<00:00:51.059> from<00:00:51.210> there<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.449> go

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
use 200 grams and then from there you go

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.180 
use 200 grams and then from there you go
into<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.780> key<00:00:52.050> 1r<00:00:52.320> range<00:00:52.559> which<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.949> really

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
into that key 1r range which is really

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.040 
into that key 1r range which is really
zonally<00:00:53.730> mapped<00:00:54.000> which<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> bit<00:00:54.809> more

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
zonally mapped which is a bit more

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.229 
zonally mapped which is a bit more
aggressive<00:00:55.440> now<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.219> key<00:00:56.579> changes<00:00:57.000> for<00:00:57.180> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
aggressive now the key changes for the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.910 
aggressive now the key changes for the
impulse<00:00:57.600> which<00:00:57.780> was<00:00:57.960> in<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.170> line<00:00:58.320> before<00:00:58.649> are

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
impulse which was in the line before are

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.369 
impulse which was in the line before are
now<00:00:59.039> getting<00:00:59.309> an<00:00:59.460> update<00:00:59.850> for<00:01:00.210> 2013<00:01:01.079> you're
