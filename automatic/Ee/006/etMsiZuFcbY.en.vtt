was<00:01:35.549> not<00:01:35.579> completed<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:37.020> basically<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.829> unit

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
was not completed so basically this unit

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.859 
was not completed so basically this unit
is<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.430> cheap<00:01:38.970> because<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.229> view<00:01:40.680> and

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
is so cheap because of this view and

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.719 
is so cheap because of this view and
very<00:01:43.100> not<00:01:44.100> very<00:01:44.430> well<00:01:44.700> tended<00:01:45.090> lake<00:01:46.729> fairway

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
preserve a condo communities over there

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.350 
preserve a condo communities over there
so<00:01:52.430> there<00:01:53.430> might<00:01:53.700> be<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.909> lot<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.090> construction

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
so there might be a lot of construction

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.289 
so there might be a lot of construction
going<00:01:54.869> on<00:01:55.079> here<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.829> definitely<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.610> sight

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
going on here this is definitely a sight

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.420 
going on here this is definitely a sight
and

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
and

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.920 
and
that's<00:02:00.060> how<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.420> looks<00:02:00.450> like<00:02:00.840> on<00:02:01.260> the<00:02:02.070> back<00:02:02.930> the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
that's how it looks like on the back the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.790 
that's how it looks like on the back the
windows<00:02:04.440> so<00:02:05.010> the<00:02:05.250> lanai<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.730> not<00:02:06.030> screened<00:02:06.800> it

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
windows so the lanai is not screened it

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.320 
windows so the lanai is not screened it

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
has a bunch of upgrades because

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.840 
has a bunch of upgrades because
obviously<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:10.140> builders<00:02:10.560> were<00:02:11.220> desperate<00:02:11.820> to

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
obviously the builders were desperate to

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.700
