drawing more attractive and appealing
for<00:01:00.660> others<00:01:01.100> shading<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.219> very<00:01:02.430> important

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
for others shading is a very important

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.700 
for others shading is a very important
part<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.120> drawing<00:01:03.329> Oh<00:01:03.570> even<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.650> a

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
part of the drawing Oh even in a

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.800 
part of the drawing Oh even in a
coloring<00:01:05.129> or<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> pencil<00:01:05.670> draw<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.510> pencil

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.300 
coloring or a pencil draw it in a pencil
drawing<00:01:06.960> it's<00:01:07.110> very<00:01:07.350> very<00:01:07.560> significant<00:01:08.189> so

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
drawing it's very very significant so

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.120 
drawing it's very very significant so
shading<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.760> normally<00:01:09.119> done<00:01:09.330> on<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:10.290> account

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
shading is normally done on the account

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.350 
shading is normally done on the account
that<00:01:11.280> there's<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.640> light<00:01:11.820> coming<00:01:11.850> from<00:01:12.180> a

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
that there's a light coming from a

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.179 
that there's a light coming from a
direction<00:01:12.510> opposite<00:01:13.170> sighted<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.619> redock<00:01:13.950> so

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
direction opposite sighted to redock so

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.710 
direction opposite sighted to redock so
one<00:01:14.369> side<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.700> will<00:01:14.820> be<00:01:14.939> light<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.360> other<00:01:15.479> side

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
one side it will be light and other side

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.570 
one side it will be light and other side
will<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.960> dock<00:01:16.200> some<00:01:16.830> people<00:01:17.100> do<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.369> like<00:01:17.400> that

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
will to dock some people do it like that

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.070 
will to dock some people do it like that
that's<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.090> natural<00:01:18.240> way<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.570> doing<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
that's a natural way of doing it and

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.830 
that's a natural way of doing it and
some<00:01:19.680> we<00:01:19.830> can<00:01:19.979> do<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:20.369> simply<00:01:20.790> share<00:01:21.720> it

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
some we can do it like simply share it

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.120 
some we can do it like simply share it
on<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.110> different<00:01:22.380> side<00:01:22.530> which<00:01:22.710> looks

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
on the different side which looks

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.219 
on the different side which looks
beautiful<00:01:23.640> just<00:01:23.670> for<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.240> look<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.110> and

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
beautiful just for the look of it and

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.960 
beautiful just for the look of it and
not<00:01:25.320> on<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.950> natural<00:01:26.340> part<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.880> can

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
not on the natural part of it so you can

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.240 
not on the natural part of it so you can
do<00:01:27.299> shading<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.080> both<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.470> way<00:01:28.590> maybe<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.159> the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
do shading on both the way maybe in the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.740 
do shading on both the way maybe in the
