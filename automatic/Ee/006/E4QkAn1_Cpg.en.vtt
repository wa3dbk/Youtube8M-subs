to hide all that stuff so you basically
get<00:01:25.810> just<00:01:26.080> the<00:01:26.170> game<00:01:26.350> experience<00:01:26.860> and<00:01:27.009> you<00:01:27.550> get

to<00:01:28.090> hide<00:01:28.360> all<00:01:28.509> this<00:01:28.720> but<00:01:29.410> right<00:01:29.770> now<00:01:29.920> the<00:01:29.979> games

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
to hide all this but right now the games

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.130 
to hide all this but right now the games
are<00:01:30.580> designed<00:01:30.729> for<00:01:31.300> this<00:01:31.600> to<00:01:31.780> be<00:01:31.930> there

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
are designed for this to be there

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.960 
are designed for this to be there
because<00:01:32.770> they're<00:01:33.040> not<00:01:33.130> expecting<00:01:33.490> people<00:01:33.759> to

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
because they're not expecting people to

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.790 
because they're not expecting people to
pay<00:01:34.240> play<00:01:34.990> without<00:01:35.170> a<00:01:35.950> touch<00:01:36.700> screen<00:01:37.800> so

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
pay play without a touch screen so

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.130 
pay play without a touch screen so
system<00:01:39.399> is<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.670> mapping<00:01:39.850> that<00:01:40.270> is<00:01:40.450> is<00:01:40.750> mapping

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
system is the mapping that is is mapping

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.950 
system is the mapping that is is mapping
I'm<00:01:42.130> going<00:01:42.460> to<00:01:42.550> switch<00:01:43.090> to<00:01:43.119> another<00:01:43.390> game<00:01:43.750> and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
I'm going to switch to another game and

oh<00:02:20.970> ok<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.000> don't<00:02:22.239> know<00:02:22.299> how<00:02:22.390> it<00:02:22.450> works<00:02:22.569> ok<00:02:23.080> but

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
oh ok I don't know how it works ok but

oh ok I don't know how it works ok but
so<00:02:25.150> I'm<00:02:25.420> gonna<00:02:25.569> try<00:02:25.930> some<00:02:26.230> emulators<00:02:26.500> in<00:02:27.040> just

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
so I'm gonna try some emulators in just

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.770 
so I'm gonna try some emulators in just
a<00:02:27.370> second<00:02:27.720> how<00:02:28.720> are<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:29.140> start<00:02:29.440> doing<00:02:29.530> the

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.880 

never<00:02:34.780> played<00:02:35.019> it<00:02:35.140> before<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.590> don't<00:02:35.650> have

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
never played it before so I don't have

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.460 
never played it before so I don't have
to<00:02:35.950> get<00:02:36.160> out<00:02:36.280> of<00:02:36.310> here<00:02:36.549> I<00:02:36.760> get<00:02:37.420> in<00:02:37.540> an<00:02:38.110> open<00:02:38.380> the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
to get out of here I get in an open the

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.650 
to get out of here I get in an open the
door<00:02:38.650> they<00:02:39.610> jump

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
door they jump

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.440 
door they jump
you<00:02:42.380> see<00:02:42.560> it's<00:02:42.800> a<00:02:42.890> it's<00:02:43.310> mapping<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:44.000> game<00:02:44.180> and

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
you see it's a it's mapping the game and

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.650 
you see it's a it's mapping the game and
it<00:02:44.540> remembers<00:02:44.930> what<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.890> mappings<00:02:46.340> are<00:02:46.660> based

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
it remembers what the mappings are based

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.440 
it remembers what the mappings are based
on<00:02:47.810> cloud<00:02:48.050> based<00:02:48.440> on<00:02:48.620> my<00:02:48.800> preferences<00:02:52.450> that's

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
on cloud based on my preferences that's

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.120 
on cloud based on my preferences that's
a<00:02:53.570> 3d<00:02:53.960> performance<00:02:55.150> because<00:02:56.150> this<00:02:56.300> is<00:02:56.390> an<00:02:56.540> r<00:02:57.260> up

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
a 3d performance because this is an r up

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.450 
a 3d performance because this is an r up
chip<00:02:58.400> dual-core<00:02:59.300> with<00:03:00.050> a<00:03:00.080> quad-core<00:03:00.460> mali-400

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
chip dual-core with a quad-core mali-400

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.760 
chip dual-core with a quad-core mali-400
so<00:03:01.640> it<00:03:01.730> has<00:03:01.850> a<00:03:01.880> good<00:03:02.120> GPU<00:03:03.160> same<00:03:04.160> GPU<00:03:04.550> is<00:03:04.610> a

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
so it has a good GPU same GPU is a

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.630 
so it has a good GPU same GPU is a
galaxy<00:03:06.770> s3<00:03:08.410> how<00:03:09.410> to<00:03:09.470> get<00:03:09.650> further<00:03:09.890> here<00:03:10.190> let<00:03:10.550> me

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
galaxy s3 how to get further here let me

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.630 
galaxy s3 how to get further here let me
try<00:03:10.760> that<00:03:10.880> again<00:03:11.290> it's<00:03:12.290> a<00:03:12.590> nintendo<00:03:13.130> 64

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
try that again it's a nintendo 64

emulator on the hand android and it's

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.190 
emulator on the hand android and it's
quite<00:03:18.860> smooth<00:03:19.160> but<00:03:19.970> of<00:03:20.090> course<00:03:20.300> with<00:03:20.930> dennis

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
quite smooth but of course with dennis

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.140

64<00:03:21.620> emulation<00:03:21.950> on<00:03:22.190> android<00:03:22.610> is<00:03:22.730> still<00:03:22.910> a<00:03:22.940> work

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
64 emulation on android is still a work

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.590 
64 emulation on android is still a work
in<00:03:23.270> progress<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:24.940> i'm<00:03:25.940> sure<00:03:26.180> there's<00:03:26.360> some

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
in progress and i'm sure there's some

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.300 
in progress and i'm sure there's some
optimization<00:03:27.230> that<00:03:27.350> should<00:03:27.710> be<00:03:27.830> done<00:03:27.980> on<00:03:28.250> the

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
optimization that should be done on the

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.530 
optimization that should be done on the
on<00:03:28.940> this<00:03:29.290> rockchip<00:03:30.610> rk3066<00:03:31.610> position<00:03:32.390> which

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
on this rockchip rk3066 position which

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.060 
on this rockchip rk3066 position which
should<00:03:32.720> still<00:03:32.960> kind<00:03:33.740> of<00:03:33.770> like<00:03:33.920> a<00:03:35.440> new<00:03:36.440> new

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
should still kind of like a new new

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.190 
should still kind of like a new new
platform<00:03:39.220> here<00:03:40.220> you<00:03:40.310> have<00:03:40.400> some<00:03:40.610> games<00:03:41.200> let's

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
platform here you have some games let's

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.260 
platform here you have some games let's
see<00:03:43.930> it's<00:03:44.930> an<00:03:45.170> awesome<00:03:45.700> aesthetic<00:03:46.700> experience

see it's an awesome aesthetic experience
to<00:03:47.390> play<00:03:47.540> these<00:03:47.660> games<00:03:48.190> and<00:03:49.190> I<00:03:49.520> think<00:03:49.850> this

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
to play these games and I think this

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.140 
to play these games and I think this
stuff<00:03:51.170> gave<00:03:51.440> this<00:03:51.560> is<00:03:51.709> 15<00:03:52.280> years<00:03:52.310> old<00:03:52.700> gaming

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
stuff gave this is 15 years old gaming

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.560 
stuff gave this is 15 years old gaming
right<00:03:53.500> it's<00:03:54.500> much<00:03:54.860> better<00:03:55.160> than<00:03:55.520> angry<00:03:56.270> birds

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
right it's much better than angry birds

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.320 
right it's much better than angry birds
it's<00:03:57.530> much<00:03:57.860> better<00:03:58.100> than<00:03:58.370> all<00:03:58.640> that<00:03:58.910> stuff

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
it's much better than all that stuff

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.320 
it's much better than all that stuff
that's<00:03:59.600> today<00:03:59.930> on<00:04:00.080> the<00:04:00.610> unwritten<00:04:01.610> under

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
that's today on the unwritten under

that's today on the unwritten under
under<00:04:02.930> smartphones<00:04:03.500> this<00:04:04.430> is<00:04:04.580> quality<00:04:05.180> gaming

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
under smartphones this is quality gaming

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.930
