00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
all those special effects and stuff you

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:59.099 
all those special effects and stuff you
know<00:00:57.609> you<00:00:57.699> can<00:00:57.850> squeeze<00:00:58.179> your<00:00:58.359> face<00:00:58.569> and<00:00:58.839> put<00:00:58.899> a

little funny hats on doesn't have that

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:04.259 
little funny hats on doesn't have that
is<00:01:01.510> pretty<00:01:01.769> straightforward<00:01:02.769> I<00:01:03.280> guess<00:01:04.059> that's

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
is pretty straightforward I guess that's

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.760 
is pretty straightforward I guess that's
okay<00:01:04.540> for<00:01:04.600> business<00:01:05.080> but<00:01:05.260> if<00:01:05.409> you<00:01:05.500> were<00:01:05.619> using

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
okay for business but if you were using

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.890 
okay for business but if you were using
this<00:01:06.040> as<00:01:06.220> an<00:01:06.340> entertainment<00:01:06.790> laptop<00:01:07.510> as<00:01:07.869> well

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
this as an entertainment laptop as well

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.090 
this as an entertainment laptop as well
you<00:01:08.110> probably<00:01:08.290> want<00:01:08.530> some<00:01:08.680> of<00:01:08.770> those<00:01:08.830> features
