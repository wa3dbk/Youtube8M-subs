00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
wonderful whipped cream is starting off

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.860 
wonderful whipped cream is starting off
with<00:00:10.889> an<00:00:11.040> ice<00:00:11.250> cold<00:00:11.550> Bowl<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.210> have<00:00:12.719> your

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
with an ice cold Bowl and have your

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:21.740 
with an ice cold Bowl and have your
cream<00:00:13.170> really<00:00:13.440> cold<00:00:13.799> as<00:00:13.980> well<00:00:20.240> I'm<00:00:21.240> using<00:00:21.510> the

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
cream really cold as well I'm using the

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.109 
cream really cold as well I'm using the
whisk<00:00:21.930> beater<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.619> now<00:00:23.039> I'm<00:00:23.220> pouring<00:00:23.550> in<00:00:23.850> 2

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
whisk beater and now I'm pouring in 2

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.429 
whisk beater and now I'm pouring in 2
cups<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.750> cold<00:00:25.710> heavy<00:00:26.099> cream<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.990> like<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.199> use

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
cups of cold heavy cream I like to use

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.700 
cups of cold heavy cream I like to use
fine<00:00:29.010> granulated<00:00:29.550> sugar<00:00:30.349> tablespoon<00:00:31.349> per<00:00:31.500> cup

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
fine granulated sugar tablespoon per cup

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.250 
fine granulated sugar tablespoon per cup
we<00:00:31.890> have<00:00:31.980> 2<00:00:32.130> cups<00:00:32.340> here<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:33.059> 2<00:00:33.120> tablespoons<00:00:33.450> and

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
we have 2 cups here so 2 tablespoons and

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.830 
we have 2 cups here so 2 tablespoons and
then<00:00:34.980> we<00:00:35.309> start<00:00:35.670> with<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.059> beaters<00:00:36.450> slow

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
then we start with a beaters slow

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.680 
then we start with a beaters slow
because<00:00:37.230> if<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:38.460> start<00:00:38.790> too<00:00:39.059> fast<00:00:39.390> it

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
because if you start too fast it

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.330 
because if you start too fast it
splashes<00:00:40.290> out<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:42.079> this<00:00:43.079> way<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.590> granulated

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
splashes out and this way the granulated

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.190 
splashes out and this way the granulated
sugar<00:00:44.489> will<00:00:45.030> dissolve<00:00:45.360> completely<00:00:46.079> by

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
sugar will dissolve completely by

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.229 
sugar will dissolve completely by
putting<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.710> right<00:00:46.920> at<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.070> beginning<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
putting it in right at the beginning the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.389 
putting it in right at the beginning the
important<00:00:48.750> thing<00:00:48.899> about<00:00:48.930> whipping<00:00:49.590> cream<00:00:49.950> is

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
important thing about whipping cream is

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.819 
important thing about whipping cream is
to<00:00:50.730> not<00:00:50.910> whip<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.600> much<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.649> becomes

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
to not whip it so much that it becomes

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.979 
to not whip it so much that it becomes
butter<00:00:53.250> but<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:53.879> also<00:00:54.059> don't<00:00:54.300> like<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.690> whip<00:00:54.840> it

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
butter but I also don't like to whip it

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.170 
butter but I also don't like to whip it
to<00:00:55.199> be<00:00:55.320> too<00:00:55.559> stiff<00:00:55.920> because<00:00:56.219> then<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:57.090> doesn't

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
to be too stiff because then it doesn't

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.349 
to be too stiff because then it doesn't
mound<00:00:57.690> softly<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.309> will<00:00:59.579> allow<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.030> beat

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
mound softly so I will allow it to beat

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.760 
mound softly so I will allow it to beat
for<00:01:00.870> about<00:01:01.050> 2<00:01:01.260> minutes

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
for about 2 minutes

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.170 
for about 2 minutes
and<00:01:01.890> then<00:01:02.070> as<00:01:02.190> soon<00:01:02.250> as<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.579> see<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.969> whisk

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
and then as soon as I see the whisk

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.910 
and then as soon as I see the whisk
marks<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.870> that's<00:01:04.140> beginning<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.710> thicken

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
marks and that's beginning to thicken

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.060 
marks and that's beginning to thicken
I'll<00:01:05.519> stop<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.180> beater<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.720> you'll<00:01:07.260> see<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
I'll stop the beater and you'll see the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.070 
I'll stop the beater and you'll see the
consistency<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.570> finished<00:01:09.900> off

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
consistency that it is and finished off

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.630 
consistency that it is and finished off
by<00:01:10.320> hand<00:01:12.229> you<00:01:13.229> can<00:01:13.290> see<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.799> whisk<00:01:14.010> marks<00:01:14.460> and

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
by hand you can see the whisk marks and

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.460 
by hand you can see the whisk marks and
how<00:01:14.729> nicely<00:01:15.030> it's<00:01:15.420> begun<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.930> thick<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.380> I'm

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
how nicely it's begun to thick and I'm

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.170 
how nicely it's begun to thick and I'm
going<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.619> bring<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.920> up<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.130> tiny<00:01:17.400> bit<00:01:17.610> more

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.580 

and<00:01:22.050> now<00:01:22.740> I'm<00:01:23.580> turning<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.390> off<00:01:24.510> completely

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.750 

and<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.830> can<00:01:28.980> see<00:01:29.160> it's<00:01:29.280> still<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.550> little

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
and you can see it's still a little

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.320 
and you can see it's still a little
soupy<00:01:30.210> at<00:01:30.300> this<00:01:30.480> point<00:01:31.520> but<00:01:32.520> here<00:01:32.880> I'd<00:01:33.090> rather

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
soupy at this point but here I'd rather

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.780 
soupy at this point but here I'd rather
continue<00:01:33.810> beating<00:01:34.260> by<00:01:34.560> hand<00:01:34.860> because<00:01:35.760> that

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
continue beating by hand because that

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.310 
continue beating by hand because that
way<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.210> don't<00:01:36.420> risk<00:01:36.750> over<00:01:37.080> beating<00:01:38.990> it<00:01:39.990> takes<00:01:40.200> a

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
way I don't risk over beating it takes a

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.110 
way I don't risk over beating it takes a
long<00:01:40.500> time<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.100> get<00:01:41.190> to<00:01:41.370> this<00:01:41.490> point<00:01:41.730> but<00:01:41.880> once

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
long time to get to this point but once

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.690 
long time to get to this point but once
it<00:01:42.270> gets<00:01:42.510> there<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:43.020> goes<00:01:43.530> very<00:01:43.830> fast<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:47.610> if

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
it gets there it goes very fast and if

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.190 
it gets there it goes very fast and if
worse<00:01:47.880> comes<00:01:48.120> to<00:01:48.270> worse<00:01:48.510> and<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.900> have<00:01:49.050> turned

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
worse comes to worse and you have turned

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.530 
worse comes to worse and you have turned
it<00:01:49.410> into<00:01:49.530> butter<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:50.190> keep<00:01:50.430> going<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.300> then

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
it into butter just keep going and then

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.210 
it into butter just keep going and then
type<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.020> butter<00:01:52.320> will<00:01:52.860> be<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.040> most

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
type it in butter will be the most

you<00:01:57.240> can<00:01:57.420> see<00:01:57.660> how<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.680> beginning<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.220> peak

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
you can see how it's beginning to peak

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.380 
you can see how it's beginning to peak
softly<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:01.080> mound<00:02:01.770> just<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.430> little<00:02:02.700> bit<00:02:02.820> more
