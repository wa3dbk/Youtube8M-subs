00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.280 
too full coverage it's more of a like a
light<00:03:17.000> coverage<00:03:17.420> but<00:03:17.570> it<00:03:17.690> just<00:03:17.840> looks<00:03:17.989> very

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
light coverage but it just looks very

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.319 
light coverage but it just looks very
natural<00:03:18.489> again<00:03:19.489> I<00:03:19.549> had<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:19.850> use<00:03:19.970> a<00:03:20.000> darker

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
natural again I had to use a darker

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.720 
natural again I had to use a darker
shade<00:03:20.480> because<00:03:20.750> my<00:03:21.110> body<00:03:21.470> was<00:03:21.829> much<00:03:22.489> more

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
shade because my body was much more

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.350 
shade because my body was much more
tanned<00:03:23.030> than<00:03:23.510> my<00:03:23.720> face<00:03:24.610> this<00:03:25.610> stuff<00:03:25.790> is<00:03:26.030> also

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
tanned than my face this stuff is also

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.850 
tanned than my face this stuff is also
