00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.120
Hi

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.000
I'll just pick any fucking "hi".

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.120
I'm here with Axel &amp; Natalie.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.740
Since my hair looks fucked up,

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.840
we're going to cut it today.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.240
And there's Emmelie.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.140
Hey!

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.800
And color it!

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.460
Let's begin!

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.720
N: I don't dare.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.340
Where is it shorter and where is it longer?

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.560
A: Like here?

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.000
N: Yeah, God.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.420
A: Hey, check the distance!

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.640
What?

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.460
N: What? Distance?

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.020
Here you see the millimetres.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.820
You were going for 0 millimeters!

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.900
What does that mean?

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.660
That I'll become skinhead.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.020
Is that 7 millimetres?

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.400
Yeah I think so.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.440
N: Or wue (what).

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.200
Do I have it upside down?

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.560
You shall have it like this,

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.560
then you glide it and VRRRRRR.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.440
A: What happened?

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.900
You're fucking brushing my haiear!

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.740
Haiear?

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.540
Ear.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.480
N: I don't dare.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.400
Now we're cropping it!

00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:20.515
A: He's like skinhead.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.560
I think it died now.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.680
We've been charging it for like 1 hour!?

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.140
What are you laughing at?

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.394
N: I'll connect the charger!

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.880
Is my hair ruined?

00:01:43.518 --> 00:01:46.078
It's just funny because it's long everywhere else.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.020
Okay, so this is how Timothy's hair looks like atm.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.040
Look at this.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.580
You cut a mole!

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.160
Can I see?

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.955
It got very short here (the hair).

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.420
It gets stuck!

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.640
Not when you shave.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.360
Just gotta..

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.080
A: It gets stuck.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.580
N: Yeah it gets stuck all the time.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.560
A: Because it's not on.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.160
Stop it!

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.380
Doesn't it get bald?

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.294
Here.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.200
I actually think it'll be good.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.940
Me too.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.620
A makeup brush to brush of the hair?

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.100
It's small.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.400
Take a towel?

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.600
I can get one, where are they?

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.354
I hate hair!

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.520
I hate it when people touch my face.

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:34.709
N: (Something) on the face.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.960
You seem to be satisfied over your work?

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.850
I am.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.640
I didn't know that I could do this.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.120
N: Are you done?

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.880
T: I get psycho thoughts.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.720
Let's just trim a little.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.545
E: But macaronis are good.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.740
Are you going to school tomorrow?

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.700
E: Me?

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.820
E: Yeah.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.720
Was that a joke?

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.240
Huh?

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.740
Was that a joke?

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.000
No?

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.160
She's born 95. (NO SCHOOL)

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.860
I've graduated.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.140
Why did you say she'll be up early tomorrow?

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.708
I'm meeting a friend.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.560
And she's gonna do a theory test.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.660
For fuck sake.

00:04:20.672 --> 00:04:23.072
No it was not a joke. &gt;.&lt;

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.760
Now we're coloring Timothy's hair.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.760
Yeah and it'll be this color.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.394
As you can see.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.500
Are we filming?

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.720
Okay hi.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.440
Do I need an audience? I get panic.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.600
It's 1 AM.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.660
I can't fix my hair now.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.960
This is the result.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.160
You'll see the results when it's fixed in another video.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.880
Kisses! Good night! It's 1 AM!

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.740
BEFORE

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.570
AFTER

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.080
Still ugly as fuck doe, houhouuu.
