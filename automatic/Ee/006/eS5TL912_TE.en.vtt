00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.570
 Construction series i at the start and 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.279
 Welcome to a subscription master 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.240
 one or two weapons masters 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.189
 Benfica orders he has no 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.439
 weapon master mode bell 4 3 had one 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.939
 However officer does not have and 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.010
 I've come up with a free mode 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.170
 the principle is relatively simple me 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.950
 comment live with you then together 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.140
 and try to pick up so many weapons 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.390
 as it somehow goes in a life and 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.640
 The principle is still a few rules 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.020
 I have to pick is looking for a weapon 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.399
 as soon as someone has killed and 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.930
 exactly from that the weapon 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.039
 it should cancel until then the 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.320
 that does not count 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.030
 and yes you have to try so long 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.770
 how to live and many weapons 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.230
 rhine to pop as it is somehow possible 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.879
 and take everything from the one you 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.350
 you can also kill which one 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.539
 but that is only appropriate and that 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.890
 does not count then to the score yes and 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.439
 As I said, the principle is there 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.780
 be unique and with it is the 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.189
 bock here in any case the subscribers 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.060
 by me and the first in any case 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.040
 here with at the start 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.299
 cool thing in any case and yes me 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.400
 would not say directly to not 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.340
 play with the scala at the beginning and then 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.630
 john has so constantly in colleagues 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.009
 kempin there it was okay okay so on 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.360
 let's go now we have to try 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.040
 I'm the round a bit later 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.430
 come with the vki now we have to 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.860
 try to be reasonably clear 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.990
 that will not be definitely not 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.520
 simply because the pipes are already seeing 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.540
 must pick up the weapon from that 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.280
 that worked quite well 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.049
 economy almost got it now 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.610
 we must fakt from her and are 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.079
 always directly on it 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.850
 We got a weapon to date has 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.560
 certainly not so bad because it 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.060
 damn hard to that too 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.860
 Inspire if you imagine then 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.079
 that the children were just like just now 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.180
 but just do not know 30 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.270
 kilometer further away then 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.500
 Sauschwer to get there and the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.729
 to get a weapon and then you have to 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.719
 just through the entire battlefield 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.159
 in it and that's why you should 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.720
 think twice about getting someone 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.760
 bring or 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.260
 nobody kills who is further away and me 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.380
 just notice what the whole thing is 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:15.090
 makes it harder that we have opponents 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:20.220
 that just dominates us right 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.120
 shit on will come clear and the 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.070
 opponents you can find now for the first time 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.040
 outside is at least one 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.960
 Weapon expires at least one week 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.400
 had you on it, it was clear that me 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.490
 the hardcore here gets the applicator 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.560
 Of course, you can jump right into it 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.790
 mouth 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.870
 and when I get revived counts 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.190
 that, of course, tells the whole story 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.090
 Of course not then I can completely 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.040
 continue playing normally 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.840
 and now you have to try 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.270
 reasonably to come here on space 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.620
 He just talked about my god 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:53.550
 my aiming is so much after so now 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.600
 we have to look that we are clearly here 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.980
 I think you can always do that a lot 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.660
 well in pairs play so one 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.940
 make splitscreen itself and then 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.670
 watch who merkels sharp 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.080
 or more weapons has so now 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.320
 let's just jump the daring 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.320
 wonder 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.940
 yes please 5 percent still help counts as 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.040
 that is, once counts as a kill 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.790
 I can also do it by virtue of him 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.489
 sincerely correct type of me here 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.140
 has revived and now you have to 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.180
 go down here to be careful because 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.980
 the type wants to train more and has 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.410
 also made it from behind where I got the way 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.560
 correctly the guys are just too heavy 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:33.080
 in the 23 bock has already 52 but the later 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.080
 uni weapon master is the difference 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.920
 old moth age shit shit 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.660
 crap 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.900
 it must try to clear it somehow 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.900
 come 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.730
 and all still live 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:51.519
 comment that is the bright sun 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:54.549
 still continue to be pure and 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:04:00.170
 who is not put away now 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:04.160
 no no no definitely 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.920
 nokia makes me look that time 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.180
 somehow get to run 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:16.010
 You will find some kills here 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:18.079
 but only one counts 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.430
 So a weapon even more calculated 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.079
 but I can also enjoy the others 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.470
 take off 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.760
 that was my weapon back to me 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:32.510
 this foal he has had and 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:34.040
 now I have it purely a grenade 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.720
 sorry at kitas school but you are 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.490
 I just have to go now 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.450
 try to get some boxes 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.010
 usd what are you yours and if i am 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.340
 now running very high is clearly 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.340
 on the mouth 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.050
 because we also have a weapon and that 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.800
 is the second now what came where 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.860
 now here 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:04.090
 yes, please recognize on the hill there in front 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.370
 what is he of the type sure yes 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.630
 clear 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.030
 okay we have two weapons now 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.110
 Of course, the company is done 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.640
 or three weapons the first 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:17.380
 Weapon counts also that is walter has 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:22.750
 this guy does not wear that kind of man 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:24.490
 I hate those kemper tampa bay is 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.630
 but revived by oh well everything 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.630
 a green one 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.470
 crap 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.150
 on 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.170
 the insider for you 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.409
 on 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:51.269
 so 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:53.539
 Now this guy is finally gone 

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:55.679
 I'm so excited that you can not do it 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:57.569
 to bring a bit of life here 

00:05:55.679 --> 00:06:00.689
 understandable so now we have again 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:01.979
 a weapon that I will probably 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:03.389
 synonymous somehow show in the top right 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:05.639
 is better for a weapon and how many 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.929
 Weapons overall so what was me then 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:08.669
 I think that was the first time 

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:11.849
 what matters is not really cold 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:16.889
 I own or have because now here the 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:19.949
 m 416 is I can say so yes 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:21.989
 is not a problem so please, please, how many 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:24.089
 is that everything? 

00:06:21.989 --> 00:06:25.409
 clear where to revive protection people 

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:26.659
 revive quite important though 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:29.069
 you such egoists since and 

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:32.089
 Waffenmeister plays where it just 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:37.439
 it depends on people to take 

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:39.630
 how many are so that was the next 

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:41.650
 weapon 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:46.780
 we watch that we are pushing a 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:47.770
 little life departure is quite more there 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.810
 yes already over 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.910
 People I had to have a look 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.190
 that it fits in with the recording time 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.180
 Definitely more exciting moni and yes 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.820
 I would say if it is you 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:04.030
 liked how to leave a comment and 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:05.590
 side got off what's going on and mf5 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.120
 for weapons master now not so 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.220
 bad and I'll do it now 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.289
 I have to comment live 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:14.699
 Kathrein until next time 

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:14.699
 and yes, all right
