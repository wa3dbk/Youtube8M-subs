infection Monistat 7 drives it up so my

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.819 
infection Monistat 7 drives it up so my
first<00:03:06.419> thought<00:03:06.569> was<00:03:06.900> if<00:03:07.169> it's<00:03:07.319> good<00:03:07.500> enough<00:03:07.530> to

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
first thought was if it's good enough to

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.409 
first thought was if it's good enough to
go<00:03:07.949> in<00:03:08.040> your<00:03:08.189> body<00:03:08.400> is<00:03:08.669> good<00:03:08.879> enough<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.150> go<00:03:09.389> on

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:09.419 
go in your body is good enough to go on

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:12.020 
go in your body is good enough to go on
on<00:03:09.659> your<00:03:09.959> body<00:03:10.199> or<00:03:10.530> your<00:03:10.650> scalp<00:03:11.219> or<00:03:11.579> whatever

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
but it dries it up why would I put all

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.659 
but it dries it up why would I put all
that<00:03:15.449> oils<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.139> stuff<00:03:16.229> in<00:03:16.530> my<00:03:16.680> hair<00:03:16.949> to<00:03:17.519> keep

well diluted the way I had it I think

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.839 
well diluted the way I had it I think
that<00:03:58.229> it<00:03:58.409> will<00:03:58.560> dry<00:03:58.829> out<00:03:58.889> your<00:03:59.009> hair<00:03:59.370> dry<00:03:59.699> out
