now<00:01:51.950> on<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.100> filter<00:01:53.340> board<00:01:53.520> obiano<00:01:53.790> reading

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
now on the filter board obiano reading

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.550 
now on the filter board obiano reading
here<00:01:54.360> which<00:01:54.540> you'll<00:01:54.720> need<00:01:54.870> to<00:01:55.020> remove<00:01:55.440> them

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
here which you'll need to remove them

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.200 
here which you'll need to remove them
far<00:01:55.830> away<00:01:55.890> put<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.280> new<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:56.700> with<00:01:56.910> the<00:01:57.000> filt

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
far away put a new one in with the filt

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.990 
far away put a new one in with the filt
new<00:01:57.360> filter<00:01:57.979> there's<00:01:58.979> also<00:01:59.100> another<00:01:59.310> opening

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
new filter there's also another opening

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.550 
new filter there's also another opening
on<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.330> pump<00:02:00.510> body<00:02:00.690> that<00:02:01.110> will<00:02:01.229> need<00:02:01.380> to

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
on the pump body that will need to

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.350 
on the pump body that will need to
change<00:02:02.010> before<00:02:02.250> we<00:02:02.430> put<00:02:02.580> a<00:02:02.610> new<00:02:02.760> filter<00:02:02.910> on<00:02:03.150> and

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
change before we put a new filter on and

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.480 
change before we put a new filter on and
then<00:02:04.110> what<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.260> like<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.530> do<00:02:04.710> now<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.160> just<00:02:05.190> get

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
then what I like to do now is just get

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.400 
then what I like to do now is just get
this<00:02:05.760> filter<00:02:06.210> bowl<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.390> really<00:02:06.840> good<00:02:06.990> clean<00:02:07.229> act

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
this filter bowl a really good clean act

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.779 
this filter bowl a really good clean act
get<00:02:07.590> rid<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.740> all<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.280> crud<00:02:08.490> that's<00:02:08.610> in

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
get rid of all of the crud that's in

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.580 
get rid of all of the crud that's in
there<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:09.840> you're<00:02:10.050> starting<00:02:10.380> afresh

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
there so that you're starting afresh

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.590 
there so that you're starting afresh
with<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.760> new<00:02:11.880> filter<00:02:14.090> so<00:02:15.090> we've<00:02:15.209> got<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.420> new

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
with the new filter so we've got a new

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.290 
with the new filter so we've got a new
filter<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.260> also<00:02:16.920> have<00:02:17.040> two<00:02:17.190> new<00:02:17.220> o-rings<00:02:17.730> I'm

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
filter and also have two new o-rings I'm

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.520 
filter and also have two new o-rings I'm
just<00:02:18.480> going<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.630> put<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.810> little<00:02:18.900> bit<00:02:19.050> diesel<00:02:19.440> on

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
just going to put a little bit diesel on

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.310 
just going to put a little bit diesel on
this<00:02:19.709> o-ring<00:02:19.890> just<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.340> lubricate<00:02:20.489> it<00:02:21.320> we'll

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
this o-ring just to lubricate it we'll

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.770 
this o-ring just to lubricate it we'll
just<00:02:22.500> put<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:22.680> in<00:02:22.920> its<00:02:23.100> in<00:02:23.700> its<00:02:23.850> position<00:02:24.360> and

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
just put that in its in its position and

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.400 
just put that in its in its position and
there<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:26.040> then<00:02:26.190> we<00:02:26.340> can<00:02:27.140> screw<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.290> new

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
there and then we can screw the new

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.150 
there and then we can screw the new
filter<00:02:29.000> to<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.090> bulb<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:31.650> this<00:02:31.770> only<00:02:31.980> needs

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
filter to the bulb and this only needs

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160 
filter to the bulb and this only needs
to<00:02:32.370> be<00:02:32.520> hand<00:02:32.910> tight<00:02:33.209> so<00:02:33.510> we<00:02:33.630> just<00:02:33.810> screw<00:02:34.020> up

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
to be hand tight so we just screw up

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.840 
to be hand tight so we just screw up
till<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.470> sits<00:02:34.800> home<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.280> then<00:02:35.430> just<00:02:35.610> give<00:02:35.760> it

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
till it sits home and then just give it

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.970 
till it sits home and then just give it
a<00:02:36.110> slight<00:02:37.110> turn<00:02:37.320> like<00:02:37.530> that

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
a slight turn like that

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.250 
a slight turn like that
so<00:02:38.640> before<00:02:38.910> we<00:02:39.000> bring<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.300> new<00:02:39.600> filter<00:02:39.870> over

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
so before we bring the new filter over

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.870 
so before we bring the new filter over
we<00:02:40.470> are<00:02:40.500> just<00:02:40.800> going<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:40.980> replace<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.610> other

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
we are just going to replace the other

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.370 
we are just going to replace the other
o-ring<00:02:42.330> which<00:02:42.450> sits<00:02:42.660> on<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.810> shaft<00:02:43.110> under

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
o-ring which sits on the shaft under

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.640 
o-ring which sits on the shaft under
here<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:43.739> we'll<00:02:43.860> remove<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.310> old<00:02:44.459> one<00:02:44.730> and

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
here so we'll remove the old one and

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.060 
here so we'll remove the old one and
then<00:02:46.650> we'll<00:02:46.830> put<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.070> new<00:02:47.220> one<00:02:47.430> on<00:02:47.580> there<00:02:49.070> if

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
then we'll put the new one on there if

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.310 
then we'll put the new one on there if
the<00:02:50.880> filter<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:51.510> below<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.870> level<00:02:52.170> of<00:02:52.230> the

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
the filter is below the level of the

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.810 
the filter is below the level of the
fuel<00:02:52.470> tank<00:02:52.739> you<00:02:52.860> can't<00:02:53.100> fill<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.400> simply<00:02:53.700> by

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
fuel tank you can't fill it simply by

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.310 
fuel tank you can't fill it simply by
opening<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:54.239> fuel<00:02:54.420> valve<00:02:54.660> but<00:02:54.870> on<00:02:54.959> this<00:02:55.110> boat

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
opening the fuel valve but on this boat

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.140 
opening the fuel valve but on this boat
it's<00:02:55.530> higher<00:02:55.739> so<00:02:56.310> open<00:02:56.549> the<00:02:56.640> fuel<00:02:56.760> valve<00:02:57.000> won't

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
it's higher so open the fuel valve won't

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.430 
it's higher so open the fuel valve won't
do<00:02:57.330> anything<00:02:57.660> so<00:02:57.780> wonder<00:02:58.019> it<00:02:58.140> is<00:02:58.230> I'm<00:02:58.410> just

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
do anything so wonder it is I'm just

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.930 
do anything so wonder it is I'm just
going<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.709> pour<00:02:58.890> some<00:02:58.920> clean<00:02:59.310> diesel<00:02:59.519> straight

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
going to pour some clean diesel straight

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.670 
going to pour some clean diesel straight
into<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.269> into<00:03:00.390> this<00:03:00.540> pull<00:03:00.750> up<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.320> then<00:03:01.560> I'm

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
into it into this pull up and then I'm

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.050 
into it into this pull up and then I'm
going<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:01.890> screw<00:03:02.100> it<00:03:02.160> straight<00:03:02.400> on<00:03:02.549> in<00:03:02.940> its

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
going to screw it straight on in its

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.960 
going to screw it straight on in its
full<00:03:03.239> position<00:03:04.220> you<00:03:05.220> do<00:03:05.340> need<00:03:05.489> clean<00:03:05.790> diesel

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
full position you do need clean diesel

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.250 
full position you do need clean diesel
to<00:03:06.180> do<00:03:06.299> this<00:03:06.450> because<00:03:06.630> obviously<00:03:06.930> don't<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.200> be

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
to do this because obviously don't to be

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.680 
to do this because obviously don't to be
introducing<00:03:07.890> any<00:03:08.130> contamination<00:03:09.000> into<00:03:09.360> this

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
introducing any contamination into this

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.080 
introducing any contamination into this
filter<00:03:10.049> any<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:11.459> small<00:03:11.820> amount<00:03:12.030> of

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
filter any a small amount of

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.550 
filter any a small amount of
contamination<00:03:12.510> you<00:03:12.690> bring<00:03:12.930> is<00:03:13.049> not<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.230> massive

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
contamination you bring is not a massive

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.720 
contamination you bring is not a massive
problem<00:03:13.769> because<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:14.040> will<00:03:14.160> get<00:03:14.280> filtered<00:03:14.519> out

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
problem because it will get filtered out

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.789 
problem because it will get filtered out
by<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.880> secondary<00:03:15.239> filter<00:03:15.480> so<00:03:16.470> that's<00:03:16.650> full

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
by the secondary filter so that's full

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.350 
by the secondary filter so that's full
of<00:03:16.860> diesel<00:03:17.040> now<00:03:17.370> but<00:03:17.549> before<00:03:17.850> we<00:03:17.940> screw<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.209> on

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
of diesel now but before we screw it on

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.310 
of diesel now but before we screw it on
I'm<00:03:18.480> just<00:03:18.540> going<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.780> put<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:18.930> little<00:03:19.110> bit<00:03:19.200> of

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
I'm just going to put a little bit of

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.710 
I'm just going to put a little bit of
diesel<00:03:19.620> on<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:19.920> o-ring<00:03:20.280> there<00:03:20.430> just<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.850> help

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
diesel on the o-ring there just to help

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.380 
diesel on the o-ring there just to help
lubricate<00:03:21.900> it

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.670 

and<00:03:25.390> again<00:03:25.660> this<00:03:25.870> doesn't<00:03:26.110> need<00:03:26.290> to<00:03:26.350> be<00:03:26.500> too

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
and again this doesn't need to be too

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.200 
and again this doesn't need to be too
tight<00:03:26.920> so<00:03:27.010> we<00:03:27.220> just<00:03:27.370> wait<00:03:27.550> till<00:03:27.700> it<00:03:27.790> seats<00:03:28.000> home

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 
tight so we just wait till it seats home

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.600 
tight so we just wait till it seats home
and<00:03:28.450> just<00:03:28.630> give<00:03:28.780> it<00:03:28.870> another<00:03:29.050> half<00:03:29.950> turn<00:03:30.220> or<00:03:30.430> so

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
and just give it another half turn or so

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.150 
and just give it another half turn or so
just<00:03:31.030> hand<00:03:31.210> tight<00:03:31.420> only<00:03:31.830> so<00:03:32.830> that's<00:03:33.010> the

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
just hand tight only so that's the

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.620 
just hand tight only so that's the
primary<00:03:33.400> filters<00:03:33.880> done<00:03:34.030> now<00:03:34.330> we're<00:03:34.450> going<00:03:34.540> to

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
primary filters done now we're going to

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.940 
primary filters done now we're going to
be<00:03:34.690> moving<00:03:34.810> on<00:03:35.050> to<00:03:35.080> the<00:03:35.230> secondary<00:03:35.530> filters

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
be moving on to the secondary filters

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.860 
be moving on to the secondary filters
and<00:03:36.130> again<00:03:36.820> to<00:03:37.270> this<00:03:37.390> we're<00:03:37.600> going<00:03:37.720> to<00:03:37.780> be

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
and again to this we're going to be

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.410 
and again to this we're going to be
needing<00:03:38.050> a<00:03:38.200> filter<00:03:38.470> wrench<00:03:39.060> so<00:03:40.060> now<00:03:40.180> we've<00:03:40.330> got

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
needing a filter wrench so now we've got

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.580 
needing a filter wrench so now we've got
it<00:03:40.450> hand<00:03:40.720> loose<00:03:40.900> I'm<00:03:41.080> just<00:03:41.230> going<00:03:41.350> to<00:03:41.380> get<00:03:41.500> in

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
it hand loose I'm just going to get in

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.170 
it hand loose I'm just going to get in
there<00:03:41.770> and<00:03:41.980> unscrew<00:03:42.460> it<00:03:42.490> all<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.760> way<00:03:42.880> but<00:03:43.120> I'm

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
there and unscrew it all the way but I'm

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.220 
there and unscrew it all the way but I'm
going<00:03:43.270> to<00:03:43.360> put<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.510> container<00:03:43.810> underneath

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
going to put a container underneath

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:53.470 
going to put a container underneath
again<00:03:44.350> just<00:03:44.740> to<00:03:44.830> catch<00:03:45.040> any<00:03:45.220> spilled

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.500 

so<00:03:54.480> we've<00:03:54.600> got<00:03:54.720> a<00:03:54.750> new<00:03:54.960> secondary<00:03:55.500> fuel<00:03:55.710> filter

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
so we've got a new secondary fuel filter

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.700 
so we've got a new secondary fuel filter
what<00:03:57.510> we<00:03:57.600> need<00:03:57.720> to<00:03:57.780> do<00:03:57.900> is<00:03:58.020> just<00:03:58.170> lubricate

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
what we need to do is just lubricate

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.990 
what we need to do is just lubricate
that<00:03:58.740> o-ring<00:03:58.980> with<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.370> little<00:03:59.550> bit<00:03:59.640> diesel

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
that o-ring with a little bit diesel

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.670 
that o-ring with a little bit diesel
like<00:04:00.060> we<00:04:00.180> did<00:04:00.300> on<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.480> other<00:04:00.540> one<00:04:00.660> now<00:04:01.410> I'm<00:04:01.500> not

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
like we did on the other one now I'm not

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.810 
like we did on the other one now I'm not
going<00:04:01.800> to<00:04:01.860> be<00:04:01.980> filling<00:04:02.220> this<00:04:02.310> one<00:04:02.520> with<00:04:02.700> a

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
going to be filling this one with a

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.490 
going to be filling this one with a
clean<00:04:03.090> diesel<00:04:03.360> and<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:03.720> simple<00:04:04.080> reason<00:04:04.110> plays

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
clean diesel and the simple reason plays

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.810 
clean diesel and the simple reason plays
I<00:04:04.860> don't<00:04:05.190> want<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.400> introduce<00:04:05.610> any

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
I don't want to introduce any

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.370 
I don't want to introduce any
contamination<00:04:06.420> into<00:04:06.870> this<00:04:06.990> filter<00:04:07.350> that

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
contamination into this filter that

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.140 
contamination into this filter that
might<00:04:07.680> be<00:04:07.800> bypassed<00:04:08.340> I<00:04:08.640> it<00:04:08.790> might<00:04:08.970> go<00:04:09.090> straight

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
might be bypassed I it might go straight

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.300 
might be bypassed I it might go straight
from<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.780> filter<00:04:10.080> into<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.590> diesel<00:04:10.860> injector

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
from the filter into the diesel injector

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.740 
from the filter into the diesel injector
pump<00:04:11.460> so<00:04:12.060> we're<00:04:12.150> going<00:04:12.240> to<00:04:12.300> put<00:04:12.450> this<00:04:12.540> one<00:04:12.690> on

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
pump so we're going to put this one on

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.210 
pump so we're going to put this one on
empty<00:04:13.350> and<00:04:13.530> we're<00:04:13.650> going<00:04:13.770> to<00:04:13.800> fill<00:04:13.980> it<00:04:14.100> by

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
empty and we're going to fill it by

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.620 
empty and we're going to fill it by
following<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.610> bleeding<00:04:14.910> process<00:04:15.120> which

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
following the bleeding process which

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.520 
following the bleeding process which
you'll<00:04:15.870> see<00:04:15.900> later

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
you'll see later

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.860 
you'll see later
so<00:04:17.430> 15<00:04:17.790> this<00:04:18.000> filter<00:04:18.390> is<00:04:18.450> just<00:04:18.630> a<00:04:18.690> case<00:04:18.840> of

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
so 15 this filter is just a case of

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.080 
so 15 this filter is just a case of
twisting<00:04:19.440> on<00:04:19.650> until<00:04:20.160> it<00:04:20.280> seats<00:04:20.489> home<00:04:20.730> and<00:04:21.000> then

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
twisting on until it seats home and then

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.700 
twisting on until it seats home and then
just<00:04:21.239> giving<00:04:21.390> it<00:04:21.510> another<00:04:21.690> 1/2<00:04:21.959> to<00:04:22.110> 3/4<00:04:22.560> of<00:04:22.620> a

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
just giving it another 1/2 to 3/4 of a

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.640 
just giving it another 1/2 to 3/4 of a
turn<00:04:22.890> and<00:04:23.160> tire<00:04:23.700> only<00:04:24.030> again<00:04:24.320> so<00:04:25.320> that's<00:04:25.500> how

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
turn and tire only again so that's how

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.680 
turn and tire only again so that's how
to<00:04:25.710> change<00:04:26.010> the<00:04:26.250> fuel<00:04:26.430> filters<00:04:26.820> as<00:04:27.270> important

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
to change the fuel filters as important

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.000 
to change the fuel filters as important
that<00:04:27.840> yours<00:04:28.050> about<00:04:28.260> owner<00:04:28.500> I<00:04:28.530> understand<00:04:28.860> had

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
that yours about owner I understand had

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.470 
that yours about owner I understand had
to<00:04:29.100> do<00:04:29.220> this<00:04:29.400> not<00:04:29.760> only<00:04:29.820> because<00:04:30.150> it's<00:04:30.270> part<00:04:30.300> of

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
to do this not only because it's part of

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.150 
to do this not only because it's part of
the<00:04:30.570> annual<00:04:30.870> service<00:04:31.200> regime<00:04:31.770> but<00:04:32.010> also

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
the annual service regime but also

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.700 
the annual service regime but also
because<00:04:32.580> fuel<00:04:32.970> filters<00:04:33.300> can<00:04:33.480> often<00:04:33.930> block<00:04:34.470> out

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
because fuel filters can often block out

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.350 
because fuel filters can often block out
a<00:04:34.770> C<00:04:35.130> and<00:04:35.430> if<00:04:35.520> you<00:04:35.610> don't<00:04:35.850> know<00:04:35.910> how<00:04:36.030> to<00:04:36.090> change

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
a C and if you don't know how to change

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.760 
a C and if you don't know how to change
them<00:04:36.600> you<00:04:36.780> might<00:04:36.930> find<00:04:37.110> yourself<00:04:37.230> without<00:04:37.740> a

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
them you might find yourself without a

them you might find yourself without a
running<00:04:38.070> engine<00:04:38.570> changing<00:04:39.570> the<00:04:39.630> filters<00:04:39.870> is

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
running engine changing the filters is

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.240 
running engine changing the filters is
only<00:04:40.080> part<00:04:40.320> of<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.440> equation<00:04:40.560> no<00:04:40.950> what<00:04:41.160> you

only part of the equation no what you

only part of the equation no what you
need<00:04:41.400> to<00:04:41.490> do<00:04:41.610> now<00:04:41.820> is<00:04:42.060> to<00:04:42.240> bleed<00:04:42.540> the<00:04:42.690> system<00:04:42.840> to

need to do now is to bleed the system to

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.780 
need to do now is to bleed the system to
