00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:06.190
 He is welcome until 2014 where we are here 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.930
 have the genius nomad m9 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.980
 dino is a manufacturer now in 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.000
 Germany also with a few 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.870
 trade partner cooperation 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.550
 can work together 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.200
 Here we have something very special 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:18.250
 because I have a 9 inch resolution 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:22.810
 not 97 not 8,9 but 9 inches and 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.919
 full HD, however, with 1920 x 1280 pixels 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.439
 I could be quite good here 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.520
 recognize 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.169
 and yes, that's what samsung does 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.099
 here very briefly the technical data 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:31.720
 then I do not have that much 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:32.980
 tell we have 16 gb internal 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.739
 memory that we can expand and 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.100
 also the ig is her with the film the 210th 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.480
 There will be 220 euros for this tablet 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.699
 here with a quad core processor too 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.500
 again in there and actually 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.140
 more so should run quite well has 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.730
 the same weight as an ipad retina 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.480
 I can do it very briefly then 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.489
 we can see here 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.170
 that's what it looks like i can attract it 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.039
 and here we are in jelly bean 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.719
 something in there relatively unchanged here 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.100
 has been played on it you can tell 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.260
 partly the quad core processor 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.390
 needs a bit of training 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.390
 So that could run something smoothly 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.290
 but you see that is going pretty fast 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.659
 I can stay here for a short time 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.689
 settings go in and built here 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.130
 tablet show you 422 may newest like 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:16.600
 Who said a protective film on it now 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.729
 that's why the picture field is not quite like that 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.320
 nice as you would wish but 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.670
 I can do another full hd here 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.640
 video play was for example here 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.380
 see a promotional video from step up 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.590
 revolution is a cool dance 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.640
 movie here of course accordingly 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.960
 wonderful synonymous to the movies look something 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.030
 tablet where, of course, quite a lot 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.340
 black and was black bar above 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.070
 and it will be down in 16 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.270
 But the ten best 16 to 9 table is 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.799
 Above all, we can do with the resolution 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.079
 if we needed I would have now 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.820
 but no internet connected here 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.560
 we can really do a lot of 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.420
 the side do not know even in the height 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.829
 just in the broad so that's it 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.060
 In any case very good and I can 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.649
 again briefly show the keyboard 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.450
 here when I use the browsers depend on where 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.860
 we really are here too 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.560
 Round was fast on it team can therefore 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.759
 Slowly, the tablet is not and 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.189
 Of course, turn in any direction 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.500
 can and here's the keyboard too 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.780
 still very good with 2 behind 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.869
 can 24 accordingly if you want 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.550
 still usable and otherwise i can 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.090
 of course we still show the cameras 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.890
 have behind 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.220
 we probably read you have read 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.050
 five megapixels and 2 wide front 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.430
 It is not but we can do it here 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.720
 Everything with the big keys very good 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.099
 photos i think shoot this is 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.739
 actually very funny to watch 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:29.760
 I can actually be great buttons 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.760
 but can turn around very briefly 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.610
 here the front camera a bit slow so 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.860
 My head is like a cucumber but 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.090
 otherwise yes if you keep that quiet 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.470
 Do you have a facial recognition with 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.209
 and you can actually 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.670
 shoot relatively detailed pictures 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.319
 So here I have something 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.870
 Little beards here you can also completely 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.010
 good details but recognize for 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.370
 Small town shots it should be on 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.049
 every case here is enough bonino de 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.670
 By the way, there you can 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.019
 Tablets was also maybe a look 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.580
 I do not even order for sure 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.970
 not look at sven but that was 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.670
 a short shirt with the ends on 9 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.440
 nice metal case here comes the sim 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.390
 card purely come here in the micro sd card 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.459
 pure volume control on and off 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.069
 camera without lightning here arise the 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.310
 Antenna for 3g headphone jack and 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.170
 otherwise, of course, a microphone 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.120
 and also micro usb with speakers 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.299
 here also with existing at the 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.980
 with a new business one shot of 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.980
