00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.439
 on youtube already has a gameplay channel 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.080
 almost no one says a channel of 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.800
 Conversation I'm down to 4 m 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.289
 commerce 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.160

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.480
 I want to make you blog, you get a theme.

 cheer up others looking a lot at the screen 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.170

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.469
 for the camera 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.590

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.360
 Could do nothing different but I 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.820
 I could find a way and my way is 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.030
 catch some animals of the season from a 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.830
 summer or winter season 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.590
 spring chose the animals that 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.590
 comment and comment on each episode of them 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.750

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.760
 go 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.830
 I think it will be fun that will give 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:23.340
 I work a lot the first classic in the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:25.110
 Sunday commenting animes the first with 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.780
 the noise and commented rivers are born from 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.340
 anime serva do service that is a beautiful 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.840
 new glee season tells the story 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.299
 of three people who start working 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.729
 with the public servants in a place that 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.979
 I think it's the Dutch well being and 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.020
 public health are something tivoli 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.659
 totally naked work experience is 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.920
 very funny so a way that 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.270
 unroll 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.689
 So let's talk about the characters. 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.939

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.310
 what a nice guy was a lot 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.710
 funny in this first episode because 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.469
 he would make jokes like the kind of 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.689
 place for smoking has a place for me 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.490
 I was putting off you getting me 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.380
 This is very funny because it anticipated 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.409
 a kind of heartthrob like 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.569
 before that was the worst description that 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.030
 could have given the character but is 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.430
 more or less so and the second character 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.160
 that comes here is mine the chip is a 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.989
 shy girl who is the first job 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.319
 her so much that she makes a point of speaking 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:25.260
 this way please be kind to me 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.150

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.120
 inexperience and the third person who is 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.480

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.080

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.599

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:46.530

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:55.049
 of the person who when she was born left 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.959

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.549
 in it are several gigantic names 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.549

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.380

 The first discontented video story is 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.390

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.630

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.090
 they put a job here just inside the 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.819
 gentio so strange comment the opinion 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.459
 anime was one of the best young people 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.069
 I already saw the benfica but I liked it 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.450
 up to now was a minimum of 2012 was 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.980
 play again 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.690
 tomÃ© is from the first church a hollow and a girl 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.780
 but it could not overcome the 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.900
 President has the defects in the hills 73 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.629
 Look, they were very nice. 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.549
 The rhythm is cool, so addictive. 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:17.430
 shows everyone that is showing up 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:20.280
 anime probably the character stayed 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.160
 well I really liked it and one 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.370
 first episode of an anime to start already 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.729
 with the view is different from the anime be 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:33.210
 unlike most homes that has 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:35.639
 all in one family schoolboy 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.139
 the restaurant is not that about people 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.990
 who will work with the servers 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:42.210
 in the place where it deals with good 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.669
 being and health was very funny 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.830
 The situation has had very good jokes. 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.139
 when the chief of the 13 people started 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.360
 work begins to speak then why 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.320

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.260
 population 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.960
 This was funny first video gives 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.419
 discount and the anime is legal 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.370

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.110
 absurdly superficial comments
