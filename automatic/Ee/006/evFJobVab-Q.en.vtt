00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
for each section and make sure that you

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.120 
for each section and make sure that you
start<00:01:52.730> your<00:01:53.730> next<00:01:53.880> crimp<00:01:54.390> exactly<00:01:55.140> where<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
start your next crimp exactly where the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.550 
start your next crimp exactly where the
previous<00:01:56.370> one<00:01:56.760> ended<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.450> order<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.230> get<00:01:58.410> the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
previous one ended in order to get the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:08.700 
previous one ended in order to get the
desired<00:01:58.680> look

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.350 

and<00:02:09.710> after<00:02:10.009> your<00:02:10.100> first<00:02:10.340> piece<00:02:10.610> is<00:02:10.820> done<00:02:11.180> it

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
and after your first piece is done it

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.920 
and after your first piece is done it
should<00:02:11.540> look<00:02:11.600> like<00:02:11.720> that<00:02:13.000> so<00:02:14.000> just<00:02:14.630> do<00:02:14.810> the

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
should look like that so just do the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:03:01.700 
should look like that so just do the
same<00:02:15.140> thing<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.520> next<00:02:16.910> section

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.990 

it's<00:03:02.710> pretty<00:03:02.950> much<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.250> same<00:03:03.280> process<00:03:03.820> all

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
it's pretty much the same process all

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.480 
it's pretty much the same process all
over<00:03:04.060> my<00:03:04.420> head<00:03:04.690> so<00:03:04.720> after<00:03:05.440> I<00:03:05.470> do<00:03:05.590> this<00:03:05.920> one<00:03:06.220> in

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
over my head so after I do this one in

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.400 
over my head so after I do this one in
regular<00:03:06.940> motion<00:03:07.150> I'm<00:03:07.450> just<00:03:07.630> gonna<00:03:07.780> speed<00:03:08.140> up
