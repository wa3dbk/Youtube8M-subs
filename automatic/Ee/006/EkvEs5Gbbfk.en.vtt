00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.930
 hello friends with you wind glory 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.730
 I often ask subscribers or friends 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.960
 where would you like to settle in azerote i 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.969
 hear the same answer 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.160
 la grande but really the place is very 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.890
 beautiful nice nature 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.380
 sky sky just awesome big 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.109
 number of animals and of course lovely tale 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.130
 beeches all this makes a grant very 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.599
 a pleasant place to stay today 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.760
 I decided to look for where you can 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.820
 settle first place that I 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.530
 visited called goods and here it seems 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.640
 don't want to sell anything 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.070
 the guards are angry and look at me somehow 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.090
 with high or no look or 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.090
 still watching and 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.700
 no no no no no no no okay after 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.590
 I had to wash this walk 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.760
 motorcycles i go on obviously in you 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.590
 lari nothing shines me 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.539
 in general I would like to note that a big 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.699
 part of the buildings in the grande looks like 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.520
 because in general you see nothing now 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.350
 good in general such upside down 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.439
 empty clay pots 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.909
 with a broken ceiling often not generally 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.430
 I know how they can live and then we can 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.090
 warm enough to settle in 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.100
 such places 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.250
 whether it is to settle in any 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.200
 wet scary big cave like 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.540
 for example this glorious ashu gong 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.299
 huge construction or clearly visible on 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.590
 the map is hard to miss in general 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.619
 probably a good place to live 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.060
 let's see what's inside I think 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.860
 that many of you have already forgotten long ago 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.119
 been at the limit i'm more than sure all 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.120
 your pandarians are hanging out 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.030
 and meanwhile bk probably dance 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.570
 the best who ever were in the woo by 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.790
 at least in appearance 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.440
 locations are definitely driving into a cave and 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.090
 Immediately understand that you can not live here but 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.100
 it would be strange to live in a cave 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.400
 if you are not some monsters there 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.050
 ghoul or spider after all I'm a little 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.560
 pirates spiderman so cave for 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.000
 I'm obviously not going to fit here 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.840
 such a wonderful resident 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.640
 org grandparent I think that such a light 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.350
 we do not need but by the way 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.940
 on grant many strange neighbors who 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.429
 hardly anyone would like them then 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.440
 portals are building something just 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.060
 dress up weird only beautiful 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.520
 the house I found on the grande is it 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.400
 this and around is kinda more or less quiet 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.460
 and calm 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.590
 regarding of course one more place 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.100
 which you might like in on 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.290
 grandee 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.440
 maybe it would be possible to settle in it 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.920
 but not worth it halo 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.480
 minus this place is that often she 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.190
 It passes from hand to hand here now she 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.600
 for example sky alliances and then again 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.489
 will become Horde alliances skiba 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.320
 Horde alliances skip in general place 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.620
 where the war is not the best for life 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.989
 that's for sure but around 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.900
 beautiful nature and the flying island 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:52.100
 sky what sky 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:54.480
 another glorious place is a mountain gift 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.610
 here you can probably stay 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.200
 if in arch but again architecture here 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.180
 quite standard for on the gran yes and hardly 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.520
 can you live well in it but i found 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:08.630
 just such a nice chain dear 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.630
 do you want to live with me 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.930
 ok guys thanks for watching how 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.239
 see in on the grandee decent housing is not 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.860
 in the comments leave your opinions on 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.750
 about where you can settle in 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.750
 azerote or outland even good luck to you
