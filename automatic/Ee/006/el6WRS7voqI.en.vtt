it's very beta made for tegra 3 but you
are<00:01:14.710> going<00:01:14.829> to<00:01:14.920> be<00:01:14.979> able<00:01:15.039> to<00:01:15.159> see<00:01:15.310> that<00:01:15.549> the

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
are going to be able to see that the

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.399 
are going to be able to see that the
resolution<00:01:16.149> is<00:01:16.299> running<00:01:16.630> native<00:01:17.229> resolution

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
resolution is running native resolution

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.179 
resolution is running native resolution
so<00:01:17.979> it's<00:01:18.100> really<00:01:19.090> fantastically

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
so it's really fantastically

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.249 
so it's really fantastically
nice-looking<00:01:21.719> this<00:01:22.719> is<00:01:22.810> really<00:01:22.899> the<00:01:23.049> same

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
nice-looking this is really the same

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:24.779 
nice-looking this is really the same
scene<00:01:23.560> essentially<00:01:24.009> we<00:01:24.130> saw<00:01:24.310> and<00:01:24.490> we<00:01:24.520> did<00:01:24.700> the

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
scene essentially we saw and we did the

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.179 
scene essentially we saw and we did the
original<00:01:24.939> review<00:01:25.329> the<00:01:25.600> transform<00:01:26.049> crime<00:01:26.320> when

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
original review the transform crime when

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.870 
original review the transform crime when
we<00:01:27.280> compared<00:01:27.579> it<00:01:27.670> to<00:01:27.700> that<00:01:27.880> kept<00:01:28.149> two<00:01:28.359> and<00:01:29.880> as

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880

bit more show you it's super super fast
and<00:02:30.180> our<00:02:31.180> apps<00:02:31.360> we<00:02:31.659> have<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:31.840> basic<00:02:32.799> this<00:02:33.340> isn't

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
and our apps we have a basic this isn't

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:34.619 
and our apps we have a basic this isn't
exactly<00:02:33.670> what<00:02:33.970> its<00:02:34.120> gonna<00:02:34.180> be<00:02:34.269> coming<00:02:34.540> with

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
exactly what its gonna be coming with

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.119 
exactly what its gonna be coming with
because<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:34.989> on<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.170> shadow<00:02:35.409> gun<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:35.709> sprinkle
