for home therapy after your dog has had

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:13.860 
for home therapy after your dog has had
surgery<00:00:12.040> what<00:00:12.760> we<00:00:12.880> want<00:00:13.090> to<00:00:13.180> do<00:00:13.300> today<00:00:13.510> is<00:00:13.840> just

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:13.870 
surgery what we want to do today is just

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.000 
surgery what we want to do today is just
review<00:00:15.810> post-operative<00:00:16.810> icing<00:00:17.349> and<00:00:17.560> the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.010 
review post-operative icing and the

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.890 
review post-operative icing and the
importance<00:00:18.519> of<00:00:18.669> post-operative<00:00:19.269> icing<00:00:19.810> in

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
importance of post-operative icing in

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.329 
importance of post-operative icing in
the<00:00:19.929> first<00:00:20.199> 72<00:00:20.650> hours<00:00:20.890> after<00:00:21.849> surgery<00:00:23.339> the

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:24.339 
the first 72 hours after surgery the

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:26.249 
the first 72 hours after surgery the
thing<00:00:24.609> the<00:00:25.029> reason<00:00:25.359> why<00:00:25.509> icing<00:00:25.929> is<00:00:26.079> so

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:26.259 
thing the reason why icing is so

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.550 
thing the reason why icing is so
important<00:00:26.859> is<00:00:26.980> that<00:00:27.689> after<00:00:28.689> surgery<00:00:28.899> there's

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
important is that after surgery there's

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.349 
important is that after surgery there's
a<00:00:29.649> lot<00:00:29.800> of<00:00:29.919> damage<00:00:30.130> to<00:00:30.310> the<00:00:30.579> tissue<00:00:30.819> that<00:00:31.179> is

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
a lot of damage to the tissue that is

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.440 
a lot of damage to the tissue that is
done<00:00:31.659> which<00:00:32.380> brings<00:00:32.800> in<00:00:33.450> inflammatory

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
done which brings in inflammatory

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.660 
done which brings in inflammatory
mediators<00:00:34.690> into<00:00:35.530> that<00:00:35.680> area<00:00:36.100> those

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
mediators into that area those

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.090 
mediators into that area those
inflammatory<00:00:37.090> mediators<00:00:37.630> then<00:00:38.350> damage<00:00:38.860> other

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
inflammatory mediators then damage other

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.880 
inflammatory mediators then damage other
tissue<00:00:39.460> in<00:00:39.820> the<00:00:39.910> surrounding<00:00:40.620> area

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
tissue in the surrounding area

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.310 
tissue in the surrounding area
so<00:00:42.430> by<00:00:42.760> icing<00:00:43.330> what<00:00:43.600> we're<00:00:43.750> going<00:00:43.870> to<00:00:43.900> do<00:00:44.110> is

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
so by icing what we're going to do is

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.040 
so by icing what we're going to do is
constrict<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.040> blood<00:00:45.070> vessels<00:00:45.280> down

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
constrict the blood vessels down

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.360 
constrict the blood vessels down
therefore<00:00:47.050> stopping<00:00:47.500> the<00:00:47.950> inflow<00:00:48.340> of

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
therefore stopping the inflow of

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.000 
therefore stopping the inflow of
inflammatory<00:00:49.300> mediators<00:00:49.890> stopping<00:00:50.890> that

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
inflammatory mediators stopping that

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.460 
inflammatory mediators stopping that
localized<00:00:51.610> destruction<00:00:52.300> of<00:00:52.450> tissue<00:00:52.690> and<00:00:53.110> in

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
localized destruction of tissue and in

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.110 
localized destruction of tissue and in
doing<00:00:53.650> so<00:00:53.800> we're<00:00:54.250> also<00:00:54.430> going<00:00:54.730> to<00:00:54.790> relieve

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
doing so we're also going to relieve

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.450 
doing so we're also going to relieve
some<00:00:55.900> of<00:00:55.930> the<00:00:56.050> pain<00:00:56.290> that's<00:00:56.590> related<00:00:57.160> to<00:00:57.340> that

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
some of the pain that's related to that

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.020 
some of the pain that's related to that
inflammatory<00:00:58.300> response<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.980> what<00:01:00.610> I<00:01:00.640> want<00:01:00.940> to

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
inflammatory response so what I want to

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.580 
inflammatory response so what I want to
do<00:01:01.180> is<00:01:01.390> review<00:01:01.840> a<00:01:01.900> couple<00:01:02.140> of<00:01:02.380> the<00:01:02.470> different

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
do is review a couple of the different

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.969 
do is review a couple of the different
options<00:01:03.160> on<00:01:03.370> what<00:01:03.489> you<00:01:03.700> can<00:01:03.910> use<00:01:04.119> for<00:01:04.150> icing

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
options on what you can use for icing

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.130 
options on what you can use for icing
and<00:01:05.979> then<00:01:06.250> just<00:01:06.640> show<00:01:06.850> you<00:01:06.999> some<00:01:07.329> pretty<00:01:07.899> basic

dog now let's take a quick minute to

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:16.800 
dog now let's take a quick minute to
review<00:01:15.549> the<00:01:15.700> icing<00:01:16.090> options<00:01:16.509> that<00:01:16.659> are

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
review the icing options that are

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.690 
review the icing options that are
available<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:17.829> first<00:01:18.039> would<00:01:18.369> be<00:01:18.399> your

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
available the first would be your

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.169 
available the first would be your
standard<00:01:19.240> ice<00:01:19.479> pack<00:01:19.840> these<00:01:20.380> are<00:01:20.439> hard

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:21.179 
standard ice pack these are hard

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:23.520 
standard ice pack these are hard
non-conforming<00:01:22.179> so<00:01:22.659> it's<00:01:22.840> not<00:01:22.990> your<00:01:23.259> best

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
non-conforming so it's not your best

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.059 
non-conforming so it's not your best
option<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.939> second<00:01:25.359> option<00:01:25.569> would<00:01:26.259> be<00:01:26.319> a<00:01:26.710> gel

00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:27.069 
option the second option would be a gel

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:30.239 
option the second option would be a gel
pack<00:01:27.369> such<00:01:28.060> as<00:01:28.299> this<00:01:28.569> that<00:01:29.170> when<00:01:29.439> called<00:01:29.770> can

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:30.249 
pack such as this that when called can

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:32.879 
pack such as this that when called can
conform<00:01:30.850> which<00:01:31.450> would<00:01:31.689> definitely<00:01:32.350> like<00:01:32.590> and

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:32.889 
conform which would definitely like and

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:35.219 
conform which would definitely like and
then<00:01:33.490> your<00:01:33.670> third<00:01:33.939> option<00:01:34.209> would<00:01:34.719> be<00:01:34.780> if<00:01:35.079> you

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
then your third option would be if you

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.770 
then your third option would be if you
don't<00:01:35.469> have<00:01:35.740> does<00:01:35.979> a<00:01:36.369> nice<00:01:36.909> frozen<00:01:37.450> bag<00:01:37.630> of

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
don't have does a nice frozen bag of

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.080 
don't have does a nice frozen bag of
peas<00:01:38.049> the<00:01:38.859> problem<00:01:39.280> with<00:01:39.429> these<00:01:39.579> are<00:01:39.880> they

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
peas the problem with these are they

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.719 
peas the problem with these are they
just<00:01:40.299> don't<00:01:40.509> stay<00:01:40.749> cold<00:01:41.079> long<00:01:41.380> enough<00:01:41.709> but<00:01:42.340> if

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
just don't stay cold long enough but if

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.190 
just don't stay cold long enough but if
this<00:01:42.999> is<00:01:43.209> what<00:01:43.359> you<00:01:43.539> got<00:01:43.719> then<00:01:44.319> I'll<00:01:44.439> be<00:01:44.709> very
