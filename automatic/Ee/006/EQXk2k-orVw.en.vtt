00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
with a base but it can't be done and it

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.590 
with a base but it can't be done and it

we're going to go ahead and shut it down

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.500 
we're going to go ahead and shut it down
and<00:01:29.320> just<00:01:30.220> to<00:01:30.370> let<00:01:30.460> you<00:01:30.610> know<00:01:30.730> we<00:01:30.910> are<00:01:31.030> using<00:01:31.240> a

tenner 5-string bass to D to C to give
you<00:01:35.620> a<00:01:35.650> better<00:01:35.920> idea<00:01:36.070> of<00:01:36.430> how<00:01:37.120> this<00:01:37.690> type<00:01:37.930> can

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
you a better idea of how this type can

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.400 
you a better idea of how this type can
be<00:01:38.200> used<00:01:38.530> with<00:01:39.090> any<00:01:40.090> instrument<00:01:40.840> keyboards

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
be used with any instrument keyboards

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.430 
be used with any instrument keyboards
and<00:01:41.620> guitar<00:01:41.650> and<00:01:42.490> bass<00:01:42.640> and<00:01:42.970> so<00:01:43.150> on<00:01:43.300> so<00:01:44.110> again

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
and guitar and bass and so on so again

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.980 
and guitar and bass and so on so again
we<00:01:45.310> have<00:01:45.400> a<00:01:45.430> drive<00:01:45.760> knob<00:01:46.000> set<00:01:46.330> down<00:01:46.510> pretty

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
we have a drive knob set down pretty

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:55.789 
we have a drive knob set down pretty
clean

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:08.130 

go<00:01:56.799> ahead<00:01:57.010> and<00:01:57.100> increase<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.610> drive<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.930> will

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
go ahead and increase the drive you will

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.479 
go ahead and increase the drive you will
get<00:02:08.350> in<00:02:08.500> volume<00:02:08.830> increased<00:02:09.190> with<00:02:09.459> increasing

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
get in volume increased with increasing

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:30.229 
get in volume increased with increasing
the<00:02:09.970> drive<00:02:10.560> so<00:02:11.560> we<00:02:11.680> lowered<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:12.489> level

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.809 

go<00:02:31.239> ahead<00:02:31.359> and<00:02:31.450> turn<00:02:31.569> the<00:02:31.749> drive<00:02:32.049> back<00:02:32.739> down<00:02:32.819> to

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
go ahead and turn the drive back down to

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.319 
go ahead and turn the drive back down to
nine<00:02:34.629> o'clock<00:02:34.959> or<00:02:35.260> so<00:02:35.969> next<00:02:36.969> we're<00:02:37.180> going<00:02:37.269> to

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
nine o'clock or so next we're going to

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.470 
nine o'clock or so next we're going to
move<00:02:37.569> to<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.989> position<00:02:38.200> now<00:02:39.069> the<00:02:39.129> position

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
move to the position now the position

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.199 
move to the position now the position
when<00:02:40.480> adjusted<00:02:41.049> is<00:02:41.319> the<00:02:42.280> same<00:02:42.519> as<00:02:42.670> simulating

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
when adjusted is the same as simulating

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.490 
when adjusted is the same as simulating
a<00:02:43.389> microphone<00:02:43.930> being<00:02:44.170> placed<00:02:45.150> closer<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:47.260> the

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
a microphone being placed closer to the

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.059 
a microphone being placed closer to the
horn<00:02:47.799> versus<00:02:48.459> closer<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.450> speaker<00:02:49.769> in<00:02:50.769> a

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
horn versus closer to the speaker in a

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.890 
horn versus closer to the speaker in a
rotary<00:02:51.489> cabinet<00:02:51.969> so<00:02:52.480> we'll<00:02:52.629> go<00:02:52.719> ahead<00:02:52.810> and

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
rotary cabinet so we'll go ahead and

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:24.899 
rotary cabinet so we'll go ahead and
turn<00:02:53.139> the<00:02:53.230> position<00:02:53.349> down<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:24.400> you<00:03:24.489> can<00:03:24.669> hear<00:03:24.849> a

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:24.909 
turn the position down so you can hear a

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:26.729 
turn the position down so you can hear a
slight<00:03:25.299> increase<00:03:25.449> and<00:03:26.079> decrease<00:03:26.169> of<00:03:26.560> highs

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
slight increase and decrease of highs

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.369 
slight increase and decrease of highs
and<00:03:26.769> lows<00:03:27.159> as<00:03:27.459> you<00:03:27.609> move<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:27.939> position<00:03:28.379> we're

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:29.379 
and lows as you move the position we're

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:30.899 
and lows as you move the position we're
going<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.560> go<00:03:29.680> ahead<00:03:29.709> and<00:03:30.099> put<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.280> ready

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:30.909 
going to go ahead and put that ready

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:33.030 
going to go ahead and put that ready
right<00:03:31.090> there<00:03:31.389> next<00:03:32.260> we<00:03:32.349> move<00:03:32.469> on<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.829> top

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
right there next we move on to the top

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.909 
right there next we move on to the top
speed<00:03:33.400> this<00:03:34.060> controls<00:03:34.509> the<00:03:35.319> speed<00:03:35.620> of<00:03:35.889> the

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:35.919 
speed this controls the speed of the

00:03:35.919 --> 00:04:09.759 
speed this controls the speed of the
rotary

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.670 

now<00:04:10.769> say<00:04:11.129> if<00:04:11.190> you<00:04:11.310> have<00:04:11.580> your<00:04:12.019> you<00:04:13.019> have<00:04:13.230> gone

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
now say if you have your you have gone

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
now say if you have your you have gone
ahead<00:04:13.800> and<00:04:13.980> set<00:04:14.310> your<00:04:14.599> top<00:04:15.599> speed<00:04:15.930> ratio<00:04:16.350> and

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
ahead and set your top speed ratio and

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.190 
ahead and set your top speed ratio and
for<00:04:17.700> instance<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:18.180> may<00:04:18.359> want<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.750> have<00:04:18.959> the

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
for instance you may want to have the

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.409 
for instance you may want to have the
reefs<00:04:19.590> low<00:04:19.859> down<00:04:20.100> as<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.519> end<00:04:20.850> of<00:04:21.120> a<00:04:21.209> song

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
reefs low down as the end of a song

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:26.510 
reefs low down as the end of a song
comes<00:04:21.720> along<00:04:21.959> so<00:04:24.680> reach<00:04:25.680> over<00:04:26.010> in<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.310> past

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
comes along so reach over in the past

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.219 
comes along so reach over in the past
just<00:04:27.240> little<00:04:27.479> bit<00:04:29.540> and<00:04:30.540> it'll<00:04:30.750> slow<00:04:31.050> the

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
just little bit and it'll slow the

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.850 
just little bit and it'll slow the
rotary<00:04:31.590> down<00:04:31.800> as<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.580> number<00:04:33.590> you<00:04:34.590> mean<00:04:34.740> you

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
rotary down as the number you mean you
