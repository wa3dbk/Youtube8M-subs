00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:15.619
 It has been a great double training 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:18.830
 more sporting training because we have 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.750
 I've seen many mistakes and it's good to commit 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.670
 mistakes in the trainings we have not 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.250
 considered as a training to which 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:30.520
 we have arrived with a lot of workload 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.520
 with six months of training 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.539
 6 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.220
 we had to adapt some 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.070
 players in positions to others 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.400
 positions because there are casualties in some 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.400
 of the sites 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.710
 exists 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.000
 we have wanted to distribute all the 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.440
 minutes to continue with the same 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:21.950
 loads you all know the gadget has 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:25.510
 made in 204 traditional games like 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.510
 seen the player 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.120
 I have seen intense I have seen things very 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.270
 positive 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.220
 I thought it was a match 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.150
 interesting 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.150
 of intention 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.570
 tonight 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.820
 we tried to balance the two 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.680
 teams 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.920
 even with people who played in other 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.920
 positions 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:23.650
 and then we wanted to see the 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.650
 equipment inside 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.120
 putting together the note 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.560
 it was one of the priorities of the second 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.560
 weather 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.840
 in the first time we wanted to see 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.819
 also to those of ball playing next to 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.140
 playing almost as a midfielder but that 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.140
 he has injured us we have not been able to see him 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.640
 I'm not going to make an assessment now very 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.890
 individual because I 'm missing data I'm going to 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.170
 see if when we see the images let's see 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.610
 the match and we analyze it I will have a 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.909
 a little clearer conception of all 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.909
 Players 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.959
 it's like a great fact is right 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.799
 but I'm happy with the energy that 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:31.390
 we wanted to impose especially the 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.280
 pressure the pressure in rival field 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.310
 I'm happy with that energy though 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.500
 we have made mistakes sit down two 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.280
 witnesses and then I said now ten 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:46.470
 doubles recording going on the energy is not 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.470
 attacked without and the others 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.780
 playing with this risk I'm sure that 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.190
 we are going to win many more matches 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.190
 let's lose is here 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.799
 it's only playing the game 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:15.489
 the right you see it wrong so it's a lot 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.160
 more central than anything else wrong 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:21.190
 so it's several amendments the project 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.410
 central in me offers me a great event 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.389
 but the lowering of lines that makes us 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.970
 we have to put another footballer 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.970
 he suffers a bruise the carelessness 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.590
 it's good bad girl the history test 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.560
 to walk around we have a big suitcase already 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:39.400
 graus the conjuncture but of degree from 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:42.970
 the last time you played skiing and you the 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:46.389
 nipple if you have injuries that you had if 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.250
 I had a problem I think in the ankle 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:51.330
 but I had a little problem and we have 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.350
 I prefer to give you rest is not that I 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.200
 I contuve 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:05:00.900
 when by the Scotsman with 19 and the 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.900
 contusions technique 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:09.050
 this 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.970
 no no no no no no no I do not think so why 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.190
 I think they do understand why when 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.229
 we have given orders I knew the orders that 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.090
 It was costing me to go until yes 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.090
 we could know 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.039
 what happens is that sometimes during the 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.870
 party although in stores sometimes it is 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:30.460
 hard 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.460
 execute what they are telling you 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:39.400
 and we do we are in the video here
