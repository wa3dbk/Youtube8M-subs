not<00:02:07.990> my<00:02:08.200> assessment<00:02:08.739> i<00:02:08.800> think<00:02:09.039> our<00:02:09.789> team's

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
not my assessment i think our team's

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.180 
not my assessment i think our team's
record<00:02:10.420> speaks<00:02:11.349> for<00:02:11.440> itself<00:02:11.560> but<00:02:11.890> i<00:02:11.980> think

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
record speaks for itself but i think

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.819 
record speaks for itself but i think
good<00:02:12.400> teams<00:02:12.670> find<00:02:13.030> ways<00:02:13.299> to<00:02:13.510> win<00:02:13.689> you<00:02:14.590> know<00:02:14.709> and

good teams find ways to win you know and

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:16.589 
good teams find ways to win you know and
