the<00:00:27.900> specs<00:00:28.230> Barry<00:00:28.529> this<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.980> $40<00:00:29.460> tablet<00:00:29.880> so

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
the specs Barry this is a $40 tablet so

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.720 
the specs Barry this is a $40 tablet so
the<00:00:30.090> specs<00:00:30.359> vary<00:00:30.660> for<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.769> minimum<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.520> think

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
the specs vary for the minimum I think

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.220 
the specs vary for the minimum I think
this<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.059> minimum<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:33.719> one<00:00:33.989> gigahertz

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
this is the minimum so one gigahertz

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.810 
this is the minimum so one gigahertz
plateau<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.890> RAM<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.280> pretty<00:00:35.520> much<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
plateau of RAM is pretty much the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.360 
plateau of RAM is pretty much the
minimum<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.630> can<00:00:36.660> get<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.770> we're<00:00:38.010> gonna<00:00:38.160> see

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
minimum you can get so we're gonna see

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.910 
minimum you can get so we're gonna see
how<00:00:38.730> well<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.480> thing<00:00:39.719> handles<00:00:40.140> gaming<00:00:40.500> so

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
how well this thing handles gaming so

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.190 
how well this thing handles gaming so
let's<00:00:41.100> go<00:00:41.160> ahead<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.309> get<00:00:41.430> started<00:00:42.200> alright

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
game will be something really graphic

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:55.330 
game will be something really graphic
intense<00:03:41.000> in<00:03:41.570> my<00:03:41.750> opinion<00:03:42.200> is<00:03:42.380> dead<00:03:42.830> trigger

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.059 

and<00:03:55.790> I've<00:03:56.209> also<00:03:56.450> tested<00:03:56.959> Real<00:03:57.140> Racing<00:03:57.410> 3<00:03:57.620> I

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
and I've also tested Real Racing 3 I

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.190 
and I've also tested Real Racing 3 I
just<00:03:58.310> deleted<00:03:58.819> it<00:03:58.970> because<00:03:59.060> I<00:03:59.209> took<00:03:59.840> up<00:03:59.989> a<00:04:00.080> lot

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
just deleted it because I took up a lot

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.830 
just deleted it because I took up a lot
of<00:04:00.230> space<00:04:00.530> but<00:04:00.800> it<00:04:01.040> plays<00:04:01.700> it<00:04:01.970> you<00:04:02.300> can<00:04:02.480> play<00:04:02.720> it

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
of space but it plays it you can play it

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.270 
of space but it plays it you can play it
but<00:04:02.930> it<00:04:03.080> doesn't<00:04:03.410> play<00:04:03.530> that<00:04:03.560> decent<00:04:04.130> favor

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
but it doesn't play that decent favor

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.190 
but it doesn't play that decent favor
and<00:04:04.489> since<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:04.790> only<00:04:04.819> game<00:04:05.150> that<00:04:05.180> kind<00:04:06.080> of
