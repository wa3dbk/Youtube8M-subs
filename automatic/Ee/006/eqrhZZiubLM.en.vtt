00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.379
 26 years ago we had the opportunity to 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.450
 delight us with one of the videogames 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.990
 most entertaining and prolific of the 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.910
 history was 1987 and capcom needed a 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.500
 title with which to increase the presence 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.150
 of the brand on the nintendo console 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.340
 with the creation of a successful 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.649
 franchise in that same year 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.120
 keiji inafune who had just graduated 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.980
 as an illustrator I began to work 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.290
 for capcom as an illustrator and designer 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.820
 at the same time that inafune worked 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.250
 as a graphic designer for the game 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.320
 street fighter akira kitamura created the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.030
 first sketch that in turn would go through 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.399
 the hands of inafune thus creating the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.739
 character that would later adopt 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.929
 the name of the rock man man known man 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.789
 in america as megaman began his fight 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:56.399
 against doctor wil and 17 of 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.739
 December 1987 launching on the market 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.909
 a great variety of games in different 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.909
 nintendo platforms 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.720
 it was not until 1993 that mega man 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.420
 he came to the super nintendo being 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.130
 renamed as megaman ex title that 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.080
 had drastic changes in the 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.790
 story designs and the gameplay in 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.440
 general also joined a 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.180
 character created in its entirety by 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.040
 inafune that was sought to be the 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.740
 protagonist of this new saga and he 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.540
 he was dealing with the city since the executives of 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.220
 Capcom did not look kindly on the 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.560
 Change of protagonist in a franchise 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.690
 that was going up, they decided that ex 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.550
 would be the main character and if rose 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.259
 it would be a secondary character it was like that 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.720
 that started one of the most famous sagas 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.610
 of this character that covered up to 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.610
 lifetime of playstation 2 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.460
 besides the saga of ex inafune he worked 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.020
 in a 3d spin-off called mega man 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.850
 legends that although it did not reach the number 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.920
 of expected sales generated enough 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.440
 interest so that capcom in will launch a 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.430
 sequel in the year 2000 on October 29 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.800
 of 2010 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.390
 inafune left capcom and created his own 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.250
 company called com share 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.680
 capcom replied to the exit of inafune 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.630
 preventing you from continuing or creating any 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.790
 thing related to mega man between 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.440
 these projects was included the third 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.780
 part of megaman legends that was left 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.490
 canceled definitely causing the 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.290
 disappointment and anger from his followers 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.000
 who are still trying to 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.100
 make the company react with the 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.050
 so that this title is released to the 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.670
 market although megaman is still living 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.100
 technically in collectable items 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.840
 that capcom launches from time to time the 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.580
 franchise is almost in the 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.470
 forgetfulness is very difficult for us 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.720
 decide one of our moments 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.730
 favorites among so many that have 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.680
 these games each one holds a place 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.110
 special in our memory and whether by 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.690
 the music the scenarios or the bosses without 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.690
 import if they are in 8 bits or in 16 bits 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.590
 this week in which mega man met 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.600
 26 years we remember how difficult it was 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.130
 finish any game in the nes to 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.590
 difference from others that existed in the 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.320
 Megaman era presented a high challenge 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.730
 but it was humanly possible to finish the 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.310
 get to the end of the fortress 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.650
 of Dr. Willy was a very 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.750
 rewarding that prevails even if in 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.670
 these days we decided to play these titles 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.220
 either in a month or in a console 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.630
 virtual megaman ex introduced them in a 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.580
 new universe in which the 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.770
 possibilities of the blue bomber is 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.840
 they extended beyond walking and toasting 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.760
 the surprise of being able to bounce 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.160
 the walls and collect parts of the 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.110
 armor were great and excellent 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.030
 additions that prevailed from that 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.740
 from now on even the 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.360
 secondary characters and antagonists 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.460
 they had a story that made us 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.740
 interesting from the evil doctor 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.060
 willy and his eagerness to dominate the world and of 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.310
 step to beat his rival 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.260
 the light doctor going through casualties was the 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.210
 that they were simply moved by hatred and 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.280
 envy towards our hero until the 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.170
 complicated history of sigma rifles 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.210
 and the sirou virus complete the 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.920
 puzzle of a whole saga that we 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.569
 accompanied from our childhood 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.519
 megaman legends introduced 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.859
 the series of rpg elements and the 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.599
 charismatic mega man pumps thanks to 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:07.159
 this saga we could meet more 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.379
 characters that achieved so much 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.870
 appreciation that have even appeared in 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:13.969
 other games the perfect example strong 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.920
 bone that managed to have its own game and 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:18.349
 until appear in other games as the 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.720
 marvel against capcom and project ex show 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:22.910
 the future of the franchise is uncertain 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.310
 however there is a small ray of 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.870
 hope in madryn number nine the new 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.849
 project that the gym to funes that 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.919
 curiously matches my team and 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.539
 magic and that were some of the 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.090
 first names that were considered 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.680
 to refer to the blue mayrÃ­n bomber 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.960
 name nine has the participation 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.550
 of inafune and other members of his 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.169
 old team with which he developed 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.940
 several megaman games for the month 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:45.560
 although we have not been able to see much of the 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.389
 game looks like a real successor 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.699
 Megaman spiritual despite the oblivion 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:52.099

 wake him up again someday to 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.960
