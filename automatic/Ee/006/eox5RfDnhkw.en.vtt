hip you've all heard this in jazz play

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.459 
hip you've all heard this in jazz play
I'm<00:00:10.019> sure<00:00:10.290> this<00:00:11.160> is<00:00:11.370> quartile<00:00:11.940> harmony<00:00:12.599> now<00:00:13.259> if

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
I'm sure this is quartile harmony now if

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.140 
I'm sure this is quartile harmony now if
you've<00:00:13.590> studied<00:00:13.830> harmony<00:00:14.460> before<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:15.030> know

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
you've studied harmony before you know

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.930 
you've studied harmony before you know
that<00:00:15.450> most<00:00:15.839> courts<00:00:16.430> that<00:00:17.430> come<00:00:17.609> from<00:00:17.760> our

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
that most courts that come from our

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.120 
that most courts that come from our
Western<00:00:18.300> music<00:00:18.720> system<00:00:19.109> are<00:00:19.439> built<00:00:19.830> from

Western music system are built from

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.310 
Western music system are built from
thirds<00:00:20.670> intervals<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.480> thirds<00:00:21.810> we<00:00:22.080> stack

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
thirds intervals of thirds we stack

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.170 
thirds intervals of thirds we stack
thirds<00:00:22.590> on<00:00:22.769> top<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.130> each<00:00:23.250> other<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.730> create

thirds on top of each other to create

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.050 
thirds on top of each other to create
all<00:00:24.359> kinds<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:25.050> courts<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.070> then<00:00:26.640> we<00:00:26.730> alter

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
all kinds of courts and then we alter

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.849 
all kinds of courts and then we alter
them<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.510> get<00:00:28.080> all<00:00:28.199> kinds<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.560> different

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
them to get all kinds of different

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.220 
them to get all kinds of different
sounds<00:00:29.010> but<00:00:29.910> there's<00:00:30.060> another<00:00:30.330> whole<00:00:30.750> system

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
sounds but there's another whole system

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.900 
sounds but there's another whole system
of<00:00:31.349> harmony<00:00:31.830> out<00:00:31.949> there<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.579> called

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
of harmony out there and this is called

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.299 
of harmony out there and this is called
quartile<00:00:33.480> harmony<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.200> these<00:00:34.800> are<00:00:34.950> chords

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
quartile harmony and these are chords

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.940 
quartile harmony and these are chords
that<00:00:35.430> are<00:00:35.550> built<00:00:35.820> on<00:00:36.000> fourths<00:00:36.750> now<00:00:37.680> there<00:00:37.860> are

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
that are built on fourths now there are

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.889 
that are built on fourths now there are
two<00:00:38.160> kinds<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.790> force<00:00:39.090> there<00:00:39.390> are<00:00:39.540> pure

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
two kinds of force there are pure

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.650 
two kinds of force there are pure
fourths<00:00:40.440> meaning<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.640> every<00:00:41.969> note<00:00:42.180> we<00:00:42.329> play

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
fourths meaning that every note we play

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.020 
fourths meaning that every note we play
every<00:00:43.260> every<00:00:43.590> interval<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.100> an<00:00:44.250> exact<00:00:44.610> perfect

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
every every interval is an exact perfect

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.740 
every every interval is an exact perfect
force

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
force

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.380 
force
you<00:00:46.260> know<00:00:46.410> from<00:00:46.680> C<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.190> F<00:00:47.340> for<00:00:47.579> instance<00:00:47.940> then

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
you know from C to F for instance then

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.330 
you know from C to F for instance then
there<00:00:48.539> are<00:00:48.660> also<00:00:48.899> what<00:00:49.200> we<00:00:49.289> call<00:00:49.469> diatonic

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
there are also what we call diatonic

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.270 
there are also what we call diatonic
fourths<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:50.940> these<00:00:51.660> are<00:00:51.960> situations<00:00:52.770> where

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
fourths and these are situations where

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.880 
fourths and these are situations where
we<00:00:53.370> try<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.579> stay<00:00:53.879> true<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.870> key<00:00:55.590> and

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
we try to stay true to a key and

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.950 
we try to stay true to a key and
sometimes<00:00:56.610> we'll<00:00:56.789> adjust<00:00:57.239> an<00:00:57.539> interval<00:00:57.930> to

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
sometimes we'll adjust an interval to

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.799 
sometimes we'll adjust an interval to
make<00:00:58.320> sure<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.590> stays<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.250> key<00:00:59.489> but<00:01:00.449> today

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
make sure it stays in the key but today

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.450 
make sure it stays in the key but today
we're<00:01:01.020> talking<00:01:01.140> about<00:01:01.410> pure<00:01:01.739> fourths<00:01:02.250> or

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
we're talking about pure fourths or

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.080 
we're talking about pure fourths or
natural<00:01:03.120> fourths<00:01:03.589> now<00:01:04.589> these<00:01:04.860> are<00:01:05.040> chords<00:01:05.640> as

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
natural fourths now these are chords as

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.630 
natural fourths now these are chords as
you<00:01:06.210> can<00:01:06.360> build<00:01:06.600> two<00:01:07.080> three<00:01:07.830> notes<00:01:08.040> four<00:01:08.430> notes

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
you can build two three notes four notes

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.190 
you can build two three notes four notes
five<00:01:09.060> notes<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.689> know<00:01:09.810> we're<00:01:09.900> gonna<00:01:09.990> stick

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.150 
okay these are the kind scores used for
those<00:02:14.270> kinds<00:02:14.630> of<00:02:14.690> core<00:02:14.930> progressions<00:02:15.560> but<00:02:16.010> how

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
those kinds of core progressions but how

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.740 
those kinds of core progressions but how
do<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:16.310> use<00:02:16.640> them<00:02:16.820> and<00:02:17.030> when<00:02:17.270> can<00:02:17.570> you<00:02:17.600> use

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
do you use them and when can you use

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.470 
do you use them and when can you use
them<00:02:18.110> it's<00:02:18.560> actually<00:02:18.920> very<00:02:19.040> simple<00:02:19.480> what

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
them it's actually very simple what

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.840 
them it's actually very simple what
we're<00:02:20.630> gonna<00:02:20.720> do<00:02:20.990> is<00:02:21.170> apply<00:02:21.920> them<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:22.580> minor

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
we're gonna do is apply them to minor

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.730 
we're gonna do is apply them to minor
chords<00:02:23.480> where<00:02:23.690> they<00:02:23.780> work<00:02:23.930> particularly<00:02:24.350> well

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
chords where they work particularly well

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.700 
chords where they work particularly well
so<00:02:25.490> so<00:02:25.700> let's<00:02:25.940> say<00:02:26.030> we<00:02:26.150> had<00:02:26.300> a<00:02:26.330> C<00:02:27.050> minor<00:02:27.260> seven

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
so so let's say we had a C minor seven

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.500 
so so let's say we had a C minor seven
chord<00:02:30.280> okay<00:02:31.280> so<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:31.520> know<00:02:31.670> this<00:02:31.850> court<00:02:32.150> and

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
chord okay so you know this court and

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.570 
chord okay so you know this court and
you<00:02:32.600> also<00:02:32.750> know<00:02:33.140> C<00:02:33.440> minor<00:02:33.650> pentatonic<00:02:34.040> scale

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
you also know C minor pentatonic scale

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:41.280 
you also know C minor pentatonic scale
no<00:02:34.940> doubt<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:39.260> we<00:02:39.380> know<00:02:39.560> how<00:02:39.740> well<00:02:39.950> those<00:02:40.220> two

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
no doubt and we know how well those two

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.680 
no doubt and we know how well those two
tools<00:02:42.290> work<00:02:43.030> okay<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:44.060> what<00:02:44.270> we're<00:02:44.360> gonna<00:02:44.450> do

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
tools work okay so what we're gonna do

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.310 
tools work okay so what we're gonna do
if<00:02:45.350> you<00:02:45.560> had<00:02:45.800> a<00:02:46.070> C<00:02:46.640> minor<00:02:46.820> seven<00:02:47.210> chord<00:02:47.320> you

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
if you had a C minor seven chord you

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.680 
if you had a C minor seven chord you
could<00:02:48.500> take<00:02:48.710> these<00:02:49.000> quartile<00:02:50.000> chord<00:02:50.330> shapes

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
could take these quartile chord shapes

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.980 
could take these quartile chord shapes
and<00:02:51.220> outline<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.250> shape<00:02:52.760> of<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.210> pentatonic

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
and outline the shape of the pentatonic

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.620 
and outline the shape of the pentatonic
scale<00:02:54.410> with<00:02:54.740> them<00:02:54.980> in<00:02:55.460> other<00:02:55.610> words<00:02:58.630> translate

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
scale with them in other words translate

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:15.460 
scale with them in other words translate
to<00:03:12.910> okay<00:03:13.910> now<00:03:14.120> what<00:03:14.690> do<00:03:14.750> you<00:03:14.810> do<00:03:15.020> with<00:03:15.170> it

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
to okay now what do you do with it

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.530 
to okay now what do you do with it

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
all of these chords within this

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.670 
all of these chords within this
pentatonic<00:03:19.820> scale<00:03:20.060> can<00:03:20.750> be<00:03:21.020> used<00:03:21.350> to

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
pentatonic scale can be used to

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.610 
pentatonic scale can be used to
substitute<00:03:22.160> for<00:03:22.640> the<00:03:23.360> C<00:03:23.540> minor<00:03:23.780> seven<00:03:24.590> chord

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.830 
substitute for the C minor seven chord
itself

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
about this already let's let's beef it

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.900 
about this already let's let's beef it
up<00:04:13.190> a<00:04:13.310> little<00:04:13.459> bit

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
up a little bit

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.349 
up a little bit
all<00:04:14.540> of<00:04:14.780> these<00:04:14.900> chords<00:04:15.350> can<00:04:15.530> be<00:04:15.590> inverted<00:04:16.370> okay

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
all of these chords can be inverted okay

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.449 
all of these chords can be inverted okay
now<00:04:17.810> they<00:04:17.989> stop<00:04:18.200> being<00:04:18.470> fourth<00:04:18.799> chords<00:04:19.250> at

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
now they stop being fourth chords at

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.460 
now they stop being fourth chords at
that<00:04:19.669> point<00:04:20.000> but<00:04:20.600> they<00:04:20.750> can<00:04:20.900> be<00:04:21.019> used<00:04:21.290> in

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
that point but they can be used in

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.800 
that point but they can be used in
exactly<00:04:22.040> the<00:04:22.160> same<00:04:22.400> way<00:04:22.729> so<00:04:23.479> how<00:04:23.630> do<00:04:23.690> you

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
exactly the same way so how do you

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.780 
exactly the same way so how do you
invert<00:04:24.050> these<00:04:24.260> chords<00:04:24.650> well<00:04:25.220> our<00:04:25.340> first<00:04:25.490> chord

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
invert these chords well our first chord

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.030 
invert these chords well our first chord
looked<00:04:26.000> like<00:04:26.150> this<00:04:26.380> so<00:04:27.380> what<00:04:27.500> I'm<00:04:27.590> gonna<00:04:27.680> do<00:04:27.919> is

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
looked like this so what I'm gonna do is

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.610 
looked like this so what I'm gonna do is
take<00:04:28.220> that<00:04:28.280> note<00:04:28.760> C<00:04:29.120> on<00:04:29.360> top<00:04:29.630> and<00:04:29.930> drop<00:04:30.320> it<00:04:30.530> or

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
take that note C on top and drop it or

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.120 
take that note C on top and drop it or
not<00:04:30.740> it<00:04:31.389> gives<00:04:32.389> me<00:04:32.510> this<00:04:32.770> okay<00:04:33.770> now<00:04:33.919> it's<00:04:34.070> the

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
not it gives me this okay now it's the

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.400 
not it gives me this okay now it's the
same<00:04:34.370> three<00:04:34.669> notes<00:04:34.880> but<00:04:35.479> this<00:04:35.630> is<00:04:35.750> no<00:04:35.900> longer<00:04:36.169> a

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
same three notes but this is no longer a

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.890 
same three notes but this is no longer a
quarrel<00:04:37.010> chord<00:04:37.340> anymore<00:04:37.820> because<00:04:38.000> this<00:04:38.690> is

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
quarrel chord anymore because this is

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.070 
quarrel chord anymore because this is
from<00:04:39.110> C<00:04:39.290> to<00:04:39.320> D<00:04:39.460> it's<00:04:40.460> a<00:04:40.550> major<00:04:40.700> second<00:04:41.210> we<00:04:41.900> still

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
from C to D it's a major second we still

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.750 
from C to D it's a major second we still
have<00:04:42.200> our<00:04:42.260> fourth<00:04:42.560> year<00:04:42.710> though<00:04:43.010> it's<00:04:43.520> really

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
have our fourth year though it's really

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.210 
have our fourth year though it's really
a<00:04:43.789> major<00:04:44.000> second<00:04:44.570> and<00:04:44.750> a<00:04:44.900> perfect<00:04:45.289> fourth<00:04:45.530> it's

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
a major second and a perfect fourth it's

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.940 
a major second and a perfect fourth it's
not<00:04:46.340> quite<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:46.729> same<00:04:46.760> thing<00:04:47.680> but<00:04:48.680> you<00:04:48.800> can

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
not quite the same thing but you can

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.880 
not quite the same thing but you can
move<00:04:49.130> around<00:04:49.340> the<00:04:50.030> same<00:04:50.300> way<00:04:50.330> now<00:04:51.260> because<00:04:51.470> the

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
move around the same way now because the

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.590 
move around the same way now because the
shapes<00:04:52.160> will<00:04:52.400> change<00:04:52.700> from<00:04:52.880> string<00:04:53.270> set<00:04:53.479> the

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
shapes will change from string set the

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.330 
shapes will change from string set the
string<00:04:53.870> sets<00:04:54.169> you<00:04:54.800> have<00:04:54.890> to<00:04:55.039> play<00:04:55.220> a<00:04:55.250> little

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
string sets you have to play a little

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.340 
string sets you have to play a little
more<00:04:55.550> horizontally<00:04:56.300> this<00:04:56.479> way<00:04:56.690> so<00:04:57.200> your

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
more horizontally this way so your

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:13.390 
more horizontally this way so your
pentatonic<00:04:57.979> ideas

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.770 

okay<00:05:14.400> so<00:05:14.699> that<00:05:14.820> works<00:05:15.060> gives<00:05:15.510> you<00:05:15.600> more

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
okay so that works gives you more

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.840 
okay so that works gives you more
ammunition<00:05:16.020> now<00:05:16.800> we<00:05:16.980> can<00:05:17.130> invert<00:05:17.400> it<00:05:17.550> again

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
ammunition now we can invert it again

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.240 
ammunition now we can invert it again
let's<00:05:18.449> take<00:05:18.630> this<00:05:18.840> shape<00:05:19.139> and<00:05:19.500> take<00:05:19.860> that<00:05:19.980> G

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
let's take this shape and take that G

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.300 
let's take this shape and take that G
and<00:05:20.460> drop<00:05:20.639> it<00:05:20.850> in<00:05:20.970> octave<00:05:21.710> now<00:05:22.710> we've<00:05:22.860> got<00:05:23.070> this

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
and drop it in octave now we've got this

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.850 
and drop it in octave now we've got this
and<00:05:23.880> once<00:05:24.270> again<00:05:24.479> you<00:05:24.840> can<00:05:24.870> skate<00:05:25.260> around

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.200 

horizontally<00:05:28.860> on<00:05:29.190> the<00:05:29.250> fingerboard<00:05:29.610> this<00:05:30.000> way

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
horizontally on the fingerboard this way

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.439 
horizontally on the fingerboard this way
in<00:05:30.740> pentatonic<00:05:31.740> scales<00:05:32.280> it's<00:05:33.090> gonna<00:05:33.240> work

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449 
in pentatonic scales it's gonna work

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:38.390 
in pentatonic scales it's gonna work
okay<00:05:34.020> so<00:05:34.410> we<00:05:34.949> had<00:05:35.130> this<00:05:35.370> this<00:05:36.330> and<00:05:36.750> this<00:05:37.400> now

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
okay so we had this this and this now

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.680 
okay so we had this this and this now
we're<00:05:38.550> going<00:05:38.639> to<00:05:38.699> invert<00:05:39.000> it<00:05:39.030> again<00:05:39.389> I<00:05:39.419> guess

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
we're going to invert it again I guess

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.480 
we're going to invert it again I guess
what<00:05:39.870> happens<00:05:40.290> we're<00:05:40.770> back<00:05:40.919> to<00:05:41.070> the<00:05:41.160> original

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
what happens we're back to the original

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.930 
what happens we're back to the original
shape<00:05:41.580> again<00:05:42.050> okay<00:05:43.050> so<00:05:43.590> you<00:05:43.949> have<00:05:44.040> a<00:05:44.100> lot<00:05:44.550> to<00:05:44.580> do

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
shape again okay so you have a lot to do

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:53.870 
shape again okay so you have a lot to do
there<00:05:45.240> you<00:05:45.389> can<00:05:45.630> play<00:05:52.190> if<00:05:53.190> they're<00:05:53.370> inversions

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
there you can play if they're inversions

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.640 
there you can play if they're inversions
I'm<00:05:54.270> sorry<00:05:54.540> I<00:05:54.600> get<00:05:54.750> caught<00:05:54.930> up<00:05:54.960> in<00:05:55.200> my<00:05:55.320> client

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
I'm sorry I get caught up in my client

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:03.860 
I'm sorry I get caught up in my client
sometimes<00:05:56.010> yeah<00:06:02.030> and<00:06:03.030> it<00:06:03.300> brings<00:06:03.540> you<00:06:03.660> right

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
sometimes yeah and it brings you right

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.040 
sometimes yeah and it brings you right
up<00:06:04.020> to<00:06:04.050> the<00:06:04.190> 2011<00:06:05.190> and<00:06:05.400> more<00:06:05.610> modern<00:06:05.850> sounds<00:06:06.450> so

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
up to the 2011 and more modern sounds so

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.870 
up to the 2011 and more modern sounds so
get<00:06:07.289> into<00:06:07.530> this<00:06:07.680> remember<00:06:08.190> using<00:06:08.370> for<00:06:08.669> minor

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
get into this remember using for minor

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.960 
get into this remember using for minor
chords<00:06:09.360> and<00:06:09.650> I<00:06:10.650> think<00:06:11.160> your<00:06:11.310> your<00:06:11.699> your

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970 
chords and I think your your your

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.390 
chords and I think your your your
bandmates<00:06:12.360> will<00:06:12.750> be<00:06:12.960> pretty<00:06:13.620> impressed<00:06:13.949> and

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
bandmates will be pretty impressed and

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.640 
bandmates will be pretty impressed and
it'll<00:06:14.610> open<00:06:14.669> up<00:06:14.940> their<00:06:15.240> ideas<00:06:15.660> for<00:06:15.870> solos<00:06:16.229> as

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
it'll open up their ideas for solos as

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.950 
it'll open up their ideas for solos as
well
