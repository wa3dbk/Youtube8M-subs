this<00:00:39.989> way<00:00:40.260> Libby's<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.940> most<00:00:42.120> nutritious

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
this way Libby's to the most nutritious

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.470

being<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.410> farmers<00:00:44.340> market<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.180> reason

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
being the farmers market and the reason

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.900 
being the farmers market and the reason
behind<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.260> because<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.010> USDA<00:00:47.250> doesn't

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
behind that is because the USDA doesn't

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.760 
behind that is because the USDA doesn't
distinguish<00:00:48.450> between<00:00:48.510> what<00:00:49.230> we<00:00:49.320> think<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.649> as

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
distinguish between what we think of as

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.279 
distinguish between what we think of as
traditional<00:00:50.010> pumpkin<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.289> certain

butternut squash rather than what we

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.610 
butternut squash rather than what we

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
not a lot of it but just enough that it

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.140 
not a lot of it but just enough that it
hit<00:01:27.360> me<00:01:27.509> just<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.049> nice<00:01:28.259> thick<00:01:28.740> consistency

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
hit me just a nice thick consistency

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.850 
hit me just a nice thick consistency
tastes<00:01:30.150> like<00:01:30.360> pumpkin<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:31.020> didn't<00:01:31.500> get<00:01:31.590> me<00:01:31.650> Sam

little crunch of like a grain of sand or
something<00:02:31.700> in<00:02:31.970> it<00:02:32.120> a<00:02:32.360> little<00:02:32.840> sweeter<00:02:33.050> taste

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
something in it a little sweeter taste

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.610 
something in it a little sweeter taste
like<00:02:34.070> pumpkin<00:02:34.420> it<00:02:35.420> make<00:02:35.630> a<00:02:35.660> good<00:02:35.930> pie<00:02:36.140> so<00:02:36.380> far

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
and finally we're going to do the

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.900 
and finally we're going to do the
Farmers<00:02:39.170> Market<00:02:39.459> kinda<00:02:40.459> looks<00:02:40.670> like<00:02:40.730> an

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
Farmers Market kinda looks like an

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.050 
Farmers Market kinda looks like an
orange<00:02:41.239> version<00:02:41.570> of<00:02:42.100> canned<00:02:43.100> cranberry<00:02:43.519> sauce

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
orange version of canned cranberry sauce

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.900 
orange version of canned cranberry sauce
is<00:02:44.650> by<00:02:45.650> far<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:45.980> Palast<00:02:46.970> one<00:02:47.269> of<00:02:47.570> the<00:02:48.290> bunch

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
is by far the Palast one of the bunch

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.000 
is by far the Palast one of the bunch
you<00:02:49.910> know<00:02:50.000> looks<00:02:50.570> a<00:02:50.690> lot<00:02:50.870> more<00:02:50.989> congealed<00:02:51.560> than

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
you know looks a lot more congealed than

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.210 
you know looks a lot more congealed than
the<00:02:52.130> others<00:02:53.380> so<00:02:54.380> this<00:02:54.500> one<00:02:54.650> has<00:02:54.830> a<00:02:54.860> slightly

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
the others so this one has a slightly

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.699 
the others so this one has a slightly
different<00:02:55.420> smell<00:02:56.420> than<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.810> others<00:02:57.080> it's

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
different smell than the others it's

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.650 
different smell than the others it's
less<00:02:58.010> of<00:02:58.160> what<00:02:58.250> I<00:02:58.310> think<00:02:58.370> of<00:02:58.640> as<00:02:58.760> a<00:02:58.790> traditional

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
less of what I think of as a traditional

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.030 
less of what I think of as a traditional
pumpkin<00:03:00.320> scent<00:03:00.950> it's<00:03:01.579> taste<00:03:01.850> it<00:03:02.920> it<00:03:03.920> also

pumpkin scent it's taste it it also

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.280 
pumpkin scent it's taste it it also
tastes<00:03:04.640> different<00:03:04.940> than<00:03:05.000> all<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.329> others<00:03:05.600> has

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
tastes different than all the others has

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.880 
tastes different than all the others has
a<00:03:06.320> much<00:03:06.650> more<00:03:06.860> of<00:03:06.920> a<00:03:07.100> squash<00:03:07.700> taste<00:03:08.630> to<00:03:08.900> it<00:03:08.930> than

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
a much more of a squash taste to it than

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.870 
a much more of a squash taste to it than
a<00:03:10.959> pumpkin<00:03:11.959> purse<00:03:12.200> a<00:03:12.380> taste<00:03:12.680> to<00:03:12.920> it<00:03:12.950> I<00:03:13.280> can't

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
a pumpkin purse a taste to it I can't

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.110 
a pumpkin purse a taste to it I can't
get<00:03:13.970> over<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.209> texture<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:15.260> texture<00:03:15.620> is<00:03:15.769> just

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
get over the texture the texture is just

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.300 
get over the texture the texture is just
congealed<00:03:17.120> baby<00:03:17.510> food<00:03:18.160> perhaps<00:03:19.160> the

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
congealed baby food perhaps the

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.280 
congealed baby food perhaps the
nutritional<00:03:19.790> value<00:03:20.030> of<00:03:20.090> this<00:03:20.510> one<00:03:20.690> is<00:03:20.959> higher

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
nutritional value of this one is higher

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.020 
nutritional value of this one is higher
because<00:03:21.739> they<00:03:22.070> aren't<00:03:22.400> using<00:03:22.579> the<00:03:22.820> same

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
because they aren't using the same

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
you can see the color variation is

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.090 
you can see the color variation is
significant<00:03:30.260> in<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.860> organic<00:03:31.400> version<00:03:32.120> so

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
significant in the organic version so

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.270 
significant in the organic version so

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
consistency good pumpkin flavor but if

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.150

you<00:04:00.320> are<00:04:00.530> on<00:04:00.560> a<00:04:00.799> budget<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:03.410> market<00:04:03.739> pantry

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
you are on a budget the market pantry

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.970 
you are on a budget the market pantry
from<00:04:04.430> Target<00:04:05.030> pretty<00:04:05.870> close

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
from Target pretty close

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.410 
from Target pretty close
not<00:04:07.370> as<00:04:07.550> sweet<00:04:07.670> but<00:04:07.819> if<00:04:08.180> you're<00:04:08.300> making

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
not as sweet but if you're making

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.300 
not as sweet but if you're making
pumpkin<00:04:08.959> pie<00:04:09.140> you'll<00:04:09.560> never<00:04:09.830> notice<00:04:10.069> the

pumpkin pie you'll never notice the

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.830 
pumpkin pie you'll never notice the
difference<00:04:10.340> so<00:04:11.030> if<00:04:11.090> you're<00:04:11.180> making<00:04:11.300> pie<00:04:11.569> this

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
difference so if you're making pie this

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.110 
difference so if you're making pie this
season<00:04:12.170> I<00:04:12.349> would<00:04:12.830> go<00:04:12.950> with<00:04:13.040> Libby's<00:04:13.400> and<00:04:13.970> if

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
season I would go with Libby's and if

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.360 
season I would go with Libby's and if
you're<00:04:14.239> in<00:04:14.330> a<00:04:14.390> budget<00:04:15.040> market<00:04:16.040> pantry<00:04:18.370> Peter
