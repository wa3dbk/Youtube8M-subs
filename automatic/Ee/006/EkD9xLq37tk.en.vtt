00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.179
 maynkravt is a game on another absolutely 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.390
 engine with different graphics and generally it 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.190
 horror maykravta yes it is maykravt choirs 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.140
 I stumbled upon this 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.700
 a toy on the Internet 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.950
 as I understood it came out quite recently 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.079
 I hardly found any clips on it 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.670
 youtube and I decided such a pancake maybe 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.559
 it's really something very scary 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.530
 even turned off the light let's rate 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.020
 click on the drink and see what he 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.930
 will not I do not expect something to scare 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.239
 but maybe we got some kind of paradise 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.840
 it is not very similar to horror yet 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.820
 but we see yes indeed maykravt 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.189
 very similar to minekravta yes graphics 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.720
 very very beautiful hope the game 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.720
 will be just as scary 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:25.299
 herobrin that what was it all about 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.540
 there was a type of such a terrible beginning type behind 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:32.110
 we will herobrin throughout the map run 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:45.100

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:55.810

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.679
 seriously yes ok at first the game is very 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.929
 strongly resembles 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:04.450
 balls who can remember we played 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:08.200

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.179
 same bridge and then the ball me on the mail 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.890

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.290
 Slender is so that I 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.600
 activate the note 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:25.320

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:31.239

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:45.370
 it looks cool to me and I passed 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:48.100
 through the wall I can go back and 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.810

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.040
 why let the button fell stone 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.409
 Okay, maybe somewhere something has opened 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.069
 so so there seems to be nothing new 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:24.260
 damn I agree schedule 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.189
 This is very cool so I can dig 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.489
 here ore 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:30.379
 I can't finish 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:34.670

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:54.829
 okay adventures like personally 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.590
 there is a passage in the incomprehensible 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.480
 a place so good now to turn 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:04.599
 climber someone 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:07.159
 and wow action is cool 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:10.129
 provocateur more like some kind 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:19.370
 a large cluster of phalluses global their 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:23.289
 mini threes that it and this that it is very 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:27.800
 mysterious why I walk through the trees 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:29.919
 okay abandoned mines and here is stone 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.919
 tree 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:48.569
 that's 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:50.200
 and what a strange game was whoa whoa what is it 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:51.670
 here we have 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.240
 I think at least here that they 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.240
 scare 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:04.990
 and chop oval oval some kind of black 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.850
 squares flew ok headless corpse 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.100
 the skeleton is 3000 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.930
 nothing no let's go on here here is 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.729
 ghana 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.530
 By the way, maybe maybe right now 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.120
 something happen i know little by little 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.360
 already starting to lose hope that 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:24.000
 something will be scary in this game and here 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.000
 this is interesting dude 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:31.750
 Well, all the same, the game starts already having 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.520
 scare and click on that turn on the light 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.139
 turn off why this is great 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.720
 in our opinion, this is what I think will be 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.699
 scary what 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.220
 that for some reason turned this often for 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:44.180
 why the shit the wood texture sticks out 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.460
 walls 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:51.229
 it's generally okay a candle which 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:06:03.050
 for some reason does not cover anything and the radio in 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:06:05.540
 minecraft radio so follow up here 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:08.080
 that was cool so here is more 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:11.900
 that shit won't be about pickaxe great 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:16.250

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:20.750
 knock knock hockey strange portal to hell wow 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:25.550
 that's so cool so I went again 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:27.260
 through the wall okay I'm starting hope 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.660
 that there will be something terrible in this game 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.760
 so but now I understand us again 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.669
 will have to look for some kind of lever i just 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:40.060
 already guess damn oh opt great 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:44.660

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:46.880
 these doors now I can go here 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:50.590
 there is some continuation to this 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.960
 the room is very scary 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:07:00.450

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:30.070
 ok there were a couple of scary moments but 

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:32.860

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:39.280
