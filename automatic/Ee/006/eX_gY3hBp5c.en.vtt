for omega-3 fatty acids actually some

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.910 
for omega-3 fatty acids actually some
very<00:01:04.969> interesting<00:01:05.329> data<00:01:05.719> coming<00:01:06.110> out<00:01:06.290> that

very interesting data coming out that

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.130 
very interesting data coming out that
shows<00:01:07.219> that<00:01:07.430> that<00:01:07.850> taking<00:01:08.329> omega-3<00:01:08.869> fatty

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
shows that that taking omega-3 fatty

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.139 
shows that that taking omega-3 fatty
acids<00:01:09.560> or<00:01:09.740> eating<00:01:09.979> diets<00:01:10.340> even<00:01:10.490> that<00:01:10.820> are<00:01:10.969> high
