used this um mainframe a while ago like

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:59.059 
used this um mainframe a while ago like
months<00:02:53.939> ago<00:02:54.799> on<00:02:56.299> my<00:02:57.299> face<00:02:57.689> on<00:02:58.200> my<00:02:58.349> acne<00:02:58.560> marks

work<00:03:06.480> too<00:03:07.109> but<00:03:07.530> we<00:03:07.739> will<00:03:07.950> see<00:03:08.370> with<00:03:08.849> my

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
work too but we will see with my

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.240 
work too but we will see with my
experience<00:03:11.010> with<00:03:11.549> it<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:15.500> I<00:03:16.500> got<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.680> I<00:03:17.159> got

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250
