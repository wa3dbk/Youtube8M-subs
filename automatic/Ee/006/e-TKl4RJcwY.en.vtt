surgery<00:00:34.350> lasted<00:00:35.129> probably<00:00:35.600> close<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.629> two

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
surgery lasted probably close to two

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.869 
surgery lasted probably close to two
hours<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.770> was<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> complicated<00:00:38.520> surgery

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
hours it was a complicated surgery

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.459 
hours it was a complicated surgery
actually<00:00:39.000> much<00:00:39.510> more<00:00:39.660> complicated<00:00:40.020> than<00:00:40.350> I

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
actually much more complicated than I

actually much more complicated than I
had<00:00:40.680> expected<00:00:41.210> dr.<00:00:42.210> Erdmann<00:00:42.539> my<00:00:42.690> partner<00:00:43.140> will

had expected dr. Erdmann my partner will
explain<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.550> what<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.820> ultrasound

explain to you what the ultrasound

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.990 
explain to you what the ultrasound
showed<00:00:45.629> what<00:00:46.500> we<00:00:46.649> found<00:00:47.160> when<00:00:47.430> we<00:00:47.460> went<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.850> was

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
showed what we found when we went in was

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.479 
showed what we found when we went in was
not<00:00:48.149> exactly<00:00:48.539> what<00:00:48.780> we<00:00:48.809> had<00:00:49.109> expected<00:00:49.289> in<00:00:49.920> fact

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
not exactly what we had expected in fact

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.880 
not exactly what we had expected in fact
she<00:00:50.730> had<00:00:50.969> ingested<00:00:51.300> two<00:00:51.719> socks<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.410> they<00:00:52.829> were

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
she had ingested two socks and they were

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.740 
she had ingested two socks and they were
both<00:00:53.100> lodged<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.850> different<00:00:54.149> places<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.539> her

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
both lodged in different places in her

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.790 
both lodged in different places in her
intestine<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:56.600> there<00:00:57.600> was<00:00:57.780> somehow<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.320> thread

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
intestine so there was somehow a thread

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.310 
intestine so there was somehow a thread
from<00:00:59.039> one<00:00:59.309> sock<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.000> other<00:01:00.149> which<00:01:01.019> had

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
from one sock to the other which had

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.740 
from one sock to the other which had
managed<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.859> saw<00:01:02.309> through<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.269> wall<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.629> her

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
managed to saw through the wall of her

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.499 
managed to saw through the wall of her
intestine<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.590> one<00:01:05.220> aspect<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.000> had<00:01:06.479> to

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
intestine in one aspect so I had to

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.260 
intestine in one aspect so I had to
actually<00:01:06.720> remove<00:01:07.070> approximately<00:01:08.270> 14

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
actually remove approximately 14

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.170 
actually remove approximately 14
centimeters<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.900> intestine<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.030> suture<00:01:12.030> you

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
centimeters of intestine and suture you

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.609 
centimeters of intestine and suture you
know<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.420> healthy<00:01:12.720> ends<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.200> intestine

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
know the healthy ends of the intestine

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.770 
know the healthy ends of the intestine
together<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.310> then<00:01:15.030> we<00:01:15.119> had<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.270> do<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.689> know

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
together and then we had to do you know

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.660 
together and then we had to do you know
extensive<00:01:16.229> washing<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.770> her<00:01:16.890> abdomen<00:01:17.220> because

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
extensive washing of her abdomen because

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.359 
extensive washing of her abdomen because
of<00:01:17.790> course<00:01:18.000> she<00:01:18.210> had<00:01:18.299> some<00:01:18.890> fluid<00:01:19.890> had<00:01:20.159> leaked

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
of course she had some fluid had leaked

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.340 
of course she had some fluid had leaked
from<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.670> intestine<00:01:21.180> into<00:01:21.390> her<00:01:21.630> abdomen<00:01:21.810> in

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
from the intestine into her abdomen in

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.179 
from the intestine into her abdomen in
my<00:01:22.799> estimation<00:01:23.430> she<00:01:23.790> was<00:01:24.030> probably<00:01:24.540> 15<00:01:25.409> kilos

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
my estimation she was probably 15 kilos

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.450 
my estimation she was probably 15 kilos
underweight<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.060> upwards<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.930> 30<00:01:28.200> pounds<00:01:28.650> she

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
underweight so upwards of 30 pounds she

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.980 
underweight so upwards of 30 pounds she
was<00:01:29.610> very<00:01:29.790> dehydrated<00:01:30.479> she<00:01:30.630> was<00:01:30.750> extremely

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
was very dehydrated she was extremely

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.800 
was very dehydrated she was extremely
weak<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:32.070> difficulty<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.850> situations

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
weak and the difficulty in situations

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.480 
weak and the difficulty in situations
like<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.380> she<00:01:34.740> was<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.009> catabolic

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
like this is that she was in a catabolic

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.399 
like this is that she was in a catabolic
state<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.270> means<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.689> she's<00:01:36.899> not<00:01:37.140> got

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
state and that means that she's not got

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.570 
state and that means that she's not got
a<00:01:37.649> lot<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.130> body<00:01:38.369> proteins

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
a lot of body proteins

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.730 
a lot of body proteins
her<00:01:40.210> cells<00:01:40.570> that<00:01:40.750> are<00:01:40.810> required<00:01:41.260> for<00:01:41.350> healing

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
her cells that are required for healing

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.550 
her cells that are required for healing
are<00:01:42.160> low<00:01:42.580> in<00:01:42.790> numbers<00:01:43.000> and<00:01:43.450> so<00:01:44.020> we<00:01:44.230> knew<00:01:44.380> her

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
are low in numbers and so we knew her

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.980 
are low in numbers and so we knew her
recovery<00:01:45.070> would<00:01:45.220> be<00:01:45.370> difficult<00:01:45.780> asthma<00:01:46.780> had

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
recovery would be difficult asthma had

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.120 
recovery would be difficult asthma had
we<00:01:47.110> decided<00:01:47.230> that<00:01:47.530> we<00:01:47.710> would<00:01:47.800> give<00:01:47.980> her<00:01:48.100> a

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
we decided that we would give her a

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.730 
we decided that we would give her a
blood<00:01:48.400> transfusion<00:01:49.350> postoperatively<00:01:50.350> to

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
blood transfusion postoperatively to

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.470 
blood transfusion postoperatively to
help<00:01:50.980> give<00:01:51.400> her<00:01:51.490> a<00:01:51.520> little<00:01:51.670> bit<00:01:51.790> more<00:01:51.970> support

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
help give her a little bit more support

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.840 
help give her a little bit more support
in<00:01:53.020> that<00:01:53.500> sense<00:01:53.800> and<00:01:54.010> we<00:01:54.100> knew<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.670> road

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
in that sense and we knew the the road

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.360 
in that sense and we knew the the road
to<00:01:55.030> recovery<00:01:55.480> would<00:01:55.630> be<00:01:55.810> long<00:01:56.020> because<00:01:56.920> of<00:01:57.250> her
