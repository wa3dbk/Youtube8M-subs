didn't start with the beheading of the
American<00:01:54.570> journalist<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.229> was<00:01:55.920> just<00:01:56.250> a

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
American journalist that was just a

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.060 
American journalist that was just a
symptom<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:57.149> what<00:01:57.240> was<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.930> long<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.770> growing

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070

problem<00:01:59.670> for<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.939> United<00:02:00.090> States<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:01.200> it's

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
problem for the United States so it's

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.370 
problem for the United States so it's
not<00:02:02.009> wrong<00:02:02.310> it's<00:02:02.850> just<00:02:02.969> very<00:02:03.689> very<00:02:03.960> late<00:02:04.200> in

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
not wrong it's just very very late in

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.069 
not wrong it's just very very late in
the<00:02:04.560> game<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:05.130> presents

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
the game and it presents

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.540 
the game and it presents
fewer<00:02:07.079> options<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.680> three<00:02:07.920> years<00:02:07.950> ago<00:02:08.160> we<00:02:08.399> had

one<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.380> worst<00:03:13.590> things<00:03:13.890> you<00:03:13.950> can<00:03:14.130> do<00:03:14.310> in

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
one of the worst things you can do in

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.620 
one of the worst things you can do in
warfare<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.060> guess<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.330> White<00:03:15.480> House

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
warfare and I guess the White House

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.300 
warfare and I guess the White House
would<00:03:15.810> would<00:03:16.140> dispute<00:03:16.739> whether<00:03:17.040> or<00:03:17.130> not<00:03:17.190> we

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
would would dispute whether or not we

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.560 
would would dispute whether or not we
were<00:03:17.400> actually<00:03:17.730> engaged<00:03:17.970> into<00:03:18.209> war

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
were actually engaged into war

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.420 
were actually engaged into war
I<00:03:18.600> think<00:03:18.900> Isis<00:03:19.230> is<00:03:19.350> probably<00:03:19.739> not<00:03:19.920> disputing

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
I think Isis is probably not disputing

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.099 
I think Isis is probably not disputing
it<00:03:20.489> but<00:03:20.940> he<00:03:21.090> said<00:03:21.299> one<00:03:21.510> of<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.660> worst<00:03:21.870> things

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
it but he said one of the worst things

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.650 
it but he said one of the worst things
you<00:03:22.200> can<00:03:22.380> do<00:03:22.530> in<00:03:22.799> war<00:03:23.190> is<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.640> be<00:03:23.670> indecisive

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
you can do in war is to be indecisive

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.729 
you can do in war is to be indecisive
and<00:03:25.670> it<00:03:26.670> still<00:03:27.030> is<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.450> same<00:03:27.690> thing<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.500> we

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
and it still is the same thing and we

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.370 
and it still is the same thing and we
are<00:03:28.880> indecisive<00:03:29.880> so<00:03:30.030> where<00:03:30.510> is<00:03:30.630> it<00:03:30.660> popping<00:03:31.230> up

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
are indecisive so where is it popping up

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.590 
are indecisive so where is it popping up
it<00:03:31.620> pops<00:03:31.769> up<00:03:32.040> in<00:03:32.190> Libya<00:03:32.549> as<00:03:32.880> we've<00:03:33.150> just<00:03:33.390> seen

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
it pops up in Libya as we've just seen

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
of the free syrian army and that's a

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.230 
of the free syrian army and that's a
little<00:04:33.139> confusing<00:04:33.620> to<00:04:33.770> people<00:04:34.190> so<00:04:34.760> I've

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
little confusing to people so I've

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.540 
little confusing to people so I've
always<00:04:35.600> maintained<00:04:36.110> to<00:04:36.260> go<00:04:36.410> back<00:04:36.590> quite<00:04:36.949> some
