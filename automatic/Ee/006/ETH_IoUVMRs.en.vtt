00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:18.029
 It's good for me to buy a car in cash 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.029
 it does not suit you that alternative 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.200
 of investment for your money you never 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.689
 It is convenient to buy a car in cash 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.610
 it is always convenient to finance it 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.570
 remember that a car 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.300
 loses value over time 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.610
 a car in five years is worth 50 less than 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.800
 what cost in year 1 a car 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.840
 leaving the store is worth 18 percent 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.329
 except for the simple fact of having left 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.329
 of the store then it is not convenient to put 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:50.340
 your money in a good that I know that 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.340
 pressure is not better 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.350
 The first thing is that monthly fee 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.320
 Your gonna pay 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.780
 that is the most important data because 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.530
 everybody talks to you about cup in short 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.630
 and people commonly do not understand 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.290
 percentages do not confuse us a bit 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.770
 but nevertheless I do know when a 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.549
 institution tells me hey the fee is 350 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.490
 dollars per month 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.409
 there they already landed me and I already know if 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.100
 I can pay it or I can not pay it 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:28.220
 first is the monthly credit installment 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:31.299
 what are you going to pay for the second is I'm going to 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.299
 need insurance 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.659
 so I have to find out 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.520
 how much does this insurance cost me per month 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.890
 because in the end I will be paying the 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.510
 vehicle fee plus insurance what 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.460
 third is hey 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.310
 and how much does this vehicle consume 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.320
 gasoline because having a car involves 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.540
 what are you going to have to spend on 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.630
 fuel and now gasoline is not a 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.100
 minor issue no gasoline costs and 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.369
 it is expensive 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.060
 Fourth, how much will it cost you? 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.600

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.229
 maintenances are every 5000 kilometers 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.390
 and all the concessionaires that have 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.880
