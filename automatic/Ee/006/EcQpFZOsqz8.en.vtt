00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.040
 I will not permit... 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.630
 ... you put your hands on my crew! 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.980
 Damn! 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.690
 Did he pretend to give it to him? 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.900
 This time I will give you. 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.910
 Negative Hollow! 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.490
 What?! 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.310
 My name is... 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.060
 Captain Usopp. 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.630
 Why?! 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.360
 Why does not it affect you ?! 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.140
 The ghost pierced you! 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.090
 What kind of technique are you using ?! 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.290
 It is not any technique. 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.560
 I have always been... 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.490
 ...NEGATIVE! 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.380
 The negative power of ghosts does not affect you! 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.190
 What an incredible man! 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:32.830
 Perona-sama! 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.630
 That can not be... 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.800
 There is no human being who is not affected by the Negative Hollow! 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.970
 Perona-sama! 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.700
 Perona-sama! Perona-sama! 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.790
 Perona-sama! 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.370
 People live ... 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.510
 ... looking forward, and yet ... 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.310
 Go ahead ... and yet ... 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.400
 Even so... 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.620
 This man... 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.880
 Cheer up! 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.200

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.360
 Come on, open your eyes, boys! 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.560
 Hurry up and go save Nami and Brook! 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.440
 Boys ... 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.050
 His strength is useless against this woman. 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.330
 I'll take care of it! 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.200
 Your...! 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.830
 What is this feeling of confidence ...? 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.460
 Does not it affect him ...?
