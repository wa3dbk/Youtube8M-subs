 I have to be mature for you 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.780
 have to say that I have a power that 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.269
 you can master the dragons we're going to 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.870
 ride a dragon when you decide to 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:45.870

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.020
 far 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.850
 we see that people are attacking her 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.850
 that fight we are going to take it 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.090
 values 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.420
 we already have something for us to submit 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.750
 will that means you have to 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.750
 perform 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.670

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.820
 dragon with gifts of the faith of a message 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.770
 dragon in irak in the revenge of mira 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.770
 we can take cottons worth 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.840
 no no no 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.830
 from your imperial side so you can see a 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.930
 little how it works 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.610
 we will attack the imperial soldiers with 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.730
 the dragon is worth 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.980
 faith is easier and you see as a dragon 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.620
 when you have white fixed that you already have 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.130
 fixed we give you the button that shoots 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.130
 I say kill 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.660
 both were forced landing and there 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.050
 we do little stumbles attack 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.880
 of frost that has not killed has 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.970
 assembled we are a way that we are in 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.970
 war 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.450
 and we are going to kill them based on one pass 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.230
 to see that we have more we have that 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.230
 imperial 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.220
 videos that see wolf are fight we are going to 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.220
 kill them 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.939
 I do not feel sorry 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:58.220
 we see that we are called 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:01.720
 trading you have to do it 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.720
 and I can soldier will die 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.280
 as the now called a useless war 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.689
 and that moves to my voice 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.439
 let's kill the other imperial soldier and 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:22.569
 this that makes us have mastered the 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:25.120
 dragon that we have mastered but not 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.670
 control it a vast rhythm this is the 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.050
 only difference 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.849
 now let's make a landing 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:36.069
 forced forced so we go with a 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.420
 site to land with a car na 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.690
 we're going to kill the dragon marginally 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.830
 this bullfighter is about like where 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:46.410
 submit to your will of a dragon and 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.410
 then kill him the way possible 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.760
 as order in which we are listening 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.900
 how does he speak 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.410
 we are around our 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.410
 we understand 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.890
 Juan Miguel cities for third 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.630
 I'm very sorry about something not like I said 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.630
 Before you have to get into the couple 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.769
 good do not go 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:28.300
 I need to keep trying what 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.300
 data that I have just 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.250
 all 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:37.390
 we have played so we are going to kill him not 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.390
 you go fucking 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.770
 but we have come on let's not let it go 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.200
 guys, you have to kill him anyway, so 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.380
 we are going to 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:54.290
 they attack with all clean austria takes 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.849
 shield paper shield teacher 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.249
 said shield hit 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:01.319
 we have already killed we like this episode 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:06.029
 we have changed our criteria of 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:09.800
 dragon that subdues you and kills you then here 

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:09.800
 we have a dragon 

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:14.020
 now only this game can be done 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:16.330
 this 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.990
 and I take all the segments all 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:22.920
 for my date now you're going to all 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.920
 so strike or dragon do not look at me 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:28.280
 well but that has to be bad is what 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.080
 what's wrong with it 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.620
 is waiting for it to become 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.620
 super saiyan 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.320
 fuller 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.520
 we form boys 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.010
 it was good to be even more 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:59.259
 because here we see a book of the game not 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.870
 nothing happens I do not care that dragon 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:03.190
