00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 friends we are in low 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.930
 north california and I'm in the house of 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.330
 Mrs. Kika who I am told 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.450
 prepare the best fish tacos 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.130
 style cocked that's not true sir 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.130
 here is good so let's see 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:24.040
 sir here you can know what you think 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:26.650
 if we start and tell us first the 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:30.150
 ingredients that we need first to 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:35.140
 see to see flour flour baking powder 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:38.440
 salt egg milk aja this as 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:42.040
 mustard these to oregano oregano 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.770
 and good something very important clear state 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.090
 the fish that in this case what kind of 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.450
 fish is to know well 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.930
 this is what kind of people 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.960
 it smells delicious still being raw and 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.910
 green this is sole and here vicens 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.950
 now it takes away that he had this other thing that 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.390
 we did not mention cream item we're also going 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:08.450
 need except tomato onion 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.240
 the tortillitas a rich tortillitas 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.369
 machinists the leaves and cabbage also 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.300
 perfect good because it seems that is everything 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.300
 true this 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.729
 what is the first step of stopping 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.900
 the ingredient for taquitos 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:31.080
 the flour with the egg and whatever 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.000
 put on the roll here 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.310
 very well then step by step we are going to 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.280
 put the flour in a container like 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.799
 this 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.369
 and how many new eggs are we going to 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.799
 used in the good depends as it 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.890
 called the face of the fish they go to 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.380
 do so is that right now I put two 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.830
 eggs made to see so they go 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.630
 this people calculate today the 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.030
 proportions for that reason for my year 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.740
 we want to make fish like you 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.440
 calculate for example right now for half 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.890
 kilo of fish that is put two 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.160
 eggs 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:13.020
 this baking powder a one 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:16.330
 teaspoon very well this total in the 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.630
 proportions 6 to 4 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.330
 in this case you are putting as 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:27.970
 that half a tablespoon soup more or less 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:30.730
 this one half teaspoon we show you 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.880
 everyone then goes on here sir here that one 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.950
 does not have the exact amounts, but 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.890
 that she from the practice of the dawn 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:43.470
 acquiring so well that they know 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:49.420
 you go calculating good now goes 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:51.820
 he won a little bit by little just a 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.250
 little feels it gives it a very 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.070
 social specials until perfuming that 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.480
 but nolito that can be so that not 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.390
 this 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.379
 very well this then it was like a 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.379
 little piece of oregano 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:10.700
 now milk goes 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.680
 to leave a dough 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.670
 Well, more or less this 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.670
 as i will tell you 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:27.300
 What is the name of the fish? 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:30.060
 impregnated and left spongy lady 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.850
 it removes that I have seen that sometimes 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.640
 they put a little beer on beer 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.700
 the desert cuts the beer the flour 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.400
 lower the court then for nothing is a 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.130
 Pomegranate to not even think of beer 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:51.300
 more nothing more baking powder so that 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:54.120
 I put a little more milk for them 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.940
 that is a little more logical 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:03.590
 tapas more until now we will see the 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.590
 end is how consistent paste 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:15.450
 well with the very thick and very loose very 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.420
 softly that is the process is this 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.520
 fish the sole if it is not caught 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:24.420
 then in strips of the best that 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:26.190
 we have whoever puts the fish in the 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:30.980
 flour and ready 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:33.980
 there is already to go to the what is called 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.630
 by making the perfect oil well 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.340
 hands to the work to see then already 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.170
 we have here ready I am ready and 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.810
 food with using tweezers 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.620
 experiences and put them and let's see 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:48.050
 one by one one by one in the oil there 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:51.380
 well it came out a little bad really if there 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.330
 totally wrong this one went a little bit more 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.430
 well let's put another unnecessary and 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.100
 the expert quoted is to see if we 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.770
 we come here here and you know that 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.539
 said foreigners 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.979
 it has to be there has to be a 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:06.710
 little bit hotter then it's 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:12.099
 very important as is the lady 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.099
 also good here 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.530
 it came out more that was good and good 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.780
 because the experience is giving as 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.150
 we know that they are there when we have to give 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.270
 they would turn around and it would be that flip 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.520
 when they are golden brown on one side 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:33.260
 they turn around so that they turn brown on each other and 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:35.800
 I think you're already really know 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:40.810
 that yes it is clear already has the color quito 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:43.180
 very good this sms that is there is 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.150
 I feel very well that's how they should 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:49.270
 to stay like that should be like this is the 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.760
 non-golden color comes spongy the 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.850
 texture and obviously that is not done 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.940
 chicharrÃ³n so good friends because then 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:00.250
 the little fishes were ready here and 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:03.220
 now how are we going to serve them? 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.860
 prepare with all the ingredients and 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:10.780
 here are the practices and they are good 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:13.450
 You get rich, this one, I'll go 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:17.169
 to go following it seems the fish the 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:19.470
 fish then came the creame there 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:22.389
 people who like mayonnaise but 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.770
 good that is the taste to taste us 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:28.300
 we are going to do it as the 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:31.840
 mate mate chopped lonely chopped 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:37.330

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:48.630
 type of sauces they also have in 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.630
 all places 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:59.350
