00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.100 
now we're just going to throw in the
rest<00:01:58.190> of<00:01:58.400> our<00:01:58.550> ingredients<00:01:58.840> salt<00:01:59.840> in<00:02:00.020> the

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
rest of our ingredients salt in the

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.250 
rest of our ingredients salt in the
peppers<00:02:01.720> and<00:02:02.720> then<00:02:03.080> our<00:02:03.230> garlic<00:02:03.410> shallot<00:02:05.260> it's

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
peppers and then our garlic shallot it's

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.450 
peppers and then our garlic shallot it's
this<00:02:06.440> real<00:02:06.650> good<00:02:08.979> then<00:02:09.979> finally<00:02:10.340> we're<00:02:10.430> going

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
this real good then finally we're going

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.210 
this real good then finally we're going
to<00:02:10.610> drizzle<00:02:10.820> in<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.120> extra<00:02:11.480> virgin<00:02:11.630> olive<00:02:11.840> oil

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
to drizzle in the extra virgin olive oil

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.530 
to drizzle in the extra virgin olive oil
let<00:02:13.220> me<00:02:13.280> do<00:02:13.400> it<00:02:13.460> nice<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:13.640> slow<00:02:13.820> whisking<00:02:14.450> the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
let me do it nice and slow whisking the

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.260 
let me do it nice and slow whisking the
whole<00:02:14.690> time<00:02:15.670> so<00:02:16.670> we<00:02:16.760> can<00:02:16.880> get<00:02:16.940> this<00:02:17.090> to

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
whole time so we can get this to

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.990 
whole time so we can get this to
multiply<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.020> thicken<00:02:18.290> up<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:19.640> like<00:02:19.820> steps

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
multiply and thicken up and like steps

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.780 
multiply and thicken up and like steps
about<00:02:20.150> a<00:02:20.210> quarter<00:02:20.540> cup<00:02:21.370> that's<00:02:22.370> about<00:02:22.550> the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
about a quarter cup that's about the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.760 
about a quarter cup that's about the
consistency<00:02:23.120> you're<00:02:24.080> looking<00:02:24.410> forward<00:02:24.620> to

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
consistency you're looking forward to

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.160 
consistency you're looking forward to
here<00:02:25.510> well<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.630> flavors<00:02:26.990> are<00:02:27.080> coming

going to transfer them to a large mixing
bowl<00:02:48.800> I'm<00:02:51.040> gonna<00:02:52.040> drizzle<00:02:52.280> in<00:02:52.490> about<00:02:52.670> half<00:02:52.970> of

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
bowl I'm gonna drizzle in about half of

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.800 
bowl I'm gonna drizzle in about half of
the<00:02:53.210> dressing<00:02:55.150> this<00:02:56.150> is<00:02:56.300> enough<00:02:56.540> for<00:02:56.570> about<00:02:56.780> a

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
the dressing this is enough for about a

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.530 
the dressing this is enough for about a
pound<00:02:57.620> and<00:02:57.830> a<00:02:57.860> half<00:02:57.890> of<00:02:58.490> Brussels<00:02:58.910> sprouts<00:02:58.940> and

pound and a half of Brussels sprouts and
I<00:02:59.959> probably<00:03:00.140> have<00:03:00.290> about<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:00.530> pound<00:03:00.770> right<00:03:01.070> here

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
I probably have about a pound right here

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.690 
I probably have about a pound right here
after<00:03:02.720> I<00:03:02.750> drizzle<00:03:03.110> it<00:03:03.200> in<00:03:03.520> just<00:03:04.520> going<00:03:04.610> to

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
after I drizzle it in just going to

Brussels sprouts you don't to mix it too
hard<00:03:09.770> and<00:03:09.920> break<00:03:10.070> them<00:03:10.280> all<00:03:10.370> apart<00:03:10.730> just<00:03:11.330> want

hard and break them all apart just want

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.490 
hard and break them all apart just want
to<00:03:12.220> get<00:03:13.220> them<00:03:13.970> nice<00:03:14.330> and<00:03:14.660> evenly<00:03:14.959> coated<00:03:15.290> as

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
to get them nice and evenly coated as

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.979 
to get them nice and evenly coated as
best<00:03:15.709> you<00:03:15.860> can

okay<00:03:17.989> I<00:03:18.020> like<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.320> let<00:03:18.440> these<00:03:18.590> marinate<00:03:18.860> for

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
okay I like to let these marinate for

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.040 
okay I like to let these marinate for
about<00:03:19.280> 15<00:03:19.790> minutes<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:20.360> I<00:03:20.660> probably<00:03:20.810> give

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
about 15 minutes and I probably give

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.229 
about 15 minutes and I probably give
them<00:03:21.170> a<00:03:21.230> stir<00:03:21.500> every<00:03:21.530> five<00:03:21.980> minutes<00:03:22.190> just<00:03:23.090> to

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
them a stir every five minutes just to

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:24.970 
them a stir every five minutes just to
make<00:03:23.420> sure<00:03:23.450> they're<00:03:23.810> really<00:03:24.080> good<00:03:24.410> and<00:03:24.590> coated

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
make sure they're really good and coated

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.040 
make sure they're really good and coated
now<00:03:25.970> all<00:03:26.090> we<00:03:26.180> do<00:03:26.300> is<00:03:26.330> we<00:03:26.510> transfer<00:03:26.870> them<00:03:26.930> to<00:03:26.989> a

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
now all we do is we transfer them to a

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:34.660 
now all we do is we transfer them to a
small<00:03:27.230> baking<00:03:27.620> sheet<00:03:33.280> you<00:03:34.280> want<00:03:34.459> them<00:03:34.550> in<00:03:34.610> a

small baking sheet you want them in a
single<00:03:34.910> layer<00:03:35.090> you<00:03:35.630> don't<00:03:35.660> want<00:03:35.870> to<00:03:35.930> pile<00:03:36.080> on

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
single layer you don't want to pile on

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.570 
single layer you don't want to pile on
top<00:03:36.410> of<00:03:36.530> each<00:03:36.650> other<00:03:38.470> my<00:03:39.470> ovens<00:03:39.739> at<00:03:39.860> 450<00:03:40.459> I'm

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
top of each other my ovens at 450 I'm

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.009 
top of each other my ovens at 450 I'm
going<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:40.760> put<00:03:40.910> these<00:03:41.030> in<00:03:41.180> there<00:03:41.330> and<00:03:41.570> check

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
going to put these in there and check

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:53.700 
going to put these in there and check
them<00:03:42.170> in<00:03:42.260> 15<00:03:42.680> minutes

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.200 

all<00:03:54.710> right<00:03:54.950> I<00:03:54.980> went<00:03:55.250> about<00:03:55.370> 20<00:03:55.820> minutes<00:03:56.060> on

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
all right I went about 20 minutes on

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.870 
all right I went about 20 minutes on
these<00:03:56.420> in<00:03:56.920> a<00:03:57.920> regular<00:03:58.310> oven<00:03:58.580> you'll<00:03:58.730> probably

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
these in a regular oven you'll probably

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.520 
these in a regular oven you'll probably
want<00:03:59.210> to<00:03:59.240> go<00:03:59.330> about<00:03:59.480> 25<00:04:00.050> and<00:04:00.290> like<00:04:00.380> I<00:04:00.410> said

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
want to go about 25 and like I said

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.440 
want to go about 25 and like I said
you'll<00:04:00.770> have<00:04:00.800> to<00:04:00.920> turn<00:04:01.160> them<00:04:01.310> a<00:04:01.370> few<00:04:01.550> times<00:04:01.730> and

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
you'll have to turn them a few times and

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.910 
you'll have to turn them a few times and
you<00:04:02.570> do<00:04:02.690> want<00:04:02.870> them<00:04:02.960> to<00:04:02.990> be<00:04:03.140> a<00:04:03.170> little<00:04:03.530> charred

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
you do want them to be a little charred

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.910 
you do want them to be a little charred
a<00:04:04.250> little<00:04:04.850> crispy<00:04:05.270> let's<00:04:06.080> give<00:04:06.230> it<00:04:06.260> a<00:04:06.350> try<00:04:06.500> I
