okay<00:00:04.609> we're<00:00:04.910> looking<00:00:05.029> at<00:00:05.420> the<00:00:05.600> internal

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:06.230 
okay we're looking at the internal

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.740 
okay we're looking at the internal
portion<00:00:06.859> of<00:00:07.100> the<00:00:07.279> filter<00:00:07.670> filter<00:00:08.059> max<00:00:08.269> system

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:08.750 
portion of the filter filter max system

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.720 
portion of the filter filter max system
as<00:00:08.870> you<00:00:08.990> see<00:00:09.230> here<00:00:09.470> we've<00:00:09.950> got<00:00:10.099> a<00:00:10.160> little<00:00:10.340> sump

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
as you see here we've got a little sump

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.110 
as you see here we've got a little sump
that's<00:00:11.269> below<00:00:11.780> the<00:00:12.139> the<00:00:12.589> water<00:00:13.190> surface<00:00:13.759> here

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
that's below the the water surface here

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.480 
that's below the the water surface here
by<00:00:15.080> the<00:00:15.139> bottom<00:00:15.620> edge<00:00:15.799> of<00:00:15.950> the<00:00:16.010> water<00:00:16.190> surface

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
by the bottom edge of the water surface

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.670 
by the bottom edge of the water surface
and<00:00:16.670> you<00:00:16.850> see<00:00:17.060> it<00:00:17.150> has<00:00:17.330> the<00:00:17.539> drain<00:00:17.810> inside<00:00:18.320> here

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
and you see it has the drain inside here

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.870 
and you see it has the drain inside here
and<00:00:18.830> of<00:00:18.890> course<00:00:19.130> the<00:00:19.280> sump

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
and of course the sump

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.190 
and of course the sump
now<00:00:20.210> what<00:00:20.450> we're<00:00:20.540> going<00:00:20.660> to<00:00:20.690> do<00:00:20.810> is<00:00:20.930> show<00:00:21.140> you

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
now what we're going to do is show you

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.380 
now what we're going to do is show you
how<00:00:21.620> this<00:00:22.100> filter<00:00:22.490> system<00:00:22.670> works<00:00:23.030> it's<00:00:23.300> a

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
how this filter system works it's a

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.290 
how this filter system works it's a
multi-stage<00:00:24.080> filtering<00:00:24.950> system<00:00:25.460> so<00:00:26.030> the

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
multi-stage filtering system so the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.800 
multi-stage filtering system so the
first<00:00:26.600> will<00:00:27.320> be<00:00:27.550> this<00:00:28.550> plastic<00:00:29.090> media<00:00:29.450> here

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
first will be this plastic media here

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.760 
first will be this plastic media here
and<00:00:30.020> it<00:00:30.470> goes<00:00:30.680> and<00:00:30.950> right<00:00:31.160> down<00:00:31.400> in<00:00:31.640> the<00:00:31.790> bottom

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
and it goes and right down in the bottom

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.829 
and it goes and right down in the bottom
it's<00:00:33.770> like<00:00:33.890> that<00:00:34.309> so<00:00:34.820> that's<00:00:34.969> it<00:00:35.329> sets<00:00:35.629> in

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:35.839 
it's like that so that's it sets in

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:38.799 
it's like that so that's it sets in
first<00:00:36.170> then<00:00:36.859> we<00:00:36.980> come<00:00:37.219> in<00:00:37.519> with<00:00:38.149> a<00:00:38.480> what's

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:41.659 
called a filter media pad you see it's

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:45.479 
called a filter media pad you see it's
kind<00:00:41.839> of<00:00:41.960> like<00:00:42.109> a<00:00:42.140> cloth<00:00:42.800> pad<00:00:43.159> here<00:00:43.640> it<00:00:44.390> fits<00:00:44.690> in

course you'll need to shake it around a
little<00:01:11.719> bit<00:01:11.840> to<00:01:12.170> get<00:01:12.320> it

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
little bit to get it

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.319 
little bit to get it
dispersed<00:01:13.939> throughout<00:01:14.299> here<00:01:14.750> so<00:01:15.170> it<00:01:15.320> sits<00:01:15.560> in

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
dispersed throughout here so it sits in

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:20.709 
dispersed throughout here so it sits in
just<00:01:17.329> like<00:01:17.540> this<00:01:19.060> here<00:01:20.060> and<00:01:20.180> make<00:01:20.270> sure<00:01:20.539> it's

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:20.719 
just like this here and make sure it's

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:23.709 
just like this here and make sure it's
all<00:01:20.899> nice<00:01:21.110> and<00:01:21.170> covered<00:01:21.619> there<00:01:22.579> then<00:01:23.420> we<00:01:23.539> come

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
all nice and covered there then we come

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:27.100 
all nice and covered there then we come

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
in with another filter media here on top

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.170 
in with another filter media here on top
here<00:01:27.380> and<00:01:27.590> this<00:01:27.710> is<00:01:27.829> multistage<00:01:28.399> so<00:01:28.880> we've<00:01:29.060> got

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
here and this is multistage so we've got

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.270 
here and this is multistage so we've got
all<00:01:29.299> these<00:01:29.570> different<00:01:29.960> filters<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.680> filter

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
all these different filters to filter

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.099 
all these different filters to filter
out<00:01:31.549> all<00:01:31.579> the<00:01:31.759> impurities<00:01:32.210> in<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.630> water<00:01:32.840> and

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:33.109 
out all the impurities in the water and

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:37.389 
out all the impurities in the water and
then<00:01:33.740> lastly<00:01:34.159> another<00:01:34.990> screen<00:01:35.990> here<00:01:36.439> that

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
then lastly another screen here that

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.679 
then lastly another screen here that
fits<00:01:37.609> in<00:01:37.909> on<00:01:38.060> top<00:01:38.560> just<00:01:39.560> like<00:01:39.649> that<00:01:40.100> okay<00:01:41.000> then

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
fits in on top just like that okay then

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.800 
fits in on top just like that okay then
it's<00:01:41.899> got<00:01:42.049> these<00:01:42.200> two<00:01:42.259> little<00:01:43.390> tabs<00:01:44.390> that

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
it's got these two little tabs that

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.990 
it's got these two little tabs that
secure<00:01:44.990> it<00:01:45.469> in<00:01:45.590> here<00:01:46.009> so<00:01:46.340> you<00:01:46.579> just<00:01:46.609> kind<00:01:46.909> of

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
secure it in here so you just kind of

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.060 
secure it in here so you just kind of
it's<00:01:47.509> a<00:01:47.719> little<00:01:47.929> tricky<00:01:48.229> sometimes<00:01:48.439> you<00:01:48.920> just

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
it's a little tricky sometimes you just

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:56.319 
it's a little tricky sometimes you just
slide<00:01:49.340> it<00:01:49.520> in<00:01:49.609> like<00:01:49.880> that<00:01:51.670> like<00:01:52.750> yes<00:01:53.950> and<00:01:55.329> just

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
slide it in like that like yes and just

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.980 
slide it in like that like yes and just
it<00:01:56.509> back<00:01:57.369> yeah<00:01:58.369> we<00:01:58.549> got<00:01:58.729> it<00:01:58.820> okay<00:01:59.329> so<00:01:59.570> what<00:01:59.840> that

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
it back yeah we got it okay so what that

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.480 
it back yeah we got it okay so what that
does<00:02:00.200> is<00:02:00.259> hold<00:02:00.619> everything<00:02:00.920> in<00:02:01.249> Nice

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
does is hold everything in Nice

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.190 
does is hold everything in Nice
compresses<00:02:02.210> it<00:02:02.329> nice<00:02:02.509> and<00:02:02.539> tight<00:02:02.929> and<00:02:03.079> secure

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
compresses it nice and tight and secure

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.509 
compresses it nice and tight and secure
so<00:02:04.009> that's<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:04.609> the<00:02:05.090> filtering<00:02:05.450> system
