00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.199
 you have to be a bit early 

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:13.869
 art 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:15.969
 if you present 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.390
 He understands 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.859
 to see them to see them 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.859
 estrosi the idea 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.710
 so here it is and actually allows 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.500
 two best elements collected all rest for writing and for the 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.830
 thermal 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.440
 so it just takes sex and power outages the world is talking 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.690
 and thermal point 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.260
 the report makes cuts between 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
 but how do you rotate and pineau author 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.490
 quite simply 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.180
 300 meters next 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.760
 in the culture 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.140
 no it's the best 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.140
 testifies 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.120
 yahoo 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.120
 Yes 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.370
 this is confirmed by the military mid-September minutes 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.410
 for that several months 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.250
 presumed to have brought by a little clearer equipment and more 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.250
 late for about a year ago 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.379
 so that means 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:11.729
 the airbus 350 fourth place I was idling 

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:13.259
 but according to m 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:16.749
 if we can see the historical hours in fact 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:19.749
 as on previous ones having so it must be done several times 

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:25.449
 it's because we can see there 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:27.919
 1967 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:31.779
 on a test after several tests have to know that it allows to 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:33.059
 give a little bit 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:36.149
 the number of rounds and undermines any single problem these army sensors like 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:37.879
 boys 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.179
 of obala always look the same 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:40.669
 others
