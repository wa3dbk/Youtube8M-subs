00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.530 

then<00:00:08.130> when<00:00:08.910> that<00:00:10.040> bends<00:00:11.040> what<00:00:11.850> happens<00:00:12.330> is

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
then when that bends what happens is

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.070 
then when that bends what happens is
that<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:13.140> that<00:00:14.130> one<00:00:14.490> side<00:00:14.850> let's<00:00:15.180> go<00:00:15.450> like<00:00:15.780> this

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
that is that one side let's go like this

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.240 
that is that one side let's go like this
and<00:00:16.410> then<00:00:17.539> this<00:00:18.539> side<00:00:18.870> has<00:00:19.200> to<00:00:19.440> actually<00:00:19.620> fold

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
and then this side has to actually fold

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.279 
and then this side has to actually fold
on<00:00:20.580> itself<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:23.240> that<00:00:24.240> part<00:00:24.780> of<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.020> torso

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
on itself so that part of the torso

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.490 
on itself so that part of the torso
actually<00:00:26.039> folds<00:00:26.580> on<00:00:26.730> itself<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.480> then<00:00:28.050> what<00:00:28.320> it

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
actually folds on itself so then what it

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.730 
actually folds on itself so then what it
tells<00:00:28.770> you<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.039> all<00:00:29.430> this<00:00:29.730> complex

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
tells you is all this complex

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.600 
tells you is all this complex
information<00:00:31.970> all<00:00:32.970> this<00:00:33.870> complex<00:00:34.610> anatomical

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
information all this complex anatomical

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.380 
information all this complex anatomical
information<00:00:36.140> suddenly<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:38.059> organized<00:00:39.059> very

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
information suddenly is organized very

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.569 
information suddenly is organized very
simply<00:00:39.960> because<00:00:40.590> what<00:00:40.800> will<00:00:40.890> happen<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.550> that

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
simply because what will happen is that

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.170 
simply because what will happen is that
all<00:00:42.290> this<00:00:43.290> anatomical<00:00:43.940> information<00:00:44.940> will

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
all this anatomical information will

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.010 
all this anatomical information will
feed<00:00:45.510> into<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.050> bend<00:00:47.329> okay<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.390> now<00:00:48.780> we've

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
feed into that bend okay so now we've

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.270 
feed into that bend okay so now we've
taken<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.860> biggest<00:00:50.160> form<00:00:50.790> in<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.420> body<00:00:51.630> and

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
taken the biggest form in the body and

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
taken the biggest form in the body and
simplified<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.610> terms<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.030> all<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
simplified it in terms of all the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.959 
simplified it in terms of all the
anatomy<00:00:54.860> so<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.040> what<00:00:56.250> you're<00:00:56.460> seeing<00:00:56.730> then

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
anatomy so that what you're seeing then

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.970 
anatomy so that what you're seeing then
that<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.390> now<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.899> know<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.559> nipples

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
that the now you know that the nipples

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.900 
that the now you know that the nipples
have<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.550> angle<00:00:59.820> in<00:01:00.980> you<00:01:01.980> know<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.520> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
have to angle in you know that the the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.350 
have to angle in you know that the the
pubis<00:01:03.270> symphysis<00:01:03.300> then<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.409> going<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.129> be<00:01:05.360> like

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
pubis symphysis then is going to be like

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.330 
pubis symphysis then is going to be like
so<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.750> pubic<00:01:07.110> hair<00:01:07.350> that's<00:01:07.619> going<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.920> angle

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
so the pubic hair that's going to angle

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.190 
so the pubic hair that's going to angle
up<00:01:08.549> there<00:01:08.820> also<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.720> that's<00:01:09.900> what<00:01:10.080> I'm<00:01:10.170> looking

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
up there also so that's what I'm looking

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.830 
up there also so that's what I'm looking
for<00:01:10.680> plus<00:01:11.010> what's<00:01:11.310> happening<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> twist<00:01:12.630> in

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
for plus what's happening is a twist in

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.190 
for plus what's happening is a twist in
the<00:01:12.960> body<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.729> so<00:01:14.729> I'll<00:01:15.000> I'll<00:01:15.330> I'll<00:01:15.750> address

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
the body so so I'll I'll I'll address

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.730 
the body so so I'll I'll I'll address
that<00:01:16.320> okay<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:18.290> so<00:01:19.290> basically<00:01:21.260> see<00:01:22.260> and<00:01:22.470> and

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
that okay so so basically see and and

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.980 
that okay so so basically see and and
and<00:01:23.010> this<00:01:23.360> superficially<00:01:24.360> could<00:01:24.570> look<00:01:24.780> like

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
and this superficially could look like

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.830 
and this superficially could look like
it<00:01:25.170> does<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.680> but<00:01:26.369> if<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.640> do<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.600> you

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
it does that but if you do that and you

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.219 
it does that but if you do that and you
make<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.350> form<00:01:29.040> like<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.810> then<00:01:30.810> what<00:01:31.080> you've

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
make a form like that then what you've

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.240 
make a form like that then what you've
made<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.890> like<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.400> piece<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.729> paper<00:01:33.150> or<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> leaf

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
made is like a piece of paper or a leaf

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.649 
made is like a piece of paper or a leaf
floating<00:01:35.250> down<00:01:35.580> it's<00:01:35.790> something<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.270> has<00:01:36.420> no

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
floating down it's something that has no

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.280 
floating down it's something that has no
form<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.590> that's<00:01:37.740> why<00:01:38.299> if<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.600> superficial

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
form so that's why if a superficial

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.350 
form so that's why if a superficial
glance<00:01:40.439> would<00:01:41.009> make<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.340> look<00:01:41.520> like<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:42.030> but

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
glance would make it look like that but

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.390 
glance would make it look like that but
that's<00:01:42.479> actually<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.990> concavity<00:01:43.590> can<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.220> guys

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
that's actually a concavity can you guys

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.630 
that's actually a concavity can you guys
see<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:45.290> but<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.320> makes<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.890> concavity

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
see that but that makes a concavity

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.469 
see that but that makes a concavity
it<00:01:48.119> what<00:01:48.360> has<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.780> happen<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:49.460> form<00:01:50.460> folding<00:01:51.299> on

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
it what has to happen is form folding on

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.690 
it what has to happen is form folding on
form<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.530> quite<00:01:52.829> often<00:01:53.040> what<00:01:53.280> you'll<00:01:53.460> get

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
form and and quite often what you'll get

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.319 
form and and quite often what you'll get
is<00:01:53.909> like<00:01:54.180> little<00:01:54.450> creases<00:01:54.869> there<00:01:56.030> you<00:01:57.030> know<00:01:57.119> so

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
is like little creases there you know so

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.539 
is like little creases there you know so
again<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.840> takes<00:01:58.439> something<00:01:58.920> very<00:01:59.310> very

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
again it takes something very very

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.480 
again it takes something very very
complex<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:01.320> sees<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.770> very<00:02:01.829> simply<00:02:02.280> and

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
complex and and sees it very simply and

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.580 
complex and and sees it very simply and
that's<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.820> idea<00:02:03.149> behind<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.659> gesture<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.290> that

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
that's the idea behind a gesture is that

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.399 
that's the idea behind a gesture is that
you're<00:02:05.240> stripping<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.390> down<00:02:06.560> to<00:02:07.560> its<00:02:07.680> absolute

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:09.409 
you're stripping it down to its absolute

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:13.220 
you're stripping it down to its absolute
minimum<00:02:10.849> amount<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:11.969> information<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.900> would

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
minimum amount of information that would

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.390 
minimum amount of information that would
tell<00:02:13.469> the<00:02:13.620> viewer<00:02:13.889> what

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
tell the viewer what

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.569 
tell the viewer what
happening<00:02:14.909> and<00:02:15.209> when<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.290> can<00:02:16.530> go<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:16.950> that<00:02:17.280> go

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
happening and when you can go to that go

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.640 
happening and when you can go to that go
to<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.819> absolute<00:02:18.150> minimum<00:02:18.510> then<00:02:19.439> you're

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
to the absolute minimum then you're

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.350 
to the absolute minimum then you're
going<00:02:19.799> to<00:02:19.860> be<00:02:20.010> able<00:02:20.099> to<00:02:20.310> take<00:02:20.579> it<00:02:20.730> into<00:02:20.879> longer

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
going to be able to take it into longer

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.170 
going to be able to take it into longer
drawings<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.349> you<00:02:22.409> have<00:02:22.680> this<00:02:22.799> whole<00:02:23.180> whole

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
drawings so you have this whole whole

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.899 
drawings so you have this whole whole
torso<00:02:24.599> like<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.379> and<00:02:25.650> then<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.489> have<00:02:26.730> the

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
torso like that and then you have the

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.000 
torso like that and then you have the
centerline<00:02:27.510> okay<00:02:28.079> well<00:02:28.260> let's<00:02:28.470> see<00:02:28.620> let's<00:02:28.829> get

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
centerline okay well let's see let's get

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:42.580 
centerline okay well let's see let's get
his

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.300 

whenever<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.819> arm<00:02:44.060> raises<00:02:44.870> up<00:02:45.260> so<00:02:46.099> and

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
whenever the arm raises up so and

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.309 
whenever the arm raises up so and
wherever<00:02:46.520> you<00:02:46.790> have<00:02:47.030> like<00:02:47.300> an<00:02:47.420> arm<00:02:47.690> raised<00:02:48.020> up

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
wherever you have like an arm raised up

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.160 
wherever you have like an arm raised up
what'll<00:02:49.069> happen<00:02:49.310> is<00:02:49.610> that<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.940> nipple<00:02:50.209> goes

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
what'll happen is that the nipple goes

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.800 
what'll happen is that the nipple goes
from<00:02:51.530> being<00:02:51.800> from<00:02:52.700> being<00:02:52.940> like<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:53.450> one<00:02:53.599> on

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
from being from being like the one on

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.350 
from being from being like the one on
our<00:02:54.050> left<00:02:54.700> like<00:02:55.700> that<00:02:56.030> and<00:02:56.450> it<00:02:57.110> goes<00:02:57.319> to<00:02:57.770> this

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
our left like that and it goes to this

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.180 
our left like that and it goes to this
because<00:02:59.360> it's<00:02:59.540> being<00:02:59.780> stretched<00:03:00.140> up<00:03:00.500> so<00:03:01.010> in

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
because it's being stretched up so in

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.540 
because it's being stretched up so in
one<00:03:01.459> simple<00:03:01.989> little<00:03:03.160> indication<00:03:04.160> you<00:03:04.370> can

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
one simple little indication you can

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.630 
one simple little indication you can
actually<00:03:04.760> show<00:03:05.330> that<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.920> arm<00:03:07.130> is<00:03:07.340> raised

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
actually show that the arm is raised

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.710 
actually show that the arm is raised
which<00:03:08.209> gives<00:03:08.480> it<00:03:08.690> a<00:03:08.810> feeling<00:03:09.380> of<00:03:09.470> action<00:03:10.720> so

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
which gives it a feeling of action so

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.110 
which gives it a feeling of action so
just<00:03:11.989> by<00:03:12.110> making<00:03:12.319> that<00:03:12.500> nipple<00:03:12.980> that<00:03:13.160> way<00:03:13.400> you

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
just by making that nipple that way you

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.490 
just by making that nipple that way you
know<00:03:14.239> this<00:03:14.480> nipple<00:03:14.870> this<00:03:15.230> way<00:03:17.170> you<00:03:18.170> know<00:03:18.290> and

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
know this nipple this way you know and

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.009 
know this nipple this way you know and
again<00:03:18.650> what<00:03:19.549> I'm<00:03:19.670> trying<00:03:20.060> to<00:03:20.150> do<00:03:20.390> is<00:03:20.690> something

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
again what I'm trying to do is something

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.460 
again what I'm trying to do is something
you<00:03:21.380> know<00:03:21.500> very<00:03:21.530> very<00:03:22.069> simple<00:03:22.880> and<00:03:23.180> fast<00:03:23.480> you

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
you know very very simple and fast you

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.080 
you know very very simple and fast you
know<00:03:24.590> obviously<00:03:25.069> I'm<00:03:25.280> talking<00:03:25.670> about<00:03:25.730> it<00:03:25.970> so

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
know obviously I'm talking about it so

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.330 
know obviously I'm talking about it so
it's<00:03:26.209> taking<00:03:26.540> longer<00:03:26.750> but<00:03:27.290> if<00:03:27.410> I<00:03:27.530> was<00:03:27.830> doing<00:03:28.190> it

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
it's taking longer but if I was doing it

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.199 
it's taking longer but if I was doing it
in<00:03:28.400> two<00:03:28.580> minutes

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
in two minutes

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.150 
in two minutes
you<00:03:29.690> know<00:03:29.780> you'd<00:03:29.959> be<00:03:29.989> trying<00:03:30.500> to<00:03:30.680> just<00:03:30.920> capture

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
you know you'd be trying to just capture

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.640 
you know you'd be trying to just capture
the<00:03:31.459> absolute<00:03:32.120> essence<00:03:32.540> of<00:03:32.690> it<00:03:32.840> so<00:03:33.349> the<00:03:33.470> first

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
the absolute essence of it so the first

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:41.789 
the absolute essence of it so the first
thing<00:03:33.799> is<00:03:34.040> really<00:03:34.069> dealing<00:03:34.580> with<00:03:34.730> that<00:03:35.030> torso

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.559 

see<00:03:42.799> and<00:03:42.950> then<00:03:43.159> you<00:03:43.189> can<00:03:43.549> do<00:03:43.730> all<00:03:43.969> the<00:03:44.180> ins<00:03:44.359> and

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
see and then you can do all the ins and

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.360 
see and then you can do all the ins and
outs<00:03:44.780> you<00:03:45.230> know<00:03:45.349> so<00:03:45.530> that<00:03:45.709> then<00:03:45.859> when<00:03:46.040> you<00:03:46.129> have

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
outs you know so that then when you have

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.780 
outs you know so that then when you have
more<00:03:46.609> time<00:03:46.670> you<00:03:47.450> can<00:03:47.930> get<00:03:48.200> a<00:03:48.620> little<00:03:49.549> more

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
more time you can get a little more

00:03:49.790 --> 00:04:00.510 
more time you can get a little more
specific<00:03:50.299> about<00:03:50.959> it

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.120 

and<00:04:00.610> make<00:04:01.450> some<00:04:01.810> Corrections<00:04:02.470> you<00:04:02.650> know<00:04:02.890> where

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
and make some Corrections you know where

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.620 
and make some Corrections you know where
you<00:04:03.310> have<00:04:03.490> something<00:04:03.970> not<00:04:04.180> where<00:04:04.480> it's

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
you have something not where it's

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:16.620 
you have something not where it's
supposed<00:04:04.720> to<00:04:05.050> be

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:24.830 

the<00:04:17.630> foot<00:04:17.959> is<00:04:18.170> a<00:04:18.200> basic<00:04:18.739> wedge

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.730 

and<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.530> one<00:04:25.980> thing<00:04:26.190> to<00:04:26.520> the<00:04:27.050> that<00:04:28.050> we<00:04:28.200> know<00:04:28.440> is

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
and the one thing to the that we know is

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.290 
and the one thing to the that we know is
that<00:04:28.770> even<00:04:29.220> when<00:04:29.310> you<00:04:29.460> just<00:04:29.639> have<00:04:29.910> a<00:04:29.940> line

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
that even when you just have a line

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.600 
that even when you just have a line
there<00:04:30.630> you<00:04:31.050> know<00:04:31.169> we<00:04:31.470> we<00:04:31.980> know<00:04:32.190> that<00:04:32.370> we<00:04:32.460> have

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
there you know we we know that we have

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.090 
there you know we we know that we have
two<00:04:32.820> legs<00:04:33.060> we<00:04:33.330> know<00:04:33.480> we<00:04:33.600> have<00:04:33.780> two<00:04:33.990> arms<00:04:34.440> no<00:04:34.889> if

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
two legs we know we have two arms no if

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.100 
two legs we know we have two arms no if
you<00:04:35.250> worry<00:04:35.490> too<00:04:35.730> much<00:04:35.760> about<00:04:35.940> some<00:04:36.570> things<00:04:36.870> it

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
you worry too much about some things it

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.680 
you worry too much about some things it
takes<00:04:37.260> away<00:04:37.560> from<00:04:37.590> all<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.940> time<00:04:39.180> and<00:04:39.360> energy

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
takes away from all the time and energy

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.300 
takes away from all the time and energy
you<00:04:40.110> have<00:04:40.290> with<00:04:40.500> other<00:04:40.680> things<00:04:41.040> that<00:04:41.220> are

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
important so if I just kept that like

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.159 
important so if I just kept that like
that<00:04:44.669> for<00:04:44.970> a<00:04:45.000> gesture<00:04:45.480> we<00:04:45.690> would<00:04:45.840> know<00:04:45.990> it<00:04:46.080> was

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
that for a gesture we would know it was

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:54.040 
that for a gesture we would know it was
a<00:04:46.230> leg

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.110
