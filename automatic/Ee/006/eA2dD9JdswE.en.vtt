00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.280 

I've<00:00:05.069> prepared<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.819> landscape<00:00:06.480> which<00:00:07.080> is<00:00:07.259> a

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
I've prepared a landscape which is a

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.549 
I've prepared a landscape which is a
marsh<00:00:07.680> of<00:00:07.980> fresh<00:00:08.760> water<00:00:09.059> in<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.450> front<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:09.960> a

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
marsh of fresh water in the front and a

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.509 
marsh of fresh water in the front and a
green<00:00:11.010> field<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.820> grass<00:00:12.120> I've<00:00:12.990> basically

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519 
green field of grass I've basically

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.970 
green field of grass I've basically
added<00:00:14.519> fields<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.450> color<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.080> now<00:00:16.410> I'm<00:00:16.650> going

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
added fields of color and now I'm going

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.769 
added fields of color and now I'm going
to<00:00:17.279> add<00:00:17.670> these<00:00:18.539> strands<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.500> grass<00:00:19.710> there<00:00:20.400> are

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
to add these strands of grass there are

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.740 
to add these strands of grass there are
literally<00:00:21.779> endless<00:00:22.730> strands<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.850> grass<00:00:24.000> so

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
literally endless strands of grass so

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.170 
literally endless strands of grass so
I'm<00:00:24.869> not<00:00:25.080> necessarily<00:00:25.890> going<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.189> draw<00:00:26.460> every

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
I'm not necessarily going to draw every

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.019 
I'm not necessarily going to draw every
strand<00:00:27.630> what<00:00:28.349> I'm<00:00:28.529> going<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.830> do<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.279> just<00:00:29.730> draw

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
strand what I'm going to do is just draw

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.229 
strand what I'm going to do is just draw
enough<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.990> them<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.890> show<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.610> grass

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
enough of them to show that it is grass

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.049 
enough of them to show that it is grass
so<00:00:34.140> I'm<00:00:34.230> going<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.530> be<00:00:34.649> using<00:00:34.800> color<00:00:35.399> pastels

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
so I'm going to be using color pastels

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.190 
so I'm going to be using color pastels
and<00:00:36.360> then<00:00:36.840> basically<00:00:37.620> making<00:00:38.780> somewhat<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.989> a

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
and then basically making somewhat of a

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.740 
and then basically making somewhat of a
straight<00:00:40.559> line<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:41.670> let<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.210> go<00:00:42.360> free

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
straight line and I just let it go free

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.900 
straight line and I just let it go free
at<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.079> top<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:43.739> it's<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.160> type<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.489> motion

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
at the top so it's this type of motion

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.510 
at the top so it's this type of motion
I'm<00:00:45.239> flicking<00:00:45.840> my<00:00:46.050> wrist<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.800> I'm<00:00:47.039> just<00:00:47.309> going

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
I'm flicking my wrist and I'm just going

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.299 
I'm flicking my wrist and I'm just going
to<00:00:47.610> do<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.149> some<00:00:48.570> areas<00:00:49.110> enough<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:51.449> show

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
to do it in some areas enough so to show

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.389 
to do it in some areas enough so to show
that<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.460> fact<00:00:53.750> it<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.840> grass<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:56.039> all<00:00:56.250> you

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
that in fact it is grass so all you

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.510 
that in fact it is grass so all you
really<00:00:56.699> have<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.000> do<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.690> show<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:58.920> certain

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
really have to do is show it in certain

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.950 
really have to do is show it in certain
areas<00:01:00.030> like<00:01:00.750> little<00:01:01.250> concentrated<00:01:02.250> areas<00:01:02.960> you

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
areas like little concentrated areas you

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.859 
areas like little concentrated areas you
don't<00:01:04.199> have<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.880> spend<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.240> rest<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.689> your

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
don't have to spend the rest of your

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.440 
don't have to spend the rest of your
life<00:01:07.020> drawing<00:01:07.530> every<00:01:07.979> strand<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.490> grass<00:01:08.760> so

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
life drawing every strand of grass so

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.250 
life drawing every strand of grass so
I'm<00:01:09.689> using<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.760> basic<00:01:11.760> shade<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.390> green<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.900> now

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
I'm using a basic shade of green and now

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.140 
I'm using a basic shade of green and now
I'm<00:01:13.439> going<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.799> come<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.189> with<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.760> lighter

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
I'm going to come in with a lighter

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.330 
I'm going to come in with a lighter
shade<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.509> green<00:01:15.869> because<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.770> light<00:01:17.040> is

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
shade of green because the light is

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.710 
shade of green because the light is
hitting<00:01:17.640> these<00:01:18.509> blades<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:19.140> grass<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:20.130> some<00:01:20.460> of

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
hitting these blades of grass so some of

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.859 
hitting these blades of grass so some of
what<00:01:21.720> we<00:01:21.869> see<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.439> darker<00:01:23.009> shade<00:01:23.720> some<00:01:24.720> of

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
what we see is a darker shade some of

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.859 
what we see is a darker shade some of
what<00:01:25.049> we<00:01:25.170> see<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.740> lighter<00:01:26.130> shade<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.869> some

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
what we see is a lighter shade and some

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.929 
what we see is a lighter shade and some
of<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.170> grass<00:01:28.380> comes<00:01:28.770> straight<00:01:29.310> into<00:01:29.820> the

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
of the grass comes straight into the

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.600 
of the grass comes straight into the
water<00:01:30.409> so<00:01:31.409> I'm<00:01:31.470> going<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.740> add<00:01:31.860> those<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.250> as

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
water so I'm going to add those in as

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.969 
water so I'm going to add those in as
well<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.119> again<00:01:33.570> it's<00:01:33.810> just<00:01:33.960> an<00:01:34.320> up-and-down

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
well and again it's just an up-and-down

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.460 
well and again it's just an up-and-down
movement<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:36.030> want<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.509> show<00:01:36.750> maybe<00:01:37.140> there's

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
movement I want to show maybe there's

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.300 
movement I want to show maybe there's
wind<00:01:37.890> blowing<00:01:38.430> or<00:01:38.729> some<00:01:39.390> motion<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.259> can<00:01:40.890> create

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
wind blowing or some motion I can create

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.450 
wind blowing or some motion I can create
that<00:01:41.640> as<00:01:41.880> well<00:01:42.119> they're<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:43.020> very<00:01:43.409> fine<00:01:43.979> fine

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
that as well they're just very fine fine

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.990 
that as well they're just very fine fine
lines<00:01:44.850> with<00:01:45.659> pastel<00:01:46.350> if<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.430> make<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> mistake

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
lines with pastel if you make a mistake

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.969 
lines with pastel if you make a mistake
or<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.600> put<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:48.960> on<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> color<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.770> don't

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
or you put it on a color that you don't

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.190 
or you put it on a color that you don't
like<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.790> can<00:01:50.820> always<00:01:51.360> wipe<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.840> right<00:01:52.020> out

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
like you can always wipe it right out

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.010 
like you can always wipe it right out
and<00:01:52.409> with<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.979> marsh<00:01:53.399> there's<00:01:54.000> actual<00:01:54.509> grass

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
and with the marsh there's actual grass

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.679 
and with the marsh there's actual grass
growing<00:01:55.710> out<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.549> water<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:57.390> I'm<00:01:57.540> gonna

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
growing out of the water so I'm gonna

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.030 
growing out of the water so I'm gonna
add<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.290> as<00:01:58.560> well

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
again doesn't have to be solid solid

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.310 
again doesn't have to be solid solid
lines<00:02:01.829> but<00:02:02.250> just<00:02:02.460> these<00:02:02.640> touches<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:04.020> I'm

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
lines but just these touches and I'm

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.540 
lines but just these touches and I'm
going<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.619> continue<00:02:05.009> this

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
going to continue this

with the lighter greens and now instead
of<00:02:13.270> just<00:02:13.450> one<00:02:14.050> straight<00:02:14.500> line

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
of just one straight line

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.880 
of just one straight line
I'm<00:02:15.100> almost<00:02:15.790> making<00:02:16.030> little<00:02:16.480> dashes<00:02:16.870> just<00:02:17.710> to

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
I'm almost making little dashes just to

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.640 
I'm almost making little dashes just to
show<00:02:18.190> that<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:19.300> strands<00:02:19.720> of<00:02:20.020> grass<00:02:20.320> the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
show that the strands of grass the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.570 
show that the strands of grass the
blades<00:02:21.070> of<00:02:21.370> grass<00:02:21.550> growing<00:02:22.510> out<00:02:22.780> of<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:23.110> water

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
blades of grass growing out of the water

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.520 
blades of grass growing out of the water
actually<00:02:24.580> have<00:02:25.360> different<00:02:25.600> highlights<00:02:26.200> and

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
actually have different highlights and

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.330 
actually have different highlights and
then<00:02:27.040> if<00:02:27.250> I<00:02:27.430> want<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:28.270> show<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:29.040> specific<00:02:30.040> area

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
then if I want to show a specific area

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.020 
then if I want to show a specific area
that<00:02:30.970> has<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.170> concentrated<00:02:32.170> color<00:02:32.440> of<00:02:32.710> grass

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
that has a concentrated color of grass

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.420 
that has a concentrated color of grass
again<00:02:34.030> I<00:02:34.180> can<00:02:34.390> just<00:02:34.420> use<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.260> side<00:02:35.530> of<00:02:35.860> my

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
again I can just use the side of my

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.120 
again I can just use the side of my
charcoal<00:02:36.970> or<00:02:37.240> the<00:02:37.540> tip<00:02:37.810> I'm<00:02:38.050> using<00:02:38.710> the<00:02:38.950> tip

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
charcoal or the tip I'm using the tip

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.120 
charcoal or the tip I'm using the tip
right<00:02:39.430> now<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:39.940> in<00:02:40.300> a<00:02:40.390> very<00:02:40.600> fast<00:02:41.230> up-and-down

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
right now and in a very fast up-and-down

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.930 
right now and in a very fast up-and-down
motion<00:02:42.960> almost<00:02:43.960> scribbling<00:02:44.950> right<00:02:45.550> through

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
motion almost scribbling right through

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.410 
motion almost scribbling right through
the<00:02:46.060> area<00:02:46.450> to<00:02:47.380> show<00:02:47.650> a<00:02:47.680> sense<00:02:48.010> of<00:02:48.190> grass<00:02:48.460> I'm

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
the area to show a sense of grass I'm

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.560 
the area to show a sense of grass I'm
now<00:02:49.750> going<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.200> use<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.680> pencil<00:02:50.980> I'm<00:02:51.280> using<00:02:51.310> a<00:02:51.700> 6b

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
now going to use a pencil I'm using a 6b

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.710 
now going to use a pencil I'm using a 6b
pencil<00:02:52.960> and<00:02:53.680> I'm<00:02:54.250> going<00:02:54.550> to<00:02:54.760> use<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.480> pencil

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
pencil and I'm going to use the pencil

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.980 
pencil and I'm going to use the pencil
and<00:02:56.140> draw<00:02:56.440> into<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.280> water<00:02:57.490> I<00:02:57.850> want<00:02:58.600> to<00:02:58.720> show

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
and draw into the water I want to show

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.610 
and draw into the water I want to show
that<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.890> grass<00:03:00.190> above<00:03:00.970> is<00:03:01.380> reflecting<00:03:02.380> in

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
that the grass above is reflecting in

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.550 
that the grass above is reflecting in
the<00:03:02.650> water<00:03:03.010> there's<00:03:03.490> a<00:03:03.550> shadow<00:03:03.880> being<00:03:04.300> cast<00:03:04.560> so

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
the water there's a shadow being cast so

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.770 
the water there's a shadow being cast so
you<00:03:05.620> could<00:03:05.890> use<00:03:06.070> pastel<00:03:06.700> I'm<00:03:06.940> going<00:03:07.390> to<00:03:07.570> use<00:03:07.750> a

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
you could use pastel I'm going to use a

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.500 
you could use pastel I'm going to use a
pencil<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:08.770> you<00:03:09.130> have<00:03:09.280> all<00:03:09.640> these<00:03:09.910> really

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
pencil and you have all these really

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.070 
pencil and you have all these really
beautiful<00:03:10.750> long<00:03:11.470> lines<00:03:12.040> that<00:03:13.000> intersect<00:03:13.239> and

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
beautiful long lines that intersect and

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.710 
beautiful long lines that intersect and
intertwine<00:03:14.800> and<00:03:15.160> it<00:03:15.430> really<00:03:15.670> shows<00:03:16.150> that<00:03:16.600> the

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
intertwine and it really shows that the

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.650 
intertwine and it really shows that the
grass<00:03:16.989> is<00:03:17.320> reflecting<00:03:18.100> in<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.310> water<00:03:18.670> I<00:03:19.030> don't

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
grass is reflecting in the water I don't

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.750 
grass is reflecting in the water I don't
have<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:20.110> go<00:03:20.320> everywhere<00:03:20.950> with<00:03:21.160> it<00:03:21.520> I<00:03:21.550> don't

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
have to go everywhere with it I don't

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.690 
have to go everywhere with it I don't
have<00:03:22.239> to<00:03:22.360> draw<00:03:22.570> every<00:03:23.200> single<00:03:23.620> line<00:03:23.830> but<00:03:24.580> I'm

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
have to draw every single line but I'm

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.810 
have to draw every single line but I'm
going<00:03:24.940> to<00:03:25.000> draw<00:03:25.270> enough<00:03:26.200> of<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:26.680> lines<00:03:26.920> so

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
going to draw enough of the lines so

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.180 
going to draw enough of the lines so
that<00:03:27.850> you<00:03:28.090> really<00:03:28.510> get<00:03:28.690> a<00:03:28.720> sense<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:29.920> this<00:03:30.130> is

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
that you really get a sense that this is

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.000 
that you really get a sense that this is
in<00:03:30.610> fact<00:03:30.640> grass<00:03:31.390> so<00:03:32.050> you<00:03:32.140> can<00:03:32.410> see<00:03:32.680> that<00:03:32.860> you

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
in fact grass so you can see that you

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.699 
in fact grass so you can see that you
can<00:03:33.190> combine<00:03:33.430> drawing<00:03:34.209> materials<00:03:34.959> you<00:03:35.530> don't

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
can combine drawing materials you don't

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.880 
can combine drawing materials you don't
only<00:03:36.010> have<00:03:36.250> to<00:03:36.580> stick<00:03:36.850> to<00:03:37.060> one<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:38.290> can<00:03:38.470> use<00:03:38.680> as

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
only have to stick to one you can use as

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.010 
only have to stick to one you can use as
many<00:03:39.100> different<00:03:39.430> materials<00:03:39.760> as<00:03:40.390> you<00:03:40.420> want<00:03:40.780> and

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
many different materials as you want and

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.740 
many different materials as you want and
allow<00:03:41.709> them<00:03:42.040> to<00:03:42.580> work<00:03:42.790> together<00:03:43.060> so<00:03:43.540> just

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
allow them to work together so just

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.830 
allow them to work together so just
within<00:03:44.410> this<00:03:44.680> reflection<00:03:45.220> these<00:03:46.060> very<00:03:46.480> simple

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
within this reflection these very simple

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.000 
within this reflection these very simple
lines<00:03:47.230> I'm<00:03:47.470> basically<00:03:47.920> just<00:03:48.040> doing<00:03:48.430> this<00:03:50.010> so

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
lines I'm basically just doing this so

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.860 
lines I'm basically just doing this so
when<00:03:51.160> I<00:03:51.190> do<00:03:51.340> that<00:03:51.700> right<00:03:52.030> in<00:03:52.270> the<00:03:52.420> water

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
when I do that right in the water

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.790 
when I do that right in the water
it<00:03:53.140> gives<00:03:53.680> it<00:03:53.860> a<00:03:54.010> feeling<00:03:54.370> of<00:03:54.900> grass<00:03:55.900> and<00:03:56.290> grass

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
it gives it a feeling of grass and grass

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.729 
it gives it a feeling of grass and grass
being<00:03:57.250> reflected<00:03:57.910> if<00:03:58.239> I<00:03:58.510> wanted<00:03:58.900> to<00:03:59.170> I<00:03:59.410> could

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
being reflected if I wanted to I could

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.070 
being reflected if I wanted to I could
continue<00:04:00.160> this<00:04:00.489> drawing<00:04:00.910> I<00:04:01.209> would<00:04:01.600> continue

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
continue this drawing I would continue

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.070 
continue this drawing I would continue
with<00:04:03.070> some<00:04:03.310> of<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.580> reflections<00:04:04.269> and<00:04:04.720> I<00:04:04.959> would

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
with some of the reflections and I would

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.699 
with some of the reflections and I would
continue<00:04:05.470> drawing<00:04:05.860> more<00:04:06.190> and<00:04:06.459> more<00:04:06.850> detail

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
continue drawing more and more detail

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.320 
continue drawing more and more detail
the<00:04:08.709> last<00:04:08.980> thing<00:04:09.340> that<00:04:09.370> I'm<00:04:09.610> going<00:04:09.850> to<00:04:09.940> do<00:04:10.150> is

the last thing that I'm going to do is

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.540 
the last thing that I'm going to do is
going<00:04:10.450> to<00:04:10.510> take<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:10.989> brown<00:04:11.440> piece<00:04:11.830> of<00:04:12.040> charcoal

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
going to take a brown piece of charcoal

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.200 
going to take a brown piece of charcoal
and<00:04:12.820> in<00:04:13.480> the<00:04:13.600> top<00:04:13.930> area<00:04:14.290> this<00:04:15.040> yellow<00:04:15.670> field<00:04:16.030> of

grass I'm just going to hint
add<00:04:19.109> some<00:04:19.879> little<00:04:20.879> pieces<00:04:21.299> of<00:04:22.550> thicker<00:04:23.550> or

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.100 
darker grass showing in the background
in<00:04:27.509> the<00:04:28.199> distance<00:04:29.389> so<00:04:30.389> again<00:04:30.599> I'm<00:04:30.720> using<00:04:30.810> the

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
in the distance so again I'm using the

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.559 
in the distance so again I'm using the
tip<00:04:31.349> of<00:04:31.379> my<00:04:31.530> charcoal<00:04:32.220> I'm<00:04:32.490> making<00:04:33.180> just<00:04:33.389> a

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:33.569 
tip of my charcoal I'm making just a

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:36.649 
tip of my charcoal I'm making just a
very<00:04:34.050> gentle<00:04:34.530> upward<00:04:35.009> line<00:04:35.520> there's<00:04:36.150> an<00:04:36.300> area

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:36.659 
very gentle upward line there's an area

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:38.629 
very gentle upward line there's an area
here<00:04:37.050> where<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.409> grass<00:04:37.620> is<00:04:37.680> blowing<00:04:38.490> in<00:04:38.610> the

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
here where the grass is blowing in the

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:39.140 
here where the grass is blowing in the
wind

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
wind

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.830 
wind
so<00:04:39.750> I'll<00:04:39.930> allow<00:04:40.259> it<00:04:40.470> to<00:04:40.680> move<00:04:41.039> and<00:04:41.810> have<00:04:42.810> a

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
so I'll allow it to move and have a

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.830 
so I'll allow it to move and have a
little<00:04:43.080> more<00:04:43.349> motion<00:04:43.949> I<00:04:44.159> can<00:04:44.729> take<00:04:45.180> my<00:04:45.389> finger

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
little more motion I can take my finger

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.360 
little more motion I can take my finger
I'm<00:04:46.020> not<00:04:46.289> rubbing<00:04:46.710> it<00:04:47.009> in

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
I'm not rubbing it in

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.089 
I'm not rubbing it in
but<00:04:47.520> I'm<00:04:47.639> dabbing<00:04:48.060> it<00:04:48.560> just<00:04:49.560> so<00:04:49.740> that<00:04:49.949> the

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
but I'm dabbing it just so that the

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:54.710 
but I'm dabbing it just so that the
lines<00:04:50.340> are<00:04:50.729> not<00:04:51.110> too<00:04:52.110> too<00:04:52.380> detailed<00:04:53.389> my<00:04:54.389> last

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
lines are not too too detailed my last

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.529 
lines are not too too detailed my last
step<00:04:55.110> is<00:04:55.409> I'm<00:04:56.099> just<00:04:56.130> going<00:04:56.759> to<00:04:56.849> move<00:04:57.150> through

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
step is I'm just going to move through

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.719 
step is I'm just going to move through
the<00:04:57.720> drawing<00:04:58.020> because<00:04:58.680> there<00:04:59.099> are<00:04:59.190> some<00:04:59.430> areas

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
the drawing because there are some areas

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.210 
the drawing because there are some areas
that<00:04:59.940> are<00:05:00.270> much<00:05:00.449> darker<00:05:00.780> and<00:05:01.380> so<00:05:01.770> within<00:05:01.979> the

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
that are much darker and so within the

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.740 
that are much darker and so within the
grass<00:05:02.460> I'm<00:05:02.759> just<00:05:02.970> going<00:05:03.210> to<00:05:03.270> use<00:05:03.479> some<00:05:03.509> black

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
grass I'm just going to use some black

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.820 
grass I'm just going to use some black
and<00:05:04.409> I'm<00:05:04.979> gonna<00:05:05.130> bring<00:05:05.490> that<00:05:05.550> black<00:05:06.180> right<00:05:06.659> in

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
and I'm gonna bring that black right in

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.040 
and I'm gonna bring that black right in
again<00:05:07.830> this<00:05:08.759> up-and-down<00:05:09.270> motion<00:05:09.599> like

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
again this up-and-down motion like

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.249 
again this up-and-down motion like
strands<00:05:10.530> of<00:05:10.800> grass<00:05:10.979> just<00:05:11.849> to<00:05:12.090> show<00:05:12.360> that<00:05:12.659> sense

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:13.259 
strands of grass just to show that sense

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:15.589 
strands of grass just to show that sense
of<00:05:13.409> dimension<00:05:13.710> and<00:05:14.280> depth<00:05:14.969> and<00:05:15.180> then<00:05:15.509> I'm

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:15.599 
of dimension and depth and then I'm

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:17.839 
of dimension and depth and then I'm
going<00:05:15.780> to<00:05:15.810> rub<00:05:16.050> it<00:05:16.080> in<00:05:16.289> slightly<00:05:16.860> now<00:05:17.490> this<00:05:17.699> is

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
going to rub it in slightly now this is

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.529 
going to rub it in slightly now this is
how<00:05:18.000> I<00:05:18.030> would<00:05:18.240> start<00:05:18.810> I<00:05:19.280> would<00:05:20.280> probably

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
how I would start I would probably

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:23.180 
how I would start I would probably
continue<00:05:21.539> on<00:05:21.719> with<00:05:21.990> this<00:05:22.110> drawing<00:05:22.469> I<00:05:22.830> would

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
continue on with this drawing I would

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.459 
continue on with this drawing I would
continue<00:05:23.550> bringing<00:05:24.060> in<00:05:24.210> more<00:05:24.509> color<00:05:24.900> I<00:05:25.259> would

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:25.469 
continue bringing in more color I would

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:28.040 
continue bringing in more color I would
continue<00:05:25.979> bringing<00:05:26.490> in<00:05:26.669> more<00:05:27.330> strands<00:05:27.810> of

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
continue bringing in more strands of

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.640 
continue bringing in more strands of
grass<00:05:28.199> I<00:05:28.560> would<00:05:28.740> continue<00:05:29.130> bringing<00:05:29.699> in<00:05:29.909> an

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
grass I would continue bringing in an

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.649 
grass I would continue bringing in an
overlapping<00:05:31.650> of<00:05:32.039> colors<00:05:32.580> and<00:05:32.969> an<00:05:33.060> overlapping

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:33.659 
overlapping of colors and an overlapping

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:37.129 
overlapping of colors and an overlapping
of<00:05:34.430> all<00:05:35.430> of<00:05:35.819> these<00:05:35.940> different<00:05:36.389> elements<00:05:36.539> and

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139 
of all of these different elements and

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:39.399 
of all of these different elements and
the<00:05:37.380> drawing<00:05:37.680> but<00:05:38.340> I've<00:05:38.520> gotten<00:05:38.880> far<00:05:39.270> enough

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:39.409 
the drawing but I've gotten far enough

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:43.420 
the drawing but I've gotten far enough
to<00:05:40.409> show<00:05:40.680> this<00:05:41.520> sense<00:05:41.849> of<00:05:42.120> grass<00:05:42.479> and<00:05:42.900> to<00:05:43.110> show

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
to show this sense of grass and to show

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.999 
to show this sense of grass and to show
how<00:05:44.430> one<00:05:44.759> would<00:05:45.419> draw<00:05:45.659> grass<00:05:45.990> in<00:05:46.349> your<00:05:46.860> own

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 
how one would draw grass in your own

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:49.580 
how one would draw grass in your own
drawing<00:05:47.400> I<00:05:47.639> would<00:05:47.880> suggest<00:05:48.120> continuing<00:05:49.110> for

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
drawing I would suggest continuing for

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.010 
drawing I would suggest continuing for
as<00:05:49.710> long<00:05:50.009> as<00:05:50.069> you<00:05:50.490> want<00:05:50.699> and<00:05:51.020> continuing

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
as long as you want and continuing

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.939 
as long as you want and continuing
perhaps<00:05:52.500> to<00:05:53.159> integrate<00:05:53.759> pencil<00:05:54.659> into<00:05:55.139> pastel

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:55.949 
perhaps to integrate pencil into pastel

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:58.909 
perhaps to integrate pencil into pastel
so<00:05:56.430> that<00:05:56.610> you<00:05:56.699> can<00:05:56.909> really<00:05:57.270> show<00:05:57.919> this

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
so that you can really show this

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:01.670 
so that you can really show this
movement<00:05:59.669> of<00:05:59.849> grass<00:06:00.509> throughout<00:06:01.289> your<00:06:01.469> whole

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
movement of grass throughout your whole

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.969 
movement of grass throughout your whole
drawing<00:06:02.009> most<00:06:02.789> importantly<00:06:03.509> enjoy<00:06:03.979> the

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
drawing most importantly enjoy the

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.219 
drawing most importantly enjoy the
process
