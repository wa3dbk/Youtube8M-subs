00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.259
 You talk about how you are every day. 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.570
 day so each contended 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.149
 formats and talks about something you 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.580

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.110
 very cool, I'm doing 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.020

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.870
 very cool and the strong fiber going and a 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.230

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.230
 with him because he talks about anorexia me and 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.240

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.640

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.400
