00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:25.910 
building that can help us out so when we
wanted<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.930> develop<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.260> good<00:00:25.380> carbon<00:00:25.650> bike<00:00:25.740> we

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
wanted to develop a good carbon bike we

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.099 
wanted to develop a good carbon bike we
when<00:00:26.189> we<00:00:26.220> said<00:00:26.400> hey<00:00:26.430> meant<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:27.630> you're<00:00:27.990> the

back through here what do you want out
of<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.730> new<00:00:30.179> cyclocross<00:00:30.840> bike<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.769> said<00:00:32.009> I'd

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
of a new cyclocross bike you said I'd

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.870 
of a new cyclocross bike you said I'd
like<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.360> tarmac<00:00:33.899> for<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.230> dirt<00:00:34.440> right<00:00:35.190> so

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
like that a tarmac for the dirt right so

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.580 
like that a tarmac for the dirt right so
then<00:00:36.030> we<00:00:36.149> said<00:00:36.420> all<00:00:37.079> right<00:00:37.200> well<00:00:37.320> let's<00:00:37.469> be

in the back room as well what do you
want<00:00:41.370> out<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.760> cyclocross<00:00:42.210> bike<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.780> Todd

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
want out of a cyclocross bike and Todd

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.110 
want out of a cyclocross bike and Todd
you<00:00:43.230> said<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.680> kind<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.309> like<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.489> tarmac<00:00:44.879> for<00:00:45.030> the

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
out of a cyclocross bike and he said and

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.139 
out of a cyclocross bike and he said and
no<00:00:58.590> one<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.010> room<00:00:59.039> spoke<00:00:59.460> check<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.030> we

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
no one in the room spoke check so we

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.670 
no one in the room spoke check so we
just<00:01:00.300> nodded<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.930> went<00:01:01.109> ahead<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.410> we<00:01:01.500> build

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
just nodded and went ahead and we build

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.100 
just nodded and went ahead and we build
a<00:01:01.739> tarmac<00:01:02.039> for<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.280> dirt<00:01:03.080> introducing<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
a tarmac for the dirt introducing the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.990 
a tarmac for the dirt introducing the
new<00:01:04.290> carbon<00:01:04.680> crops<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.580> cool<00:01:05.790> thing<00:01:05.820> here

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
new carbon crops and the cool thing here

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.929 
new carbon crops and the cool thing here
is<00:01:06.240> it's<00:01:06.390> not<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.540> one<00:01:07.020> bite<00:01:07.260> it's<00:01:08.040> too<00:01:08.400> we've

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
is it's not just one bite it's too we've

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.580 
is it's not just one bite it's too we've
gone<00:01:09.150> through<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.659> we've<00:01:09.689> made<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> disc<00:01:10.350> bike

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
gone through and we've made a disc bike

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.030 
gone through and we've made a disc bike
as<00:01:10.799> well<00:01:11.220> as<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:12.140> brand-new<00:01:13.140> cantilever<00:01:13.740> bike

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
as well as a brand-new cantilever bike

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.920 
as well as a brand-new cantilever bike
so<00:01:14.549> we're<00:01:14.820> really<00:01:15.000> focusing<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:15.720> bringing

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
so we're really focusing on bringing

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.289 
so we're really focusing on bringing
that<00:01:16.170> complete<00:01:16.770> line<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.820> complete<00:01:18.119> line

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
that complete line that complete line

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.840 
that complete line that complete line
speaks<00:01:18.630> through<00:01:18.930> carbon<00:01:19.290> fiber<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:20.070> speaks

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
speaks through carbon fiber it speaks

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.249 
speaks through carbon fiber it speaks
through<00:01:21.119> aluminum<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.810> speaks<00:01:22.049> through

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
through aluminum it speaks through

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.620 
through aluminum it speaks through
everything<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.860> total<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.400> seven<00:01:23.820> sizes<00:01:24.210> in

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
everything a total of seven sizes in

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.859 
everything a total of seven sizes in
each<00:01:25.020> frame<00:01:25.580> two<00:01:26.580> different<00:01:27.030> layups<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.720> the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
each frame two different layups in the

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.399 
each frame two different layups in the
carbon<00:01:28.229> bike<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:29.820> alloy<00:01:30.150> bikes<00:01:30.409> two

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
carbon bike and the alloy bikes two

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.140 
carbon bike and the alloy bikes two
different<00:01:31.740> brake<00:01:31.890> options<00:01:32.310> cantilever<00:01:32.820> and

different brake options cantilever and

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.289 
different brake options cantilever and
this<00:01:33.770> for<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> total<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.220> forty<00:01:35.610> two<00:01:35.850> frames

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
this for a total of forty two frames

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.880 
this for a total of forty two frames
fortunately<00:01:37.020> mark<00:01:37.229> schroeder<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.590> out<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
fortunately mark schroeder is out of the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.230 
fortunately mark schroeder is out of the
room<00:01:38.040> because<00:01:38.250> he<00:01:38.369> doesn't<00:01:38.549> have<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.970> look<00:01:39.090> at

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
room because he doesn't have to look at

was design engineering on this on this
project<00:02:24.700> now<00:02:24.910> we<00:02:24.970> have<00:02:25.150> many<00:02:25.450> of<00:02:25.569> the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
project now we have many of the

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.210 
project now we have many of the
different<00:02:25.750> frames<00:02:26.080> here<00:02:26.380> we<00:02:26.800> can<00:02:26.920> pass<00:02:27.100> them

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
different frames here we can pass them

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.040 
different frames here we can pass them
round<00:02:27.430> will<00:02:27.550> have<00:02:27.670> them<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:27.850> trade<00:02:28.090> show<00:02:28.330> but<00:02:28.930> to

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
round will have them a trade show but to

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.270 
round will have them a trade show but to
be<00:02:29.080> clear<00:02:29.350> like<00:02:29.740> we<00:02:29.860> said<00:02:30.010> all<00:02:30.190> those

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
be clear like we said all those

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.550 
be clear like we said all those
