00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:22.839
 gentlemen so we started this 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:25.210
 final the blues please lurking 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:26.380
 and what do you make your life you 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.099
 spreads sabering laughter it's for 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.869
 clear the air 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.609
 because when the atmosphere is relaxed we 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.649
 feels good and everything becomes more 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.329
 pleasant 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:38.379
 it's for fun but I laugh 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:40.780
 not lurking what you doing when you 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.449
 do that I feel bad it creates a 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.000
 duality and the question is not 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.940
 follow do not follow me 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.890
 test 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.890
 the test has led to the confrontation that 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.199
 it does not depend on the atmosphere 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.589
 the reason all I see is a 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.690
 guy 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:01.480
 certainly a beautiful hairstyle but who speaks 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.609
 a lot 3 and mainly for not 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:08.070
 to say nothing you know what you're doing to me 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:11.020
 think a fat son of a palace bitch towards 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.670
 your mother your time you are here to 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.409
 distribute the cards to open your 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:20.170
 mouth your mother you were ok what's it 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.200
 this institute is there it looks like you 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.829
 try to invent a personality 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.810
 I have the impression that you are trying to 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:27.990
 do like edward norton in the movie 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.990
 the players 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.799
 norton antivirus the impression that you have 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.210
 something to hide when I send you 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.369
 as dirty but I tell myself that you bluff 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.600
 you do not have a good game yes then I you 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.520
 reminds that cartons not yet been 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.520
 distributed it's a truth 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.659
 I waited for my patience has limits 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.039
 picnic carpet thomas never had 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.549
 come on I have a game of football the picards 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:02.020
 have not even been distracted by the sea 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.560
 then I will distribute the cards 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.450
 role of shock it's now that the 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.479
 part starts 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:15.040
 absolutely there we have already passed the stage 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:17.760
 a simple skin part because now the 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.760
 true bluff can start 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.200
 i 'm doing what i'm doing yeah 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.160

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.939
