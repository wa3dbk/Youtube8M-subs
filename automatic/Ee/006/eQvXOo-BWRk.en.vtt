00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.380
 for all of you 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.660
 I'm going to start with these basic tips 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.030
 they are simple that I am going to give you 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.610
 practically the colors and now you go 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.640
 to take care of looking for a dress 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.200
 according to the recommendations that I give you 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.810
 you see and since you want to follow my 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.270
 ok tips first of all let's go to 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.640
 start with a classic black dress 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.290
 black that no woman looks bad at 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.990
 everyone looks good in black 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.890
 because black is elegance black is 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.780
 conservative 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.580
 Black can be sexy, there's no need 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.280
 also look for different types of fabric 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.320
 for example a black with lace can 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.710
 be very sexy very sensual on for 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.380
 poinsettia would be ideal a black with fabric 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.360
 very elegant silk also sexy to the 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.100
 there are blacks with sequins that 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.440
 have a ribbon or as it seems 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.240
 for the youngest girls who want 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.610
 nadir with brightness I also say for the 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.920
 older but I think that for the 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.990
 older I would leave them with lace with 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.780
 silk and the younger ones with a lot of brightness 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.080
 and all that whole roll you can not 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.270
 combine with accessories that make in 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.420
 contrast speaks to black for example 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.780
 white one red with black one looks a lot 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.700
 very elegant also that is one of 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.739
 the other recommendations would be 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.459
 unquestionably red not because the 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.349
 red is the color of Christmas and over there 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.140
 many people say that it brings good 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:26.200
 luck for the new year in love and 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.480
 all this well that a good option is 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.239
 the red for Christmas on Christmas Eve will be 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.310
 ideal and for new year if you believe in 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.709
 this of superstitions that red you 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.170
 brings love can be ideal red what 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.360
 You can combine with accessories 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.190
 You can wear some known tape 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.680
 some belt super thin in the 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.920
 waist that makes contrast to the dress 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.200
 either white or black can be 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.950
 a golden color will also come 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:57.819
 perfect the red color that fantastic 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.880
 now to receive the new year nothing 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.220
 better than a golden color not by much 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.620
 blin blinded a dress in golden color 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.510
 it would be perfect for 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.549
 dismiss the old year and receive the year 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.769
 new because they already know the new year is 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.739
 fireworks lights by all 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.110
 sides champagne and all this stuff like that 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.150
 that a golden color is perfect 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.000
 dress in golden color would be perfect 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.430
 for this occasion just make sure that if 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.740
 you choose to opt for 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.810
 a golden dress of what 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.210
 if you have sequins if you have a lot 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.740
 shine that you do not overdo it because 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.620
 take in to confuse with a sphere 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:40.310
 giant or Christmas tree and that 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.020
 we do not want to also recommend you and 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.820
 I do not recommend anything else god but 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.460
 the magazines that they see fashionable that if 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.100
 you choose a dress of this type of this 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.670
 golden color just make sure 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:56.000
 that it's a straight cut because if 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.190
 is a cut thug imagine gold jean 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.410
 Paul are going to appear now so a 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.320
 sphere of those Christmas giants and it 's 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.970
 what you least want to happen to you, not from 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.740
 you confused with the little tree 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.100
 large sphere so be very careful with 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.870
 that and a combination that to me 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.460
 loved it very much that is the one that 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.400
 more I love all the ones that I have 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:19.070
 given is a combination between red and 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.250
 golden you can choose to use a 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.620
 red dress and decorate yourself with some 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.220
 golden accessories for example a 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.190
 golden wallet 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.830
 a gold bracelet a gold necklace 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.120
 something for the golden hair the 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.220
 red and gold are going to make a 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.200
 perfect combination to dismiss the 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.490
 New year you can also use it in 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.840
 poinsettia would be ideal only a small 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.390
 in general in any of these 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.910
 clothes you choose or the one you already have 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.680
 you there take care of the accessories do not you 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.260
 overloads and accessories because the 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.440
 you see it would be something ugly you see something 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.690
 like it does not look very good when 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.700
 women are responsible for accessories are not 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.130
 puts these rings very popular today in 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.830
 Huge day is a big ring they put on 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.720
 a huge bracelet a big watch and 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.790
 then they put on the huge necklace and 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.850
 some big earrings and it's like you 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.560
 more 'that is, lower it if you want 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.830
 large projections that look very nice 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.410
 then choose not to put on a 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.440
 necklace stand perhaps a very talented 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.060
 small or a very small ring now if 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.730
 you want a very big ring so he opted 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.490
 for some very small earrings there is always 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.980
 have to balance that with the accessories 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.420
 they do not imitate much now either what 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:40.290
 as much as never the saint nor so much 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:44.400
 or something that you have to balance 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:46.980
