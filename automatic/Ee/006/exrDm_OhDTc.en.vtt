case we're going to set it up as

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.350 
case we're going to set it up as
Ethernet<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.430> that's<00:01:05.580> where<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.970> source<00:01:06.210> is

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
Ethernet so that's where the source is

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.210

coming<00:01:06.689> in<00:01:06.810> from<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.229> then<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:08.010> set<00:01:08.189> it

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
coming in from and then you can set it

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.310 
coming in from and then you can set it
up<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.430> how<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.700> want<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.090> broadcast<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.840> so

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
up to how you want to broadcast it so

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.660 
up to how you want to broadcast it so
we've<00:01:10.650> got<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.950> set<00:01:11.130> up<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.580> will
