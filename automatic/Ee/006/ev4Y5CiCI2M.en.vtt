00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:08.950
 and the Martians arrived already and arrived 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.780
 dancing the chachachá by not doing or we 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.790
 narrates how the Martians want 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.310
 seize the land because it's nice 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.529
 the blue color of your sky starts 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.810
 with a sweet princess ambassador whose 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.150
 desire is that earthlings and martians 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.740
 live in peace and we all know what they 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.740
 pass to those who want peace 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.980
 how 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.489
 the Martians themselves cause that attack 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.829
 as an excuse to start the 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.809
 confrontation the war is unleashed and the 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.559
 Martians fall to earth to 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.600
 pulverize typical people from the side of the 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.149
 humanity we have a guy who has the 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.399
 charisma of a door is the type I am a 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.890
 cock and I have no feelings because 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.899
 feelings are not trendy type 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.179
 door I studied in a place where they 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.399
 they teach how to drive gives me giant bots 

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:09.320
 to fight against the aliens and how the 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:11.360
 better soldiers have been annihilated 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.970
 obviously the only salvation are 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.200
 young students without experience in 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.240
 combat 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.429
 this is an anime that I expected neither from 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.890
 I'm an earthling but I live with the 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:23.890
 Martians is Mr. Piñata 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.730
 the piñata is with the aliens but not 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.220
 intends to harm his brothers 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.860
 where does it come from or where is it good or bad 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.320
 from ricolás or martian a princess 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.660
 great or people who do not know everything is 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.120
 difficult in the life of the good piñata and 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.190
 let's stop the man by not doing or is it a 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.080
 series made by the good ogre buzzi 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.240
 so you can expect a story 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.670
 full of destroyed ideals and minds 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.970
 gentiles discovering the cruelty of the 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.220
 lifetime 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.410
 the characters I can not tell if they are 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.690
 raised as it is early to know 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.210
 but in a certain way I find them 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.040
 interesting especially the piñata type 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.140
 has everything to give a good development 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.390
 of personality can become the 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.040
 hero or you can end up being a child of 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.260
 Whore seems to be a story of 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.690
 betrayals strategies and people 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.580
 turning hard something not very novel 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.280
 but always interesting to see in the 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.320
 music you are not water and it shows in these 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.300
 two chapters there is at least a part 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.620
 in which the music feels and is 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.720
 special 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.640
 look how good it is in I forgot 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.890
 mention the gender meca genre that 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.320
 usually does not call me too much and in 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.920
 I do not know what to think for the moment 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.650
 the robots 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.810
 and it does not feel like the center of 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.239
 everyone knows that for the moment no 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.220
 will take different designs with 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.650
 different skills and a robot that 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.720
 appears in a prophecy which only 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.610
 can handle the door type though 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.890
 I want to believe that a gucci will not go 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.319
 that side does not rule it out in the power of 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.330
 the figurines can more I would not tell them that 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.980
 is the gender revolution and may 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.750
 get worse instead of better or the 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.819
 question is that it is one of the two series 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.440
 with potential in the season these two 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.330
 chapters have not disappointed me and 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.160
 I really hope to see something beyond 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.290
 simple battles with robots until the 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.640
 moment is entertaining for what it is worth 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.640
 it's worth giving it a chance
