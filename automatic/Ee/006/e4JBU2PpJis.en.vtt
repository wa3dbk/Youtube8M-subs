more and more paint build builds up on

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.540 
more and more paint build builds up on
your<00:00:18.330> brush<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.869> start<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.650> impede<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.310> flow

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
your brush and start to impede the flow

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.890 
your brush and start to impede the flow
and<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.750> begins<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.590> really<00:00:22.769> become<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.160> mess

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
and it begins to really become a mess

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.970 
and it begins to really become a mess
now<00:00:24.900> for<00:00:25.140> some<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.470> out<00:00:25.500> there<00:00:25.590> who<00:00:25.949> have

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
now for some of you out there who have

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.250 
now for some of you out there who have
fingernails<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.000> such<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.510> can<00:00:27.689> simply<00:00:28.109> just

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
fingernails and such you can simply just

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.700 
fingernails and such you can simply just
pull<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.590> paint<00:00:29.160> right<00:00:30.090> off<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.510> tip<00:00:30.689> but<00:00:31.529> I

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
pull that paint right off the tip but I

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.860 
pull that paint right off the tip but I
prefer<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.489> use<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:33.680> old<00:00:34.680> toothbrush<00:00:35.750> so<00:00:36.750> he

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
prefer to use a old toothbrush so he

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.630 
prefer to use a old toothbrush so he
might<00:00:36.960> be<00:00:37.079> gone<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.260> long<00:00:37.410> big<00:00:37.980> whoop<00:00:38.190> big

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
might be gone a long big whoop big

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.819 
might be gone a long big whoop big
toothbrush<00:00:39.059> but<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.379> really<00:00:40.710> great

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
toothbrush but this is a really great

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.830 
toothbrush but this is a really great
way<00:00:41.070> now<00:00:41.489> it's<00:00:41.850> kind<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.090> funny<00:00:42.329> here<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.600> do<00:00:42.719> it

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
way now it's kind of funny here to do it

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.170 
way now it's kind of funny here to do it
on<00:00:42.930> camera<00:00:43.200> but<00:00:43.559> as<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.730> can<00:00:44.820> see<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.149> just

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
on camera but as you can see it just

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.770 
on camera but as you can see it just
simply<00:00:45.980> lightly<00:00:46.980> scrub<00:00:47.340> its<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.300> find<00:00:48.629> it

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
simply lightly scrub its I find it

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.450 
simply lightly scrub its I find it
better<00:00:49.020> than<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.649> know<00:00:49.770> trying<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.070> use<00:00:50.250> my

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
better than you know trying to use my

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.880 
better than you know trying to use my
fingertips<00:00:51.210> or<00:00:51.480> what<00:00:51.780> have<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.289> try<00:00:52.829> and

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
fingertips or what have you to try and

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.160 
fingertips or what have you to try and
pull<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.190> paint<00:00:53.370> off<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.180> as<00:00:54.600> long<00:00:54.809> as<00:00:54.840> you

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
pull the paint off and as long as you

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.799 
pull the paint off and as long as you
don't<00:00:55.879> apply<00:00:56.879> too<00:00:57.000> much<00:00:57.180> pressure<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.750> have

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
don't apply too much pressure you have

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.650 
don't apply too much pressure you have
you<00:00:58.109> don't<00:00:58.230> run<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.590> risk<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:59.359> bending<00:01:00.359> or

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
you don't run the risk of bending or

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.260 
you don't run the risk of bending or
damaging<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.199> needle<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:02.489> course<00:01:02.730> you

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
damaging the needle and of course you

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.660 
damaging the needle and of course you
just<00:01:03.510> simply<00:01:03.780> really<00:01:04.500> quickly<00:01:04.799> draw<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.519> off

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
just simply really quickly draw it off

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.480 
just simply really quickly draw it off
and<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.240> see<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.659> now<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.590> paint<00:01:07.830> is

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
and you can see and now the paint is

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.460 
and you can see and now the paint is
flowing<00:01:08.850> really<00:01:09.479> well<00:01:09.780> again

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.780 

but<00:01:13.470> that's<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.830> kids<00:01:14.040> won't<00:01:14.369> leave<00:01:14.520> man<00:01:14.640> look

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
but that's it kids won't leave man look

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.039 
but that's it kids won't leave man look
at<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.880> how<00:01:15.090> fast<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.509> builds<00:01:15.750> up<00:01:15.840> again

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
at that how fast that builds up again

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.560 
at that how fast that builds up again
and<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.680> again<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.009> could<00:01:17.100> just<00:01:17.280> simply<00:01:17.570> scrub

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
and so again you could just simply scrub

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.590 
and so again you could just simply scrub
it<00:01:18.659> off<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:20.210> keep<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.330> tip<00:01:21.509> nice<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.439> going

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
toothbrush also you could a bright the

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.859 
toothbrush also you could a bright the
bristles<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.680> little<00:01:32.430> bit<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.670> fine<00:01:33.240> grit<00:01:33.450> 200

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.410 
bristles a little bit of fine grit 200
sandpaper<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.189> bring<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.090> little<00:01:36.270> bit

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
sandpaper and just bring a little bit

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.789 
sandpaper and just bring a little bit
more<00:01:36.479> texture<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.380> it's<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.590> little

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
more texture to that so it's a little

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.130 
more texture to that so it's a little
bit<00:01:37.890> more<00:01:38.009> gentle<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.640> needle<00:01:39.090> but<00:01:39.840> again

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
bit more gentle on the needle but again

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.679 
bit more gentle on the needle but again
it's<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> really<00:01:41.220> great<00:01:41.430> way<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.909> keeping<00:01:42.479> the
