00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.750
 Hello me 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.340
 welcome to penta klein today it works 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.320
 I'll have you three again 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.560
 brought all three from the high end 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.760
 segment from 80 euro and I want to start 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.740
 certainly one of the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.609
 most famous masts namely the pro flex 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.550
 from the house data what offers us the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.730
 pro flex we certainly have 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.099
 the name is really soft and very 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.110
 flexible mouthguard with a really 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.239
 very good ventilation also up here 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.020
 we find again good air holes we 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.480
 have a double-walled stamos what 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.570
 means you can see this here 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.660
 black membrane the trend 2 on each other 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.129
 glued glasses and guaranteed that 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.800
 between these two glasses the air 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.680
 What can then circulate too clearly 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.809
 less fogging is quite antiquated 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.430
 completely fog free is certainly no 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.930
 mask but this double-walled theme 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.949
 Glass works very much 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.900
 good otherwise the game also comes from 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.310
 home with a visa speak with 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.290
 a sunscreen I on top 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.400
 but also can do it off and with 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.119
 I have him to show you now 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.240
 let it go 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:20.369
 then we have very very soft neoprene 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.530
 workshop panels are also interchangeable 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.330
 are really very very soft very much 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.100
 very flexible but offer by that 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.450
 Neoprene is also a very good one 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.390
 protection for the very sensitive 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.920
 and I have very many names 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.720
 it now times through holes 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.820
 of course the sounds of the field and 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.439
 also what your players say to you 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.479
 just want to say much better 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.270
 is worn on the player and 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.159
 audible is also characterized by the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.869
 Partie by a really very very 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.990
 soft and very comfortable on the face 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.030
 sit single-walled foam one 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.590
 Good as I said a good fit has 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.759
 fits very well in the face 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.000
 and the sweat also good of the 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.490
 Immediately keeps what a mask 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.799
 not quite as great is the masks 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.969
 glass change that is also evident in the 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.689
 later masks we still today 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.310
 discuss 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.079
 that works for everyone else 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.429
 very very simple the mask is just 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.840
 also just a long time on the market 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.890
 and then it was just one more time 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.240
 innovative system 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.640
 I have one can maybe see here 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.280
 small clips of it I have 12 34 at the 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.560
 distributed mask that I have to press purely 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.120
 then it dissolves everywhere and then can 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.280
 I entire bike frame forward away 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.630
 take takes a relatively long time is relative 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.950
 awkward I can only recommend you 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.600
 if I want to do it, take it 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.070
 somehow small screwdriver because 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.880
 otherwise you can finger yourself here 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.170
 already hurt easily 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:40.110
 the next mask I have before me 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:44.170
 is the profiler from home ran it 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.750
 stands in contrast to the pro flex 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.300
 thereby from the however a bent however 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.310
 a straight curved glass has these 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.590
 mask a vaulted glass I hope 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.690
 You can see that here is the manufacturer 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.430
 boasts despite curved glass and 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.860
 vaulted glass we have one 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.690
 diopters number from 0 diopters so 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.220
 by looking through window glass like that 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.760
 is really a very good story 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.380
 I have a firmer frame of the 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.640
 but also very well ventilated is the but 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.860
 Of course, a little bit too 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.020
 clearly a little bit better 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.060
 Although protection offers wave bursting as well 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.490
 faster but here it can be 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.230
 sometimes the energy of the 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.500
 Soon it will be so big 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.000
 the mask goes on to the child below 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.380
 Changing glass is much easier here 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.520
 I want to show it to me right now 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.440
 have if you are there inside it pure 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.510
 I grab two small clips from 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.790
 masks glass of masks strap the me 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.530
 then I can usually do that 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.810
 strapping out of the anchorage here 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.210
 and if I pull then maybe and 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.430
 maybe I can push it all the way 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.840
 push backwards then I am 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.610
 very fast on the glass 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.840
 press it once, then it is here 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.940
 already looks free on the other side 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.410
 the same as read Kanchen masks 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.990
 Take out and change very easily 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.670
 here it is so we have a simple one 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.140
 Glass has something from the back and from 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.170
 front with an anti fog coating 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.910
 and thus an anti fogged is sprayed 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.380
 however, there are now and there 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.500
 certainly many players are looking forward to 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.060
 Also for this double-walled thermal 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.170
 I will give you glasses at the end of the day 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.730
 can only recommend 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.580
 because they are much better 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.040
 work as these coated glasses 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.019
 while I here along the farm 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.319
 reassemble 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.330
 give me a second that's all 

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:25.960
 relatively easy push this again 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.479
 purely clip is purely in the back and then sits 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.349
 the whole thing again for a very long time 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.479
 Of course, now I'm back 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:33.129
 must daft times today sees the whole 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.690
 again very fast as well 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:37.330
 Of course, that simply changes 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.039
 masks strip what is here by it 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.409
 characterized that it gummed from behind 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.300
 is out of his mind again for 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:45.250
 should provide majority and better fit 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.099
 and I'm in here, in contrast 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.650
 for yeti a double or two-stage 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:52.750
 Foam a slightly firmer layer 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.430
 and a very soft comfortable layer 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.560
 something for the soft seat in the face 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.759
 not only soft seats in the cause 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.069
 but also a very good one 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:01.810
 sweat barrier 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:03.759
 here are dior paddles stuck with drum 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.310
 are also very very soft too 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:07.539
 good high slots offer but again 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.909
 in that it's just a bit 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:13.590
 solid material is a little bit 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:16.960
 better protection on the ears 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:20.440
 we are just over 80 in both masks 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.289
 85 euros depending on the provider the next 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.150
 bigger sister of the profiler is 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.770
 the so-called grill many of you 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.900
 already is already well known 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.300
 Long on the market has a lot 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.039
 Narrow profile for little hit area 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.490
 and again very much 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:38.889
 soft protection element below causing the 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.659
 balls better off with us very much 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:42.669
 well ventilated for a good 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:44.590
 air circulation for the player though 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.479
 just for the mast glass means 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.460
 which of course makes it clear again 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.870
 less fogs in this mask, too 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.699
 is from home only once 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.110
 only topic glass what from behind and 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:54.520
 the front is coated with this 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.590
 Coating works like fund 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.840
 Although very good, but I can only 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.909
 recommend for the 25 just under 30 euros the 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.110
 These glasses cost a double walled 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:03.880
 to buy stella gas 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.960
 Here, too, is the mask glass change 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.990
 very very easy a little bit more 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.990
 different to the profiler i take 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.759
 just press these two clips here 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.669
 pull back then it is 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:17.590
 The mask glass itself under strap free 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:19.990
 then I push it lightly from the back 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.969
 to the outside and pull it just like that here 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.610
 away and then again I can completely 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:26.169
 Just free the glass here on the 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.820
 the other side as well then I can 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:29.870
 Masks take glass away to the front 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.880
 cleaning or just to Mars 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.170
 change in this case that works 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.780
 whole even more if I am 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.640
 i can unlock this blog system 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.200
 change this frame if and when 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.720
 I do not like color or color anymore 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.700
 Anything else is very much 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.400
 just very customer friendly and before 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.670
 Everything very customized decommissioning goes 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.920
 quite simply clip in again 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:53.720
 that mascus trip anchored 

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.250
 push back is done so 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.770
 really quite simple too 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:00.080
 This mask tape has the rubber coating 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:04.670
 for better sitting behind the back of the head 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:06.470
 and also this one has the two-stage 

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.780
 foam the slightly harder for the 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:12.070
 Switzerland barrier and the very soft 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:16.190
 for a very comfortable seat in the face 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:18.070
 the grill is 99 95 euro 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:21.800
 in both masses there are thermal glasses 

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:23.990
 in the offer are between about 25 to 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.180
 30 euro comes depending on the color 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:29.300
 execution 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:30.560
 That was part of one of our masks today 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.200
 next time we'll give you a higher level 

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.550
 to masks from 100 I hope it's fun 

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.810
 wish you a nice one 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.810
 day and have fun until then
