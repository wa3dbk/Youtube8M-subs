so marvelous machine I never seen a

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.740 
so marvelous machine I never seen a
machine<00:06:16.650> like<00:06:16.949> that<00:06:17.010> so<00:06:17.940> we're<00:06:18.300> gonna<00:06:18.510> show

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750

small piece about the hinge see ya he

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:04.510 
small piece about the hinge see ya he
can<00:07:00.560> detect<00:07:00.889> very<00:07:01.190> small<00:07:01.990> to<00:07:02.990> the<00:07:03.020> Machine<00:07:03.520> I'm

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520 
can detect very small to the Machine I'm

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.820 
can detect very small to the Machine I'm
gonna<00:07:04.879> go<00:07:05.840> here<00:07:06.080> to<00:07:06.650> see<00:07:06.860> the<00:07:06.979> meter<00:07:07.810> about

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:08.830 
gonna go here to see the meter about

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:14.469 
gonna go here to see the meter about
39:48<00:07:10.090> yeah<00:07:11.680> so<00:07:12.680> when<00:07:13.310> you<00:07:13.430> detect<00:07:13.729> like<00:07:14.000> small
