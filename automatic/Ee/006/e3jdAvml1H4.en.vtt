to 100 plus members you have to really

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.990 
to 100 plus members you have to really
get<00:03:14.050> everything<00:03:14.739> down<00:03:14.950> packed<00:03:15.310> so<00:03:15.670> have<00:03:15.850> all

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
get everything down packed so have all

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.990 
get everything down packed so have all
your<00:03:16.120> process<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.980> know<00:03:18.070> solidified<00:03:18.670> so

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
your process you know solidified so

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.210 
your process you know solidified so
saying<00:03:19.269> you<00:03:19.810> know<00:03:19.930> from<00:03:20.290> invoices<00:03:20.950> to

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
saying you know from invoices to

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.590 
saying you know from invoices to
meetings<00:03:21.760> everything<00:03:22.209> has<00:03:22.360> to<00:03:22.480> have<00:03:22.510> a

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
meetings everything has to have a

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.750 
meetings everything has to have a
process<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.350> I<00:03:23.470> think<00:03:23.500> that's<00:03:24.280> one<00:03:24.489> thing<00:03:24.640> I

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
process and I think that's one thing I

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.370 
process and I think that's one thing I
learned<00:03:24.910> early<00:03:25.209> on<00:03:25.510> so<00:03:25.870> I<00:03:25.900> could<00:03:26.050> translate

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
learned early on so I could translate

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.259 
learned early on so I could translate
that<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:26.680> this<00:03:26.890> company<00:03:27.280> as<00:03:27.430> we<00:03:27.550> keep<00:03:27.760> growing

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
that to this company as we keep growing

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.930 
that to this company as we keep growing
you<00:03:28.750> know<00:03:28.840> we<00:03:28.989> can<00:03:29.110> grow<00:03:29.320> efficiently<00:03:29.920> and<00:03:30.820> I

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
you know we can grow efficiently and I

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.130 
you know we can grow efficiently and I
think<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.630> third<00:03:32.080> one<00:03:32.350> is<00:03:32.620> obviously

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
think the third one is obviously

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.600 
think the third one is obviously
learning<00:03:35.140> how<00:03:35.230> to<00:03:35.290> do<00:03:35.530> stuff<00:03:35.590> but<00:03:36.100> not<00:03:36.250> do
