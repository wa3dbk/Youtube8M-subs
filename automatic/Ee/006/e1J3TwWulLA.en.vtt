pretty<00:01:46.290> great<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.770> can<00:01:46.860> bounce<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.189> group

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
pretty great and it can bounce the group

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.340 
pretty great and it can bounce the group
if<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.640> want<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:48.420> only<00:01:48.659> if<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.810> want<00:01:49.140> I

actually<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.460> will<00:01:53.700> probably<00:01:54.030> be<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
actually this will probably be the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.039 
actually this will probably be the
easier<00:01:55.140> one<00:01:55.470> because<00:01:55.920> i<00:01:56.040> don't<00:01:56.219> know<00:01:56.310> it's

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
easier one because i don't know it's

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.020 
easier one because i don't know it's
honestly<00:01:58.049> it's<00:01:58.380> kind<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.860> difficult<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.640> make

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
honestly it's kind of difficult to make

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.370 
honestly it's kind of difficult to make
a<00:02:00.060> difficult<00:02:01.159> yep<00:02:02.159> still<00:02:02.610> good<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.600> climbing

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
a difficult yep still good a climbing

and stuff difficult and I suppose it's

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.910 
and stuff difficult and I suppose it's
true<00:02:13.910> that<00:02:14.240> it's<00:02:14.300> not<00:02:14.630> always<00:02:14.870> easy<00:02:15.110> but<00:02:15.740> it's

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
true that it's not always easy but it's

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.470

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
pretty good match and also I think

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.310 
pretty good match and also I think

pretty<00:06:37.099> crazy<00:06:37.399> I<00:06:37.819> suppose<00:06:39.580> all<00:06:40.580> right<00:06:40.909> yeah

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:41.319 
pretty crazy I suppose all right yeah

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:43.689 
pretty crazy I suppose all right yeah
honestly<00:06:42.319> I<00:06:42.409> was<00:06:42.619> expecting<00:06:42.949> something<00:06:43.129> a<00:06:43.550> bit

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:43.699 
honestly I was expecting something a bit

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:46.209 
honestly I was expecting something a bit
larger<00:06:44.300> but<00:06:44.449> i<00:06:44.539> suppose<00:06:44.749> up<00:06:45.080> 200<00:06:45.619> screen<00:06:45.949> goes

00:06:46.209 --> 00:06:46.219 
larger but i suppose up 200 screen goes

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:48.249 
larger but i suppose up 200 screen goes
very<00:06:46.580> quick<00:06:46.999> when<00:06:47.300> a<00:06:47.330> lot<00:06:47.569> of<00:06:47.599> these<00:06:47.869> screens

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:48.259 
very quick when a lot of these screens

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:50.230 
very quick when a lot of these screens
are<00:06:48.469> spent<00:06:48.769> mopping<00:06:49.519> and<00:06:49.669> bopping<00:06:50.089> and

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
are spent mopping and bopping and

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.209 
are spent mopping and bopping and
jumping<00:06:50.599> around<00:06:50.719> so<00:06:51.259> you<00:06:51.289> know<00:06:51.499> i<00:06:51.529> like<00:06:51.919> that<00:06:52.159> a

00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:52.219 
jumping around so you know i like that a

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:55.839 
jumping around so you know i like that a
lot<00:06:52.490> it<00:06:52.699> was<00:06:52.879> more<00:06:53.389> like<00:06:53.719> was<00:06:53.990> as<00:06:54.830> I<00:06:55.039> heard<00:06:55.669> it

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:55.849 
lot it was more like was as I heard it

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:58.600 
lot it was more like was as I heard it
it's<00:06:56.029> basically<00:06:56.419> a<00:06:57.379> hack<00:06:57.740> in<00:06:58.099> and<00:06:58.219> of<00:06:58.430> itself

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
it's basically a hack in and of itself

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.100 
it's basically a hack in and of itself
in<00:06:59.089> one<00:06:59.269> level<00:06:59.599> I<00:06:59.719> thought<00:06:59.899> it<00:06:59.959> was<00:07:00.019> very<00:07:00.080> nice

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110 
in one level I thought it was very nice

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:06.129 
in one level I thought it was very nice
ah<00:07:03.110> the<00:07:04.069> transitions<00:07:04.999> were<00:07:05.209> nice<00:07:05.539> like<00:07:05.839> added

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:06.139 
ah the transitions were nice like added

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:08.320 
ah the transitions were nice like added
was<00:07:06.289> cut<00:07:06.559> up<00:07:06.589> in<00:07:06.800> pieces<00:07:06.830> I<00:07:07.399> suppose<00:07:07.819> it<00:07:08.029> if<00:07:08.149> I

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.330 
was cut up in pieces I suppose it if I

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.689 
was cut up in pieces I suppose it if I
made<00:07:08.599> more<00:07:09.050> sense<00:07:09.409> i<00:07:09.769> would<00:07:10.009> like<00:07:10.189> take<00:07:10.430> all<00:07:10.669> of

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:10.699 
made more sense i would like take all of

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:14.799 
made more sense i would like take all of
these<00:07:11.680> level<00:07:12.680> like<00:07:13.099> little<00:07:13.519> card<00:07:13.939> separators

00:07:14.799 --> 00:07:14.809 
these level like little card separators

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:16.749 
these level like little card separators
and<00:07:14.839> use<00:07:15.289> that<00:07:15.319> to<00:07:15.619> prove<00:07:16.069> myself<00:07:16.339> a

00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:16.759 
and use that to prove myself a

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:18.579 
and use that to prove myself a
checkpoint<00:07:17.180> but<00:07:17.419> whatever<00:07:17.809> what<00:07:18.110> is<00:07:18.259> done<00:07:18.439> is

00:07:18.579 --> 00:07:18.589 
checkpoint but whatever what is done is

00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:21.670 
checkpoint but whatever what is done is
done<00:07:18.619> and<00:07:19.099> when<00:07:19.999> Sun<00:07:20.209> Sun<00:07:20.449> Scout<00:07:21.050> playing<00:07:21.409> of
