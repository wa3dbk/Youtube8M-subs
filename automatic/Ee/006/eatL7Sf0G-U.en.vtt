00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.240
 hello in this tutorial I'm going to show you 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.740
 how to make these beautiful dresses that 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.870
 we can give as memories what they are 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.000
 baby showers and whether they want it 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.830
 do it in a simple way or 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.320
 with its base to highlight a little 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.300
 more although doing so look also 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.770
 as it takes two pieces simply 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.900
 we put here what is the stick of 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.780
 skewer to be able to place it in a 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.960
 base and make a nice arrangement or well 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.460
 We can give it with some assurance in this 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.739
 part to put it to our 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.780
 guests well then let's go to 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.900
 start showing the materials that 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.000
 we will need to occupy two or three 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.800
 pieces of foami depending on the dress 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.300
 that you are going to choose if you want 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.710
 do this that takes the base or 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.320
 just do it like that so 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.739
 simple we are also going to need 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.980
 our cold silicone scissors a 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.329
 marker of the same tone as the foam and 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.480
 our skewer stick to mark 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.190
 white acrylic paint and some ornament 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.040
 who want to put him in this part can 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.579
 be some little flower or some little monkey and the 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.080
 mold and here it is and you know I leave you the 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:12.460
 link here in the little box of the 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.500
 click-only description 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.450
 and will take them to my facebook page 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.040
 what I did especially for you to 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.740
 that they can get all the molds that 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.900
 you need or want or 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.520
 there is also the link to my blog 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.520
 which can you also get there 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.590
 the mold well then let's start 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.810
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.020
 mark our mold on what is the 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.149
 fomin 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.740
 here previously I already did it to save 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.340
 time and only then you have to 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.340
 cut them out 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.060
 once we already have them so 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.770
 next is let's blur all the 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.770
 contour of both pieces 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.540
 since we have it like this we are going to mark him 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.420
 what are the hello 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.340
 A) Yes 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.840
 making him this curve 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.840
 so they look better 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.810
 and we will have stayed like this now we are going to 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.810
 do the same with this other part 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.010
 and here in this part we're going to do what 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.569
 same in these sunny parts that 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:03.200
 we cut let's mark what is the 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:06.129
 olanchito well with more lines so that 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.129
 see more beautiful 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.330
 and give it a better shape 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.080
 now with the same bookmark or if they want 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.150
 with a different one they can do this 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.150
 line that I did to you here those waves 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.660
 that can be marked simply 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.880
 little by little and then so 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.960
 right on the most right they can 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.960
 to make it look better 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.069
 we are going to do it also in color 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.069
 pink 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.490
 trying to keep us almost the same 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.440
 size not that we will have one more 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.570
 open and another longer trying that 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.989
 we remain the same so that it looks 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.799
 couple 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.799
 there yes 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.620
 here I made them a little more open and 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.450
 here the systems followed since I 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.790
 he liked more how he looks with all the 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.240
 little dots that are there already is to taste of 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.220
 your 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.670
 well once we have both 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.910
 pieces like this 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.910
 the next thing is we're going to paste them 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.740
 here we are going to paint these other lines 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.190
 so they also look like lan is 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.780
 here we are simply going to do this in 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.289
 I'm going to mark the mold so that 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.980
 have you as a guide 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:03.780
 well just doing a line 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.820
 and here this option of you if you want 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.260
 blur it or just nothing else like that 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.260
 that is marked 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:19.500
 and now let's hit her a little flower 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.500
 let's put him 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.940
 the one that stands out the most I think is the blue 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.280
 and we are going to put it here 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:39.879
 and now nothing else is a matter of 

00:05:37.869 --> 00:05:42.809
 put the little white dots with our 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:42.809
 skewer stick 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.760
 we can also use a little bit of 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.120
 paint this the same tone as the 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.120
 little flower 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.470
 here in what is the white part for 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.110
 that looks more here nothing else we are going to 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.860
 put a few dots 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.860
 here 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.050
 and now we are going to put them in color 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.050
 White 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:28.050
 where we choose or think 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.050
 that others 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.190
 and that's how it's finished 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.470
 our dress with all the details 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.360
 of the little white dots look how pretty 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.129
 it looks 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.020
 good friends, I hope this is 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:53.599
 craftsmanship has been to your liking if it was 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.400
 so they share her finger up and 

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:57.550
 see you in the next tutorial up 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.550
 then
