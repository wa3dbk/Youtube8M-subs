00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:17.060

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.760
 what the future held for him 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.050
 wanted to be a writer but could not find 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.730
 words 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.349
 take it as a hobby and only until 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.789

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:35.330
 responsibilities and suddenly there 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.800
 was she for the first time saw a world 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.920
 bigger than the one where he had 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.920
 born 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:48.440

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.670
 moment 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.039
 tell me the truth that really happened 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.809
 due to the current situation in the world 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.550

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.329
 then it had been his world suddenly 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.329
 it was made small 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:10.020
 I'm not who I thought I was and it terrifies me 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.020

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.880
 get it 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.000
 It is totally different from everything 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.000

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.960

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.170

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.660

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.740
 fiction both are very close but 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.740
 they never touch each other 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.040
 you think you can appropriate life 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.160
 of a man and to pay a price for 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.160
