basically get the cut in and then get on

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.030 
basically get the cut in and then get on
the<00:01:03.719> throttle<00:01:03.750> how<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.260> use<00:01:04.559> all<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.860> time

the throttle how to use all the time

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.580 
the throttle how to use all the time
third<00:01:05.549> fourth<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.240> then<00:01:06.570> fifth<00:01:06.990> just<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.500> the

and then you've got the moving little

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.770 
and then you've got the moving little
straight<00:01:26.220> down<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.580> back<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:26.939> into<00:01:27.420> one<00:01:27.689> of

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
straight down the back and into one of

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.539 
straight down the back and into one of
the<00:01:27.900> hardest<00:01:28.470> breaking<00:01:28.920> corners<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
the hardest breaking corners on the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.370 
the hardest breaking corners on the
circuit<00:01:29.880> don't<00:01:30.299> into<00:01:30.570> second<00:01:30.930> gear<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.200> rear

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
circuit don't into second gear the rear

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.230 
circuit don't into second gear the rear
squirming<00:01:31.920> again<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.280> turn<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.970> lose<00:01:33.210> a

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
squirming again you turn it you lose a

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.399 
squirming again you turn it you lose a
bit<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.509> grip<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.079> go<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
bit of grip and then you go on the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.750 
bit of grip and then you go on the
throttle<00:01:34.619> as<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.250> pulls<00:01:35.490> up<00:01:35.700> hill<00:01:35.970> third

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
throttle as it pulls up hill third

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.850 
throttle as it pulls up hill third
and<00:01:36.880> then<00:01:37.090> form<00:01:37.390> under<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:37.780> big<00:01:38.050> brave<00:01:38.470> bridge

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
and then form under the big brave bridge

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.590 
and then form under the big brave bridge
little<00:01:39.490> lift<00:01:39.670> and<00:01:39.850> then<00:01:39.910> back<00:01:40.120> on<00:01:40.330> it<00:01:40.420> using

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
little lift and then back on it using

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.540 
little lift and then back on it using
all<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:41.140> circuit<00:01:41.500> on<00:01:41.590> exit<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.220> as<00:01:42.310> you<00:01:42.400> can

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
all the circuit on exit and as you can

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.920 
all the circuit on exit and as you can
see<00:01:42.580> someone<00:01:43.030> used<00:01:43.210> a<00:01:43.300> little<00:01:43.510> bit<00:01:43.630> too<00:01:43.780> much

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
see someone used a little bit too much

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.050 
see someone used a little bit too much
and<00:01:44.140> then<00:01:44.410> go<00:01:44.590> to<00:01:44.620> the<00:01:44.800> final<00:01:45.160> corner<00:01:45.370> no<00:01:45.820> this

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
and then go to the final corner no this

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.150 
and then go to the final corner no this
one<00:01:46.270> you<00:01:46.570> can<00:01:46.810> easily<00:01:47.050> overshoot<00:01:47.680> going<00:01:47.980> to

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
one you can easily overshoot going to

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.040 
one you can easily overshoot going to
white<00:01:48.400> and<00:01:48.700> then<00:01:49.060> that's<00:01:49.300> it<00:01:49.420> you've<00:01:49.600> lost<00:01:49.810> all

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
white and then that's it you've lost all

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.750 
white and then that's it you've lost all
of<00:01:50.080> the<00:01:50.260> time<00:01:50.440> all<00:01:50.620> you've<00:01:50.800> gained<00:01:51.100> on<00:01:51.370> the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
of the time all you've gained on the

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.030 
of the time all you've gained on the
whole<00:01:52.030> circuit<00:01:52.510> then<00:01:52.930> you<00:01:53.080> pull<00:01:53.290> up<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.740> big

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
whole circuit then you pull up the big

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.580 
whole circuit then you pull up the big
long<00:01:54.550> hill<00:01:54.820> into<00:01:55.390> this<00:01:55.510> gear<00:01:55.780> just<00:01:56.200> before<00:01:56.350> you

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
long hill into this gear just before you

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.200 
long hill into this gear just before you
cross<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.890> line<00:01:56.920> that's<00:01:57.610> one<00:01:57.910> minute<00:01:58.200> 49.1
