so sometimes tips of the days or really
other<00:01:01.559> people's<00:01:02.100> truths<00:01:02.400> and<00:01:02.640> sometimes

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
other people's truths and sometimes

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.299 
other people's truths and sometimes
they're<00:01:03.269> my<00:01:03.420> truths<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.110> then<00:01:04.259> of<00:01:04.530> course<00:01:04.589> in

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
they're my truths and then of course in

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.030 
they're my truths and then of course in
time<00:01:05.610> sometimes<00:01:06.330> they'll<00:01:06.540> be<00:01:06.660> your<00:01:06.840> truths<00:01:07.140> so

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
time sometimes they'll be your truths so

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.990 
time sometimes they'll be your truths so
this<00:01:08.880> idea<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:10.410> actually<00:01:11.040> real<00:01:11.550> because<00:01:11.910> you

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
this idea is actually real because you

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.389 
this idea is actually real because you
can<00:01:12.149> see<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.660> big<00:01:13.080> plant<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:14.070> tobacco

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
can see this big plant this tobacco

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.719 
can see this big plant this tobacco
plant<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.060> bigger<00:01:15.810> than<00:01:16.110> one<00:01:16.920> leaf<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.490> bigger

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
plant is bigger than one leaf is bigger

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.620 
plant is bigger than one leaf is bigger
than<00:01:17.910> the<00:01:18.000> whole<00:01:18.149> plant<00:01:19.100> so<00:01:20.330> minerals<00:01:21.330> are

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
than the whole plant so minerals are

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.450 
than the whole plant so minerals are
very<00:01:22.399> essential<00:01:23.399> to<00:01:24.210> grow<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.800> in<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.310> way

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
very essential to grow you in the way

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.420 
very essential to grow you in the way
you<00:01:26.490> want<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.229> when<00:01:28.229> we<00:01:28.380> dry<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:28.740> plant<00:01:29.220> this

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
you want to when we dry this plant this

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.940 
you want to when we dry this plant this
plant<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.940> yellow<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.450> can<00:01:30.690> see<00:01:30.750> this<00:01:31.680> one's

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
plant is yellow you can see this one's

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.550 
plant is yellow you can see this one's
green<00:01:32.280> green<00:01:32.910> if<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.509> dried<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.259> turns

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
green green if you dried this this turns

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.260 
green green if you dried this this turns
into<00:01:34.800> just<00:01:35.220> like<00:01:35.399> yellow<00:01:35.729> just<00:01:35.940> like<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.149> what

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
into just like yellow just like you what

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.080 
into just like yellow just like you what
you<00:01:36.420> see<00:01:36.630> there<00:01:37.619> there's<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.190> pyramid<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.970> you

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
you see there there's a pyramid and you

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.309 
you see there there's a pyramid and you
can<00:01:39.240> look<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.509> see<00:01:39.660> some<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.959> the<00:01:40.020> videos

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
can look and see some of the videos

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:41.449 
can look and see some of the videos
we've<00:01:40.500> done<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.830> that<00:01:40.979> called<00:01:41.160> the<00:01:41.280> food

00:01:41.449 --> 00:01:41.459 
we've done on that called the food

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:43.580 
we've done on that called the food
pyramid<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.090> explains<00:01:42.539> all<00:01:43.020> these<00:01:43.319> levels

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
pyramid and explains all these levels

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.740 
pyramid and explains all these levels
out<00:01:43.920> really<00:01:44.190> good<00:01:44.490> because<00:01:44.700> it's<00:01:45.030> it's<00:01:45.630> not

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
out really good because it's it's not

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.570 
out really good because it's it's not
that<00:01:45.869> it's<00:01:46.259> hard<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.649> understand<00:01:47.250> it's<00:01:47.429> just

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
that it's hard to understand it's just

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.859 
that it's hard to understand it's just
that<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.789> have<00:01:47.910> to<00:01:48.000> figure<00:01:48.270> out<00:01:48.420> what<00:01:48.630> level

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
that you have to figure out what level

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.630 
that you have to figure out what level
of<00:01:49.050> the<00:01:49.140> pyramid<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.590> are<00:01:49.770> at<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.130> where<00:01:50.369> you

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
of the pyramid you are at and where you

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.520 
of the pyramid you are at and where you
want<00:01:50.849> to<00:01:51.000> go<00:01:51.149> if<00:01:51.300> it<00:01:51.420> makes<00:01:51.599> logical<00:01:51.840> sense<00:01:52.140> to

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
want to go if it makes logical sense to

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.290 
want to go if it makes logical sense to
you<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:52.910> the<00:01:53.910> tip<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.330> day<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.539> minerals

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
you so the tip of the day is minerals

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.800 
you so the tip of the day is minerals
equal<00:01:57.890> conductivity<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.340> without<00:02:00.330> these

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
equal conductivity and without these

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.630 
equal conductivity and without these
things<00:02:01.709> water<00:02:02.610> minerals<00:02:03.569> and<00:02:04.130> sunlight<00:02:05.130> it

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
things water minerals and sunlight it

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.589 
things water minerals and sunlight it
just<00:02:06.450> doesn't<00:02:06.840> happen<00:02:06.989> as<00:02:07.319> you<00:02:07.590> can<00:02:07.770> see<00:02:08.599> there

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
just doesn't happen as you can see there

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.420 
just doesn't happen as you can see there
we<00:02:09.720> go<00:02:09.869> now<00:02:10.110> this<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.709> going<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.039> be<00:02:11.190> very

we go now this is going to be very

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.790 
we go now this is going to be very
interesting<00:02:12.360> for<00:02:12.390> your<00:02:12.780> mind<00:02:13.110> if<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.500> haven't

interesting for your mind if you haven't
been<00:02:13.890> doing<00:02:14.069> this<00:02:14.750> these<00:02:15.750> are<00:02:16.080> seeds<00:02:16.530> and

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
been doing this these are seeds and

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.660 
been doing this these are seeds and
seeds<00:02:17.819> are<00:02:18.060> very<00:02:18.360> special<00:02:19.080> if<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:20.010> have<00:02:20.220> seeds

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
searching for is food so these are

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.860 
searching for is food so these are
avocado<00:02:32.489> seeds

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
avocado seeds

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.309 
avocado seeds
these<00:02:34.500> are<00:02:34.709> chilies<00:02:35.910> all<00:02:36.180> different<00:02:36.810> types<00:02:36.989> of

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
these are chilies all different types of

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.530 
these are chilies all different types of
plants<00:02:37.770> what<00:02:38.610> we're<00:02:38.760> talking<00:02:39.120> about<00:02:39.180> is

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
plants what we're talking about is

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.330 
plants what we're talking about is
actually<00:02:39.690> taking<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.590> seeds<00:02:41.180> that<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.780> eat

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
actually taking the seeds that you eat

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.180 
actually taking the seeds that you eat
let's<00:02:44.970> say<00:02:45.150> like<00:02:45.360> an<00:02:45.480> avocado<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:46.500> you're

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
let's say like an avocado and you're

let's say like an avocado and you're
eating<00:02:47.520> an<00:02:47.610> Alva<00:02:47.880> kado<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:48.540> have<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.750> seed

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
eating an Alva kado and you have a seed

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.330 
eating an Alva kado and you have a seed
what<00:02:49.320> do<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:49.440> do<00:02:49.590> with<00:02:49.740> it<00:02:49.860> look<00:02:50.070> what<00:02:50.190> we<00:02:50.310> just

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
what do you do with it look what we just

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.840 
what do you do with it look what we just
did<00:02:50.640> with<00:02:50.850> it<00:02:51.200> we<00:02:52.200> have<00:02:52.230> been<00:02:52.650> growing<00:02:52.920> all<00:02:53.310> the

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
did with it we have been growing all the

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.170 
did with it we have been growing all the
things<00:02:54.210> that<00:02:54.690> have<00:02:54.960> seeds<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.920> if<00:02:56.490> we<00:02:56.670> all<00:02:56.850> did

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
things that have seeds and if we all did

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.470 
things that have seeds and if we all did
this<00:02:57.740> what<00:02:58.740> do<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:58.890> think<00:02:59.160> we'd<00:02:59.340> have<00:02:59.480> this

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
this what do you think we'd have this

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.320 
this what do you think we'd have this
avocado<00:03:00.830> has<00:03:01.830> only<00:03:02.070> been<00:03:02.310> here<00:03:02.610> for<00:03:02.880> about<00:03:02.940> oh

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
avocado has only been here for about oh

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.540 
avocado has only been here for about oh
maybe<00:03:03.750> about<00:03:04.080> a<00:03:04.140> month<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.590> half<00:03:04.620> look<00:03:05.340> what

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
maybe about a month and a half look what

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.050 
maybe about a month and a half look what
it's<00:03:05.700> doing<00:03:05.940> it's<00:03:06.630> growing<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:08.190> wants<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:08.850> grow

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
it's doing it's growing it wants to grow

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.820 
it's doing it's growing it wants to grow
so<00:03:09.270> don't<00:03:09.480> throw<00:03:09.630> it<00:03:09.810> out<00:03:09.900> in<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.140> garbage<00:03:10.500> can

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
so don't throw it out in the garbage can

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.030 
so don't throw it out in the garbage can
that's<00:03:11.190> sort<00:03:11.700> of<00:03:11.900> well<00:03:12.900> if<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:13.380> find<00:03:13.650> out<00:03:13.860> that

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
that's sort of well if you find out that

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.490 
that's sort of well if you find out that
we're<00:03:14.190> all<00:03:14.310> working<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.480> get<00:03:15.750> food<00:03:16.080> that<00:03:16.350> would

we're all working to get food that would

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.980 
we're all working to get food that would
be<00:03:16.530> blasphemy<00:03:17.490> to<00:03:17.670> throw<00:03:17.910> away<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.210> seed<00:03:18.660> if<00:03:18.870> you

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
be blasphemy to throw away a seed if you

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.690 
be blasphemy to throw away a seed if you
know<00:03:19.140> that<00:03:19.350> over<00:03:19.590> three<00:03:19.830> billion<00:03:20.160> people

I<00:03:24.840> call<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.470> naturalistic<00:03:26.160> Church<00:03:26.490> take<00:03:27.390> your

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
I call it naturalistic Church take your

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.750 
I call it naturalistic Church take your
seeds<00:03:27.810> of<00:03:28.020> the<00:03:28.110> week<00:03:28.320> dry<00:03:28.680> them<00:03:28.890> out<00:03:29.010> wash<00:03:29.430> them

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
seeds of the week dry them out wash them

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.540 
seeds of the week dry them out wash them
and<00:03:29.910> then<00:03:30.420> plant<00:03:30.750> them<00:03:30.960> and<00:03:31.500> you'll<00:03:31.740> see<00:03:31.980> that

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
and then plant them and you'll see that

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.220 
and then plant them and you'll see that
you'll<00:03:32.730> have<00:03:32.880> food<00:03:33.180> for<00:03:33.480> a<00:03:33.510> rainy<00:03:33.750> day

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
you'll have food for a rainy day

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.280 
you'll have food for a rainy day
mm-hmm<00:03:34.830> and<00:03:34.920> if<00:03:35.130> we<00:03:35.250> all<00:03:35.400> did<00:03:35.610> that<00:03:35.670> well<00:03:36.630> you'd

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
mm-hmm and if we all did that well you'd

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.380 
mm-hmm and if we all did that well you'd
see<00:03:37.530> that<00:03:37.710> we'd<00:03:37.830> have<00:03:38.040> a<00:03:38.310> lot<00:03:38.580> of<00:03:38.640> farmers

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
see that we'd have a lot of farmers

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.660 
see that we'd have a lot of farmers
market<00:03:40.020> people<00:03:40.230> going<00:03:40.800> to<00:03:40.950> share<00:03:41.250> what<00:03:41.520> they

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
market people going to share what they

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.750 
market people going to share what they
grow<00:03:41.940> and<00:03:42.240> they<00:03:42.780> don't<00:03:43.080> have<00:03:43.350> enough<00:03:43.830> well

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
grow and they don't have enough well

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.910 
grow and they don't have enough well
people<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:45.990> their<00:03:46.080> family<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.590> eat<00:03:46.680> all<00:03:46.800> the

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
people and their family to eat all the

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.050 
people and their family to eat all the
food<00:03:47.160> they're<00:03:47.340> growing<00:03:47.580> so<00:03:47.730> what<00:03:47.850> do<00:03:47.910> they<00:03:48.000> do

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
food they're growing so what do they do

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.150 
food they're growing so what do they do
with<00:03:48.300> it<00:03:48.330> they<00:03:48.540> share<00:03:48.780> it<00:03:48.870> with<00:03:48.930> others<00:03:49.320> one

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
with it they share it with others one

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.310 
with it they share it with others one
other<00:03:50.310> thing<00:03:50.580> before<00:03:50.730> we<00:03:50.940> pass<00:03:51.780> on<00:03:52.080> is<00:03:54.320> looking

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
other thing before we pass on is looking

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.890 
other thing before we pass on is looking
at<00:03:55.440> this<00:03:55.650> is<00:03:55.860> called<00:03:56.130> a<00:03:56.430> weed<00:03:56.910> maybe<00:03:57.210> or<00:03:57.540> grass

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
at this is called a weed maybe or grass

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.590 
at this is called a weed maybe or grass
but<00:03:58.530> this<00:03:58.680> was<00:03:58.860> growing<00:03:59.280> in<00:03:59.400> here<00:03:59.670> and<00:03:59.970> this<00:04:00.450> is

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
but this was growing in here and this is

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.570 
but this was growing in here and this is
why<00:04:00.810> we<00:04:01.440> need<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.770> go<00:04:01.890> ahead<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.160> clean

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
why we need to go ahead and clean

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.150 
why we need to go ahead and clean
ourselves<00:04:03.240> of<00:04:03.390> a<00:04:04.050> lot<00:04:04.350> of<00:04:04.380> different<00:04:04.800> types<00:04:04.980> of

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
ourselves of a lot of different types of

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.550 
ourselves of a lot of different types of
parasites<00:04:05.790> because<00:04:06.270> I<00:04:06.450> want<00:04:06.750> this<00:04:07.050> to<00:04:07.110> grow

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
parasites because I want this to grow

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.260 
parasites because I want this to grow
and<00:04:07.800> it's<00:04:07.890> not<00:04:08.040> a<00:04:08.070> parasite<00:04:08.550> but<00:04:08.910> it<00:04:09.000> is<00:04:09.120> it's

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
and it's not a parasite but it is it's

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.730 
and it's not a parasite but it is it's
living<00:04:09.600> off<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:09.900> minimal<00:04:10.260> mineral<00:04:10.620> and

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
living off the minimal mineral and

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.800 
living off the minimal mineral and
minerals<00:04:11.100> that<00:04:11.160> I<00:04:11.310> have<00:04:11.490> in<00:04:11.640> here<00:04:11.820> and<00:04:12.120> so<00:04:12.630> if<00:04:12.720> I

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
minerals that I have in here and so if I

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.110 
minerals that I have in here and so if I
take<00:04:12.840> this<00:04:13.230> away<00:04:13.590> now<00:04:13.860> this<00:04:14.580> plant<00:04:14.880> you<00:04:14.940> can

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
take this away now this plant you can

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.789 
take this away now this plant you can
see<00:04:15.300> the<00:04:15.450> root<00:04:15.630> structure<00:04:15.960> this<00:04:16.260> plant<00:04:16.590> was

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
see the root structure this plant was

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.880 
see the root structure this plant was
massive<00:04:17.370> it<00:04:17.640> was<00:04:18.140> taking<00:04:19.140> away<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.500> minerals

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
massive it was taking away the minerals

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.860 
massive it was taking away the minerals
so<00:04:20.100> this<00:04:20.280> plant<00:04:20.610> most<00:04:20.880> likely<00:04:21.330> may<00:04:21.480> never<00:04:21.690> grow

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
so this plant most likely may never grow

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.840 
so this plant most likely may never grow
so<00:04:22.650> if<00:04:22.710> you<00:04:22.800> have<00:04:22.890> a<00:04:22.950> lot<00:04:23.100> of<00:04:23.130> parasites<00:04:23.490> in

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
so if you have a lot of parasites in

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.490 
so if you have a lot of parasites in
your<00:04:23.910> body<00:04:24.180> it's<00:04:24.390> only<00:04:24.540> because<00:04:24.930> most<00:04:25.290> likely

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
your body it's only because most likely

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.060

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
really hard for us to do this and this

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.670 
really hard for us to do this and this
has<00:06:12.700> taken<00:06:13.000> us<00:06:13.120> lots<00:06:13.450> of<00:06:13.660> time<00:06:13.720> to<00:06:14.200> be<00:06:14.350> able<00:06:14.380> to
