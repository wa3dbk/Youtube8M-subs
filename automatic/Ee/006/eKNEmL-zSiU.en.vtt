problems<00:00:07.259> if<00:00:07.529> you're<00:00:07.649> not<00:00:07.710> ready<00:00:07.890> for<00:00:08.189> it<00:00:08.220> and

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
problems if you're not ready for it and

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
the primary reason it cause problems is

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.570 
the primary reason it cause problems is
because<00:00:10.050> of<00:00:10.290> these<00:00:10.440> little<00:00:10.740> scrap<00:00:11.070> piles<00:00:11.400> that

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
because of these little scrap piles that

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.009 
because of these little scrap piles that
you<00:00:11.730> can<00:00:11.880> see<00:00:12.090> in<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.269> corners<00:00:12.660> I'm<00:00:12.809> just

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
you can see in the corners I'm just

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.270 
you can see in the corners I'm just
showing<00:00:13.170> you<00:00:13.290> here<00:00:13.559> so<00:00:13.710> you've<00:00:13.830> got<00:00:13.889> one<00:00:14.160> on

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
showing you here so you've got one on

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.220
