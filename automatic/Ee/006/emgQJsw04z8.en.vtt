00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
and place two blocks right behind those

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.590 
and place two blocks right behind those
rows<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.350> pistons<00:01:28.710> with<00:01:29.040> repeaters<00:01:29.759> set<00:01:30.420> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
rows of pistons with repeaters set the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.920 
rows of pistons with repeaters set the
four<00:01:30.930> tix<00:01:31.290> with<00:01:32.100> redstone<00:01:33.090> connecting<00:01:33.780> both

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
four tix with redstone connecting both

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.010 
four tix with redstone connecting both
of<00:01:34.140> those<00:01:34.259> repeaters<00:01:34.829> again<00:01:35.490> repeat<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.020> for

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
of those repeaters again repeat that for

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.320 
of those repeaters again repeat that for
both<00:01:37.439> sides

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.450 

all<00:01:43.200> right<00:01:43.380> now<00:01:43.500> what's<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.920> once<00:01:44.220> that's

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
all right now what's that once that's

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.430 
all right now what's that once that's
done<00:01:44.700> we're<00:01:45.330> actually<00:01:45.720> pretty<00:01:45.930> much<00:01:46.020> there

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
done we're actually pretty much there

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.590 
done we're actually pretty much there
the<00:01:46.890> next<00:01:47.130> thing<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.310> we<00:01:47.520> need<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.700> do<00:01:47.940> is<00:01:48.210> get

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
the next thing that we need to do is get

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.480 
the next thing that we need to do is get
this<00:01:48.780> wired<00:01:49.080> together<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.950> I'm<00:01:50.130> gonna<00:01:50.280> go

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
this wired together so I'm gonna go

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.410 
this wired together so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.910> dig<00:01:51.090> two<00:01:51.900> blocks<00:01:52.230> down<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:53.420> then

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
ahead and dig two blocks down and then

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.740 
ahead and dig two blocks down and then
set<00:01:54.720> up<00:01:54.900> a<00:01:55.200> redstone<00:01:55.620> torch<00:01:56.390> right<00:01:57.390> underneath

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
set up a redstone torch right underneath

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.660 
set up a redstone torch right underneath
the<00:01:58.050> block<00:01:58.290> where<00:01:58.560> we<00:01:58.650> have<00:01:58.830> our<00:01:58.980> redstone<00:01:59.190> so

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
the block where we have our redstone so

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.360 
the block where we have our redstone so
that<00:01:59.820> way<00:01:59.940> the<00:02:00.060> path<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.510> the<00:02:00.600> power<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:01.370> moved

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
that way the path of the power is moved

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.510 
that way the path of the power is moved
upward<00:02:02.910> through<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.270> blocks<00:02:04.250> bring<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.370> out

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
upward through the blocks bring it out

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.950 
upward through the blocks bring it out
in<00:02:05.640> just<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.970> little<00:02:06.000> bit<00:02:06.330> this<00:02:06.480> is<00:02:06.540> gonna<00:02:06.780> be

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
in just a little bit this is gonna be

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.770 
in just a little bit this is gonna be
our<00:02:06.990> wiring<00:02:07.410> path<00:02:07.950> now<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.910> course<00:02:09.119> in<00:02:09.510> your

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
our wiring path now of course in your

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.170 
our wiring path now of course in your
world<00:02:10.140> however<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.830> need<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.010> do<00:02:11.310> this<00:02:11.580> go

world however you need to do this go

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.580 
world however you need to do this go
ahead<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.450> wire<00:02:12.600> it<00:02:12.630> differently<00:02:13.290> depending

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
ahead and wire it differently depending

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.300 
ahead and wire it differently depending
on<00:02:13.950> your<00:02:14.100> needs<00:02:17.750> all<00:02:18.750> right<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.230> now<00:02:20.070> I<00:02:20.130> have

on your needs all right and now I have

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.490 
on your needs all right and now I have
both<00:02:20.459> of<00:02:20.520> my<00:02:20.700> redstone<00:02:21.600> torches<00:02:21.930> set<00:02:22.260> up<00:02:22.350> the

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
both of my redstone torches set up the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.190 
both of my redstone torches set up the
power<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:23.100> Pistons<00:02:23.690> then<00:02:24.690> we're<00:02:24.870> going<00:02:25.080> to

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
power the Pistons then we're going to

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.000 
power the Pistons then we're going to
wire<00:02:25.500> them<00:02:25.860> both<00:02:26.130> together<00:02:29.330> awesome<00:02:31.010> I'm

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
wire them both together awesome I'm

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.380 
wire them both together awesome I'm
gonna<00:02:32.130> go<00:02:32.310> ahead<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.670> get<00:02:32.820> out<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:32.970> grass<00:02:33.360> block

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
gonna go ahead and get out a grass block

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.440 
gonna go ahead and get out a grass block
as<00:02:33.990> well<00:02:34.020> just<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.160> make<00:02:35.340> this<00:02:35.490> look<00:02:35.550> nice<00:02:36.090> and

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
as well just to make this look nice and

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.160 
as well just to make this look nice and
pretty<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.940> then<00:02:39.420> place<00:02:39.630> your<00:02:39.660> lever<00:02:39.959> down

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
pretty and then place your lever down

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.740 
pretty and then place your lever down
and<00:02:40.440> now<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:40.860> can<00:02:41.130> see<00:02:41.340> as<00:02:41.520> I<00:02:41.550> toggle<00:02:42.030> the

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
and now you can see as I toggle the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.820 
and now you can see as I toggle the
lever<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.880> back<00:02:44.880> Pistons<00:02:45.480> move<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.200> push<00:02:46.590> the

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
lever the back Pistons move and push the

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.160 
lever the back Pistons move and push the
two<00:02:47.010> front<00:02:47.340> ones<00:02:47.580> are<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.120> two<00:02:48.300> inside<00:02:48.810> blocks

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
two front ones are the two inside blocks

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.470 
two front ones are the two inside blocks
forward<00:02:49.739> but<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.040> top<00:02:50.220> ones<00:02:50.489> do<00:02:50.760> not<00:02:50.790> or<00:02:51.300> the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
forward but the top ones do not or the

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.540 
forward but the top ones do not or the
the<00:02:52.019> middle<00:02:52.200> ones<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.680> push<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.040> wall<00:02:53.190> forward

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
the middle ones to push the wall forward

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.000 
the middle ones to push the wall forward
don't<00:02:53.880> move<00:02:54.150> how<00:02:55.080> you<00:02:55.110> do<00:02:55.380> this<00:02:55.590> place<00:02:55.980> a

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
don't move how you do this place a

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.360 
don't move how you do this place a
couple<00:02:56.430> blocks<00:02:56.610> right<00:02:57.209> on<00:02:57.390> top<00:02:58.040> bring<00:02:59.040> it<00:02:59.190> out

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
couple blocks right on top bring it out

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.280 
couple blocks right on top bring it out
just<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.850> bit<00:03:00.000> now<00:03:00.150> it's<00:03:00.330> very<00:03:00.660> important<00:03:01.140> that

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
just a bit now it's very important that

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.930 
just a bit now it's very important that
this<00:03:01.410> redstone<00:03:01.830> trail<00:03:02.220> that<00:03:02.400> we're<00:03:02.550> about<00:03:02.670> to

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
this redstone trail that we're about to

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.300 
this redstone trail that we're about to
run<00:03:03.120> does<00:03:03.480> not<00:03:03.720> touch<00:03:04.050> our<00:03:04.290> existing<00:03:04.830> pistons

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
run does not touch our existing pistons

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.470 
run does not touch our existing pistons
if<00:03:06.269> that<00:03:06.989> occurs<00:03:07.590> then<00:03:08.310> it<00:03:08.550> will<00:03:08.760> essentially

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
if that occurs then it will essentially

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.560 
if that occurs then it will essentially
short<00:03:10.080> your<00:03:10.410> machine<00:03:10.800> and<00:03:11.160> it<00:03:11.730> won't<00:03:11.970> work<00:03:12.239> so

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
short your machine and it won't work so

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.280 
short your machine and it won't work so
then<00:03:13.290> go<00:03:14.250> ahead<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.459> run<00:03:14.880> this<00:03:15.150> wiring<00:03:15.480> up<00:03:15.930> and

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
then go ahead and run this wiring up and

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.890 
then go ahead and run this wiring up and
put<00:03:16.860> it<00:03:16.980> on<00:03:17.160> top<00:03:17.550> of<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:18.120> Pistons<00:03:18.570> that<00:03:18.810> we

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
put it on top of the Pistons that we

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.750 
put it on top of the Pistons that we
need<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.260> push<00:03:19.440> forward<00:03:19.800> so<00:03:20.130> I<00:03:20.160> just<00:03:20.519> added

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
need to push forward so I just added

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.850 
need to push forward so I just added
onto<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.360> back<00:03:21.510> here<00:03:21.900> brought<00:03:22.470> it<00:03:22.590> up<00:03:22.709> and

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
onto the back here brought it up and

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.479 
onto the back here brought it up and
around<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.430> have<00:03:24.120> my<00:03:24.300> two<00:03:25.160> connections<00:03:26.160> right

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
around and have my two connections right

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.670 
around and have my two connections right
there<00:03:26.790> so<00:03:27.420> now<00:03:27.600> it's<00:03:27.870> gonna<00:03:27.989> look<00:03:28.200> goofy<00:03:28.440> at

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
there so now it's gonna look goofy at

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.300 
there so now it's gonna look goofy at
first

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
first

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.550 
first
oops<00:03:29.459> fell<00:03:30.209> off<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.540> back

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
oops fell off the back

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.460 
oops fell off the back
but<00:03:32.520> now<00:03:32.730> as<00:03:32.910> we<00:03:32.940> toggle<00:03:33.510> it<00:03:33.599> you<00:03:33.840> can<00:03:34.020> see<00:03:34.230> the

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
but now as we toggle it you can see the

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.250 
but now as we toggle it you can see the
wall<00:03:34.680> comes<00:03:35.280> forward<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:35.760> pulls<00:03:36.030> back<00:03:36.300> now

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
wall comes forward and pulls back now

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.870 
wall comes forward and pulls back now
that's<00:03:37.560> that's<00:03:37.800> really<00:03:38.040> all<00:03:38.250> there<00:03:38.400> is<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.760> it

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
that's that's really all there is to it

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.490 
that's that's really all there is to it
if<00:03:39.000> you<00:03:39.120> guys<00:03:39.239> have<00:03:39.450> any<00:03:39.599> problems<00:03:40.110> with<00:03:40.319> it

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
if you guys have any problems with it

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.770 
if you guys have any problems with it
just<00:03:41.220> go<00:03:41.370> ahead<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:41.670> make<00:03:41.790> sure<00:03:41.970> that<00:03:42.180> both<00:03:42.540> of

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
just go ahead and make sure that both of

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.320 
just go ahead and make sure that both of
your<00:03:42.900> side<00:03:43.200> pistons<00:03:43.770> are<00:03:44.069> set<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.640> four<00:03:44.940> ticks

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
your side pistons are set the four ticks

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.470 
your side pistons are set the four ticks
and<00:03:45.630> then<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.290> wall<00:03:46.650> or<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.069> the<00:03:47.819> top<00:03:48.120> of<00:03:48.330> it

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
and then the wall or the the top of it

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.640 
and then the wall or the the top of it
is<00:03:48.930> set<00:03:49.349> to<00:03:49.610> or<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:51.120> wiring<00:03:51.330> run<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:52.349> the<00:03:52.470> top

is set to or the wiring run to the top
of<00:03:52.860> your<00:03:53.040> build<00:03:53.730> is<00:03:54.030> not<00:03:54.360> touching<00:03:55.200> your

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
of your build is not touching your
