00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.360

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.360
 but 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:47.320
 is a marriage that was treated when 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.320

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.739
 well there they were at the wedding is like a 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:17.269
 not old that does not finish confirming if 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:19.580

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:22.220

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.050
 I spoke with Matías on Friday at ease 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.850
 being that good and he told me he had 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.080
 a marriage but he never told me about a 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.080
 girlfriend we talk long and hard 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:56.010
 clear that the fire never 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.830
 It's so serious that we doubt the game 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.150
 you can confirm we have matías can 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:15.170
 play habitually with relation or by 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.170
 there because it can not be very pretty 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.480

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.950
 who married look this is the authentic 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.150
 decadent that is the case of the harrow 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.530
 that the world is known not by the name 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.770

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.230

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:36.090
