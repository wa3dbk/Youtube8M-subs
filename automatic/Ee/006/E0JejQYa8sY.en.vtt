 we will come first 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.779
 body position it is always recommended 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.330
 to stretch out the arms like here 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.339
 in the example if you have a certain height 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.800
 you should have reached you 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:25.579
 sit back or the body not to 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.619
 Pull handlebar 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:30.769
 so you can relax then the willi 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.909
 drive something in advance please think 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.430
 always on your protective clothing 

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:36.440
 Motorcyclists in t-shirt and short 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.570
 Do not get trousers like let's do it 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.570
 respect and you do not want to 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.329
 in a wheelchair on the back wheel drive 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:47.600
 Let's start for those who need it 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.489
 we before the clutch and the throttle 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.250
 However, we start something important 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.530
 in advance if you try a video then 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.640
 you should always use the right foot 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.649
 Be over the brake 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.719
 this could be in the emergency 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.699
 get the front wheel back on the ground or 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:05.840
 vidic control the 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:08.869
 So let's go first 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.820
 insert gear and drive slowly now 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.770
 we accelerate in the first gear until we 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.640
 about one third of the maximum speed 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.460
 achieved 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.170
 then we pull with a maximum of two 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.780
 finger the clutch like this 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.710
 example increase the gas and let the 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.720
 Clutch jump 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.430
 This must be done pretty fast 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.000
 happen and requires a bit 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.310
 exercise caution gives little at the beginning 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.200
 gas if you the clutch jump load 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.420
 and then increased piece by piece 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.960
 otherwise you lie down quickly on the 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.290
 nose 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.969
 Here again in the first gear up to about 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.130
 one-third of the maximum speed 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:44.990
 accelerate the clutch with a 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.030
 pull a maximum of two fingers 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.020
 increase the gas and then the clutch 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.719
 let it jump 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.090
 And do not forget the foot always over 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:54.770
 Keep the foot brake then it just means 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.810
 practice practicing again 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.909
 you should not rush and the 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.100
 Take it easy for a perfect 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.289
