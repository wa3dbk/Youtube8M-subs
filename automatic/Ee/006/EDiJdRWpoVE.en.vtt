hi<00:00:14.790> I'm<00:00:14.970> Vicky<00:00:15.390> with<00:00:15.630> conde<00:00:16.110> technical

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
hi I'm Vicky with conde technical

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.620 
hi I'm Vicky with conde technical
support<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.340> today<00:00:17.700> I'm<00:00:17.970> going<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.360> talk

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
support and today I'm going to talk

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.500 
support and today I'm going to talk
about<00:00:18.870> the<00:00:19.320> differences<00:00:19.860> of<00:00:19.920> tile<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.850> how

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
about the differences of tile and how

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.170 
about the differences of tile and how
and<00:00:21.900> when<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.529> would<00:00:22.680> use<00:00:22.950> a<00:00:23.190> green<00:00:23.760> heat

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
and when you would use a green heat

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.019 
and when you would use a green heat
conductive<00:00:24.600> rubber<00:00:24.810> pad<00:00:25.110> okay<00:00:26.040> so<00:00:26.100> we<00:00:26.580> do<00:00:26.760> some

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
conductive rubber pad okay so we do some

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.999 
conductive rubber pad okay so we do some
tile<00:00:27.300> with<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.750> heat<00:00:28.080> conductive<00:00:28.529> rubber<00:00:28.740> pad

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
tile with the heat conductive rubber pad

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.790 
tile with the heat conductive rubber pad
and<00:00:29.310> we<00:00:29.400> do<00:00:29.640> some<00:00:29.880> tile<00:00:30.180> without<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.810> I'm<00:00:31.560> not

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
and we do some tile without it I'm not

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.980 
and we do some tile without it I'm not
here<00:00:31.950> to<00:00:32.040> talk<00:00:32.220> about<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.669> temperature<00:00:33.240> are

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:33.990 
here to talk about the temperature are

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.290 
here to talk about the temperature are
the<00:00:34.020> instructions<00:00:34.770> about<00:00:35.130> time<00:00:35.550> temperature

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
the instructions about time temperature

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.370 
the instructions about time temperature
and<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:37.370> versus<00:00:38.370> one<00:00:39.180> size<00:00:39.480> versus<00:00:40.079> another

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
and and versus one size versus another

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.710 
and and versus one size versus another
all<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.100> want<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.550> accomplish<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.390> video

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
all I want to accomplish in this video

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.200 
all I want to accomplish in this video
is<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.590> know<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.920> difference<00:00:44.399> on<00:00:44.640> how<00:00:45.149> to

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
is to know the difference on how to

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.049 
is to know the difference on how to
press<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.780> tile<00:00:46.020> meaning<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.590> layers

or no heat conductive rubber pad so

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.540 
or no heat conductive rubber pad so
we're<00:00:55.559> not<00:00:55.649> going<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.890> get<00:00:56.100> into<00:00:56.340> anything

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
we're not going to get into anything

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.729 
we're not going to get into anything
else<00:00:56.879> but<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.239> do<00:00:57.300> want<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.780> show<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.079> get<00:00:58.469> an<00:00:58.590> up

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
else but I do want to show you get an up

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.750 
else but I do want to show you get an up
close<00:00:58.769> a<00:00:59.340> tight<00:01:00.300> shot<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:01.010> when<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.339> how<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
close a tight shot of when and how the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.700 
close a tight shot of when and how the
tile<00:01:03.059> looks<00:01:03.089> on<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.660> back<00:01:03.839> which<00:01:04.379> will<00:01:04.500> help

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
tile looks on the back which will help

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.440 
tile looks on the back which will help
determine<00:01:04.980> when<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.580> use<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.790> heat<00:01:06.030> conductive

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
determine when you use a heat conductive

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.190 
determine when you use a heat conductive
rubber<00:01:06.690> pad<00:01:06.960> for<00:01:07.880> transferring<00:01:08.880> onto<00:01:09.030> tile<00:01:09.390> so

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
rubber pad for transferring onto tile so

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
rubber pad for transferring onto tile so
let's<00:01:11.130> get<00:01:11.280> started<00:01:11.670> on<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:13.160> alright<00:01:14.160> so

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
let's get started on that alright so

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.940 
let's get started on that alright so
what<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.030> want<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.570> establish<00:01:15.720> here<00:01:16.500> with<00:01:16.770> these

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
what I want to establish here with these

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.710 
what I want to establish here with these
sample<00:01:17.549> tiles<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:20.520> raised<00:01:20.790> areas<00:01:21.390> on<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
sample tiles is the raised areas on the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.499 
sample tiles is the raised areas on the
back<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.140> tile<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:23.150> when<00:01:24.150> you're<00:01:24.299> using

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
back of the tile so when you're using

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.840 
back of the tile so when you're using
the<00:01:24.780> heat<00:01:24.960> conductive<00:01:25.500> pad<00:01:25.829> you<00:01:26.430> should<00:01:26.670> look

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
the heat conductive pad you should look

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.789 
the heat conductive pad you should look
for<00:01:27.180> on<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.659> back<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.049> tile<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.590> should

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
for on the back of the tile you should

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.030 
for on the back of the tile you should
be<00:01:28.920> looking<00:01:29.340> for<00:01:29.930> areas<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:30.960> are<00:01:31.229> raised<00:01:31.619> and

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
be looking for areas that are raised and

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.310 
be looking for areas that are raised and
what<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.189> mean<00:01:32.460> by<00:01:32.520> raised<00:01:32.970> meaning<00:01:33.600> this

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
what I mean by raised meaning this

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.990 
what I mean by raised meaning this
particular<00:01:34.920> tile<00:01:36.079> has<00:01:37.079> lines<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.070> this

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
particular tile has lines in it and this

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.499 
particular tile has lines in it and this
square<00:01:39.560> Center<00:01:40.560> here<00:01:40.860> where<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.909> lines<00:01:42.180> look

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
square Center here where the lines look

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.550 
square Center here where the lines look
like<00:01:42.719> speed<00:01:43.469> bumps<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.189> they're<00:01:44.369> there<00:01:44.729> higher

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
like speed bumps so they're there higher

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.340 
like speed bumps so they're there higher
so<00:01:46.560> what's<00:01:47.009> going<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.219> happen<00:01:48.020> if<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.110> don't

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
so what's going to happen if you don't

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.620 
so what's going to happen if you don't
get<00:01:49.560> equal<00:01:49.950> distribution<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.850> heat<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.329> when

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
get equal distribution of heat is when

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.170 
get equal distribution of heat is when
you<00:01:51.719> turn<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.110> tile<00:01:52.380> over<00:01:52.950> you're<00:01:53.729> gonna<00:01:53.850> see

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
you turn the tile over you're gonna see

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.050 
you turn the tile over you're gonna see
like<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.049> checkerboard<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:56.340> using<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> heat

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
like a checkerboard so using the heat

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.600 
like a checkerboard so using the heat
conductive<00:01:57.570> rubber<00:01:57.810> pad<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.610> important

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
conductive rubber pad is important

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.139 
conductive rubber pad is important
because<00:02:00.649> it<00:02:01.649> will<00:02:01.770> help<00:02:02.189> distribute<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.850> heat

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
because it will help distribute the heat

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.749 
because it will help distribute the heat
better<00:02:03.380> with<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.530> padding<00:02:04.979> versus<00:02:05.430> without

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
better with the padding versus without

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.160 
better with the padding versus without
it<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.090> that's<00:02:06.450> what<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.869> want<00:02:07.079> to

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
it and that's what you want to

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.510 
it and that's what you want to
accomplish<00:02:08.420> this<00:02:09.420> 12-inch<00:02:10.020> tile<00:02:10.410> here<00:02:10.860> now

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
accomplish this 12-inch tile here now

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.670 
accomplish this 12-inch tile here now
this<00:02:12.000> is<00:02:12.150> what<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.390> brought<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.170> one<00:02:13.350> out<00:02:13.530> is

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
this is what I brought this one out is

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.390 
this is what I brought this one out is
that<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.190> can<00:02:14.340> be<00:02:14.460> deceiving<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.210> that<00:02:15.990> is

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
that it can be deceiving and that is

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.949 
that it can be deceiving and that is
that<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.520> looks<00:02:17.760> like<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.240> could<00:02:18.420> go<00:02:18.600> without

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
that it looks like you could go without

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.080 
that it looks like you could go without
the<00:02:19.290> heat<00:02:19.500> conductive<00:02:19.980> rubber<00:02:20.190> pad<00:02:20.489> however

and<00:02:21.620> that's<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.739> reason<00:02:23.190> I<00:02:23.250> say<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.640> that

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
and that's the reason I say that is that

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.330 
and that's the reason I say that is that
these<00:02:24.269> check

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
these check

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.740

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
the texture of it it's quite flat it's

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.700 
the texture of it it's quite flat it's
it's<00:02:33.030> just<00:02:33.270> slightly<00:02:33.780> textured<00:02:34.200> it's<00:02:34.500> not

it's just slightly textured it's not

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.000 
it's just slightly textured it's not

now<00:02:44.240> what's<00:02:45.240> deceiving<00:02:45.810> about<00:02:46.050> this<00:02:46.290> tile<00:02:46.560> is

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
now what's deceiving about this tile is

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.210 
now what's deceiving about this tile is
around<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.520> edge<00:02:48.290> this<00:02:49.290> is<00:02:49.350> a<00:02:49.590> higher<00:02:49.860> raised

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
around the edge this is a higher raised

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.730 
around the edge this is a higher raised
area<00:02:50.820> where<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.660> square<00:02:51.960> is<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.560> goes

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
area where the square is that goes

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.590 
area where the square is that goes
around<00:02:52.890> all<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.730> way<00:02:53.760> around<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.210> edge<00:02:54.360> of

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
around all the way around the edge of

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.650 
around all the way around the edge of
the<00:02:54.950> 12-inch<00:02:55.950> tile<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.000> want<00:02:57.240> to<00:02:57.330> look<00:02:57.510> for

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
the 12-inch tile so you want to look for

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.260 
the 12-inch tile so you want to look for
things<00:02:57.930> like<00:02:58.050> that<00:02:58.470> as<00:02:58.650> well<00:02:58.790> now<00:03:01.460> if<00:03:02.460> you<00:03:02.670> if

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
things like that as well now if you if

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.420 
things like that as well now if you if
you<00:03:03.450> press<00:03:03.780> these<00:03:04.020> tiles<00:03:04.350> without<00:03:04.830> using<00:03:05.310> the

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
you press these tiles without using the

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.820 
you press these tiles without using the
conductive<00:03:05.940> pad<00:03:06.180> then<00:03:07.050> what<00:03:07.530> you're<00:03:07.680> going<00:03:07.770> to

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
conductive pad then what you're going to

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.480 
conductive pad then what you're going to
get<00:03:08.100> is<00:03:08.400> is<00:03:08.870> light<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.050> dark<00:03:10.110> places<00:03:10.620> you're

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
get is is light and dark places you're

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.670 
get is is light and dark places you're
going<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:11.700> get<00:03:11.820> lines<00:03:12.060> it's<00:03:12.960> not<00:03:13.260> going<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.530> be

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
going to get lines it's not going to be

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.770 
going to get lines it's not going to be
equally<00:03:14.190> distributed<00:03:14.940> your<00:03:15.060> image<00:03:15.450> is<00:03:15.630> going

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
equally distributed your image is going

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.230 
equally distributed your image is going
to<00:03:15.840> have<00:03:16.110> um<00:03:16.380> it's<00:03:17.340> going<00:03:17.550> to<00:03:17.610> look<00:03:17.790> light<00:03:18.060> and

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.190 
to have um it's going to look light and
dark<00:03:18.450> it's<00:03:18.660> going<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:18.840> look<00:03:19.020> like<00:03:19.140> a

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
dark it's going to look like a

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.230 
dark it's going to look like a
checkerboard<00:03:19.530> probably<00:03:20.490> on<00:03:20.640> this<00:03:20.880> one<00:03:21.060> you

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
checkerboard probably on this one you

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.660 
checkerboard probably on this one you
might<00:03:21.480> get<00:03:21.720> lucky<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.320> not<00:03:22.560> happened<00:03:22.980> but

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
might get lucky and it not happened but

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.450 
might get lucky and it not happened but
it's<00:03:23.850> better<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.420> be<00:03:24.570> consistently<00:03:25.460> perfect

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
it's better to be consistently perfect

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.400 
it's better to be consistently perfect
when<00:03:26.880> you<00:03:27.000> press<00:03:27.270> these<00:03:27.480> tiles<00:03:27.900> if<00:03:28.050> you<00:03:28.140> can

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
when you press these tiles if you can

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.490 
when you press these tiles if you can
rather<00:03:29.250> than<00:03:29.490> take<00:03:29.730> chances<00:03:30.270> on<00:03:30.510> not<00:03:31.080> using

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
rather than take chances on not using

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.910 
rather than take chances on not using
the<00:03:31.590> pad<00:03:31.800> so<00:03:32.580> this<00:03:33.150> pad<00:03:33.450> is<00:03:33.860> important<00:03:34.860> to

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
the pad so this pad is important to

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.640 
the pad so this pad is important to
purchase<00:03:35.430> should<00:03:36.330> you<00:03:36.540> be<00:03:36.690> pressing<00:03:37.170> multiple

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
purchase should you be pressing multiple

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.250 
purchase should you be pressing multiple
types<00:03:37.890> of<00:03:38.100> tiles<00:03:38.490> now<00:03:39.030> don't<00:03:39.300> assume<00:03:39.660> always

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
types of tiles now don't assume always

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.680 
types of tiles now don't assume always
that<00:03:40.850> they're<00:03:41.850> always<00:03:42.030> going<00:03:42.270> to<00:03:42.330> look<00:03:42.540> the

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
that they're always going to look the

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.320 
that they're always going to look the
same<00:03:42.720> on<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.260> back<00:03:43.440> because<00:03:43.830> our<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.910> vendor

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
same on the back because our the vendor

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.030 
same on the back because our the vendor
does<00:03:45.540> change<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.200> way<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.440> back<00:03:46.590> of<00:03:46.740> the<00:03:46.830> tile

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
does change the way the back of the tile

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.340 
does change the way the back of the tile
looks<00:03:47.370> but<00:03:48.030> what's<00:03:48.240> important<00:03:48.810> is<00:03:48.960> that<00:03:48.990> you

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
looks but what's important is that you

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.280 
looks but what's important is that you
learn<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:50.130> difference<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.820> win<00:03:51.090> as<00:03:51.360> to<00:03:52.110> when

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
learn the difference to win as to when

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.080 
learn the difference to win as to when
to<00:03:52.320> use<00:03:52.770> the<00:03:52.950> heat<00:03:53.100> conductive<00:03:53.550> pad<00:03:53.760> and<00:03:53.970> when

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
to use the heat conductive pad and when

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.770 
to use the heat conductive pad and when
not<00:03:54.300> to<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.870> so<00:03:55.680> I'm<00:03:55.890> trying<00:03:56.070> to<00:03:56.310> demonstrate

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
not to and so I'm trying to demonstrate

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.280 
not to and so I'm trying to demonstrate
that<00:03:57.780> in<00:03:58.020> this<00:03:58.140> video<00:03:58.410> so<00:03:59.280> as<00:03:59.640> with<00:03:59.970> every<00:04:00.330> tile

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
that in this video so as with every tile

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.310 
that in this video so as with every tile
you're<00:04:01.800> always<00:04:01.980> going<00:04:02.280> to<00:04:02.310> use<00:04:02.520> the<00:04:02.700> felt<00:04:02.970> pad

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
you're always going to use the felt pad

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.699 
you're always going to use the felt pad
but<00:04:04.320> with<00:04:05.070> particular<00:04:05.459> tiles<00:04:06.090> like<00:04:06.240> these

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
but with particular tiles like these

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.350 
but with particular tiles like these
with<00:04:07.709> many<00:04:08.100> more<00:04:08.340> that<00:04:08.760> I<00:04:08.790> haven't<00:04:09.030> sampled

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
with many more that I haven't sampled

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.520 
with many more that I haven't sampled
here<00:04:09.780> but<00:04:10.700> these<00:04:11.700> particular<00:04:11.970> tiles<00:04:12.540> you<00:04:13.290> it

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
here but these particular tiles you it

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.199 
here but these particular tiles you it
will<00:04:13.680> require<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.130> pad<00:04:14.400> so<00:04:14.640> make<00:04:14.790> sure<00:04:14.820> you<00:04:15.060> have

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
will require a pad so make sure you have

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.910 
will require a pad so make sure you have
one<00:04:15.450> and<00:04:15.660> then<00:04:16.230> we're<00:04:16.380> going<00:04:16.470> to<00:04:16.560> talk<00:04:16.739> about

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
one and then we're going to talk about

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.800 
one and then we're going to talk about
the<00:04:17.640> felt<00:04:17.910> and<00:04:18.090> I'm<00:04:18.180> going<00:04:18.299> to<00:04:18.359> show<00:04:18.480> you<00:04:18.510> some

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
the felt and I'm going to show you some

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.130 
the felt and I'm going to show you some
samples<00:04:19.260> of<00:04:19.410> that<00:04:19.560> as<00:04:19.680> well<00:04:20.540> alright<00:04:21.540> so<00:04:21.840> these

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
samples of that as well alright so these

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.470 
samples of that as well alright so these
are<00:04:22.320> some<00:04:22.470> samples<00:04:22.920> of<00:04:23.010> tile<00:04:23.760> that's<00:04:24.150> not

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
are some samples of tile that's not

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.720 
are some samples of tile that's not
required<00:04:24.690> to<00:04:25.590> use<00:04:25.770> a<00:04:25.800> heat<00:04:26.040> conductive<00:04:26.490> rubber

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
required to use a heat conductive rubber

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.080 
required to use a heat conductive rubber
pad<00:04:27.030> and<00:04:27.420> I'm<00:04:28.410> going<00:04:28.620> to<00:04:28.680> say<00:04:29.010> again<00:04:29.310> that<00:04:29.640> the

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
pad and I'm going to say again that the

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.180 
pad and I'm going to say again that the
backs<00:04:30.330> are<00:04:30.630> not<00:04:30.810> always<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:31.380> same<00:04:31.620> but<00:04:31.980> the

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
backs are not always the same but the

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.540 
backs are not always the same but the
main<00:04:32.340> thing<00:04:32.580> you<00:04:32.700> want<00:04:32.880> to<00:04:32.910> look<00:04:33.030> for<00:04:33.330> is<00:04:34.550> the

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
main thing you want to look for is the

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.330 
main thing you want to look for is the
smaller<00:04:36.320> are<00:04:37.320> the<00:04:37.500> less<00:04:37.740> texture

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
smaller are the less texture

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.060 
smaller are the less texture
areas<00:04:39.120> on<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.480> back<00:04:39.690> meaning<00:04:40.080> not<00:04:40.710> looking

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
areas on the back meaning not looking

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.490 
areas on the back meaning not looking
like<00:04:41.280> an<00:04:41.550> empty<00:04:41.790> square<00:04:42.210> here<00:04:42.600> or<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.230> speed

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
like an empty square here or the speed

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.590 
like an empty square here or the speed
bumps<00:04:43.860> as<00:04:43.980> I<00:04:44.100> had<00:04:44.280> demonstrated<00:04:44.970> with<00:04:45.570> the

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
bumps as I had demonstrated with the

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.810 
bumps as I had demonstrated with the
heat<00:04:45.840> conductive<00:04:46.290> pad<00:04:46.500> but<00:04:47.220> what<00:04:47.400> you<00:04:47.580> want<00:04:47.790> to

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
heat conductive pad but what you want to

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.150 
heat conductive pad but what you want to
look<00:04:47.970> for<00:04:48.300> is<00:04:48.540> that<00:04:48.570> there's<00:04:49.080> not<00:04:49.229> much<00:04:49.470> raised

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
look for is that there's not much raised

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.790 
look for is that there's not much raised
area<00:04:50.699> from<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.360> back<00:04:51.540> of<00:04:52.169> the<00:04:52.290> tile<00:04:52.560> being

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
area from the back of the tile being

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.550 
area from the back of the tile being
flat<00:04:53.130> versus<00:04:53.729> this<00:04:54.240> honeycomb<00:04:54.600> effect<00:04:55.350> and

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
flat versus this honeycomb effect and

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.040 
flat versus this honeycomb effect and
the<00:04:55.949> honeycomb<00:04:56.250> effect<00:04:56.850> most<00:04:57.120> of<00:04:57.360> these<00:04:57.510> tiles

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
the honeycomb effect most of these tiles

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.320 
the honeycomb effect most of these tiles
and<00:04:58.260> most<00:04:59.160> I'm<00:04:59.550> gonna<00:04:59.639> go<00:04:59.790> and<00:04:59.880> say<00:05:00.030> all<00:05:00.300> of

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
and most I'm gonna go and say all of

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.290 
and most I'm gonna go and say all of
these<00:05:00.630> tiles<00:05:01.020> with<00:05:01.199> the<00:05:01.290> honeycomb<00:05:01.560> back<00:05:02.300> can

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
these tiles with the honeycomb back can

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.060 
these tiles with the honeycomb back can
be<00:05:03.330> pressed<00:05:03.840> without<00:05:04.260> the<00:05:04.410> heat<00:05:04.590> conductive

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
be pressed without the heat conductive

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.450 
be pressed without the heat conductive
rubber<00:05:05.280> pad<00:05:05.580> and<00:05:05.910> then<00:05:06.919> some<00:05:07.919> of<00:05:08.040> the<00:05:08.100> deco

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
rubber pad and then some of the deco

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.690 
rubber pad and then some of the deco
tiles<00:05:08.910> as<00:05:09.090> well<00:05:09.320> this<00:05:10.320> tile<00:05:10.620> here<00:05:10.650> has<00:05:11.430> the

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
tiles as well this tile here has the

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.300 
tiles as well this tile here has the
small<00:05:12.000> lines<00:05:12.330> little<00:05:13.290> grid<00:05:13.530> lines<00:05:13.800> that<00:05:14.160> come

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
small lines little grid lines that come

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.890 
small lines little grid lines that come
across<00:05:15.260> horizontally<00:05:16.260> and<00:05:16.440> so<00:05:17.270> it<00:05:18.270> does<00:05:18.660> have

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
across horizontally and so it does have

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.629 
across horizontally and so it does have
a<00:05:18.930> square<00:05:19.290> in<00:05:19.380> the<00:05:19.500> back<00:05:19.650> however<00:05:20.280> the

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
a square in the back however the

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.730 
a square in the back however the
difference<00:05:21.030> between<00:05:21.180> the<00:05:22.080> ones<00:05:22.410> that<00:05:22.650> you

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
difference between the ones that you

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.560 
difference between the ones that you
press<00:05:23.010> with<00:05:23.280> the<00:05:23.430> heat<00:05:23.610> conductive<00:05:24.090> ever<00:05:24.270> pad

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
press with the heat conductive ever pad

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.530 
press with the heat conductive ever pad
that<00:05:24.870> has<00:05:24.930> the<00:05:25.350> square<00:05:25.680> it's<00:05:26.190> not<00:05:26.430> as<00:05:26.639> it's<00:05:27.330> not

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
that has the square it's not as it's not

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.469 
that has the square it's not as it's not
as<00:05:27.750> high<00:05:27.960> these<00:05:28.350> lines<00:05:28.650> are<00:05:28.889> not<00:05:29.010> as<00:05:29.479> they're

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
as high these lines are not as they're

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.450 
as high these lines are not as they're
not<00:05:30.570> it<00:05:30.750> they're<00:05:31.229> not<00:05:31.380> as<00:05:31.500> high<00:05:31.710> as<00:05:31.740> the<00:05:32.280> other

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
not it they're not as high as the other

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.830 
not it they're not as high as the other
ones<00:05:33.139> so<00:05:34.160> these<00:05:35.160> lines<00:05:35.460> are<00:05:35.700> not<00:05:35.729> raised<00:05:36.180> up<00:05:36.570> as

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
ones so these lines are not raised up as

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.439 
ones so these lines are not raised up as
high<00:05:37.410> as<00:05:37.560> the<00:05:37.770> other<00:05:37.889> ones<00:05:38.160> should<00:05:38.400> I<00:05:38.490> say<00:05:38.729> so

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:39.449 
high as the other ones should I say so

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:42.020 
high as the other ones should I say so
basically<00:05:39.900> it's<00:05:40.169> more<00:05:40.410> flat<00:05:40.770> so<00:05:41.070> you<00:05:41.550> don't

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
basically it's more flat so you don't

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.000 
basically it's more flat so you don't
feel<00:05:42.360> as<00:05:42.510> much<00:05:42.690> of<00:05:42.840> a<00:05:42.930> bump<00:05:43.200> here<00:05:43.530> when<00:05:43.710> you<00:05:43.830> run

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
feel as much of a bump here when you run

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.879 
feel as much of a bump here when you run
your<00:05:44.160> hand<00:05:44.370> across<00:05:44.580> it<00:05:44.700> so<00:05:45.200> you<00:05:46.200> can<00:05:46.380> use<00:05:46.620> this

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
your hand across it so you can use this

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.840 
your hand across it so you can use this
type<00:05:47.220> of<00:05:47.250> tile<00:05:48.030> as<00:05:48.300> well<00:05:48.539> with<00:05:49.320> just<00:05:49.950> the<00:05:50.160> felt

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
type of tile as well with just the felt

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.760 
type of tile as well with just the felt
pad<00:05:51.090> and<00:05:51.360> not<00:05:51.389> the<00:05:51.720> heat<00:05:51.900> conductive<00:05:52.320> pad<00:05:52.530> and

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
pad and not the heat conductive pad and

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.159 
pad and not the heat conductive pad and
there's<00:05:53.430> some<00:05:53.639> other<00:05:53.849> ones<00:05:54.090> also<00:05:54.389> that<00:05:54.900> are

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169 
there's some other ones also that are

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:58.010 
there's some other ones also that are
out<00:05:55.349> there<00:05:55.380> that<00:05:55.650> we<00:05:56.010> sell<00:05:56.280> that<00:05:57.030> what<00:05:57.870> you

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
out there that we sell that what you

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.620 
out there that we sell that what you
want<00:05:58.200> to<00:05:58.260> look<00:05:58.410> for<00:05:58.710> is<00:05:59.039> the<00:05:59.970> back<00:06:00.180> of<00:06:00.330> the<00:06:00.419> tile

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
want to look for is the back of the tile

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.860 
want to look for is the back of the tile
not<00:06:00.930> being<00:06:01.289> as<00:06:01.530> having<00:06:02.460> as<00:06:02.669> many<00:06:02.849> raised<00:06:03.240> areas

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
not being as having as many raised areas

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.219 
not being as having as many raised areas
and<00:06:04.789> that<00:06:05.789> would<00:06:06.000> be<00:06:06.090> the<00:06:06.210> difference<00:06:06.360> we've

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
and that would be the difference we've

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:09.230 
and that would be the difference we've
went<00:06:07.470> over<00:06:07.620> the<00:06:08.130> backs<00:06:08.370> of<00:06:08.520> the<00:06:08.610> tiles<00:06:09.000> and

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
went over the backs of the tiles and

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.730 
went over the backs of the tiles and
when<00:06:09.419> to<00:06:09.510> use<00:06:09.690> the<00:06:09.810> heat<00:06:09.990> conductive<00:06:10.440> rubber

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
when to use the heat conductive rubber

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.850 
when to use the heat conductive rubber
pad<00:06:10.950> when<00:06:11.639> not<00:06:11.910> to<00:06:12.180> and<00:06:12.450> what<00:06:13.349> you<00:06:13.500> should<00:06:13.680> know

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
pad when not to and what you should know

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.129 
pad when not to and what you should know
about<00:06:13.889> Thai<00:06:14.820> always<00:06:15.180> make<00:06:15.389> sure<00:06:15.419> you<00:06:15.690> always

from the sublimation instructions the
sizes<00:06:21.810> are<00:06:21.930> different<00:06:22.080> the<00:06:22.680> instructions<00:06:23.190> are

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
sizes are different the instructions are

about letting you know what layers

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.570

you're going to need when you do press a

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.089 
you're going to need when you do press a
variety<00:06:33.180> of<00:06:33.210> tiles<00:06:33.720> so<00:06:34.260> we<00:06:34.380> get<00:06:34.530> the<00:06:34.650> question

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:35.099 
variety of tiles so we get the question

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:37.760 
variety of tiles so we get the question
often<00:06:35.599> about<00:06:36.599> the<00:06:36.660> backs<00:06:36.990> of<00:06:37.200> the<00:06:37.260> tiles<00:06:37.650> and

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
often about the backs of the tiles and

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.830 
often about the backs of the tiles and
it's<00:06:37.919> a<00:06:38.010> little<00:06:38.130> hard<00:06:38.400> to<00:06:38.490> describe<00:06:38.849> so<00:06:38.970> this

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 
it's a little hard to describe so this

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.010 
it's a little hard to describe so this
video<00:06:40.880> serves<00:06:41.880> as<00:06:42.090> a<00:06:42.120> purpose<00:06:42.570> to<00:06:42.599> show<00:06:42.960> you

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630 
the difference in the raised areas and

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.120 
the difference in the raised areas and
when<00:06:45.780> they<00:06:45.930> use<00:06:45.960> the<00:06:46.229> heat<00:06:46.409> conductive<00:06:46.860> over

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.130
