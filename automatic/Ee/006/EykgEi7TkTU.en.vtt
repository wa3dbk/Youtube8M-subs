00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.900 
to be a tournament somewhere so there's
a<00:02:42.150> tournament<00:02:42.920> it's<00:02:43.920> not<00:02:44.130> really<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.310> story<00:02:44.610> arc

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
a tournament it's not really a story arc

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.580 
a tournament it's not really a story arc
but<00:02:45.239> it's<00:02:45.420> it's<00:02:45.810> more<00:02:45.959> like<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.200> training

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.400 

training<00:02:49.610> montage<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:50.819> could<00:02:50.940> say<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.120> guess

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
training montage you could say I guess

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.289 
training montage you could say I guess
it's<00:02:52.410> like<00:02:52.500> they're<00:02:53.130> just<00:02:53.370> getting<00:02:53.910> better

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
it's like they're just getting better

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.120 
it's like they're just getting better
and<00:02:54.569> then<00:02:54.660> fighting<00:02:54.959> in<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.260> tournament<00:02:55.590> and

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
and then fighting in a tournament and

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.520 
and then fighting in a tournament and
getting<00:02:56.760> money<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:59.390> then<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.959> second<00:03:01.350> story

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
getting money and then the second story

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:09.140 
getting money and then the second story
arcs<00:03:01.799> right<00:03:01.980> here<00:03:02.220> with<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:05.640> auction<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:08.150> in

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
arcs right here with the auction and in

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.460 
arcs right here with the auction and in
the<00:03:09.239> beginning<00:03:09.390> it<00:03:09.720> just<00:03:09.900> seems<00:03:10.080> like<00:03:10.170> they're

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
the beginning it just seems like they're

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.080 
the beginning it just seems like they're
trying<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:10.830> buy<00:03:11.010> something<00:03:11.340> from<00:03:11.609> the<00:03:11.730> auction

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
but then it gets really complicated and

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:23.110 
but then it gets really complicated and
I<00:03:13.560> last<00:03:13.799> four<00:03:19.220> lasts<00:03:20.220> all<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:21.000> way<00:03:21.260> to<00:03:22.260> book<00:03:22.410> 12

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.580 
is on the book 18th book and the fourth
one<00:04:07.830> starts<00:04:08.129> in<00:04:08.190> this<00:04:08.310> book<00:04:08.519> also<00:04:09.170> so<00:04:12.590> let's

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
one starts in this book also so let's

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.110 
one starts in this book also so let's

so<00:04:23.030> the<00:04:24.030> art<00:04:24.150> style<00:04:24.740> varies<00:04:25.740> you<00:04:26.040> could<00:04:26.190> say

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
so the art style varies you could say

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.300 
so the art style varies you could say
sometimes<00:04:28.020> it's<00:04:28.200> really<00:04:28.410> detailed<00:04:28.650> and<00:04:29.100> great

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
sometimes it's really detailed and great

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.870 
sometimes it's really detailed and great
but<00:04:29.940> a<00:04:29.970> lot<00:04:30.180> of<00:04:30.330> times<00:04:30.570> it's<00:04:30.960> just<00:04:31.790> you<00:04:32.790> know

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
but a lot of times it's just you know

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.760 
but a lot of times it's just you know
like<00:04:32.970> a<00:04:33.150> couple<00:04:33.270> lines<00:04:33.720> not<00:04:34.020> really<00:04:34.470> much

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
like a couple lines not really much

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.379 
like a couple lines not really much
shading<00:04:35.510> no<00:04:36.510> like<00:04:36.840> no<00:04:37.050> inking<00:04:37.470> well<00:04:37.979> not<00:04:38.130> much

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
shading no like no inking well not much

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.210 
shading no like no inking well not much
it's<00:04:39.389> just<00:04:39.570> like<00:04:39.780> like<00:04:40.470> a<00:04:40.500> pencil<00:04:40.800> drawing<00:04:40.950> you

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
it's just like like a pencil drawing you

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.110 
it's just like like a pencil drawing you
could<00:04:41.370> say<00:04:41.550> like<00:04:42.270> that<00:04:42.510> oh<00:04:43.669> it<00:04:44.669> doesn't<00:04:44.820> really

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
could say like that oh it doesn't really

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.629 
could say like that oh it doesn't really
change<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.960> story<00:04:46.470> much<00:04:46.860> but<00:04:48.860> sometimes<00:04:49.860> the

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
change the story much but sometimes the

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.750 
change the story much but sometimes the
art<00:04:50.820> is<00:04:50.970> really<00:04:51.240> really<00:04:51.690> really<00:04:51.960> great

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
art is really really really great

00:04:52.760 --> 00:05:00.400
