00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
what the Jets did yesterday I think that

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.950 
what the Jets did yesterday I think that
if<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.850> jets<00:01:21.090> are<00:01:21.210> gonna<00:01:21.360> win<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.750> game

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
if the jets are gonna win this game

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.590 
if the jets are gonna win this game
though<00:01:22.200> Mark<00:01:22.830> Sanchez<00:01:23.340> has<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.729> have<00:01:24.390> at<00:01:24.570> least

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
though Mark Sanchez has to have at least

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.020 
though Mark Sanchez has to have at least
as<00:01:25.080> good<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.320> game<00:01:25.500> as<00:01:25.560> he<00:01:25.830> did<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.280> think<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:26.939> a

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
as good a game as he did I think it's a

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.760 
as good a game as he did I think it's a
bit<00:01:27.210> overrated<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.990> game<00:01:28.170> he<00:01:28.380> did<00:01:28.590> have

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770

one<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.710> these<00:01:55.890> teams<00:01:56.159> might<00:01:56.549> have<00:01:56.729> looked<00:01:57.329> at

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
one of these teams might have looked at

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.149 
one of these teams might have looked at
last<00:01:57.689> week<00:01:58.079> as<00:01:58.259> they're<00:01:58.409> super<00:01:58.799> bowl<00:01:58.950> maybe

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
last week as they're super bowl maybe

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.410 
last week as they're super bowl maybe
they<00:01:59.790> didn't<00:02:00.030> mean

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
they didn't mean

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.140 
they didn't mean
too<00:02:00.540> but<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.560> think<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.950> lot<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.189> one<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:03.060> these

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
too but I think a lot of one of these

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.060 
too but I think a lot of one of these
teams<00:02:03.420> might<00:02:03.869> have<00:02:04.020> spent<00:02:04.320> all<00:02:04.439> their<00:02:04.590> energy

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
teams might have spent all their energy

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.760 
teams might have spent all their energy
and<00:02:05.299> last<00:02:06.299> week's<00:02:06.630> putting<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.350> into<00:02:07.500> last

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
and last week's putting it into last

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.969 
and last week's putting it into last
week's<00:02:08.039> game<00:02:08.569> okay<00:02:09.569> here's<00:02:09.840> kjs<00:02:10.470> thoughts<00:02:10.770> on

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
week's game okay here's kjs thoughts on

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:34.870

the<00:02:11.069> Jets<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:32.840> steward<00:02:33.840> will<00:02:34.050> come<00:02:34.380> out

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
the Jets and steward will come out

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.840 
the Jets and steward will come out
stronger<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:35.910> just<00:02:36.330> win<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.569> game<00:02:40.850> see

stronger and just win the game see
what's<00:02:42.030> your<00:02:42.180> thoughts<00:02:42.390> on<00:02:42.569> this<00:02:51.470> lot<00:02:52.470> of

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
what's your thoughts on this lot of

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.960 
what's your thoughts on this lot of
people<00:02:52.739> didn't<00:02:52.920> expect<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.250> beat<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.640> Colts

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
people didn't expect to beat the Colts

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.970 
people didn't expect to beat the Colts
so<00:02:54.600> you<00:02:54.660> know<00:02:54.989> they're<00:02:55.140> definitely<00:02:55.440> playing

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
so you know they're definitely playing

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.900 
so you know they're definitely playing
with<00:02:56.160> something<00:02:56.459> to<00:02:56.519> prove<00:02:56.700> right<00:02:56.940> now<00:02:57.209> but

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
with something to prove right now but

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.289 
with something to prove right now but
are<00:02:59.910> they<00:03:00.180> completely<00:03:00.780> legitimate<00:03:01.380> I<00:03:02.299> would

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
are they completely legitimate I would

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.380 
are they completely legitimate I would
have<00:03:03.569> to<00:03:03.720> say<00:03:03.750> now<00:03:04.290> at<00:03:04.440> this<00:03:04.590> point<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:05.390> mean

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
have to say now at this point I mean

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.030 
have to say now at this point I mean
they<00:03:06.690> beat<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.959> Patriots<00:03:07.410> but<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.590> Patriots

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
they beat the Patriots but the Patriots

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.490 
they beat the Patriots but the Patriots
state<00:03:08.310> they<00:03:08.489> looked<00:03:08.760> they<00:03:09.299> looked<00:03:09.780> lousy<00:03:09.989> kind

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
state they looked they looked lousy kind

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.569 
state they looked they looked lousy kind
of<00:03:10.620> in<00:03:10.739> that<00:03:10.769> game<00:03:11.269> last<00:03:12.269> night<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.840> I<00:03:13.579> don't

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
of in that game last night and I don't

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.099 
of in that game last night and I don't
know<00:03:14.670> i<00:03:14.700> think<00:03:14.880> i<00:03:15.329> think<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.570> steelers<00:03:15.959> will

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
know i think i think the steelers will

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.330 
know i think i think the steelers will
handle<00:03:16.410> them<00:03:16.910> okay<00:03:18.350> all<00:03:19.350> this<00:03:19.650> being<00:03:19.920> said<00:03:20.070> I

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
handle them okay all this being said I

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.759 
handle them okay all this being said I
think<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.910> Jets<00:03:21.420> kind<00:03:21.750> of<00:03:21.900> trash<00:03:22.170> talked<00:03:22.560> a

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
think the Jets kind of trash talked a

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.849 
think the Jets kind of trash talked a
lot<00:03:22.920> last<00:03:22.980> week<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:23.910> I<00:03:24.600> think<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.989> Jets<00:03:25.260> big

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
lot last week and I think the Jets big

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.860 
lot last week and I think the Jets big
goal<00:03:26.160> this<00:03:26.430> year<00:03:26.489> was<00:03:26.850> to<00:03:27.000> beat<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.329> Patriots

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
goal this year was to beat the Patriots

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.170 
goal this year was to beat the Patriots
I<00:03:27.989> really<00:03:28.260> do<00:03:28.410> I<00:03:28.440> think<00:03:28.829> they<00:03:29.340> used<00:03:29.579> so<00:03:29.970> much

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
I really do I think they used so much

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.259 
I really do I think they used so much
energy<00:03:30.480> last<00:03:30.989> week<00:03:31.430> whether<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:32.579> was<00:03:32.640> talking

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
energy last week whether it was talking

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.420 
energy last week whether it was talking
to<00:03:33.359> the<00:03:33.480> media<00:03:33.690> or<00:03:34.440> actually<00:03:34.829> playing<00:03:35.100> in<00:03:35.310> the

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
to the media or actually playing in the

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.360 
to the media or actually playing in the
game<00:03:35.630> and<00:03:36.630> I<00:03:37.140> think<00:03:37.410> in<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.530> way<00:03:37.680> last<00:03:38.040> week

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
game and I think in a way last week

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.310 
game and I think in a way last week
ended<00:03:38.730> up<00:03:38.910> kind<00:03:39.150> of<00:03:39.299> being<00:03:39.510> there<00:03:39.690> super<00:03:40.109> bowl

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
ended up kind of being there super bowl

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.560 
ended up kind of being there super bowl
and<00:03:40.560> while<00:03:41.190> I<00:03:41.220> don't<00:03:41.549> think<00:03:41.760> Rex<00:03:41.970> Ryan<00:03:42.269> looks

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
and while I don't think Rex Ryan looks

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.050 
and while I don't think Rex Ryan looks
at<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:42.900> that<00:03:43.049> way<00:03:43.079> I<00:03:43.500> think<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.069> players<00:03:44.340> use

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
at it that way I think the players use

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.270 
at it that way I think the players use
so<00:03:45.450> much<00:03:45.690> energy<00:03:45.750> in<00:03:46.319> last<00:03:46.560> week<00:03:46.859> last<00:03:47.069> week

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
so much energy in last week last week

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.550 
so much energy in last week last week
was<00:03:47.579> a<00:03:47.609> real<00:03:47.880> grind<00:03:48.120> for<00:03:48.480> them<00:03:48.600> and<00:03:48.840> while<00:03:49.440> the

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
was a real grind for them and while the

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.259 
was a real grind for them and while the
steelers<00:03:49.980> didn't<00:03:50.250> exactly<00:03:50.519> play<00:03:50.910> in<00:03:50.970> an<00:03:51.120> easy

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
steelers didn't exactly play in an easy

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.199 
steelers didn't exactly play in an easy
game<00:03:51.600> either<00:03:51.870> last<00:03:52.230> week<00:03:52.560> you<00:03:53.430> know<00:03:53.549> I<00:03:53.579> I<00:03:53.850> don't

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
game either last week you know I I don't

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.650 
game either last week you know I I don't
think<00:03:54.510> I<00:03:55.220> I<00:03:56.220> don't<00:03:56.790> know<00:03:56.850> her<00:03:56.910> phrases<00:03:57.359> i<00:03:57.480> think

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
think I I don't know her phrases i think

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.330 
think I I don't know her phrases i think
the<00:03:57.780> steelers<00:03:58.139> probably<00:03:58.440> hated<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:58.920> ravens

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
the steelers probably hated the ravens

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.789 
the steelers probably hated the ravens
just<00:03:59.639> as<00:03:59.790> much<00:03:59.970> as<00:04:00.239> agitated<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.260> Patriots

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
just as much as agitated the Patriots

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.440 
just as much as agitated the Patriots
but<00:04:02.280> i<00:04:02.370> think<00:04:02.579> the<00:04:02.700> Steelers<00:04:03.120> were<00:04:03.239> more

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
but i think the Steelers were more

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.630 
but i think the Steelers were more
confident

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
confident

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.040 
confident
and<00:04:04.760> we're<00:04:05.090> just<00:04:05.180> able<00:04:05.390> to<00:04:05.569> go<00:04:05.750> out<00:04:05.840> there<00:04:05.900> and

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
and we're just able to go out there and

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.900 
and we're just able to go out there and
do<00:04:06.230> it<00:04:06.350> the<00:04:06.440> Jets<00:04:06.710> needed<00:04:07.130> to<00:04:07.250> trash<00:04:07.550> talk<00:04:07.850> a

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
do it the Jets needed to trash talk a

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.640 
do it the Jets needed to trash talk a
little<00:04:08.150> more<00:04:08.420> and<00:04:08.720> they<00:04:09.080> need<00:04:09.290> to<00:04:09.410> get

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
little more and they need to get

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.559 
little more and they need to get
themselves<00:04:10.130> pumped<00:04:10.580> up<00:04:10.700> to<00:04:10.880> come<00:04:11.090> out<00:04:11.300> and<00:04:11.450> do

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
themselves pumped up to come out and do

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.300 
themselves pumped up to come out and do
it<00:04:11.600> and<00:04:11.930> I'm<00:04:12.530> not<00:04:12.709> sure<00:04:12.770> they're<00:04:13.069> going<00:04:13.160> to<00:04:13.220> be

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
it and I'm not sure they're going to be

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.800
