 We'll take a closer look 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.060
 especially should be on 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.310
 the surface on the display lid 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.620
 This is so different from others the Pixies 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.550

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.710
 the reconnection 5 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.840
 only with the difference that here an Intel r is to escape f50 for word 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.990
 the beating the barrel 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.080

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.990
 the power supply 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.520

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.280
 will be answered 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.370
 if we do it all first 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.310
 because the bird then stand out 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.540

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.700
