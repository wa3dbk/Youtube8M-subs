the things obviously one of the things
that's<00:00:15.719> nice<00:00:15.870> about<00:00:15.929> it<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.379> it's<00:00:16.590> free

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830

I've played some of the other free MMO
is<00:00:19.080> just<00:00:19.260> experimenting<00:00:19.890> with<00:00:19.920> them<00:00:20.130> and

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
is just experimenting with them and

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.950 
is just experimenting with them and
stuff<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.970> think<00:00:21.180> this<00:00:21.270> one<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.840> little

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
stuff and I think this one is a little

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.810 
stuff and I think this one is a little
more<00:00:22.199> well-put-together<00:00:23.160> than<00:00:23.460> some<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.730> them

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
more well-put-together than some of them

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
one of the things I like about it is the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.859 
one of the things I like about it is the
graphics<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.670> think<00:00:27.029> they<00:00:27.119> look<00:00:27.240> pretty<00:00:27.449> good<00:00:27.570> I

really<00:01:37.140> like<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.439> combat<00:01:37.799> system<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.640> was

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
really like the combat system it was

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.550 
really like the combat system it was
supposed<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.240> be<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.540> most<00:01:39.659> engaging<00:01:40.110> or

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
supposed to be the most engaging or

whatever combat system on on the market
to<00:01:43.229> be<00:01:43.350> honest<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.890> amounts<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.310> me<00:01:44.610> selecting

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
to be honest it amounts to me selecting

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.850 
to be honest it amounts to me selecting
a<00:01:45.540> target<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.990> then<00:01:46.320> making<00:01:46.590> sure<00:01:46.680> I'm

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
a target and then making sure I'm

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.859 
a target and then making sure I'm
pointing<00:01:47.130> at<00:01:47.340> them<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:48.180> every<00:01:48.509> once<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.810> a

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
pointing at them and every once in a

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.270 
pointing at them and every once in a
while<00:01:49.020> I'll<00:01:49.259> remember<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.619> reduce<00:01:50.130> their

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
while I'll remember to reduce their

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.710 
while I'll remember to reduce their
armor<00:01:50.490> class<00:01:50.670> slightly<00:01:51.060> with<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.210> sunder<00:01:51.540> armor

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
armor class slightly with a sunder armor

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.649 
armor class slightly with a sunder armor
that's<00:01:52.290> about<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.220> not<00:01:53.670> really<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.149> exciting

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
that's about it not really that exciting

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.109 
that's about it not really that exciting
the<00:01:55.380> cleric<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.009> i<00:01:56.070> was<00:01:56.189> playing<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.670> even

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
the cleric that i was playing is even

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.670 
the cleric that i was playing is even
less<00:01:57.299> interesting<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.020> he<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.409> buffs

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
less interesting and that he just buffs

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.350 
less interesting and that he just buffs
up<00:01:58.860> before<00:01:59.159> he<00:01:59.219> goes<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.520> fight<00:01:59.759> now<00:02:00.149> if<00:02:00.240> he

up before he goes to the fight now if he

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.670 
up before he goes to the fight now if he
goes<00:02:00.479> that's<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.899> another<00:02:01.350> thing<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.619> don't

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.089 
done a good job as far as the part is
concerned<00:02:08.459> but<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:09.239> only<00:02:09.750> equip<00:02:10.289> headgear

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
bit ridiculous in my mind it guess it

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.690 
bit ridiculous in my mind it guess it
would<00:02:50.530> be<00:02:50.620> different<00:02:50.829> if<00:02:51.099> the<00:02:51.280> rogue<00:02:51.459> had

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
would be different if the rogue had

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.430 
would be different if the rogue had
other<00:02:51.970> non<00:02:52.269> sort<00:02:52.900> of<00:02:52.989> combat<00:02:53.290> related

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.640 
shadows you're walking along a Ledge and
the<00:03:04.000> ledge<00:03:04.209> doesn't<00:03:04.629> cast<00:03:04.720> a<00:03:04.870> shadow<00:03:05.049> but<00:03:05.410> you

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
the ledge doesn't cast a shadow but you

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.869 
the ledge doesn't cast a shadow but you
do<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.160> so<00:03:06.280> you're<00:03:06.400> sort<00:03:06.549> of<00:03:06.640> just<00:03:06.790> floating

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
do and so you're sort of just floating

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.210 
do and so you're sort of just floating
shadow<00:03:07.569> on<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:07.930> far<00:03:08.109> wall<00:03:08.319> and<00:03:08.650> stuff<00:03:09.099> like

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
shadow on the far wall and stuff like

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.470 
shadow on the far wall and stuff like
that<00:03:09.280> i<00:03:09.459> don't<00:03:09.609> know<00:03:09.790> i<00:03:09.849> mean<00:03:10.060> i'm<00:03:10.239> like

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
that i don't know i mean i'm like

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.030 
that i don't know i mean i'm like
settings<00:03:11.079> up<00:03:11.230> pretty<00:03:11.470> high<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:11.829> i<00:03:11.920> would

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
settings up pretty high and i would

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.800 
settings up pretty high and i would
expect<00:03:12.250> stuff<00:03:12.609> like<00:03:12.760> that<00:03:12.790> not<00:03:13.150> to<00:03:13.299> happen<00:03:13.420> and

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
expect stuff like that not to happen and

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.300 
expect stuff like that not to happen and
I<00:03:13.989> guess<00:03:14.140> my<00:03:14.290> last<00:03:14.530> sort<00:03:14.890> of<00:03:15.010> thing<00:03:15.190> I<00:03:15.250> don't

better<00:04:28.060> game<00:04:28.330> than<00:04:28.360> this<00:04:28.660> and<00:04:28.900> so<00:04:29.890> I<00:04:29.920> probably

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
better game than this and so I probably

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.970 
better game than this and so I probably
won't<00:04:30.640> be<00:04:31.120> putting<00:04:31.750> any<00:04:31.900> money<00:04:32.050> into<00:04:32.200> it<00:04:32.500> and

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
won't be putting any money into it and

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.680 
won't be putting any money into it and
that's<00:04:33.160> just<00:04:33.370> my<00:04:33.580> opinion<00:04:33.610> you<00:04:34.150> feel<00:04:34.390> free<00:04:34.600> to

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
that's just my opinion you feel free to

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.320 
that's just my opinion you feel free to
disagree<00:04:34.960> so<00:04:35.500> and<00:04:35.920> I<00:04:35.980> hope<00:04:36.220> that's<00:04:36.370> a<00:04:36.640> somebody

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
disagree so and I hope that's a somebody

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.670 
disagree so and I hope that's a somebody
finds<00:04:37.570> us<00:04:37.630> at<00:04:37.750> least<00:04:37.930> interesting<00:04:38.440> if<00:04:38.530> not

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
finds us at least interesting if not

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.700
