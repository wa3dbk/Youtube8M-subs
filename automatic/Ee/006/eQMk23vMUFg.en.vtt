00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.660
 so the idea for my drink is like that 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.029
 I came up with a classic style 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.720
 i started a bike area 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.449
 14 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.689
 bacardi superior why the 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.670
 after that screams as in the daiquiri of course 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.980
 Also easy with citrus acid too 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.930
 But also work a lot of space around 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.390
 leaves at the side and have the whole 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.700
 once with two and a half centimeters 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.969
 and a sugar syrup together cl 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.800
 given 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.660
 this balance then I am with so 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.449
 a lot of mirrors went against it 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.250
 until I still tasted as a citizen 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.739
 but have the mirabelle with his 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.809
 fruit significantly in the permeate was 3 cl 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.280
 the special feature was necessary for that now 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.949
 is I have this brings this way 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.239
 but I want to be able to do that 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.280
 whole family history necessarily 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.710
 Of course, also a riesling 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.350
 bring brownberg to where mine 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.830
 Grandfather comes from that time already 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.360
 made legs and after crying in 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.740
 postwar fruit fires 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.150
 has been made for bartering 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.890
 to have something more in hand 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.630
 the americans were more into schnapps 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.090
 as on wine and so I have this 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.850
 products merged mirabelle the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.950
 riesling from brownberg cohesion in 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.950
 to this classic compliments too 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.250
 And that was the idea a lot 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.200
 easy drinkable brings to make the 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.909
 but not boring in aromatics 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.159
 Excitement remains and fun is mine 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.900
 name is mario cup s i work million 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.060
 for five and a half years in total 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.149
 I work behind the election since 20 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.350
 years and this my legacy low 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.350
 should be punched 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.899
 Euro
