00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.350
 It's super easy based on cookies like 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.530
 I said triton that can carry from 8 to 12 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.200
 packages and the ingredients are that more 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.309
 a cream to beat is necessary that 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.359
 be from one day to the next in the 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.390
 refrigerator can use a voice the 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:26.480
 paper of this aluminum to line the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:29.760
 mold and a milk to taste 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.590
 well the mold has to be more or less 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.360
 the size of the tortilla does not want 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:39.620
 sweet square round and a tray 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.620
 then for this the cookies 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.870
 Then the cream will be emptied into a mold 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.140
 the fountain 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.129
 I'll make the short ones and cream 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.129
 it was refrigerated 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:03.570
 and we have to beat the good until 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.570
 turn up the volume 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.060
 well then here the cream is already 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.060
 thick 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.860
 and it 's going to cool it while 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.810
 we do the next part 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:44.040
 so then the next step is that 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.040
 we have to separate all the cookies 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.350
 from the top 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:52.409
 and the cream 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.100
 if we were left without matter because in the end 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.560
 they will not be noticed 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.590
 they can choose the flavor they want there 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.730
 chocolate vanilla orange by 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.430
 Sunday 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.430
 but actually mixed 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:13.599
 then this should all be left 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.550
 the cookies separated from the lid by 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.560
 another side we have the source with milk and 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.410
 preparing the cookies only 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.000
 soak 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.000
 because if they spend more than the account 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.980
 so 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.180
 in this mold well pegaditos we already have 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.180
 the first layer of cookies 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.810
 and later they start to put 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.940
 intermediate so that there is no 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.860
 huequito the other lid 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.200
 plugging all the gaps then by 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.020
 example there was a hole and I 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.610
 started putting halves of cookies 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.610
 if we do not put them like that 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.940
 to make the first layer of cookies 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.270
 already then 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.740
 we already have the fly for the one below 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.370
 above 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:16.270
 and now with cream August 1 lifting 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.270
 a layer of cream 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.710
 when all the cookies 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.480
 and I do not know why this is because you can not see 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.780
 he does not even sit on the side of the 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.780
 cream 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.180
 It is also important that the little boat 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.880
 is well lined because if they are not going to 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.880
 pass the milk all down 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.750
 then we repeat the same 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.590
 process until all the 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.590
 packets of biscuits 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.840
 then we're done 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.380
 and this 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.380
 this stage dollars 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.220
 with aluminum foil 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.590
 you have to leave everything covered and everything and 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.950
 then it goes into the refrigerator of a 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.950
 day for another 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:23.360
 and I have it covered 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:27.210
 and therefore good from one day to the next 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.660
 since this has to go well 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.320
 cream with cookies 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.520
 and the important thing is that the next day 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.640
 they can have something to decorate it with 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:42.380
 because one the turn unmolds these 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:44.230
 molds are easy to disassemble and one 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.400
 you can decorate them later 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.400
 they are super rich
