00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
been a great point to take away against

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.100 
been a great point to take away against
Southampton<00:01:44.939> but<00:01:45.090> unfortunately<00:01:45.600> they<00:01:45.930> have

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
Southampton but unfortunately they have

lost again but Austin you know still
nonetheless<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.560> definitely<00:01:49.829> think<00:01:50.189> it

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
nonetheless I definitely think it

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.649 
nonetheless I definitely think it
deserves<00:01:50.670> an<00:01:50.759> upgrade<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.270> think<00:01:51.479> it'll<00:01:51.630> be

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
deserves an upgrade and I think it'll be

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.719 
deserves an upgrade and I think it'll be
a<00:01:51.720> gold<00:01:51.990> upgrade<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.560> because<00:01:53.399> he's<00:01:53.549> already

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
a gold upgrade and because he's already

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.850 
a gold upgrade and because he's already
got<00:01:53.939> 74<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.960> know<00:01:55.049> silver<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.560> he's<00:01:55.649> already

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
got 74 you know silver and he's already

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.980 
got 74 you know silver and he's already
got<00:01:56.070> 74<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.700> form<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.180> there's<00:01:57.210> nowhere<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.750> him

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
got 74 in form so there's nowhere to him

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.749 
got 74 in form so there's nowhere to him
to<00:01:58.110> go<00:01:58.229> over<00:01:58.799> them<00:01:58.920> into<00:01:59.310> with<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.549> gold

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
to go over them into with the gold

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.580 
to go over them into with the gold
category<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.540> think<00:02:00.780> you'll<00:02:00.899> get<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.079> 76

informed<00:05:54.680> and<00:05:54.800> then<00:05:55.190> I<00:05:55.550> think<00:05:55.790> two<00:05:56.060> or<00:05:56.180> three

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
informed and then I think two or three

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.030 
informed and then I think two or three
weeks<00:05:56.450> later<00:05:56.660> actually<00:05:57.140> got<00:05:57.260> second<00:05:57.650> in<00:05:57.710> forms

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040

though a very very great start to the
season<00:05:59.810> for<00:06:00.110> Mena's<00:06:00.410> and<00:06:00.590> it<00:06:00.830> looks<00:06:00.980> like<00:06:01.160> he

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
season for Mena's and it looks like he

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.220 
season for Mena's and it looks like he
could<00:06:01.490> be<00:06:01.550> in<00:06:01.820> for<00:06:01.850> a<00:06:02.030> 81<00:06:02.540> right<00:06:02.690> its<00:06:02.840> central
