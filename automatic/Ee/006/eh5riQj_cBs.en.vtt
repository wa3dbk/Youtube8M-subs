00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
tutorials on how to work it there's my

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.580

dog<00:00:20.520> this<00:00:21.180> is<00:00:21.359> footage<00:00:21.600> with<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.109> camera

dog this is footage with the camera

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.650 
dog this is footage with the camera
really<00:00:23.310> good<00:00:23.550> resolution<00:00:24.150> better<00:00:24.390> than<00:00:24.570> the

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
really good resolution better than the

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.870 
really good resolution better than the
flip<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.080> I'll<00:00:25.260> go<00:00:25.410> outside<00:00:25.529> show<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.550> just

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
flip and I'll go outside show you just

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.790 
flip and I'll go outside show you just
how<00:00:27.000> good<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:28.080> has<00:00:28.410> image

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
how good it is it has image

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.279 
how good it is it has image
stabilization<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:30.449> also<00:00:30.660> works<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.199> the

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
stabilization and it also works in the

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.459 
stabilization and it also works in the
dark<00:00:31.500> somewhat<00:00:32.009> as<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.880> see<00:00:33.120> what<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.200> really

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
dark somewhat as you see what is really

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.709 
dark somewhat as you see what is really
good<00:00:34.649> I'm<00:00:35.610> not<00:00:35.730> very<00:00:35.850> good<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.270> Sun<00:00:36.540> but

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
good I'm not very good in the Sun but

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.000 
good I'm not very good in the Sun but
that<00:00:36.870> probably<00:00:37.020> ruins<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.559> lens<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:37.980> I

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
that probably ruins the lens so I

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.200 
that probably ruins the lens so I
shouldn't<00:00:38.280> do<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.550> let's<00:00:39.180> see<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.480> zooming

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
shouldn't do that let's see the zooming

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.979 
shouldn't do that let's see the zooming
while<00:00:42.210> zooming<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.809> great<00:00:43.820> takes<00:00:44.820> focus<00:00:45.120> you

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
while zooming this great takes focus you

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.139 
while zooming this great takes focus you
can<00:00:46.110> see<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.289> snow<00:00:46.860> root<00:00:47.250> sign<00:00:47.670> all<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.090> way

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
can see that snow root sign all the way

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.029 
can see that snow root sign all the way
over<00:00:48.390> there<00:00:49.670> see<00:00:50.670> if<00:00:50.760> i<00:00:50.910> can<00:00:51.120> put<00:00:51.329> flavors<00:00:51.570> on

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
over there see if i can put flavors on

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.500 
over there see if i can put flavors on
so<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.129> can<00:00:53.309> barely<00:00:53.760> even<00:00:53.910> see<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
so you can barely even see it in the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.380 
so you can barely even see it in the
shine<00:00:54.920> it's<00:00:55.920> really<00:00:56.129> good<00:00:56.280> zoom<00:00:56.520> good

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
shine it's really good zoom good

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.479 
shine it's really good zoom good
stabilization<00:00:57.920> zoom<00:00:58.920> behind<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.280> fire

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
stabilization zoom behind that fire

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.910 
stabilization zoom behind that fire
hydrant<00:00:59.670> see<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:02.809> takes<00:01:03.809> focus<00:01:04.080> moderately

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
hydrant see that takes focus moderately

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.940 
hydrant see that takes focus moderately
courtly<00:01:05.630> doesn't<00:01:06.630> take<00:01:06.780> forever<00:01:08.659> um<00:01:09.950> really

um<00:01:27.550> this<00:01:28.150> is<00:01:28.270> at<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.620> highest<00:01:29.620> resolution<00:01:30.580> you

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
um this is at the highest resolution you

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.930 
um this is at the highest resolution you
can<00:01:31.030> get<00:01:31.270> it<00:01:31.390> ultra<00:01:31.990> it's<00:01:32.710> like<00:01:32.860> ultra<00:01:33.550> fine

all right stabilization seems pretty

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.160 
all right stabilization seems pretty
better<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.040> would<00:01:59.420> probably<00:02:00.420> be<00:02:00.690> worse<00:02:00.900> I

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
better and I would probably be worse I
