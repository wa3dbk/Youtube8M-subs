this is a little deeper this is a little

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.100 
this is a little deeper this is a little
bit<00:00:51.910> raspier<00:00:52.390> this<00:00:52.540> has<00:00:52.660> got<00:00:52.780> a<00:00:52.809> different

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
bit raspier this has got a different

bit raspier this has got a different
tone<00:00:53.260> this<00:00:53.440> way<00:00:53.590> and<00:00:53.829> his<00:00:54.430> last<00:00:54.820> response<00:00:55.180> to

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
me was that doesn't really mean a whole

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.350 
me was that doesn't really mean a whole
lot<00:00:56.890> to<00:00:57.040> me<00:00:57.070> because<00:00:57.430> what<00:00:57.640> is<00:00:57.760> deeper<00:00:58.120> in<00:00:58.210> your

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
lot to me because what is deeper in your

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.170 
lot to me because what is deeper in your
mind<00:00:58.540> is<00:00:58.719> not<00:00:58.870> deeper<00:00:59.140> in<00:00:59.230> my<00:00:59.260> mind<00:00:59.620> and<00:00:59.829> I<00:01:00.790> sat

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
mind is not deeper in my mind and I sat

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.490 
mind is not deeper in my mind and I sat
there<00:01:01.329> on<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:01.450> ground<00:01:01.630> with<00:01:01.870> a<00:01:01.899> couple<00:01:02.440> of

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
there on the ground with a couple of

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.650 
there on the ground with a couple of
hours<00:01:02.770> to<00:01:03.309> think<00:01:03.610> about<00:01:03.790> it<00:01:03.940> and<00:01:04.030> kind<00:01:04.479> of<00:01:04.540> came

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
hours to think about it and kind of came

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:05.880 
hours to think about it and kind of came
up<00:01:04.750> with<00:01:04.869> an<00:01:04.960> idea<00:01:05.199> of<00:01:05.320> an<00:01:05.410> interchangeable

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
up with an idea of an interchangeable

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.050 
up with an idea of an interchangeable
exhaust<00:01:06.250> system<00:01:06.550> something<00:01:06.820> that<00:01:06.910> we<00:01:06.970> could

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
exhaust system something that we could

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.850 
exhaust system something that we could
hook<00:01:07.180> up<00:01:07.270> as<00:01:07.390> a<00:01:07.420> display<00:01:07.660> that<00:01:08.649> would<00:01:08.740> allow

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
hook up as a display that would allow

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.050 
hook up as a display that would allow
you<00:01:08.920> to<00:01:09.070> hear<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.399> different<00:01:09.670> sounds<00:01:09.700> on<00:01:09.970> the

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
you to hear the different sounds on the

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.060 
you to hear the different sounds on the
same<00:01:10.240> motor<00:01:10.450> and<00:01:11.289> its<00:01:11.440> time<00:01:11.619> progressed<00:01:11.950> and

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
same motor and its time progressed and

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.260 
same motor and its time progressed and
as<00:01:12.190> actually<00:01:12.490> that<00:01:12.580> flight<00:01:12.789> went<00:01:13.000> on<00:01:13.090> and<00:01:13.210> my

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
as actually that flight went on and my

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.780 
as actually that flight went on and my
napkin<00:01:13.600> got<00:01:13.750> full<00:01:13.960> of<00:01:14.050> ideas<00:01:14.320> I<00:01:14.890> turned<00:01:15.610> into

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
napkin got full of ideas I turned into

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.250 
napkin got full of ideas I turned into
what<00:01:15.970> was<00:01:16.090> really<00:01:16.299> the<00:01:16.390> original<00:01:16.750> rendering<00:01:17.170> I

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
what was really the original rendering I

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.039 
what was really the original rendering I
came<00:01:17.470> out<00:01:17.619> to<00:01:17.770> being<00:01:18.010> a<00:01:18.340> truck<00:01:18.790> with<00:01:19.060> a<00:01:19.360> exhaust

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
came out to being a truck with a exhaust

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:20.969 
came out to being a truck with a exhaust
system<00:01:20.320> built-in<00:01:20.530> that<00:01:20.619> allowed<00:01:20.830> you<00:01:20.950> to

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
system built-in that allowed you to

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.940 
system built-in that allowed you to
change<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.520> different<00:01:21.790> exhaust<00:01:22.270> sounds

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
change the different exhaust sounds

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.500 
change the different exhaust sounds
absolutely<00:01:23.950> incredible<00:01:24.670> did<00:01:24.880> it<00:01:24.970> turn<00:01:25.119> out<00:01:25.299> as

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
absolutely incredible did it turn out as

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.600 
absolutely incredible did it turn out as
beautiful<00:01:26.170> and<00:01:26.260> as<00:01:26.380> as<00:01:26.710> amazing<00:01:27.490> as<00:01:27.580> you
