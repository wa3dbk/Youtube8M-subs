movies<00:03:44.150> that<00:03:44.330> were<00:03:44.420> doing<00:03:44.690> so<00:03:44.989> that's<00:03:45.500> pretty

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
movies that were doing so that's pretty

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.850 
movies that were doing so that's pretty
well<00:03:45.920> that<00:03:46.160> and<00:03:46.900> also<00:03:47.900> there's<00:03:48.380> a<00:03:48.590> full

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
well that and also there's a full

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.280 
well that and also there's a full
gameplay<00:03:49.100> or<00:03:49.610> full<00:03:50.390> combat<00:03:50.720> training<00:03:51.019> and

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
it's it's gonna be a good game I'm the

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.779 
it's it's gonna be a good game I'm the
graphics<00:05:27.410> I'm<00:05:27.680> getting<00:05:28.009> over<00:05:28.130> I'm<00:05:28.310> starting

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:28.789 
graphics I'm getting over I'm starting

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:31.600 
graphics I'm getting over I'm starting
to<00:05:28.820> like<00:05:29.120> I<00:05:29.389> just<00:05:29.949> it<00:05:30.949> just<00:05:31.130> doesn't<00:05:31.430> look<00:05:31.490> a

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
to like I just it just doesn't look a

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.790 
to like I just it just doesn't look a
visually<00:05:32.000> appealing<00:05:32.360> game<00:05:32.750> to<00:05:32.960> me<00:05:33.110> but<00:05:33.770> I

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
visually appealing game to me but I

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.350 
visually appealing game to me but I
think<00:05:34.039> it's<00:05:34.130> going<00:05:34.220> to<00:05:34.310> play<00:05:34.580> really<00:05:34.849> well<00:05:35.090> I

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
think it's going to play really well I

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.540 
think it's going to play really well I
think<00:05:35.840> maybe<00:05:36.349> they<00:05:36.590> tried<00:05:36.830> to<00:05:36.949> implement<00:05:37.250> too

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
think maybe they tried to implement too

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.040 
think maybe they tried to implement too
many<00:05:37.729> things<00:05:37.880> at<00:05:38.030> once<00:05:38.090> like<00:05:38.449> the<00:05:38.630> creative

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
many things at once like the creative

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.230 
many things at once like the creative
class<00:05:39.169> and<00:05:39.590> I<00:05:40.370> think<00:05:40.580> this<00:05:40.789> is<00:05:40.880> how<00:05:41.090> it<00:05:41.180> goes

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
class and I think this is how it goes

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.430 
class and I think this is how it goes
i'm<00:05:41.539> not<00:05:41.660> sure<00:05:41.810> i<00:05:41.870> was<00:05:41.990> watching<00:05:42.229> FearCrads

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
i'm not sure i was watching FearCrads

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.500 
i'm not sure i was watching FearCrads
video<00:05:42.979> maybe<00:05:43.280> someone<00:05:43.639> can<00:05:43.789> clarify<00:05:44.060> at<00:05:44.389> the

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
video maybe someone can clarify at the

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.409 
video maybe someone can clarify at the
comments<00:05:44.900> if<00:05:45.020> people<00:05:45.650> comment<00:05:46.090> if<00:05:47.090> it's

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
comments if people comment if it's

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:50.050 
comments if people comment if it's
something<00:05:47.659> like<00:05:47.919> when<00:05:48.919> you<00:05:49.039> get<00:05:49.310> your<00:05:49.340> highest

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
something like when you get your highest

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.810 
something like when you get your highest
killstreak<00:05:50.389> and<00:05:50.900> you<00:05:51.830> use<00:05:52.130> it<00:05:52.340> those<00:05:52.520> kills

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
killstreak and you use it those kills

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.060 
killstreak and you use it those kills
start<00:05:53.120> up<00:05:53.270> a<00:05:53.389> kill<00:05:53.599> streak<00:05:53.720> again<00:05:54.199> which<00:05:54.830> isn't

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
start up a kill streak again which isn't

well look at that feed feed feed syd a
bitch<00:05:58.659> so<00:05:59.659> the<00:06:00.220> apparent<00:06:01.220> killstreaks<00:06:01.820> when

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
bitch so the apparent killstreaks when

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.430 
bitch so the apparent killstreaks when
you<00:06:02.449> get<00:06:02.570> up<00:06:02.630> to<00:06:02.750> your<00:06:02.780> highest<00:06:03.199> killstreak

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440

you get up to your highest killstreak
and<00:06:03.889> see<00:06:04.610> if<00:06:04.699> you<00:06:04.820> had<00:06:05.000> let's<00:06:05.720> just<00:06:05.870> use<00:06:05.990> black

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229 
and see if you had let's just use black

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:07.540 
and see if you had let's just use black
ops<00:06:06.440> for<00:06:06.620> an<00:06:06.680> example<00:06:06.949> cuz<00:06:07.130> everyone<00:06:07.370> knows

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
ops for an example cuz everyone knows

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.730 
ops for an example cuz everyone knows
those<00:06:07.789> those<00:06:08.539> things<00:06:08.900> so<00:06:09.110> if<00:06:09.199> you<00:06:09.320> get<00:06:09.440> it<00:06:09.590> if

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
those those things so if you get it if

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.529 
those those things so if you get it if
you<00:06:09.949> get<00:06:10.070> chopper<00:06:10.310> gunner<00:06:10.550> in<00:06:10.669> a<00:06:10.909> chopper

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:11.539 
you get chopper gunner in a chopper

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:14.080 
you get chopper gunner in a chopper
gunner<00:06:11.780> and<00:06:11.990> then<00:06:12.560> use<00:06:12.770> dogs<00:06:13.039> those<00:06:13.669> kills

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
gunner and then use dogs those kills

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.580 
gunner and then use dogs those kills
will<00:06:14.449> start<00:06:14.690> your<00:06:14.780> google<00:06:14.990> streak<00:06:15.229> up<00:06:15.349> again

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
will start your google streak up again

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.080 
will start your google streak up again
so<00:06:15.770> when<00:06:15.889> you<00:06:15.979> get<00:06:16.099> out<00:06:16.220> you<00:06:16.250> have<00:06:16.580> dogs<00:06:16.880> and

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
so when you get out you have dogs and

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.089 
so when you get out you have dogs and
chopper<00:06:18.050> gunner<00:06:18.199> waiting<00:06:18.590> and<00:06:18.740> then<00:06:18.800> you<00:06:18.949> use

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:19.099 
chopper gunner waiting and then you use

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:20.230 
chopper gunner waiting and then you use
them<00:06:19.280> and<00:06:19.400> have<00:06:19.520> another<00:06:19.729> one<00:06:19.849> waiting<00:06:20.000> if

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
them and have another one waiting if

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.480 
them and have another one waiting if
that's<00:06:20.479> how<00:06:20.599> it<00:06:20.750> happens<00:06:21.050> which<00:06:21.199> I<00:06:21.380> it<00:06:21.740> can't

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
that's how it happens which I it can't

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.029 
that's how it happens which I it can't
it<00:06:22.789> would<00:06:23.570> just<00:06:23.599> be<00:06:23.840> way<00:06:23.990> too<00:06:24.050> easy<00:06:24.199> and<00:06:24.740> people

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:25.039 
it would just be way too easy and people

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:27.939 
it would just be way too easy and people
would<00:06:25.130> just<00:06:25.990> be<00:06:26.990> stand<00:06:27.320> never<00:06:27.470> be<00:06:27.650> able<00:06:27.740> to<00:06:27.830> be

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:27.949 
would just be stand never be able to be

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:29.710 
would just be stand never be able to be
stopped<00:06:28.250> but<00:06:28.460> I<00:06:28.520> think<00:06:28.909> like<00:06:29.060> that<00:06:29.210> so<00:06:29.479> I'm

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.610 
stopped but I think like that so I'm
sorry<00:06:29.960> that<00:06:30.080> wasn't<00:06:30.289> a<00:06:30.320> good<00:06:30.349> player
