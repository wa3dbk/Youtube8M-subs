00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
it because the American government has

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.780

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
think that President Obama really is

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.130 
think that President Obama really is
kind<00:04:26.820> of<00:04:27.000> a<00:04:27.410> captive<00:04:28.410> of<00:04:29.570> corporate<00:04:30.570> economy

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
kind of a captive of corporate economy

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.930 
kind of a captive of corporate economy
and<00:04:31.620> this<00:04:32.430> this<00:04:32.760> actually<00:04:33.330> goes<00:04:33.540> back<00:04:34.070> way<00:04:35.070> way

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
and this this actually goes back way way

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.580 
and this this actually goes back way way
back<00:04:36.270> even<00:04:37.230> before<00:04:37.350> he<00:04:37.680> was<00:04:37.830> a<00:04:37.860> candidate<00:04:38.460> and

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
back even before he was a candidate and

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.430 
back even before he was a candidate and
we<00:04:40.590> can<00:04:40.770> see<00:04:41.070> this<00:04:41.370> one<00:04:42.120> of<00:04:42.240> the<00:04:42.360> ways<00:04:43.050> that<00:04:43.290> we

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
we can see this one of the ways that we

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.610 
we can see this one of the ways that we
can<00:04:43.620> see<00:04:43.830> this<00:04:44.010> is<00:04:44.640> his<00:04:45.480> efforts<00:04:46.440> to<00:04:46.800> cut<00:04:47.190> back
