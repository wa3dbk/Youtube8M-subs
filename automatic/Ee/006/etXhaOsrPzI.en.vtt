 it is a bit crowded and the only thing 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.980
 risk of capsizing what I run is like 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.899

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.740
 there are a lot of things that I don't 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.510
 understand the mortgage interest deduction 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.909
 popularity of one direction 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.130
 why avocados push it for five days 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.860
 lie out loud your fruit bowl and that 6th 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.600

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.189
 the female orgasm 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.960
 but these weeks definitely arrived 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.320
 on number one, angry things that I don't 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.810
 understand 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.960
 how some people can respond to 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.119
 the suffering of others 700 asylum seekers 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.189
 drowning just 200 kilometers from 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.470
 the coast of italy and on social media 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.650
 some people hang the flag digitally 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.920
 from 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.990
 I read comments like nice having now 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.430
 help again and I do not understand I 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.409
 do n't understand that reaction because it 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.360
 comment was posted by people who 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.140
 usually always very helpful 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.280
 to be 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.560
 These are people who normally 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.619
 always very helpful to ask me 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.119
 if I want fries sauce with that 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.439
 apparently those of the week have just 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.030
 a little too long above the frying fat 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.250
 hung and are all those brain cells 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.990
 turned into chicken nuggets because of this cackling 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.820
 does not make any sense 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.070
 the moment you are on this side of 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.090
 the water reacts that way 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.950
 that makes us 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.509
 its better than the situation where that 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.259
 drowning people 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.640
 flee 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.769
 the reason those people go here 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.930
 come looking for happiness is because we 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.580
 that have long found happiness in the 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.500
 shape of a cheese stem with chili sauce 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.870
 on the poti terrace 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.870
 nice and cozy is busy to lower
