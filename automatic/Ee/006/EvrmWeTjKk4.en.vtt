00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.840 
as you can probably imagine I didn't
really<00:01:22.799> want<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.009> use<00:01:23.100> his<00:01:23.250> crossing<00:01:23.549> too<00:01:23.670> much

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
really want to use his crossing too much

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.789 
really want to use his crossing too much
I<00:01:24.030> wanted<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.540> bring<00:01:24.659> him<00:01:24.810> inside<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.409> take

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
I wanted to bring him inside and take

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.469 
I wanted to bring him inside and take
off<00:01:25.950> some<00:01:26.100> shots<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.549> exactly<00:01:26.970> why<00:01:27.119> advanced

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
off some shots to exactly why advanced

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.330 
off some shots to exactly why advanced
people<00:01:27.570> do<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.049> it's<00:01:28.350> exactly<00:01:28.530> what<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.009> did

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
people do and it's exactly what I did

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.980 
people do and it's exactly what I did
because<00:01:29.430> he<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.090> freaking<00:01:30.450> effective<00:01:30.840> in

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
because he is so freaking effective in

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.380 
because he is so freaking effective in
that<00:01:31.350> role<00:01:31.530> cutting<00:01:31.829> inside<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.400> yeah<00:01:33.180> just

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
that role cutting inside and yeah just

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.120 
that role cutting inside and yeah just
finesse<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.930> finesses<00:01:34.470> were<00:01:34.560> absolutely

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
finesse is finesses were absolutely

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.980 
finesse is finesses were absolutely
crazy<00:01:35.400> just<00:01:36.000> like<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.240> his<00:01:36.360> long<00:01:36.509> card<00:01:36.810> and

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
crazy just like on his long card and

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.050 
crazy just like on his long card and
just<00:01:37.020> like<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.770> his<00:01:37.979> team<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.610> year<00:01:38.640> CAD

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
just like on his team of the year CAD

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.060 
just like on his team of the year CAD
piecewise<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.049> can<00:01:40.170> probably<00:01:40.409> imagine<00:01:40.530> he's

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
piecewise I can probably imagine he's

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.560 
piecewise I can probably imagine he's
incredible<00:01:41.520> he's<00:01:41.670> really<00:01:42.030> fun<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.329> run<00:01:42.450> which

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
incredible he's really fun to run which

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.600 
incredible he's really fun to run which
is<00:01:42.689> dribbling<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.290> ball<00:01:43.470> control<00:01:43.829> I'm<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.369> good

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
is dribbling a ball control I'm so good

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.789 
is dribbling a ball control I'm so good
and<00:01:44.790> despite<00:01:45.299> his<00:01:45.630> loss<00:01:45.810> trend<00:01:46.170> because<00:01:46.590> his

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
and despite his loss trend because his

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.620 
and despite his loss trend because his
balance<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.369> good<00:01:47.610> when<00:01:48.060> he<00:01:48.090> does<00:01:48.299> lose<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
balance is so good when he does lose the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.330 
balance is so good when he does lose the
ball<00:01:48.780> he<00:01:49.140> does<00:01:49.380> like<00:01:49.560> win<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.799> back<00:01:49.979> at<00:01:50.159> times

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
ball he does like win it back at times

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.190 
ball he does like win it back at times
it<00:01:50.490> obviously<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.939> very<00:01:51.270> impressive<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:51.990> one

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
it obviously is very impressive and one

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.300 
it obviously is very impressive and one
thing<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.409> did<00:01:52.590> notice<00:01:52.619> we've<00:01:52.979> been<00:01:53.100> being<00:01:53.250> a

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
thing I did notice we've been being a

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.399 
thing I did notice we've been being a
right-wing<00:01:53.729> he<00:01:54.240> am<00:01:54.420> actually<00:01:54.659> defended<00:01:55.229> quite

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
right-wing he am actually defended quite

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.600 
right-wing he am actually defended quite
a<00:01:55.439> bit<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.770> got<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.009> helped<00:01:56.340> out<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
a bit and got it helped out in the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.160 
a bit and got it helped out in the
defense<00:01:56.939> which<00:01:57.090> was<00:01:57.240> there<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.540> bit<00:01:57.810> surprising

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
defense which was there a bit surprising

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.780 
defense which was there a bit surprising
it<00:01:58.590> was<00:01:58.860> good<00:01:59.040> when<00:01:59.219> he<00:01:59.280> was<00:01:59.430> making<00:01:59.729> the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
it was good when he was making the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.130 
it was good when he was making the
tackles<00:02:00.149> but<00:02:00.299> when<00:02:00.390> he<00:02:00.450> was<00:02:00.570> running<00:02:00.689> all<00:02:00.990> that

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
tackles but when he was running all that

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.690 
tackles but when he was running all that
we're<00:02:01.290> not<00:02:01.469> making<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.770> tackle<00:02:01.950> obviously

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
we're not making a tackle obviously

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.499 
we're not making a tackle obviously
there's<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.880> bit<00:02:03.030> annoying<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.390> his

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
there's a bit annoying that his

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.179 
there's a bit annoying that his
opposition<00:02:03.780> was<00:02:04.079> still<00:02:04.320> at<00:02:04.649> least<00:02:04.860> he<00:02:05.070> was

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
opposition was still at least he was

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.190 
opposition was still at least he was
making<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.579> effort<00:02:05.700> yes<00:02:06.119> anyway<00:02:06.630> back<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:07.079> the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
making the effort yes anyway back to the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.660 
making the effort yes anyway back to the
cast<00:02:07.409> that's<00:02:07.619> driven<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:08.039> probably<00:02:08.399> imagine

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
cast that's driven it probably imagine

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.580 
cast that's driven it probably imagine
pretty<00:02:09.060> awesome<00:02:09.420> shooting<00:02:10.050> when<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.289> came<00:02:10.440> to

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
pretty awesome shooting when it came to

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.070 
pretty awesome shooting when it came to
long<00:02:10.800> shots<00:02:11.129> inside<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.000> box<00:02:12.180> always<00:02:12.780> go<00:02:12.900> for

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
long shots inside the box always go for

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.670 
long shots inside the box always go for
the<00:02:13.110> finesse

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
the finesse

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.619 
the finesse
next<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.129> just<00:02:14.310> absolutely<00:02:14.640> incredible<00:02:14.879> just

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
next is just absolutely incredible just

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.330 
next is just absolutely incredible just
because<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.959> cab<00:02:16.200> is<00:02:16.379> absolutely<00:02:16.890> crazy<00:02:17.040> on

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
pretty much every messy car device when

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.500 
pretty much every messy car device when
it<00:02:19.650> comes<00:02:19.769> to<00:02:19.890> pass<00:02:20.069> in<00:02:20.280> yeah<00:02:21.000> this<00:02:21.180> next
