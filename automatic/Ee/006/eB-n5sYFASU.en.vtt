00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
see here in front of you it's a little

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.100 
see here in front of you it's a little
bit<00:00:42.010> bigger<00:00:42.220> than<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.640> Xbox<00:00:43.150> and<00:00:43.449> Playstation

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
bit bigger than the Xbox and Playstation

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.170 
bit bigger than the Xbox and Playstation
control<00:00:44.500> the<00:00:44.830> weight<00:00:45.010> of<00:00:45.220> the<00:00:45.699> controllers

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
control the weight of the controllers

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.840 
control the weight of the controllers
similar<00:00:46.630> to<00:00:46.899> an<00:00:47.560> Xbox<00:00:48.040> controller<00:00:50.460> overall<00:00:51.460> I

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
similar to an Xbox controller overall I

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.030 
similar to an Xbox controller overall I
think<00:00:52.329> people<00:00:52.870> are<00:00:52.930> going<00:00:53.020> to<00:00:53.079> like<00:00:53.260> this<00:00:53.470> the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
think people are going to like this the

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.310 
think people are going to like this the
way<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.399> new<00:00:54.520> layout<00:00:54.850> of<00:00:55.030> the<00:00:55.180> controller<00:00:55.600> and

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
way the new layout of the controller and

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.380 
way the new layout of the controller and
I<00:00:56.860> think<00:00:57.070> it<00:00:57.190> really<00:00:57.340> does<00:00:57.579> stack<00:00:57.910> up<00:00:58.120> against

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
I think it really does stack up against

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.660 
I think it really does stack up against
the<00:00:58.570> Xbox<00:00:59.200> controller<00:00:59.649> I<00:00:59.710> think<00:00:59.980> most<00:01:00.489> of<00:01:00.579> you

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
the Xbox controller I think most of you

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.540 
the Xbox controller I think most of you
guys<00:01:01.290> may<00:01:02.290> even<00:01:02.559> prefer<00:01:02.920> this<00:01:03.130> this<00:01:03.550> feel<00:01:05.550> but

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
guys may even prefer this this feel but

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.370 
guys may even prefer this this feel but
as<00:01:06.670> you<00:01:06.820> can<00:01:06.910> see<00:01:06.970> we've<00:01:07.330> already<00:01:07.990> gone<00:01:08.320> ahead
