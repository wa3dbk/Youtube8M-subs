people run towards the middle and yeah I
mean<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.369> two<00:01:11.549> sides<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.150> rail<00:01:12.360> siding<00:01:12.570> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750

cliffside are both good for flanking and

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.920 
cliffside are both good for flanking and
sometimes<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.000> might<00:01:15.119> see<00:01:15.299> some<00:01:15.479> objective

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
play there but for the most part you

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.550

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
cliff side the advantage is slightly in

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.950 
cliff side the advantage is slightly in
the<00:01:29.040> sea<00:01:29.340> Dom<00:01:29.520> spawns<00:01:29.970> favor<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.570> mean<00:01:30.810> they're

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
the sea Dom spawns favor I mean they're

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.630 
the sea Dom spawns favor I mean they're
both<00:01:31.170> about<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.500> same<00:01:31.650> but<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.130> sea<00:01:32.280> Tom<00:01:32.430> side

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
both about the same but the sea Tom side

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.219 
both about the same but the sea Tom side
has<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.820> slight<00:01:33.180> height<00:01:33.509> advantage<00:01:33.720> there<00:01:34.200> a

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
has a slight height advantage there a

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.630 
has a slight height advantage there a
little<00:01:34.439> bit<00:01:34.619> higher<00:01:34.860> up<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.130> they're<00:01:35.369> shooting

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
little bit higher up so they're shooting

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.310 
little bit higher up so they're shooting
down<00:01:35.820> at<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.090> enemies<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.540> then<00:01:36.990> they<00:01:37.110> also

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
down at the enemies and then they also

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.080 
down at the enemies and then they also
have<00:01:37.680> this<00:01:37.799> rock<00:01:38.130> right<00:01:38.159> here<00:01:38.430> which<00:01:38.790> offers

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
have this rock right here which offers

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.580 
have this rock right here which offers
really<00:01:39.479> great<00:01:39.750> cover<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.200> know<00:01:40.290> if<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.439> want

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
really great cover you know if you want

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.960 
really great cover you know if you want
to<00:01:40.650> lock<00:01:40.799> down<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.220> side<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.549> map<00:01:41.700> this

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
to lock down this side of the map this

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.819 
to lock down this side of the map this
rock<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> spot<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.869> do<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.229> because<00:01:43.649> you

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
rock is a spot to do it in because you

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.560 
rock is a spot to do it in because you
can't<00:01:44.040> shoot<00:01:44.250> through<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.820> it's<00:01:45.270> really

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
can't shoot through it and it's really

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.179 
can't shoot through it and it's really
hard<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:46.110> shoot<00:01:46.259> their<00:01:46.470> tiny<00:01:46.680> little<00:01:46.920> heads

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
hard to shoot their tiny little heads

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.649 
hard to shoot their tiny little heads
above<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.549> it's<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.729> really<00:01:48.030> good<00:01:48.240> head<00:01:48.450> glitch

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
above it it's a really good head glitch

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.749 
above it it's a really good head glitch
spot<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.200> if<00:01:49.740> you're<00:01:49.979> spotting<00:01:50.340> on<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> top

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
spot but if you're spotting on the a top

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.670 
spot but if you're spotting on the a top
side<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.570> doesn't<00:01:51.960> mean<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.649> can't

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
side that doesn't mean that you can't

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.100 
side that doesn't mean that you can't
take<00:01:53.130> control<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.670> out<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.030> map<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.570> what

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
take control this out of the map so what

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.510 
take control this out of the map so what
you<00:01:55.229> want<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.439> do<00:01:55.530> if<00:01:55.649> somebody's<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.159> that

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
you want to do if somebody's in that

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.550 
you want to do if somebody's in that
rock<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.360> can<00:01:57.509> actually<00:01:57.689> jump<00:01:58.079> out<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
rock you can actually jump out to the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.920 
rock you can actually jump out to the
ski<00:01:58.829> lift<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.310> then<00:01:59.700> from<00:01:59.880> out<00:02:00.000> here<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.810> can

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
ski lift and then from out here you can

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.749 
ski lift and then from out here you can
shoot<00:02:01.229> them<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.710> usually<00:02:01.920> they<00:02:02.280> won't<00:02:02.520> expect

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
shoot them and usually they won't expect

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.219 
shoot them and usually they won't expect
you<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.180> out<00:02:03.210> there<00:02:03.450> especially<00:02:03.570> at<00:02:04.110> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
you to be out there especially at the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.410 
you to be out there especially at the
very<00:02:04.469> very<00:02:04.560> start<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.130> map<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.610> i<00:02:05.790> use<00:02:06.240> that

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
very very start of the map so i use that

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.999 
very very start of the map so i use that
if<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.630> want<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.140> then<00:02:07.229> push<00:02:07.469> up<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.920> if

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
if you want to and then push up and if

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.710 
if you want to and then push up and if
you're<00:02:08.129> able<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.700> kill<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> couple<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.420> enemies

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
you're able to kill a couple the enemies

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.850 
you're able to kill a couple the enemies
on<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.929> side<00:02:10.110> or<00:02:10.140> if<00:02:10.379> there<00:02:10.530> are<00:02:10.590> no<00:02:10.709> enemies

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
on the side or if there are no enemies

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.199 
on the side or if there are no enemies
that<00:02:11.099> come<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.400> way<00:02:11.550> sometimes<00:02:12.000> that

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
that come this way sometimes that

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:12.900 
that come this way sometimes that
happens

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
happens

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.520 
happens
then<00:02:13.000> you<00:02:13.090> have<00:02:13.210> a<00:02:13.240> huge<00:02:13.660> advantage<00:02:13.810> because

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
then you have a huge advantage because

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.100 
then you have a huge advantage because
you<00:02:14.770> can<00:02:14.950> completely<00:02:15.460> flank<00:02:16.090> behind<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.870> seat

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
you can completely flank behind the seat

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.620 
you can completely flank behind the seat
on<00:02:17.290> spawn<00:02:17.770> without<00:02:18.610> being<00:02:18.910> seen<00:02:19.240> you<00:02:19.450> know<00:02:19.570> you

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
on spawn without being seen you know you

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.260 
on spawn without being seen you know you
can<00:02:19.840> take<00:02:20.050> this<00:02:20.260> little<00:02:20.530> outside<00:02:21.520> area<00:02:21.910> around

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
can take this little outside area around

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.610 
can take this little outside area around
the<00:02:22.450> building<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:22.870> then<00:02:23.020> you<00:02:23.110> can<00:02:23.260> go<00:02:23.410> on<00:02:23.530> this

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
the building and then you can go on this

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.110 
the building and then you can go on this
little<00:02:23.800> catwalk<00:02:24.100> here<00:02:24.550> where<00:02:24.730> they<00:02:24.820> can't<00:02:25.060> see

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
little catwalk here where they can't see

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.850 
little catwalk here where they can't see
the<00:02:25.360> top<00:02:25.540> of<00:02:25.660> your<00:02:25.750> head<00:02:25.960> and<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:26.650> can<00:02:26.770> just

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
the top of your head and you can just

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.050 
the top of your head and you can just
you<00:02:26.980> can<00:02:27.010> get<00:02:27.250> completely<00:02:27.580> behind<00:02:27.790> the

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
you can get completely behind the

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.490 
you can get completely behind the
enemies<00:02:28.330> without<00:02:28.510> them<00:02:28.840> even<00:02:29.020> having<00:02:29.410> a

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
enemies without them even having a

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.830 
enemies without them even having a
chance<00:02:29.770> to<00:02:30.010> see<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.340> so<00:02:30.610> that<00:02:31.270> can<00:02:31.450> obviously

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
chance to see you so that can obviously

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.570 
chance to see you so that can obviously
be<00:02:32.020> very<00:02:32.380> rewarding<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.130> can<00:02:33.250> get<00:02:33.340> quite

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
be very rewarding and you can get quite

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.340 
be very rewarding and you can get quite
a<00:02:33.640> few<00:02:33.730> kills<00:02:34.150> right<00:02:34.810> at<00:02:34.960> the<00:02:35.050> start<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.320> the

a few kills right at the start of the

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.420 
on the rail side this side of the map is
truly<00:02:40.450> even<00:02:40.960> I<00:02:41.080> mean<00:02:41.260> it's<00:02:41.710> not<00:02:41.860> exactly

of<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.770> map<00:03:59.980> and<00:04:00.310> this<00:04:00.550> is<00:04:00.670> kind<00:04:00.850> of<00:04:00.910> like<00:04:01.090> a

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
of the map and this is kind of like a

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.150 
of the map and this is kind of like a
high-risk<00:04:01.690> high-reward<00:04:02.290> scenario<00:04:02.950> I<00:04:03.010> mean

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
high-risk high-reward scenario I mean

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.680 
high-risk high-reward scenario I mean
there<00:04:03.489> are<00:04:03.580> a<00:04:03.610> bunch<00:04:03.910> of<00:04:04.090> different<00:04:04.270> ways

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
there are a bunch of different ways

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.390 
there are a bunch of different ways
people<00:04:05.080> can<00:04:05.200> get<00:04:05.410> into<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:05.709> middle<00:04:05.830> on<00:04:06.100> both

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
people can get into the middle on both

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.070 
people can get into the middle on both
sides<00:04:06.790> of<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.030> mat<00:04:07.180> so<00:04:07.510> you're<00:04:07.690> going<00:04:07.959> to<00:04:08.020> have

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
sides of the mat so you're going to have

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.720 
sides of the mat so you're going to have
enemies<00:04:08.380> all<00:04:08.650> around<00:04:08.680> you<00:04:09.160> coming<00:04:09.459> in<00:04:09.550> from

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
enemies all around you coming in from

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.010 
enemies all around you coming in from
different<00:04:10.090> directions<00:04:10.180> and<00:04:10.630> it's<00:04:10.780> really

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
different directions and it's really

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.570 
different directions and it's really
risky<00:04:11.170> but<00:04:11.770> if<00:04:11.890> you're<00:04:12.040> able<00:04:12.130> to<00:04:12.280> take<00:04:12.459> them

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
risky but if you're able to take them

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.190 
risky but if you're able to take them
all<00:04:12.700> out<00:04:12.730> and<00:04:12.910> then<00:04:13.209> do<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:13.510> objective<00:04:14.020> if

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
all out and then do the objective if

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.240 
all out and then do the objective if
there's<00:04:14.350> an<00:04:14.440> objective<00:04:14.860> in<00:04:14.980> there<00:04:15.100> like

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
there's an objective in there like

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.920 
there's an objective in there like
capture<00:04:15.610> be<00:04:15.760> dom<00:04:15.910> or<00:04:16.090> whatever<00:04:16.359> then<00:04:16.750> that's

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
capture be dom or whatever then that's

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.630 
capture be dom or whatever then that's
going<00:04:17.020> to<00:04:17.109> be<00:04:17.169> an<00:04:17.230> amazing<00:04:17.560> start<00:04:18.160> to<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:18.459> mat

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
going to be an amazing start to the mat

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.120 
going to be an amazing start to the mat
so<00:04:18.970> if<00:04:19.239> you<00:04:19.480> feel<00:04:19.750> a<00:04:19.780> little<00:04:19.900> bit<00:04:20.109> risky<00:04:20.500> middle

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
so if you feel a little bit risky middle

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.159 
so if you feel a little bit risky middle
is<00:04:21.250> the<00:04:21.370> way<00:04:21.520> to<00:04:21.580> go<00:04:21.910> now<00:04:22.270> one<00:04:22.930> thing<00:04:22.960> you

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
is the way to go now one thing you

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.020 
is the way to go now one thing you
should<00:04:23.200> know<00:04:23.500> is<00:04:23.530> both<00:04:23.950> sides<00:04:24.340> take<00:04:24.669> about<00:04:24.880> the

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
should know is both sides take about the

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.830 
should know is both sides take about the
same<00:04:25.060> amount<00:04:25.300> of

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
same amount of

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.640 
same amount of
I'm<00:04:25.900> gonna<00:04:26.020> get<00:04:26.139> into<00:04:26.260> the<00:04:26.320> middle<00:04:26.410> you<00:04:26.560> know

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
I'm gonna get into the middle you know

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.080 
I'm gonna get into the middle you know
from<00:04:26.860> the<00:04:26.949> sea<00:04:27.130> Dom<00:04:27.280> to<00:04:27.490> get<00:04:27.580> up<00:04:27.699> to<00:04:27.790> that<00:04:27.880> first

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
from the sea Dom to get up to that first

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.540 
from the sea Dom to get up to that first
top<00:04:28.360> window<00:04:28.750> and<00:04:28.990> then<00:04:29.470> from<00:04:29.770> a<00:04:30.040> time<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:30.430> get

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
top window and then from a time to get

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.510 
top window and then from a time to get
to<00:04:30.760> the<00:04:30.910> bottom<00:04:31.840> gold<00:04:32.230> area<00:04:32.650> and<00:04:32.889> takes<00:04:33.310> about

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
to the bottom gold area and takes about

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.830 
to the bottom gold area and takes about
the<00:04:33.580> same<00:04:33.699> amount<00:04:33.850> of<00:04:34.120> time<00:04:34.180> so<00:04:34.510> it's<00:04:34.660> even

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
the same amount of time so it's even

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.900 
the same amount of time so it's even
there<00:04:35.110> but<00:04:35.500> obviously<00:04:36.040> the<00:04:36.190> Saddam<00:04:36.490> side<00:04:36.729> has

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
there but obviously the Saddam side has

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.340 
there but obviously the Saddam side has
a<00:04:36.940> slight<00:04:37.240> advantage<00:04:37.360> because<00:04:37.750> again<00:04:38.169> they

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
a slight advantage because again they

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.870 
a slight advantage because again they
have<00:04:38.560> that<00:04:38.740> height<00:04:39.040> difference<00:04:39.430> anytime

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
have that height difference anytime

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.310 
have that height difference anytime
you're<00:04:40.000> up<00:04:40.150> higher<00:04:40.300> than<00:04:40.330> your<00:04:40.630> enemies<00:04:40.930> you

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
you're up higher than your enemies you

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.500 
you're up higher than your enemies you
have<00:04:41.500> an<00:04:41.620> advantage<00:04:41.949> so<00:04:42.340> I<00:04:42.550> see<00:04:43.030> Tom<00:04:43.210> you<00:04:43.419> know

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
have an advantage so I see Tom you know

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.420 
have an advantage so I see Tom you know
it's<00:04:43.870> a<00:04:43.990> little<00:04:44.229> bit<00:04:44.350> better<00:04:44.440> off<00:04:44.710> now<00:04:44.949> if<00:04:45.160> you

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
it's a little bit better off now if you

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.790 
it's a little bit better off now if you
do<00:04:45.699> plan<00:04:46.060> on<00:04:46.330> rushing<00:04:46.900> middle<00:04:47.110> from<00:04:47.290> see<00:04:47.470> Tom<00:04:47.620> I

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
do plan on rushing middle from see Tom I

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.710 
do plan on rushing middle from see Tom I
don't<00:04:48.220> suggest<00:04:48.550> going<00:04:49.000> to<00:04:49.210> that<00:04:49.360> first<00:04:49.570> window

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
don't suggest going to that first window

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.210 
don't suggest going to that first window
just<00:04:50.110> because<00:04:50.380> that's<00:04:50.530> where<00:04:50.740> everybody

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
just because that's where everybody

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.129 
just because that's where everybody
expects<00:04:51.669> you<00:04:51.729> to<00:04:51.820> be<00:04:51.940> go<00:04:52.389> a<00:04:52.419> little<00:04:52.750> bit<00:04:52.930> to<00:04:53.050> the

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
expects you to be go a little bit to the

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.409 
expects you to be go a little bit to the
right<00:04:53.169> hop<00:04:53.889> in<00:04:54.100> the<00:04:54.220> second<00:04:54.639> window<00:04:54.940> and<00:04:54.970> shoot

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
right hop in the second window and shoot

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:56.670 
right hop in the second window and shoot
down<00:04:55.600> at<00:04:55.750> people<00:04:55.990> as<00:04:56.080> they're<00:04:56.199> coming<00:04:56.350> through

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
down at people as they're coming through

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.050 
down at people as they're coming through
gold<00:04:56.919> or<00:04:57.100> from<00:04:57.250> the<00:04:57.280> cliff<00:04:57.520> side<00:04:57.550> or<00:04:57.820> whatever

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
gold or from the cliff side or whatever

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.270 
gold or from the cliff side or whatever
and<00:04:58.300> and<00:04:59.050> then<00:04:59.169> also<00:04:59.410> if<00:04:59.740> you're<00:04:59.889> in<00:04:59.979> the<00:05:00.070> spot

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
and and then also if you're in the spot

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.620 
and and then also if you're in the spot
it<00:05:00.460> gives<00:05:00.639> you<00:05:00.729> the<00:05:00.850> ability<00:05:00.910> to<00:05:01.180> check<00:05:01.479> the

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
it gives you the ability to check the

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.000 
it gives you the ability to check the
stairs<00:05:01.960> in<00:05:02.229> case<00:05:02.380> people<00:05:02.680> are<00:05:02.770> you<00:05:02.919> know

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
stairs in case people are you know

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.409 
stairs in case people are you know
coming<00:05:03.250> up<00:05:03.430> the<00:05:03.550> stairs<00:05:03.790> to<00:05:03.910> get<00:05:04.090> up<00:05:04.210> into<00:05:04.360> the

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
coming up the stairs to get up into the

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:05.909 
coming up the stairs to get up into the
top<00:05:04.630> part<00:05:04.870> of<00:05:04.930> the<00:05:04.990> map<00:05:05.139> from<00:05:05.320> the<00:05:05.380> a<00:05:05.440> top<00:05:05.650> side

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
top part of the map from the a top side

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.740 
top part of the map from the a top side
so<00:05:06.190> that's<00:05:06.760> a<00:05:06.910> little<00:05:07.060> bit<00:05:07.210> more<00:05:07.419> advantageous

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
so that's a little bit more advantageous

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.500 
so that's a little bit more advantageous
but<00:05:08.590> even<00:05:08.830> it<00:05:09.100> better<00:05:09.460> is<00:05:09.820> if<00:05:10.030> you<00:05:10.060> come<00:05:10.330> from

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
but even it better is if you come from

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.150 
but even it better is if you come from
the<00:05:10.600> sea<00:05:10.750> downside<00:05:11.110> what<00:05:11.290> I<00:05:11.410> like<00:05:11.680> to<00:05:11.830> do<00:05:11.979> is

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
the sea downside what I like to do is

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.310 
the sea downside what I like to do is
all<00:05:12.760> run<00:05:13.060> down<00:05:13.330> by<00:05:13.570> Saddam<00:05:13.930> you<00:05:14.050> know<00:05:14.139> maybe

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
all run down by Saddam you know maybe

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.200 
all run down by Saddam you know maybe

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.250 
just running into this control room
that's<00:05:25.000> usually<00:05:25.510> going<00:05:25.600> to<00:05:25.690> take<00:05:25.900> them<00:05:26.110> out

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260

and then you can hop up on the computer
and<00:05:28.180> you<00:05:28.539> can<00:05:28.570> lay<00:05:28.870> down<00:05:28.900> behind<00:05:29.260> cover<00:05:29.620> if<00:05:29.860> you

the height advantage they have cover you

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
have cover but they're a little bit

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:20.640 
have cover but they're a little bit
higher<00:06:19.630> up<00:06:19.870> so<00:06:19.900> they're<00:06:20.169> probably<00:06:20.380> going<00:06:20.560> to

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
higher up so they're probably going to

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.440 
higher up so they're probably going to
be<00:06:20.710> able<00:06:20.770> to<00:06:20.889> shoot<00:06:21.010> you<00:06:21.160> out<00:06:21.190> of<00:06:21.400> it<00:06:21.460> so<00:06:21.700> for

isn't<00:06:24.460> all<00:06:24.849> that<00:06:24.910> recommended<00:06:25.750> you'll

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:26.229 
isn't all that recommended you'll

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:28.050 
isn't all that recommended you'll
probably<00:06:26.620> have<00:06:27.039> better<00:06:27.220> luck<00:06:27.490> either<00:06:27.760> going

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
probably have better luck either going

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.580 
probably have better luck either going
cliffside<00:06:28.570> or<00:06:28.690> rail<00:06:28.840> side<00:06:29.110> because<00:06:29.349> it's<00:06:29.500> a

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
cliffside or rail side because it's a

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.800 
cliffside or rail side because it's a
little<00:06:29.950> bit<00:06:30.130> more<00:06:30.370> even<00:06:30.820> you<00:06:30.970> aren't<00:06:31.240> at<00:06:31.419> quite

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
little bit more even you aren't at quite

look at some of the prenat spots I've
got<00:06:40.789> for<00:06:40.939> you<00:06:40.969> guys<00:06:41.060> because<00:06:41.270> I've<00:06:41.449> got<00:06:41.569> two

then throw a nade up in the air right

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:53.529 
then throw a nade up in the air right
over<00:06:51.949> this<00:06:52.069> little<00:06:52.370> triangle<00:06:52.729> symbol<00:06:53.210> right

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:53.539 
over this little triangle symbol right

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:55.089 
over this little triangle symbol right
here<00:06:53.599> jump<00:06:54.169> to<00:06:54.289> give<00:06:54.409> it<00:06:54.529> some<00:06:54.650> extra<00:06:54.770> oomph

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:55.099 
here jump to give it some extra oomph

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:56.649 
here jump to give it some extra oomph
and<00:06:55.370> it's<00:06:55.699> going<00:06:55.819> to<00:06:55.909> land<00:06:56.029> right<00:06:56.300> in<00:06:56.360> that

00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:56.659

here right over that catwalk and it's

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:10.779 
here right over that catwalk and it's
going<00:07:09.319> to<00:07:09.379> land<00:07:09.529> back<00:07:09.830> towards<00:07:10.310> that<00:07:10.490> back

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:10.789 
going to land back towards that back

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:12.550 
going to land back towards that back
corner<00:07:11.150> where<00:07:11.569> people<00:07:11.900> come<00:07:12.050> through<00:07:12.110> out<00:07:12.439> of

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 
corner where people come through out of

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.290 
corner where people come through out of
that<00:07:12.650> zigzag<00:07:13.159> building<00:07:13.580> and<00:07:13.699> it's<00:07:14.090> going<00:07:14.240> to

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:14.300 
that zigzag building and it's going to

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.269 
that zigzag building and it's going to
kill<00:07:14.479> them<00:07:14.629> as<00:07:14.810> well<00:07:14.990> so<00:07:15.289> both<00:07:15.800> of<00:07:15.830> those<00:07:16.069> are

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:16.279 
kill them as well so both of those are

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:17.649 
kill them as well so both of those are
pretty<00:07:16.400> useful<00:07:16.610> and<00:07:16.909> then<00:07:17.000> on<00:07:17.120> the<00:07:17.210> other<00:07:17.240> side

00:07:17.649 --> 00:07:17.659 
pretty useful and then on the other side

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:19.480 
pretty useful and then on the other side
of<00:07:17.689> the<00:07:17.779> map<00:07:17.930> if<00:07:18.080> you<00:07:18.139> spawn<00:07:18.409> on<00:07:18.529> a<00:07:18.680> dom<00:07:18.889> one

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:19.490 
of the map if you spawn on a dom one

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.459 
of the map if you spawn on a dom one
thing<00:07:19.729> you<00:07:19.819> can<00:07:20.000> do<00:07:20.180> is<00:07:20.360> you<00:07:20.810> can<00:07:20.840> nade<00:07:21.139> back

00:07:21.459 --> 00:07:21.469 
thing you can do is you can nade back

00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:23.230 
thing you can do is you can nade back
over<00:07:21.919> the<00:07:22.009> buildings<00:07:22.400> so<00:07:22.520> just<00:07:22.729> run<00:07:22.969> towards

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.240 
over the buildings so just run towards

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.129 
over the buildings so just run towards
the<00:07:23.449> middle<00:07:23.599> like<00:07:23.779> you're<00:07:23.870> going<00:07:23.990> to<00:07:24.080> go

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:24.139 
the middle like you're going to go

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:25.839 
the middle like you're going to go
towards<00:07:24.379> the<00:07:24.409> middle<00:07:24.590> of<00:07:24.710> map<00:07:24.889> throw<00:07:25.490> a<00:07:25.520> nade

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:25.849 
towards the middle of map throw a nade

00:07:25.849 --> 00:07:28.450 
towards the middle of map throw a nade
and<00:07:26.090> jump<00:07:26.449> right<00:07:26.719> over<00:07:26.779> this<00:07:27.139> a4<00:07:27.800> symbol<00:07:28.310> and

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:28.460 
and jump right over this a4 symbol and

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.339 
and jump right over this a4 symbol and
again<00:07:29.000> it's<00:07:29.180> going<00:07:29.300> to<00:07:29.419> land<00:07:29.569> right<00:07:29.990> in<00:07:30.050> that

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:30.349 
again it's going to land right in that

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:32.469 
again it's going to land right in that
middle<00:07:30.620> area<00:07:30.919> where<00:07:31.250> up<00:07:31.370> enemies<00:07:31.729> often<00:07:32.210> run

00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 
middle area where up enemies often run

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:34.480 
middle area where up enemies often run
through<00:07:32.779> so<00:07:33.080> that<00:07:33.560> one's<00:07:33.800> pretty<00:07:34.009> good<00:07:34.279> and

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:34.490 
through so that one's pretty good and

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.100 
through so that one's pretty good and

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.110 
then also if you want to name the rail

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.600 
then also if you want to name the rail
