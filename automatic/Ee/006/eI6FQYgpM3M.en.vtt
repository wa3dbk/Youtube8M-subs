00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
the other side's not far behind so I

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.869

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
I got a wheel bearing it's got a bad

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.830 
I got a wheel bearing it's got a bad
sensor<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.739> it's<00:00:56.219> it's<00:00:57.210> pretty<00:00:57.300> weird

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
sensor in it so it's it's pretty weird

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.990 
sensor in it so it's it's pretty weird
it's<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.140> hundred<00:00:58.410> bucks<00:00:58.559> for<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.859> sensor<00:00:59.250> if

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
it's a hundred bucks for the sensor if

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.150 
it's a hundred bucks for the sensor if
you<00:01:00.809> buy<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.050> wheel<00:01:01.350> bearing<00:01:01.739> with<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
you buy the wheel bearing with the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.350 
you buy the wheel bearing with the
sensor<00:01:02.699> it's<00:01:03.120> 100<00:01:03.449> bucks<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:04.850> 110<00:01:05.850> like<00:01:06.150> 10

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
sensor it's 100 bucks so 110 like 10

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.270 
sensor it's 100 bucks so 110 like 10
bucks<00:01:06.570> more<00:01:06.780> or<00:01:06.930> something<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.470> didn't<00:01:08.189> make

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
sense to just buy the sensor and put it

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.260 
sense to just buy the sensor and put it
in<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.869> old<00:01:09.900> wheelbarrow<00:01:10.670> but<00:01:11.670> that's<00:01:12.150> what

demise of this shackle

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.260 
demise of this shackle
hard<00:01:45.880> to<00:01:45.970> believe<00:01:46.270> this<00:01:46.450> is<00:01:46.510> a<00:01:46.740> 2002<00:01:47.740> I<00:01:48.270> bought

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
hard to believe this is a 2002 I bought

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.920 
hard to believe this is a 2002 I bought
it<00:01:49.480> had<00:01:49.800> 160,000<00:01:50.800> on<00:01:50.920> it<00:01:51.450> that's<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.570> new<00:01:52.750> one

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
it had 160,000 on it that's the new one

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.370 
it had 160,000 on it that's the new one
there<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:55.000> truck<00:01:55.240> itself<00:01:55.630> has<00:01:55.900> never<00:01:56.140> had<00:01:56.350> any

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
there the truck itself has never had any

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.860 
there the truck itself has never had any
bodywork<00:01:56.980> or<00:01:57.160> paint<00:01:57.370> done<00:01:57.580> to<00:01:57.730> it<00:01:57.850> I<00:01:58.000> mean<00:01:58.690> it's

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
bodywork or paint done to it I mean it's

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.760 
bodywork or paint done to it I mean it's
in<00:01:59.020> great<00:01:59.260> shape<00:01:59.580> but<00:02:00.580> I<00:02:01.470> guess<00:02:02.470> that's<00:02:02.650> what

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
in great shape but I guess that's what

I found that if I just notched it enough
it<00:02:27.070> cleared<00:02:27.460> that<00:02:28.830> so<00:02:29.830> there's<00:02:30.040> your<00:02:30.190> new

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
it a little bit more of a step by step

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.940 
it a little bit more of a step by step
basically<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:49.810> lower<00:02:50.020> bolt<00:02:50.320> slides<00:02:50.709> out

an<00:04:21.580> oil<00:04:21.670> spray<00:04:22.200> so<00:04:23.200> that's<00:04:23.350> where<00:04:23.500> I'm<00:04:23.620> at<00:04:23.740> now

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
an oil spray so that's where I'm at now

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.340 
an oil spray so that's where I'm at now
but<00:04:27.360> that's<00:04:28.360> it<00:04:28.540> still<00:04:28.960> going<00:04:29.050> to<00:04:29.110> do<00:04:29.200> the

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
but that's it still going to do the

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.900 
but that's it still going to do the
front<00:04:29.860> wheel<00:04:29.980> bearing<00:04:30.310> but<00:04:30.490> I<00:04:30.520> figured<00:04:30.820> I'd

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
front wheel bearing but I figured I'd

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.790 
front wheel bearing but I figured I'd
get<00:04:31.030> everything<00:04:31.360> done<00:04:31.660> from<00:04:32.500> the<00:04:32.620> cab

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
get everything done from the cab

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.730 
get everything done from the cab
backwards<00:04:33.370> here<00:04:33.610> well<00:04:33.820> it<00:04:33.910> was<00:04:34.030> up<00:04:34.180> in<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:34.419> air

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
backwards here well it was up in the air

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:42.520 
backwards here well it was up in the air
and<00:04:35.740> we'll<00:04:36.510> move<00:04:37.510> on<00:04:38.610> see<00:04:39.610> ya

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.330 

well<00:04:43.130> guys<00:04:43.310> we're<00:04:43.550> moving<00:04:43.850> on<00:04:44.980> we<00:04:45.980> are<00:04:46.130> now

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
well guys we're moving on we are now

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.920 
well guys we're moving on we are now
doing<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:46.730> front<00:04:46.970> wheel<00:04:47.180> berry<00:04:49.930> wheel

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
doing the front wheel berry wheel

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.070 
doing the front wheel berry wheel
bearing<00:04:51.230> itself<00:04:51.560> is<00:04:51.800> fine<00:04:52.040> I<00:04:52.940> learned<00:04:53.750> from

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
bearing itself is fine I learned from

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.700 
bearing itself is fine I learned from
mr.<00:04:54.290> res<00:04:54.770> d4<00:04:55.310> Mehta<00:04:55.660> that<00:04:56.660> these<00:04:57.020> little

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
mr. res d4 Mehta that these little

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.930 
mr. res d4 Mehta that these little
sensors<00:04:58.070> in<00:04:58.520> here<00:04:58.760> fail<00:05:00.250> me<00:05:01.250> the<00:05:01.340> pulsing<00:05:01.820> is

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
sensors in here fail me the pulsing is

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.460 
sensors in here fail me the pulsing is
if<00:05:02.090> the<00:05:02.240> auntie<00:05:02.510> locks<00:05:02.690> are<00:05:02.870> kicking<00:05:03.140> in<00:05:03.260> I

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
if the auntie locks are kicking in I

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.680 
if the auntie locks are kicking in I
tried<00:05:04.280> to<00:05:04.370> take<00:05:04.520> one<00:05:04.700> apart<00:05:04.820> last<00:05:05.180> summer<00:05:05.420> and

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
tried to take one apart last summer and

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.000 
tried to take one apart last summer and
basically<00:05:06.050> what<00:05:06.290> it<00:05:06.380> does<00:05:06.410> is<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:06.800> rust

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
basically what it does is the rust

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.860 
basically what it does is the rust
swells<00:05:07.280> up<00:05:07.490> squeezes<00:05:08.210> the<00:05:08.360> sensor<00:05:08.720> to<00:05:08.810> the

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
swells up squeezes the sensor to the

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.990 
swells up squeezes the sensor to the
point<00:05:09.080> doesn't<00:05:09.350> work<00:05:09.590> breaks<00:05:10.460> it<00:05:10.640> to<00:05:10.760> get<00:05:10.880> it

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
point doesn't work breaks it to get it

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.320 
point doesn't work breaks it to get it
out<00:05:11.120> so<00:05:11.440> the<00:05:12.440> sensor<00:05:12.830> was<00:05:12.980> like<00:05:13.130> 95<00:05:13.970> or<00:05:14.210> 100

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
out so the sensor was like 95 or 100

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.659 
out so the sensor was like 95 or 100
bucks<00:05:14.690> I<00:05:15.020> get<00:05:15.740> the<00:05:15.860> whole<00:05:15.980> wheel<00:05:16.220> bearing

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
bucks I get the whole wheel bearing

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.970 
bucks I get the whole wheel bearing
assembly<00:05:16.880> with<00:05:17.240> a<00:05:17.270> new<00:05:17.480> sensor<00:05:17.900> for<00:05:18.110> 110<00:05:18.770> or

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980 
assembly with a new sensor for 110 or

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.280 
assembly with a new sensor for 110 or
something<00:05:19.280> it's<00:05:20.030> not<00:05:20.210> worth<00:05:20.450> dicking<00:05:21.200> around

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
something it's not worth dicking around

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.120 
something it's not worth dicking around
with<00:05:21.620> the<00:05:21.940> change<00:05:22.940> in<00:05:23.060> the<00:05:23.120> sensor<00:05:23.919> so<00:05:24.919> there's

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
with the change in the sensor so there's

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:31.870 
with the change in the sensor so there's
a<00:05:25.190> new<00:05:25.310> one<00:05:25.460> old<00:05:26.240> one<00:05:26.980> going<00:05:27.980> in<00:05:28.690> see<00:05:29.690> you
