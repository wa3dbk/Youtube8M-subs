00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
products and might have seen it with

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.410 
products and might have seen it with
microphones<00:02:52.800> as<00:02:52.950> well<00:02:53.100> you<00:02:53.250> get<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.400> short<00:02:53.820> USB

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
microphones as well you get a short USB

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.450 
microphones as well you get a short USB
cable<00:02:54.840> but<00:02:55.380> you've<00:02:55.470> got<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.590> generous<00:02:56.130> length

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
cable but you've got a generous length

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.730 
cable but you've got a generous length
here<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:56.940> haven't<00:02:57.810> measured<00:02:57.990> this<00:02:58.260> but<00:02:58.590> I<00:02:58.620> would

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
here I haven't measured this but I would

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.920 
here I haven't measured this but I would
imagine<00:02:58.980> it's<00:02:59.490> probably<00:02:59.730> round<00:03:00.209> about<00:03:00.510> three

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
imagine it's probably round about three

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.340 
imagine it's probably round about three

man actually normally I've seen sort of
black<00:03:34.410> powder<00:03:34.860> coated<00:03:35.280> shock<00:03:35.670> mounts<00:03:36.060> this<00:03:36.600> is

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
black powder coated shock mounts this is

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.140 
black powder coated shock mounts this is
a<00:03:36.810> silver<00:03:37.230> one<00:03:37.500> looks<00:03:38.400> like<00:03:38.610> it's<00:03:38.790> got<00:03:38.940> some

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
a silver one looks like it's got some

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.350 
a silver one looks like it's got some
nice<00:03:39.330> or<00:03:39.720> them<00:03:40.459> elastic<00:03:41.459> is<00:03:41.580> it<00:03:41.730> yeah<00:03:42.030> can<00:03:42.269> I

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
nice or them elastic is it yeah can I

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.590 
nice or them elastic is it yeah can I
say<00:03:42.570> it<00:03:42.720> elasticity<00:03:43.590> on<00:03:44.130> these<00:03:45.000> side<00:03:45.300> bits

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
say it elasticity on these side bits

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.240 
say it elasticity on these side bits
that's<00:03:45.870> going<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:46.110> keep<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.500> microphones<00:03:47.070> or

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
that's going to keep the microphones or

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.310 
that's going to keep the microphones or
isolated<00:03:48.060> from<00:03:48.180> whatever<00:03:48.420> stand<00:03:48.810> I<00:03:48.959> put<00:03:49.140> it<00:03:49.230> on

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
isolated from whatever stand I put it on

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.430 
isolated from whatever stand I put it on
and<00:03:49.560> then<00:03:50.220> this<00:03:50.400> mounts<00:03:50.880> onto<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.440> standard

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
and then this mounts onto a standard

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.449 
and then this mounts onto a standard
thread<00:03:52.980> microphone<00:03:53.850> stand<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:54.739> then<00:03:55.739> here<00:03:56.310> we

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
thread microphone stand and then here we

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.350 
thread microphone stand and then here we
have<00:03:56.820> got<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.030> microphone<00:03:57.330> itself

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.770 

so<00:04:01.260> we've<00:04:01.470> got<00:04:01.770> sort<00:04:02.730> of<00:04:02.760> low<00:04:02.940> pass<00:04:03.210> filter

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
so we've got sort of low pass filter

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.920 
so we've got sort of low pass filter
switch<00:04:04.050> on<00:04:04.350> the<00:04:04.410> side<00:04:04.980> here<00:04:05.180> we<00:04:06.180> can<00:04:06.540> see<00:04:06.750> that

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
switch on the side here we can see that

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.720 
switch on the side here we can see that
it's<00:04:07.080> only<00:04:07.290> directional<00:04:07.920> from<00:04:08.190> that<00:04:08.340> symbol

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
it's only directional from that symbol

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.120 
it's only directional from that symbol
there<00:04:08.760> and<00:04:09.150> then<00:04:09.540> we've<00:04:09.690> got<00:04:09.720> zero<00:04:10.080> or<00:04:10.530> minus

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
there and then we've got zero or minus

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.120 
there and then we've got zero or minus
10<00:04:11.400> DB<00:04:12.150> switch<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:12.810> this<00:04:13.170> is<00:04:13.290> great<00:04:13.590> for<00:04:13.620> if

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
10 DB switch and this is great for if

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.000 
10 DB switch and this is great for if
you're<00:04:14.340> recording<00:04:15.150> maybe<00:04:15.570> vocals<00:04:16.440> are<00:04:16.739> quite

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
you're recording maybe vocals are quite

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.710 
you're recording maybe vocals are quite
loud<00:04:17.310> and<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:17.609> just<00:04:17.760> want<00:04:17.940> to<00:04:17.970> cut<00:04:18.239> down<00:04:18.450> on

loud and you just want to cut down on

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.110 
loud and you just want to cut down on
the<00:04:19.230> actual<00:04:19.650> input<00:04:20.040> that's<00:04:20.489> coming<00:04:20.760> into<00:04:21.000> your

the actual input that's coming into your
computer<00:04:21.650> we<00:04:22.650> can<00:04:22.770> just<00:04:23.160> about<00:04:23.490> see<00:04:23.550> the

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
computer we can just about see the

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.870 
computer we can just about see the
diaphragm<00:04:24.960> through<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.740> mesh<00:04:25.920> there<00:04:26.250> this<00:04:26.730> is

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
diaphragm through the mesh there this is

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.570 
diaphragm through the mesh there this is
an<00:04:27.030> all-metal<00:04:27.570> construction<00:04:28.250> very<00:04:29.250> nicely

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
an all-metal construction very nicely

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.700 
an all-metal construction very nicely
made<00:04:30.030> it's<00:04:30.330> got<00:04:30.450> quite<00:04:30.690> nice<00:04:30.900> weight<00:04:31.260> to<00:04:31.290> it<00:04:31.500> as

hercules mic stand here on my desk and
the<00:05:19.590> audio<00:05:20.100> in<00:05:20.430> this<00:05:20.580> section<00:05:20.820> is<00:05:21.150> all<00:05:21.390> being

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
the audio in this section is all being

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.400 
the audio in this section is all being
recorded<00:05:22.160> with<00:05:23.160> the<00:05:23.540> sl300<00:05:24.540> so<00:05:25.080> at<00:05:25.169> the<00:05:25.229> moment

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
recorded with the sl300 so at the moment

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.710 
recorded with the sl300 so at the moment
I'm<00:05:25.680> sitting<00:05:26.100> round<00:05:26.490> about<00:05:26.880> probably<00:05:27.600> about

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
I'm sitting round about probably about

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.860 
I'm sitting round about probably about
six<00:05:28.140> inches<00:05:28.350> away<00:05:28.620> from<00:05:28.740> the<00:05:29.240> sl300<00:05:30.240> all<00:05:30.479> of

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
six inches away from the sl300 all of

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.659 
six inches away from the sl300 all of
the<00:05:30.960> settings<00:05:31.229> are<00:05:31.590> set<00:05:31.740> to<00:05:31.919> the<00:05:32.040> standard

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
the settings are set to the standard

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.790 
the settings are set to the standard
settings<00:05:33.210> on<00:05:33.390> the<00:05:33.479> microphone<00:05:33.870> and<00:05:34.229> now<00:05:34.680> I'm

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
settings on the microphone and now I'm

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.930 
settings on the microphone and now I'm
just<00:05:34.890> going<00:05:35.070> to<00:05:35.100> keep<00:05:35.280> speaking<00:05:35.580> at<00:05:35.820> the<00:05:35.910> same

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
just going to keep speaking at the same

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.180 
just going to keep speaking at the same
volume<00:05:36.360> and<00:05:36.930> move<00:05:37.140> to<00:05:37.320> round<00:05:37.560> about<00:05:37.770> three

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
volume and move to round about three

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.010 
volume and move to round about three
inches<00:05:38.490> away<00:05:38.640> from<00:05:38.760> the<00:05:39.479> front<00:05:39.810> of<00:05:39.930> the

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
inches away from the front of the

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.230 
inches away from the front of the
microphone<00:05:40.430> so<00:05:41.430> you'll<00:05:41.580> probably<00:05:41.790> hear<00:05:42.090> a

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
microphone so you'll probably hear a

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.380 
microphone so you'll probably hear a
slightly<00:05:42.840> raised<00:05:43.260> level<00:05:43.950> in<00:05:44.130> the<00:05:44.640> audio<00:05:45.060> and

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
slightly raised level in the audio and

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.540 
slightly raised level in the audio and
now<00:05:45.930> what<00:05:46.080> I'm<00:05:46.200> going<00:05:46.290> to<00:05:46.350> do<00:05:46.500> is<00:05:46.740> continue

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
now what I'm going to do is continue

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.540 
now what I'm going to do is continue
speaking<00:05:47.970> at<00:05:48.210> this<00:05:48.330> level<00:05:48.600> and<00:05:48.840> switch<00:05:49.500> the<00:05:49.890> DB

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
speaking at this level and switch the DB

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.840 
speaking at this level and switch the DB
switch<00:05:50.820> to<00:05:51.030> minus<00:05:51.450> 10<00:05:51.720> DB<00:05:52.340> so<00:05:53.340> now<00:05:53.490> we're<00:05:53.700> in

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
switch to minus 10 DB so now we're in

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.050 
switch to minus 10 DB so now we're in
the<00:05:53.880> minus<00:05:54.419> 10<00:05:54.870> DB<00:05:55.380> setting<00:05:55.860> and<00:05:56.010> you<00:05:56.820> should

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
the minus 10 DB setting and you should

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.340 
the minus 10 DB setting and you should
hear<00:05:57.330> that<00:05:57.360> level<00:05:58.080> slightly<00:05:58.890> lower<00:05:59.160> on<00:05:59.460> the

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
hear that level slightly lower on the

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.710 
hear that level slightly lower on the
sl300<00:06:01.350> audio<00:06:01.770> and<00:06:02.100> now<00:06:02.520> we<00:06:02.580> switch<00:06:02.820> back<00:06:02.940> up<00:06:03.300> 20

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
sl300 audio and now we switch back up 20

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.740 
sl300 audio and now we switch back up 20
DB<00:06:04.169> and<00:06:04.580> then<00:06:05.580> the<00:06:05.760> last<00:06:06.000> setting<00:06:06.479> I'm<00:06:06.600> going

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
DB and then the last setting I'm going

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.839 
DB and then the last setting I'm going
to<00:06:06.810> change<00:06:07.080> is<00:06:07.350> on<00:06:07.530> this<00:06:07.710> low<00:06:07.950> pass<00:06:08.220> filter<00:06:08.729> is

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:08.849 
to change is on this low pass filter is

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:10.640 
to change is on this low pass filter is
set<00:06:09.060> to<00:06:09.180> level<00:06:09.479> at<00:06:09.599> the<00:06:09.660> moment<00:06:10.050> and<00:06:10.410> I'm<00:06:10.530> going

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
set to level at the moment and I'm going

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.850 
set to level at the moment and I'm going
to<00:06:10.740> set<00:06:10.950> it<00:06:10.979> to<00:06:11.280> on<00:06:11.900> so<00:06:12.900> now<00:06:13.050> this<00:06:13.260> is<00:06:13.410> with<00:06:13.620> the

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
to set it to on so now this is with the

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:14.180 
to set it to on so now this is with the

pass<00:06:14.520> filter<00:06:15.090> activated<00:06:15.810> so<00:06:16.410> you<00:06:16.470> might<00:06:16.740> hear

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
pass filter activated so you might hear

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.010 
pass filter activated so you might hear
a<00:06:17.130> little<00:06:17.400> tiny<00:06:17.820> bit<00:06:18.000> of<00:06:18.210> difference<00:06:18.360> in<00:06:18.750> the

a little tiny bit of difference in the

a little tiny bit of difference in the
audio<00:06:19.440> tone<00:06:19.830> so<00:06:20.670> now<00:06:20.790> we<00:06:20.850> switch<00:06:21.060> it<00:06:21.330> back<00:06:21.450> over

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
audio tone so now we switch it back over

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.110 
audio tone so now we switch it back over
to<00:06:21.900> the<00:06:22.650> normal<00:06:23.070> setting<00:06:23.310> for<00:06:23.670> the<00:06:23.730> low-pass

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
to the normal setting for the low-pass

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.540 
to the normal setting for the low-pass
filter<00:06:24.690> and<00:06:24.870> just<00:06:25.350> continue<00:06:25.770> speaking<00:06:26.070> into

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
filter and just continue speaking into

the<00:06:26.700> microphone<00:06:27.000> you<00:06:27.900> do<00:06:28.020> have<00:06:28.230> to<00:06:28.350> be<00:06:28.470> in

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
the microphone you do have to be in

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.950 
the microphone you do have to be in
quite<00:06:29.100> close<00:06:29.460> proximity<00:06:29.970> to<00:06:30.360> the<00:06:30.480> microphone

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
quite close proximity to the microphone

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.290 
quite close proximity to the microphone
if<00:06:31.080> I<00:06:31.140> move<00:06:31.350> too<00:06:31.620> far<00:06:31.890> away<00:06:32.100> you'll<00:06:32.880> find<00:06:33.120> that

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
if I move too far away you'll find that

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.440 
if I move too far away you'll find that
the<00:06:33.420> audio<00:06:33.900> levels<00:06:34.320> will<00:06:34.530> drop<00:06:34.560> too<00:06:35.070> much<00:06:35.420> so<00:06:36.420> I

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.450 
the audio levels will drop too much so I

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.020 
the audio levels will drop too much so I
hope<00:06:36.570> you<00:06:36.750> found<00:06:36.990> this<00:06:37.290> audio<00:06:38.010> test<00:06:38.370> helpful

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
hope you found this audio test helpful

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.590 
hope you found this audio test helpful

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 
real value is in the price of this

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.550 
real value is in the price of this
