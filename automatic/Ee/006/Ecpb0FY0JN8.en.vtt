produced or anything like that but I
just<00:02:30.500> kind<00:02:30.800> of<00:02:30.860> missed<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.160> simplicity<00:02:31.730> of

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
just kind of missed the simplicity of

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.140

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
flying sense a lot of electronics but

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.089 
flying sense a lot of electronics but
the<00:02:37.790> vocals<00:02:38.180> are<00:02:38.330> just<00:02:38.510> so<00:02:38.690> quietly<00:02:39.380> delivered

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700
