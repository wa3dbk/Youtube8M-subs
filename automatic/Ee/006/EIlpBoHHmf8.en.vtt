00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.740
 alas the pain 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.810
 ok that's okay it's a little bit 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:24.689
 worse it's ok, but there it is not 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.910
 me it's a no it's our for more 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.550
 late one more injured in the Olympic 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.590
 Lyon 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.920
 yes hi to you little adventurer fans of 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.630
 soccer 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.520
 for this new number month the 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.200
 Professor Martinez I will decipher 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.329
 causes and consequences of 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.520
 violence in football 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.930
 here is my analysis football being the 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.460
 the most popular sport in the world is 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.960
 very normal to find there the evils of the 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.680
 society and violence have made 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.379
 obviously part 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.940
 except that despite what we are told no the 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.559
 professional football does not become 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.969
 more violent and it's even rather 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.920
 the inverted that occurs with a 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.539
 sanitizing the contacts and the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.370
 stigmatization of hard players on 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.890
 the man do you think a match like 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.329
 the one of 1984 with his legendary fight 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.210
 general at the turn of diego maradona 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.250
 could take place today 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.020
 obviously no and we must dissociate well 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.180
 violence around football that of 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.310
 supporters of the one on the ground because 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.080
 if 99% of the players make the guys 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.250
 they know very well that they do not have the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.350
 right to go further under penalty of 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.880
 penalties then the players there does not 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.420
 not things we know you're not going 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.479
 not beat you 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.680
 everything is possible and let's be frank 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.640
 violence in football is especially 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.640
 present at the amateur level 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.650
 but as soon as a fact occurs in front of 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.180
 the cameras then there everyone 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.610
 offends one like a young virgin 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.780
 in front of a clip of miley cyrus 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.670
 take the head shot by brandao 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.290
 example punish the author of a blow this is 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.970
 normal is good fart the nose of a guy 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.400
 and leave loose it is not done 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.410
 but then to eradicate all violence 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.660
 we should also punish the provocateurs 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.210
 because if we rightly punish zidane 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.100
 suarez or brandao would take a day 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.660
 think about looking at the causes to 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.310
 know the repeated insults of 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.560
 materrazi chiellini or thiago 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.460
 motta because football is a sport that 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.530
 asks for cold blood 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.970
 yes but not a master's degree 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.970
 shaolin of self control 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.240
 you are bad cans good Serbian in 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.680
 bern of a roof comes the problem 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.959
 main violence in football 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.850
 this is its alleged consequence the example 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.560
 given to young people what is a debate 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.870
 endless like that of video games 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.360
 and when I say alleged suspects Thursday 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.800
 do you really think it influences if 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.110
 yes these are the idols who have a 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.790
 responsibility the ronaldo messi neymar 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.830
 those who make the eyes shine 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.550
 little steps the players who are there for 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.400
 to make the number 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.870
 sir judgment clients here present at 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.640
 a mitigating circumstance at its 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:53.900
 extreme violence 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:57.440
 he is a fan of cyril rool the defendant is 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.640
 acquitted and then good the characters of 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.739
 our childhood have a limited influence 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.180
 on young people at most we find 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.040
 a technical gesture a haircut 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.500
 how to put on socks 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.150
 never again no we have never seen 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.830
 a young man assembled in the stands to 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.510
 play it cantona put some slippers in 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.060
 the plexus to look like nigel's 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.069
 jong and even less god thanks to himself 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.530
 put to talk like them like that what 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.700
 ouaip before the heat commands to see 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.530
 Blues 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.730
 so yes the violence still exists in 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.380
 football but it's just all 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.209
 relative to the number of matches and 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.410
 of players and it's up to everyone 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.600

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.280
