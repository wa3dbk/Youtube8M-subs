can't wait 20 minutes for 20 minutes

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.110 
can't wait 20 minutes for 20 minutes
through<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:46.860> place<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.280> expire<00:00:47.579> but

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
through this place to expire but

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.600 
through this place to expire but
basically<00:00:48.329> what<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.840> learned<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:50.460> can

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
basically what I learned is that you can

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.490 
basically what I learned is that you can
just<00:00:50.760> basically<00:00:50.940> if<00:00:51.660> our<00:00:51.930> trader<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.379> can

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
just basically if our trader you can

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.830 
just basically if our trader you can
just<00:00:52.680> add<00:00:52.829> like<00:00:53.219> let's<00:00:53.520> say<00:00:53.610> if<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.879> add<00:00:54.120> 20

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
just add like let's say if you add 20

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.380 
just add like let's say if you add 20
players<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.260> your<00:00:55.410> watch<00:00:55.559> list<00:00:56.300> basically<00:00:57.300> in

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
players to your watch list basically in

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.849 
players to your watch list basically in
almost<00:00:57.629> every<00:00:57.989> minute<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.350> will<00:00:58.440> have<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> new

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
almost every minute you will have a new

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.160 
almost every minute you will have a new
deal<00:00:59.100> almost<00:00:59.730> expiring<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.840> means<00:01:01.020> that

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
deal almost expiring and that means that

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.410 
deal almost expiring and that means that
you<00:01:01.289> can<00:01:01.500> bid<00:01:01.739> on<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.010> player<00:01:02.370> basically<00:01:03.149> every

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
you can bid on a player basically every

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.820 
you can bid on a player basically every
minute<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.080> don't<00:01:04.199> really<00:01:04.350> have<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.589> wait

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
minute and you don't really have to wait

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.740 
minute and you don't really have to wait
too<00:01:05.070> much<00:01:05.100> time<00:01:05.610> when<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.240> basically<00:01:06.540> have<00:01:06.720> a

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
too much time when you basically have a

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.570 
too much time when you basically have a
lot<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:06.990> players<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.439> your<00:01:07.680> transfer<00:01:08.040> list<00:01:08.220> so

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
lot of players in your transfer list so

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.190 
lot of players in your transfer list so
this<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.850> basically<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.180> first<00:01:09.360> step<00:01:09.630> try<00:01:10.140> to

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
this is basically the first step try to

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.710 
this is basically the first step try to
look<00:01:10.590> up<00:01:10.770> some<00:01:11.040> charter<00:01:11.640> look<00:01:11.790> or<00:01:12.030> most<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
look up some charter look or most of the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.270 
look up some charter look or most of the
pillars<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.799> think<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.070> will<00:01:14.159> get

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
pillars and that you think you will get

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.700 
pillars and that you think you will get
a<00:01:14.340> good<00:01:14.610> deal<00:01:14.790> on<00:01:15.000> on<00:01:15.210> open<00:01:15.540> beds<00:01:15.780> just<00:01:15.990> Adam<00:01:16.560> to

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
a good deal on on open beds just Adam to

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.499 
a good deal on on open beds just Adam to
transfer<00:01:17.100> targets<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:17.939> don't<00:01:18.180> have<00:01:18.330> to

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
transfer targets so you don't have to

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.060 
transfer targets so you don't have to
wait<00:01:18.720> friends<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.170> expire<00:01:19.500> too<00:01:19.710> long<00:01:19.860> because

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
wait friends to expire too long because

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.010 
wait friends to expire too long because
you<00:01:20.340> just<00:01:20.520> have<00:01:20.700> pledged<00:01:21.030> expiring<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.810> part

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020
