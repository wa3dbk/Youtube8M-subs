00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
is becoming a tricky situation when

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.190 
is becoming a tricky situation when
we're<00:00:35.880> mixing<00:00:36.059> multiple<00:00:36.600> chemicals<00:00:37.050> together

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.990 
we're mixing multiple chemicals together
we're<00:00:37.649> now<00:00:37.800> creating<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.340> different<00:00:38.700> texture

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
we're now creating a different texture

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.430 
we're now creating a different texture
to<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.300> hair<00:00:39.540> which<00:00:39.989> can<00:00:40.170> unfortunately

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
to the hair which can unfortunately

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.310 
to the hair which can unfortunately
sometimes<00:00:40.890> lead<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.280> breakage<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:43.170> one

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
sometimes lead to breakage so the one

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.590 
sometimes lead to breakage so the one
thing<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.559> do<00:00:43.620> want<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:44.010> point<00:00:44.160> out<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.730> if<00:00:45.030> you

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
the best thing about it is is that it

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.900 
the best thing about it is is that it
should<00:00:49.559> gradually<00:00:49.890> shampoo<00:00:50.370> off<00:00:50.520> in<00:00:50.789> about

this way it starts to lather what this
does<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.500> starts<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.009> slough<00:01:41.310> off<00:01:41.490> some<00:01:41.759> of

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
does is it starts to slough off some of

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.030 
does is it starts to slough off some of
that<00:01:41.909> semi-permanent<00:01:42.630> color<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.829> way

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
that semi-permanent color so this way

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.859 
that semi-permanent color so this way
you<00:01:44.310> expose<00:01:44.970> some<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.390> natural<00:01:45.540> hair

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
you expose some of the natural hair

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.499 
you expose some of the natural hair
again<00:01:46.159> unfortunately<00:01:47.159> though<00:01:47.939> because<00:01:48.180> there

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
again unfortunately though because there

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.330 
again unfortunately though because there
is<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> little<00:01:48.840> bit<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.079> lightning<00:01:49.350> agent<00:01:49.950> you

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
is a little bit of a lightning agent you

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.100 
is a little bit of a lightning agent you
will<00:01:50.490> start<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.759> remove<00:01:51.450> some<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.930> ash

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
will start to remove some of the ash

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.679 
will start to remove some of the ash
from<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.740> hair<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.100> expose<00:01:53.759> more<00:01:53.970> warmth<00:01:54.360> so

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
from the hair and expose more warmth so

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.899 
from the hair and expose more warmth so
this<00:01:54.840> may<00:01:54.990> not<00:01:55.020> be<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.350> best<00:01:55.470> option<00:01:55.909> our

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
this may not be the best option our

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.060 
this may not be the best option our
third<00:01:57.149> option<00:01:57.390> would<00:01:57.750> be<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.500> use<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.680> color

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
third option would be is to use a color

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.999 
third option would be is to use a color
remover<00:01:59.369> like<00:01:59.700> this<00:02:00.170> the<00:02:01.170> color<00:02:01.380> remover<00:02:01.740> is

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
remover like this the color remover is

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.410 
remover like this the color remover is
great<00:02:02.280> because<00:02:02.460> what<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.820> does<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.119> latches

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
great because what it does is it latches

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.120 
great because what it does is it latches
onto<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.930> hair<00:02:04.110> color<00:02:04.320> before<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.740> has<00:02:04.890> time

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
onto the hair color before it has time

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.340 
onto the hair color before it has time
to<00:02:05.280> actually<00:02:05.430> stay<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.030> hair<00:02:06.350> typically

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
to actually stay in the hair typically

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
they're only good for about the first 24

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.119 
they're only good for about the first 24
hours<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.390> hair<00:02:09.690> color<00:02:09.950> services<00:02:10.950> being
