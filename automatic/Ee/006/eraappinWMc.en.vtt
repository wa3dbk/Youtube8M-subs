00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 all eyes are turned on you 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.730
 you are the ruppin hello together 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.710
 at the film factory today I have the 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.360
 bestsellerverfilmung ruby ​​red for you 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.830
 I did not bring that with me 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.259
 I also take a red one today 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.179
 but to throw a formula does not play 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.609
 Role you want to know what can that do 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.830
 movie what can not he the story 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.720
 is well known if you are rhin he 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.240
 so the outsider in her family 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.800
 is and how not perceived 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.010
 especially because their other relatives 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.640
 to wear the big golden gene 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.210
 with which one can probably make time travel 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.630
 Ultimately, it turns out 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.700
 that actually wendelin itself this 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.920
 and that's natural 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.899
 very problematic if you always without 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.120
 that you can do something and without that 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.379
 you suddenly travel to another time 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.840
 stand before you see you still 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.730
 something happens once and I'm sitting in 1825 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.010
 in some other damn café 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.420
 By the way, on the world the whole looks 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.420
 as follows 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:06.900
 that better than any song super dress 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:10.970
 and bring the coalition to temple like that 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.400
 Lover of the Count Sascha Kever Sven Klose 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.170
 ingelheim by or what that is 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.150
 heap fanatical age of about 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.070
 I swear that is incredibly important 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.410
 keeps 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.600
 that has more to do with had about 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:30.140
 also such a world conspiracy medien.de 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.140
 wg has a similar problem as charlie 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.630
 So also an extra special gene 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.630
 carrier the wsv intention the gene on the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.140
 male line re team rather 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.190
 female that 's none of our business and 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.750
 Luckily that's not our problem 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.400
 you can see immediately that this is not a big one 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.840
 International production is but 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.880
 just a german production with 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.500
 I do not think so with a lower budget 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.870
 Bad actually was then you take 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.360
 just the big visual effects out 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.060
 and is limited to loving 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.560
 detail work on the set itself that is 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.750
 Unfortunately, the big problem so the 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.729
 movie goes totally huge so would like 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.140
 This is also very big 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.480
 thermal of london's history 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.980
 plays in london is are English 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.360
 By the way, this recording where you 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.430
 Looks okay, that's such a swing over 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.900
 london okay the spectators know that 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.130
 plays in london and then goes back in 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.870
 the scenery if you do not always 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.580
 everywhere we see here we are also at 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.020
 big problem of the film because of the company 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.500
 the subsidies from germany 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.750
 to get 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.510
 that means that the money from the 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.790
 statewide also spent in nrw 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.760
 Bühler is then but if 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.620
 the great london and the great avenue and 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.209
 that everything should look so oldschool 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.890
 suddenly with me around the corner am 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.780
 Decksteiner Weiher here in Cologne 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.130
 is produced where I then see that 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.810
 It's not the big river now 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.550
 it's just the little rivulet 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.590
 what's going on there is a bit 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.660
 difficult just like lawyers big palace 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.580
 built where I know what you last 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.380
 year itself still only at tempelhofer 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.350
 Airport at the Berlin Festival 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.500
 you can see that it is almost 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.989
 London is never and now the big one 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.750
 the great renaissance and why 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.360
 medieval things to represent 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.310
 you need a little bit more than one 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.350
 a few houses just throw a few corners 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.209
 and that actually turns the movie on 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.880
 Bit broken because of this must ferry 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.220
 simply completely missing and just one 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.269
 movie of this light fantasy element 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.410
 it needs atmosphere and the whole 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.049
 credible on the screen to bring 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.910
 The cast is also German veronica 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.410
 ferres was not too bad to her either 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.239
 face here again in the camera 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.180
 to keep but is not there was 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.069
 I am really surprised 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.840
 But Katharina Thalbach is unfortunately for him 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.819
 Again we do klimas 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.140
 get reasonably masses so that one 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.879
 somehow with the crowbar still like that 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.920
 can raushauen a few jokes 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.780
 oh man i really loved him 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.760
 very weak but I know that completely 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.799
 many of you are looking forward to the movie 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.629
 and also the books meet and 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.639
 probably also find the movie good 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.469
 for what he should be 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:58.969
 that's why since i'm mad at me 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:00.319
 also the performance as an actor 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:03.079
 Lucky olin maria ehrich 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.150
 that's just that does not seem right 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.370
 works just put it on you realize that 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.480
 all the actors are playing too 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.090
 Media that is so a bit 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.459
 I'm already aware of how difficult it is 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.699
 The chemistry between the two comes 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:19.519
 no dearestoll out right and that 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.959
 whole has really become so walled that 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.490
 is actually though the story 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.870
 you can tell that the story is 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.430
 Of course, really cool means of course 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.220
 also that by making it a trilogy 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.270
 is always something for the first time I can 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.410
 already imagine that then more 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.550
 So I'll find out the story 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.590
 really succeeded 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.120
 also the idea behind it and 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.949
 what you could do with it 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.509
 and unfortunately we have conjunctive 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.370
 Could because it did not come out 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:42.830
 Made and this movie is real 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.020
 become incredibly weak because he is in 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.979
 Unfortunately, all of them are just now 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.139
 sufficient 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:50.120
 in some places is even poor 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.949
 who should look at the whole 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.229
 Of course the people will be the ones 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:56.150
 books have not loved at all and 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.320
 from anyone from a movie visit 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.699
 let hold 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.560
 I do not want that at all 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:02.479
 look at it like a book 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.759
 become that you found great I am 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.120
 Also comment on me below in the 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:07.550
 review 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.139
 but I think that's it, too 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.669
 because he should not do it all 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.400
 Just look at the people who say 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.530
 hey if i have such a fat book what 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.259
 with special effects and visual 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.849
 could then trump effects 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:22.039
 I see it in this dimension and 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:23.570
 just not when he b movie out 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:25.820
 germany people should be on everyone 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.080
 Fall outside my personal stay 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.300
 Rating are four out of ten points 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.099
 that is really very much 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.050
 benevolently meant it's easy on 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:36.300
 to make all my defects 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.849
 biggest problem with the film 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.830
 is actually that I love to 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:42.870
 film lacks the love of the book 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.639
 I constantly have the impression and 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.500
 the feeling is always here 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.400
 To checkout because you have the books 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.590
 great 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.870
 and you will go in anyway and 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.539
 I really miss all posts 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.300
 on all corners love to this 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:58.139
 history that you would have determined 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.229
 Fantastic on the canvas bring 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:03.509
 Because of that, because of you in the 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:05.069
 acting no good settings weak 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:08.550
 special effects and visual effects 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:11.280
 has points from me only four out of ten 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.449
 you also like it if not the movie 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.490
 will probably be many again 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:16.440
 great find yourself looking forward not so 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.509
 Nevertheless, I found the thumbs good 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.830
 upwards if you say dominik I can 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:21.990
 still find the movie good 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.029
 but I am still minimized 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.469
 I have done your opinion presented 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:27.840
 So like thumbs up 

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:29.490
 if you say badu old stupid whiners 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.169
 give me the thumb down 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.129
 but you can still use the channel 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:34.800
 here you can have one more 

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:36.449
 watch another video and rubine mut 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.490
 it was in a next video I wear 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:40.770
 again another color but only 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:44.900
 again at the film factory with a 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.900
 new film criticism with me there a little
