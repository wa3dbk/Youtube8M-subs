art you're going to help them go to the
right<00:01:03.149> direction<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.989> I've<00:01:04.229> done<00:01:04.379> that

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
right direction and I've done that

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.950 
right direction and I've done that
because<00:01:04.680> there's<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.159> few<00:01:05.479> more<00:01:06.479> laid<00:01:06.659> traps

because there's a few more laid traps

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.390 
because there's a few more laid traps
that<00:01:07.380> will<00:01:07.500> actually<00:01:07.590> get<00:01:07.920> them<00:01:08.040> right<00:01:08.220> back

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
that will actually get them right back

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.160 
that will actually get them right back
to<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.670> very<00:01:08.850> very<00:01:08.909> beginning<00:01:09.090> right<00:01:09.990> back

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170

the playground some are running short
ones<00:01:12.150> they've<00:01:12.540> only<00:01:12.659> gotten<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.930> few<00:01:13.080> cells

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
ones they've only gotten a few cells

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.950 
ones they've only gotten a few cells
through<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:13.890> one<00:01:14.159> from<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.549> midway<00:01:14.850> board<00:01:15.420> and

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
through so one from the midway board and

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.200 
through so one from the midway board and
one<00:01:16.110> from<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.350> very<00:01:16.560> vague<00:01:16.740> an<00:01:17.670> ultimate<00:01:18.119> to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
one from the very vague an ultimate to

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.600 
one from the very vague an ultimate to
sell<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.530> penultimate<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.250> win<00:01:20.400> and

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
sell on the penultimate to the win and

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.999 
sell on the penultimate to the win and
that's<00:01:21.509> really<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:21.900> because<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.710> amazed

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
that's really just because it is amazed

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.740 
that's really just because it is amazed
it's<00:01:23.310> meant<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.640> be<00:01:23.670> challenged<00:01:24.090> with<00:01:24.390> all<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
it's meant to be challenged with all the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.719 
it's meant to be challenged with all the
bumps<00:01:24.930> only<00:01:25.320> had<00:01:25.439> one<00:01:25.710> direction<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.189> flow<00:01:26.460> and

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
bumps only had one direction of flow and

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:27.980 
bumps only had one direction of flow and
there's<00:01:26.939> no<00:01:27.150> way<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.420> going<00:01:27.570> right<00:01:27.810> back<00:01:27.930> to

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
there's no way of going right back to

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.539 
there's no way of going right back to
the<00:01:28.080> beginning<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.860> wouldn't<00:01:29.159> really<00:01:29.250> be<00:01:29.369> an

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
the beginning it wouldn't really be an

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.210 
the beginning it wouldn't really be an
even<00:01:29.939> flow<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.720> bugs<00:01:31.079> across<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.890> through<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
even flow of bugs across and through the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.480 
even flow of bugs across and through the
maze<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:33.390> do<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.049> think<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.860> possible<00:01:35.070> I've

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
maze so do I think this is possible I've

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.450

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
in here are actually one other battle

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.550 
in here are actually one other battle
arena<00:02:05.280> type<00:02:05.610> maces<00:02:06.030> this<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.570> long<00:02:07.320> battle

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
arena type maces this is a long battle

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.339 
arena type maces this is a long battle
this<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.069> pure<00:02:08.520> candor<00:02:09.420> bugs<00:02:09.599> on<00:02:09.989> their<00:02:10.229> way

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
this is a pure candor bugs on their way

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.460 
this is a pure candor bugs on their way
to<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.220> final<00:02:11.580> sale<00:02:11.819> can<00:02:12.510> they<00:02:12.629> actually<00:02:12.780> get

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
to the final sale can they actually get

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.170 
to the final sale can they actually get
through<00:02:13.650> all<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:13.920> mathematical<00:02:14.700> options<00:02:15.060> and

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
through all the mathematical options and

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.730 
through all the mathematical options and
all<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.360> options<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.840> all<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.080> wind<00:02:16.230> choices

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
all the options and all the wind choices

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.770 
all the options and all the wind choices
so<00:02:17.010> every<00:02:17.340> time<00:02:17.370> they<00:02:17.550> go<00:02:17.670> into<00:02:17.790> cell<00:02:18.060> there's

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
so every time they go into cell there's

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.240 
so every time they go into cell there's
only<00:02:18.960> a<00:02:19.050> certain<00:02:19.260> number<00:02:19.410> of<00:02:19.590> exit<00:02:19.920> points

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
only a certain number of exit points

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.950 
only a certain number of exit points
some<00:02:20.730> of<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:20.910> some<00:02:21.240> of<00:02:21.330> these<00:02:21.420> cells<00:02:21.660> have<00:02:21.750> got

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
some of the some of these cells have got

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.990 
some of the some of these cells have got
all<00:02:22.140> six<00:02:22.470> open<00:02:23.040> so<00:02:23.190> even<00:02:23.430> though<00:02:23.520> they<00:02:23.640> come<00:02:23.880> in

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
all six open so even though they come in

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.550 
all six open so even though they come in
one<00:02:24.180> way<00:02:24.360> they<00:02:24.720> can<00:02:24.870> actually<00:02:25.110> go<00:02:25.200> back<00:02:25.380> the

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
one way they can actually go back the

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.680 
one way they can actually go back the
way<00:02:26.100> they<00:02:26.250> came<00:02:26.430> so<00:02:27.030> there's<00:02:27.180> one<00:02:27.330> in<00:02:27.450> six

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
way they came so there's one in six

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.680 
way they came so there's one in six
chance<00:02:27.780> here<00:02:28.320> there's<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:28.980> one<00:02:29.130> in<00:02:29.160> six<00:02:29.400> chance

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
chance here there's a one in six chance

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.330 
chance here there's a one in six chance
at<00:02:30.690> this<00:02:30.870> one<00:02:31.080> as<00:02:31.170> well<00:02:31.320> there's<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.950> one<00:02:32.100> in<00:02:32.130> six

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
at this one as well there's a one in six

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.610 
at this one as well there's a one in six
chance<00:02:32.490> here<00:02:33.000> so<00:02:33.270> lawns<00:02:33.600> we've<00:02:33.840> got<00:02:34.050> whether

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
chance here so lawns we've got whether

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.050 
chance here so lawns we've got whether
they<00:02:34.710> have<00:02:34.830> roundabouts<00:02:35.310> pretty<00:02:35.640> much<00:02:35.790> one<00:02:35.940> in

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
they have roundabouts pretty much one in

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.760 
they have roundabouts pretty much one in
six<00:02:36.240> this<00:02:36.360> year<00:02:36.420> long<00:02:36.690> has<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.900> 105<00:02:37.410> because

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
six this year long has a 105 because

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.530 
six this year long has a 105 because
that's<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.160> one-way<00:02:38.370> but<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:39.000> could<00:02:39.180> become<00:02:39.450> in

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
that's a one-way but you could become in

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.420 
that's a one-way but you could become in
that<00:02:39.660> way<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:39.990> go<00:02:40.200> out<00:02:40.320> another<00:02:40.530> five<00:02:40.770> so

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
that way and go out another five so

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.920 
that way and go out another five so
there's<00:02:41.580> lots<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:42.000> chances<00:02:42.210> options<00:02:42.810> where

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
there's lots of chances options where

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.440 
there's lots of chances options where
you've<00:02:43.050> got<00:02:43.110> one<00:02:43.320> in<00:02:43.440> 61<00:02:43.740> 61<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.520> six<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:44.940> even

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
you've got one in 61 61 and six and even

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.760 
you've got one in 61 61 and six and even
if<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.600> get<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.900> shortest<00:02:46.320> route<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.620> getting

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
if you get the shortest route to getting

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.490 
if you get the shortest route to getting

the only chance that we've got to

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.340 
the only chance that we've got to
actually<00:03:01.920> see<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.430> bug<00:03:02.970> even<00:03:03.360> succeed<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.080> find

actually see a bug even succeed and find
the<00:03:04.440> way<00:03:04.530> through<00:03:04.680> this<00:03:04.770> maze<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.340> I've<00:03:05.820> made

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
the way through this maze and I've made

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000 
the way through this maze and I've made
it<00:03:06.150> as<00:03:06.209> hard<00:03:06.390> as<00:03:06.510> account<00:03:06.840> is<00:03:07.020> because<00:03:07.620> we've

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
it as hard as account is because we've

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.060 
it as hard as account is because we've
got<00:03:08.130> 30<00:03:08.459> of<00:03:08.790> them<00:03:08.880> going<00:03:09.360> in<00:03:09.570> all<00:03:09.780> at<00:03:09.930> once<00:03:10.070> and

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
got 30 of them going in all at once and

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.710 
got 30 of them going in all at once and
they<00:03:11.490> are<00:03:11.640> all<00:03:11.820> going<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.060> just<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:12.420> interact

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
they are all going to just and interact

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.720 
they are all going to just and interact
with<00:03:12.810> each<00:03:12.870> other<00:03:13.020> and<00:03:13.290> that<00:03:13.530> also<00:03:13.950> changes

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
with each other and that also changes

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.040 
with each other and that also changes
the<00:03:14.760> odds<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.240> statistics<00:03:15.870> because

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
the odds and statistics because

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.140 
the odds and statistics because
sometimes<00:03:16.950> at<00:03:17.130> wedg<00:03:17.310> sometimes<00:03:17.790> they'll<00:03:17.970> help

sometimes at wedg sometimes they'll help

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.759 
sometimes at wedg sometimes they'll help
sometimes<00:03:19.140> you'll<00:03:19.290> find<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.560> bug<00:03:19.739> that

sometimes you'll find a bug that

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.070 
sometimes you'll find a bug that

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269
