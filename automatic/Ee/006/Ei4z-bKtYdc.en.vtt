00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.570
 hello that such friends as they are I am x 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.820
 1050 with a new delivery of the news 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.289
 league of legends the pp once again 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.759
 has updated and this time they have 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.340
 implemented the use of zone in 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.050
 your other cooking and arcade skins the 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.029
 truth and it seems to me to sound every the 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.169
 not a very minimal difference since 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.790
 the changes in the 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.110
 textures that have been applied to this to 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.610
 difference of those that in class that 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.800
 you can notice the changes much better 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.690
 there have also been new changes in the 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.340
 last of it both in its sound as 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.700
 in its effects let's look to see what it is 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.700
 about 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.600
 following with other news apparently 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.120
 a new event is coming very similar to 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.619
 that there was a while ago about flavor 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.810
 this time with the theme of the success of 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.670
 your lime all this as it takes to be seen 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.259
 leader of the ratings narration team 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.360
 who was not aware about this 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.220
 event and posted this tweet saying 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.899
 tucked in the sand an event 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.310
 based on the history of lol I do not know 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.320
 you but to me it makes me a clear 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.750
 reference to the success of yuri man and a 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.860
 upcoming event that we will be enjoying 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.210
 well those are the rumors 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.619
 speculations and we'll have to wait 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.770
 a little more to see more information 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.630
 about this next event and passing another 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.399
 I was navigating a bit in the 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.210
 ppb folders looking images and 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.100
 files that may result 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.750
 interesting and I found those 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.350
 four images with the name of set 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.880
 low 3 and karim low 5 those images 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.710
 they are in the folder where they are 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.240
 all splicers and loading images 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.819
 of the champions with their respective 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.799
 corners when the rayet is about to launch 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.420
 a new skin for a champion and that's 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.210
 player is still in progress placed in 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.670
 this image so new skins for the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.799
 Caribbean series who knows the truth then 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.330
 very likely but as I always say it is 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.649
 question of waiting for that through 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.470
 a little more information about those 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.480
 corners that come on the way 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.980
 and finally a small update 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.810
 in the game interface options 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.400
 now we will have the option of being able 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.200
 change the title we want to see about 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.700
 a champion if the invoker name of 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.110
 respective player who is playing in 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.550
 this moment with the champion or 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.200
 simply the original name of the 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.270
 champion and yes although what I just 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.340
 say it sounded very redundant but good at 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.960
 few words we can choose if we see the 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.570
 name of the invoker is or that of the 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.980
 good champions that's been all for today 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.630
 if you liked this delivery they made us 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.190
 league of legends do not forget to leave your 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.570
 like to share the study so that 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.070
 others are also aware of the 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.990
 new attentions the league of legends 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.760

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.830
 of the other deliveries I dismiss 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.610

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.610
