painting side of it interested me more

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.520 
painting side of it interested me more
back<00:00:45.090> when<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.510> was<00:00:45.660> beginning<00:00:46.490> and<00:00:47.490> the<00:00:48.530> and

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
back when I was beginning and the and

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.360 
back when I was beginning and the and
I've<00:00:49.710> always<00:00:50.070> sort<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.370> been<00:00:51.500> comfortable

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
I've always sort of been comfortable

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.210 
I've always sort of been comfortable
I<00:00:53.400> think<00:00:54.120> painting<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.050> being<00:00:55.260> by<00:00:55.440> myself<00:00:56.690> and

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
I think painting and being by myself and

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.900 
I think painting and being by myself and
and<00:00:59.220> getting<00:00:59.430> jobs<00:00:59.850> done<00:01:00.150> on<00:01:01.140> my<00:01:01.530> terms<00:01:01.910> rather

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
and getting jobs done on my terms rather

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.130 
and getting jobs done on my terms rather
than<00:01:04.070> as<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.220> part<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.790> large<00:01:06.030> group<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.750> so

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
than as a part of a large group and so

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.510 
than as a part of a large group and so
that's<00:01:07.460> maybe<00:01:08.460> what<00:01:08.759> drew<00:01:08.970> me<00:01:09.150> away<00:01:09.450> from<00:01:09.750> from

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
that's maybe what drew me away from from

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:19.340 
that's maybe what drew me away from from
architecture<00:01:11.520> or<00:01:12.030> design<00:01:14.119> it's<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:18.319> you<00:01:19.319> know

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
architecture or design it's the you know

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.010 
architecture or design it's the you know
for<00:01:19.679> many<00:01:19.859> years<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.310> loved<00:01:21.149> architectural

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
for many years I loved architectural

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.719 
for many years I loved architectural
illustration<00:01:22.560> it's<00:01:23.249> just<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:24.829> after<00:01:25.829> you<00:01:26.460> do

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
illustration it's just that after you do

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.660 
illustration it's just that after you do
it<00:01:26.880> for<00:01:27.240> long<00:01:27.810> enough<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:28.710> can<00:01:29.159> get<00:01:29.429> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
it for long enough you can get the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.849 
it for long enough you can get the
feeling<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.179> maybe<00:01:30.450> you're<00:01:30.719> more<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.770> a

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:31.859 
feeling that maybe you're more of a

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:34.580 
feeling that maybe you're more of a
production<00:01:32.159> line<00:01:32.609> than<00:01:33.060> an<00:01:33.569> individual<00:01:34.259> and

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
production line than an individual and

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.129 
production line than an individual and
so<00:01:35.219> as<00:01:35.399> I<00:01:35.429> started<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.509> come<00:01:36.749> out<00:01:36.780> of

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:37.139 
so as I started to come out of

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:41.599 
so as I started to come out of
illustration<00:01:38.069> and<00:01:38.340> into<00:01:39.060> fine<00:01:39.240> art<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:40.609> just

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:41.609 
illustration and into fine art I just

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:43.489 
illustration and into fine art I just
loved<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.600> fact<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.960> there<00:01:43.170> was<00:01:43.319> nobody

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:43.499 
loved the fact that there was nobody

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:45.949 
loved the fact that there was nobody
else<00:01:43.709> telling<00:01:44.280> me<00:01:44.399> what<00:01:44.609> I<00:01:44.639> had<00:01:44.819> to<00:01:44.909> paint<00:01:45.119> we

00:01:45.949 --> 00:01:45.959 
else telling me what I had to paint we

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:48.620 
else telling me what I had to paint we
could<00:01:46.139> choose<00:01:46.579> any<00:01:47.579> subject<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.299> could<00:01:48.450> paint

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
could choose any subject I could paint

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.949 
could choose any subject I could paint
it<00:01:48.749> any<00:01:48.869> way<00:01:49.170> they<00:01:49.499> were<00:01:50.389> absolutely<00:01:51.389> no<00:01:51.719> rules

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:51.959 
it any way they were absolutely no rules

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:56.029 
it any way they were absolutely no rules
put<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:52.350> me<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.740> that's<00:01:54.770> just<00:01:55.770> been<00:01:55.889> an

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
put on me and that's just been an

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.090 
put on me and that's just been an
incredible<00:01:57.200> my<00:01:58.200> father's<00:01:58.560> been<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.799> water

where<00:04:37.479> I'm<00:04:37.599> taking<00:04:37.810> either<00:04:38.880> two<00:04:39.880> different

where I'm taking either two different
hues<00:04:40.890> or

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
hues or

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.850 
hues or
different<00:04:42.530> temperatures<00:04:43.720> of<00:04:44.720> paint<00:04:45.560> and

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
different temperatures of paint and

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.149 
different temperatures of paint and
mixing<00:04:46.550> that<00:04:46.729> and<00:04:47.210> then<00:04:48.199> varying<00:04:48.770> the<00:04:48.919> tone

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:49.159 
mixing that and then varying the tone

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:55.839 
mixing that and then varying the tone
with<00:04:49.550> my<00:04:50.409> well<00:04:51.409> water<00:04:51.849> to<00:04:52.849> create<00:04:53.090> a<00:04:54.759> sort<00:04:55.759> of

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:55.849 
with my well water to create a sort of

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:01.420 
with my well water to create a sort of
changing<00:04:56.539> and<00:04:56.780> and<00:04:57.879> evolving<00:04:59.319> glaze<00:05:00.430> and

changing and and evolving glaze and

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.529 
changing and and evolving glaze and
you'll<00:05:01.669> see<00:05:01.940> that<00:05:02.120> I<00:05:02.300> use<00:05:02.629> that<00:05:02.900> in<00:05:04.539> almost

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
you'll see that I use that in almost

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.869 
you'll see that I use that in almost
every<00:05:05.900> layer<00:05:06.319> of<00:05:06.650> my<00:05:06.830> painting<00:05:07.310> anytime<00:05:07.699> I

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:07.879 
every layer of my painting anytime I

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:10.809 
every layer of my painting anytime I
have<00:05:08.030> a<00:05:08.060> chance<00:05:08.389> to<00:05:08.690> change<00:05:09.129> the<00:05:10.129> value<00:05:10.550> I'll

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:10.819 
have a chance to change the value I'll

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:15.129 
have a chance to change the value I'll
dip<00:05:11.539> into<00:05:11.780> the<00:05:12.110> the<00:05:12.680> water<00:05:13.330> and<00:05:14.330> if<00:05:14.599> I<00:05:14.719> start<00:05:15.050> to

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
dip into the the water and if I start to

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:17.439 
dip into the the water and if I start to
feel<00:05:15.319> something<00:05:15.680> getting<00:05:16.039> too<00:05:16.219> cool<00:05:16.520> I'll<00:05:17.180> add

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:17.449 
feel something getting too cool I'll add

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.830 
feel something getting too cool I'll add
a<00:05:17.479> warm<00:05:18.099> but<00:05:19.099> it's<00:05:19.280> if<00:05:20.210> there's<00:05:20.479> something

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
a warm but it's if there's something

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.689 
a warm but it's if there's something
signature<00:05:21.379> I<00:05:21.409> think<00:05:21.830> that<00:05:22.129> that<00:05:22.280> that's

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:22.699 
signature I think that that that's

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:27.670 
signature I think that that that's
certainly<00:05:23.150> one<00:05:23.449> of<00:05:23.479> them<00:05:25.659> that<00:05:26.659> and<00:05:26.960> the

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
certainly one of them that and the

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.279 
certainly one of them that and the
occasional<00:05:28.219> splatter<00:05:28.580> or<00:05:28.909> are<00:05:29.719> doing<00:05:30.139> some

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289 
occasional splatter or are doing some

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:35.309 
occasional splatter or are doing some
dry<00:05:30.469> brush<00:05:30.740> what<00:05:31.550> is<00:05:31.669> a<00:05:31.699> typical<00:05:31.940> painting<00:05:32.599> day

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:39.879 

there<00:05:37.150> are<00:05:38.150> so<00:05:38.449> few<00:05:38.479> typical<00:05:39.169> painting<00:05:39.620> days

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889
