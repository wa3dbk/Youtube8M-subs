00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
and normally when you're using a regular

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.630 
and normally when you're using a regular
green<00:01:34.890> pigment<00:01:35.720> even<00:01:36.720> at<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:36.990> stage<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:38.490> can

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
green pigment even at this stage you can

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.639 
green pigment even at this stage you can
rarely<00:01:38.880> see<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.330> blood<00:01:39.600> mixing<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.259> really

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
rarely see the blood mixing that really

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:51.520 
rarely see the blood mixing that really
has<00:01:40.830> sort<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.250> muddy<00:01:41.549> look<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.149> it<00:01:42.299> yeah
