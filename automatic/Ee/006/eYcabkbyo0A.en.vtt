00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.970
 economic sanctions should have been 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.029
 punish Moscow for illegal 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.250
 Crimea joining fine but now 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.919
 after a year it became clear they have an effect 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.590
 which was not expected in particular in that 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.270
 concerns food ban 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.670
 exports have harmed many manufacturers 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.649
 food in the European Union 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.629
 and in Russia, opposite to local products 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.090
 restaurants are in great demand 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.649
 they are not only often cheaper than imported ones 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.269
 and coincides with the patriotic 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:52.239
 moods in the country provincial 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:54.579
 idyll not far from Moscow and in his 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.460
 farm farmer alexander breeds not 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.109
 only pigs and cows and poultry after 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.539
 Russian food embargo 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:05.650
 he has a lot of sales from the European Union 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:07.870
 increased no matter meat milk and foxes all 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.120
 Selling much better now I 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.090
 bought more chickens two more cows 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.040
 two cows bought themselves Alexander 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.280

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.430
 shop in Moscow and sales have increased here 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.729
 40 percent over the past 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.009
 a year to buy local products now 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.619
 popularly this is due to political 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.840
 situation people are more willing to buy products 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.909
 which are produced nearby before 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.369
 such products and there was virtually no 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.920
 import was cheaper now the situation 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.240
 is changing 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.700
 desire to buy local products 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.289
 affect the restaurant business in Moscow 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.289
 recently opened a lot 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:50.320
 restaurants with local cuisine such as 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:52.420
 this restaurant is 15 sestercii name 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.820
 the restaurant speaks of 15 former Soviet 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.759
 Republics are cooked according to recipes with 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.439
 Russia of the Caucasus and Central Asia I 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.640
 I think that we can be proud of our 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.429
 national cuisine 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.289
 I think it says about finding my own 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:06.939
 accessories that last time 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.890
 it feels good in Russia 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.869
 no matter because of your search 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.580
 accessories or simply and for desire 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.770
 eat local produce but one 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.950
 it is clear that the affairs of institutions with regional 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:21.610
 Kitchens go better Of course it is easier for us 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.819
 ban on imported products we don't need 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.790
 Parmesan 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.010
 mozzarella and french brie we cook 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.139
 from local products products from 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.719
 the European Union may soon disappear completely 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:34.749
 from the Russian restaurant business considers 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:37.280
 President of the Federation of Restaurateurs 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:38.989
 restaurants rebuilt if sanctions 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.060
 last even longer just for example 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.480
 a product from Italy is not possible at all 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.069
 will be able to return here 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.590
 this is bad news for italian 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.659
 restaurant owner valentina bontempi 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.579
 many dishes they can no longer 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.889
 cook since such foods 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:58.189
 as parmesan can no longer be imported 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:59.719
 worse embargo is a weak ruble all 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.400
 fewer guests can afford 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:03.379
 expensive western restaurants and 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.010
 at the same time rising procurement costs 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:09.680
 I have less profit 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.419
 inflation comes to forty percent so 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.730
 high i can't raise prices it 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:18.250
 means i need to save earlier 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.250
 I had 15 cooks now only 10 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:22.760
 but close pan tempo doesn't think in 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.980
 unlike many of his colleagues because 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.780
 import ban and economic crisis 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.509
 in Moscow were forced to close already 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.509
 hundreds of restaurants with new slots
