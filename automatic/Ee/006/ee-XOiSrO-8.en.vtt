00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
is just that on the offense he has a

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.770 
is just that on the offense he has a
little<00:02:41.070> bit<00:02:41.160> of<00:02:41.190> tweaks<00:02:41.670> that<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.240> know<00:02:42.420> every

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780

little bit of tweaks that you know every
rookie<00:02:43.110> needs<00:02:43.350> but<00:02:44.280> he<00:02:44.580> has<00:02:44.760> most<00:02:45.150> of<00:02:45.480> the

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
rookie needs but he has most of the

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.410 
rookie needs but he has most of the
important<00:02:46.560> things<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:47.070> you<00:02:47.370> need<00:02:47.550> in<00:02:47.910> a

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
important things that you need in a

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.100 
important things that you need in a
center<00:02:48.960> /<00:02:49.350> power<00:02:49.650> forward<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:50.750> his<00:02:51.750> strongest

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
center / power forward and his strongest

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.500 
center / power forward and his strongest
suit<00:02:52.620> is<00:02:52.860> on<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.520> defensive<00:02:54.120> side<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.390> the

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
suit is on the defensive side of the

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.600 
suit is on the defensive side of the
ball<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:55.050> offense<00:02:55.590> like<00:02:56.490> I<00:02:56.520> said<00:02:57.200> Stubb<00:02:58.200> and

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
ball the offense like I said Stubb and

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.250 
ball the offense like I said Stubb and
if<00:02:59.610> he<00:02:59.760> wants<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.030> work<00:03:00.270> a<00:03:00.420> jump<00:03:00.720> shot<00:03:00.870> in<00:03:01.050> there

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
if he wants to work a jump shot in there

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.050 
if he wants to work a jump shot in there
he<00:03:01.410> could<00:03:01.560> do<00:03:01.680> that<00:03:01.860> as<00:03:02.040> well<00:03:02.070> but<00:03:02.640> other<00:03:02.880> than

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
he could do that as well but other than

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.200 
he could do that as well but other than
that<00:03:03.180> I<00:03:03.600> mean<00:03:04.020> if<00:03:04.620> you<00:03:04.890> have<00:03:05.160> New<00:03:05.640> Orleans<00:03:06.000> was

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
that I mean if you have New Orleans was

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.630 
that I mean if you have New Orleans was
looking<00:03:06.450> for<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:06.690> great<00:03:06.930> defender<00:03:07.560> they<00:03:08.190> got<00:03:08.460> it

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
looking for a great defender they got it

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.120 
looking for a great defender they got it
in<00:03:08.790> Anthony<00:03:09.180> Davis<00:03:09.660> because<00:03:10.020> like<00:03:10.260> I<00:03:10.380> said<00:03:10.440> his

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
in Anthony Davis because like I said his

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.390 
in Anthony Davis because like I said his
wingspan<00:03:12.200> hit<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.380> way<00:03:13.500> he<00:03:13.710> goes<00:03:13.890> after<00:03:14.160> the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
wingspan hit the way he goes after the

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.500 
wingspan hit the way he goes after the
ball<00:03:14.720> rebounds<00:03:15.920> blocking<00:03:16.920> shots<00:03:17.240> he<00:03:18.240> pretty

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
ball rebounds blocking shots he pretty

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.380 
ball rebounds blocking shots he pretty
much<00:03:18.630> could<00:03:19.080> do<00:03:19.230> it<00:03:19.380> all<00:03:19.590> down<00:03:19.920> below<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.910> the

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
much could do it all down below the the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.449 
much could do it all down below the the
other<00:03:21.570> thing<00:03:21.930> that<00:03:21.959> he<00:03:22.290> needs<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.680> do<00:03:23.220> though

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
other thing that he needs to do though

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.660 
other thing that he needs to do though
is<00:03:23.720> get<00:03:24.720> more<00:03:24.990> muscle<00:03:25.590> because<00:03:26.070> when<00:03:26.520> you're

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
is get more muscle because when you're

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.900 
is get more muscle because when you're
down<00:03:26.880> below<00:03:27.240> all<00:03:27.510> those<00:03:27.810> elbows<00:03:28.520> all<00:03:29.520> those

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
down below all those elbows all those

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.810 
down below all those elbows all those
contact<00:03:30.600> is<00:03:31.260> gonna<00:03:31.500> wear<00:03:31.770> on<00:03:31.980> them<00:03:32.160> yeah<00:03:32.400> yeah

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
contact is gonna wear on them yeah yeah

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.330 
contact is gonna wear on them yeah yeah
he's<00:03:33.120> young<00:03:33.420> but<00:03:33.450> at<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.840> same<00:03:34.080> time<00:03:34.350> it<00:03:34.709> will

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
he's young but at the same time it will

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.730 
he's young but at the same time it will
it<00:03:36.330> will<00:03:36.360> affect<00:03:36.840> them<00:03:37.020> later<00:03:37.260> on<00:03:37.350> in<00:03:37.650> his

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
it will affect them later on in his

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.850 
it will affect them later on in his
career<00:03:37.980> so<00:03:38.400> I'm<00:03:38.580> suggesting<00:03:39.209> something<00:03:40.200> Davis

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
career so I'm suggesting something Davis

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.160 
career so I'm suggesting something Davis
is<00:03:41.010> that<00:03:41.300> he<00:03:42.300> needs<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.510> put<00:03:42.720> on<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:42.840> little<00:03:42.990> bit

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
is that he needs to put on a little bit

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.910 
is that he needs to put on a little bit
more<00:03:43.320> muscle<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:44.750> once<00:03:45.750> he<00:03:45.870> does<00:03:46.200> that<00:03:46.260> he

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
more muscle and once he does that he

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.410 
more muscle and once he does that he
could<00:03:47.100> withstand<00:03:47.220> all<00:03:47.580> those<00:03:47.730> elbows<00:03:48.150> all

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
could withstand all those elbows all

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.330 
could withstand all those elbows all
those<00:03:48.600> contacts<00:03:49.320> and<00:03:49.440> he<00:03:49.530> can<00:03:49.709> still<00:03:49.920> be<00:03:50.130> able

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
those contacts and he can still be able

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.750 
those contacts and he can still be able

future point guard I believe the new

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.550 
future point guard I believe the new
orleans<00:04:27.880> hornets<00:04:28.180> can<00:04:28.540> make<00:04:28.750> the<00:04:29.050> playoffs

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
orleans hornets can make the playoffs

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.120 
orleans hornets can make the playoffs
this<00:04:29.920> season<00:04:30.190> if<00:04:30.660> they<00:04:31.660> have<00:04:32.260> a<00:04:32.620> good<00:04:32.890> solid

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
this season if they have a good solid

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.640 
this season if they have a good solid
defense<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:34.000> a<00:04:34.210> good<00:04:34.450> offense<00:04:34.930> but<00:04:35.170> mostly

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
defense and a good offense but mostly

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.010 
defense and a good offense but mostly
they<00:04:36.040> need<00:04:36.250> solid<00:04:36.790> defense<00:04:37.510> and<00:04:37.630> I<00:04:37.750> think

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
they need solid defense and I think

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.290 
they need solid defense and I think
Anthony<00:04:38.260> Davis<00:04:38.800> will<00:04:38.980> provide<00:04:39.400> a<00:04:39.640> lot<00:04:39.970> of<00:04:40.000> that
