00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 pedrosa manrique scales, which is a race mechanic, explains which 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.089
 are the most frequent faults likely type of fault most frequent 

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:11.139
 for being in the engine management injection system 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.260
 this realization turbo and cooling but many cases 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.330
 before our car is the father a luminous witness will warn us of the 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.119
 problem the new in the types what he estimated that if they can turn us on 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.640
 in the box designing the title 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.979
 the messi by parasistema refrigeration 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:32.589
 creel we are going to turn on a thermometer was always in great color 

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:33.460
 Red 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.990
 which is indicating a problem 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.380
 in the foot it may come well because of excess temperature derived after water 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.970
 by zapotiltic raids or radiator body type cooling system 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.440
 the other type of dismissal another indicator that they are taught as a witness in the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.360
 picture 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.820
 of how oil pressure can be witnessed we will always get a 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.690
 typical so it was tiny 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.050
 in red 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.590
 which have a problem 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.890
 can come originated by good for lack of pressure pump lack of 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.590
 oil in order a series of tve data then it would already be on the fly 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.660
 in we have the system that's a braked issue 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.690
 that that light in that will be the ABC system will prevent talent surrounded by a 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:16.940
 circuit 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.170
 we are told about pop 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.760
 for motivation you lack brake fluid 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.800
 or for wear of pills 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.420
 Well, that takes care of the body to know what there is always 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.360
 to be aware of watching it 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.840
 but the most dangerous witnesses that he can 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.580
 to referendo in the control of stoppages 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.320
 refrigeration 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.650
 oil and engine management 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.040
 although without analysts you see that it happens to you 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.090
 the magic word is maintenance listen to the advice of our expert 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.650
 especially so that the vehicle they nicknamed him in January I went out with him not 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.330
 they were damaged 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.990
 I am a bit of consideration and be aware of the maintenance is 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.760
 the situation of the vehicle 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.120
 completely 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.780
 i good yes no try always stretch you could get there you could not give if 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.549
 not always based 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.830
 preferable to stop and ask 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.110
 voodoo do in the doubt we were always in cars and we have been given 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.139
 a light 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:17.359
 and we read it we knew it if we do not understand it in the manual you can call 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.579
 it was applied you can see it even you can go see the vehicle 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:22.699
 but I'll try 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:25.629
 I've been there for so many meters 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.359
 because you that according to avastin breakdown much greater
