concerned with the lowest point of our
swing<00:00:27.460> we<00:00:27.669> could<00:00:27.849> swing<00:00:28.090> slightly<00:00:28.540> up<00:00:28.720> and<00:00:28.960> hit

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.110 
swing we could swing slightly up and hit

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.690 
swing we could swing slightly up and hit
a<00:00:29.140> ball<00:00:29.349> that's<00:00:29.619> on<00:00:29.770> a<00:00:29.800> tee<00:00:30.070> we<00:00:30.340> could<00:00:30.460> swing

a ball that's on a tee we could swing

a ball that's on a tee we could swing
level<00:00:31.029> and<00:00:31.419> hit<00:00:31.630> the<00:00:31.750> ball<00:00:31.930> off<00:00:32.110> the<00:00:32.140> tee<00:00:32.410> or<00:00:32.770> we

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
level and hit the ball off the tee or we

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.950 
level and hit the ball off the tee or we

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
could even swing slightly downward and

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.630 
could even swing slightly downward and
still<00:00:35.200> make<00:00:35.350> clean<00:00:35.620> contact<00:00:36.160> with<00:00:36.370> a<00:00:36.430> ball

that's<00:00:36.820> on<00:00:37.000> the<00:00:37.090> tee<00:00:37.270> but<00:00:37.990> when<00:00:38.110> it's<00:00:38.260> on<00:00:38.380> the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:40.240 
ground and many of you have probably

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.200 
ground and many of you have probably
seen<00:00:40.510> a<00:00:40.750> video<00:00:41.280> slow<00:00:42.280> motion<00:00:42.790> on<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:43.030> Golf

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
seen a video slow motion on the Golf

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.450 
seen a video slow motion on the Golf
Channel<00:00:43.410> where<00:00:44.410> the<00:00:44.440> club<00:00:44.770> comes<00:00:45.040> into<00:00:45.340> the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
Channel where the club comes into the

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.980 
Channel where the club comes into the
ball<00:00:46.740> strikes<00:00:47.740> it<00:00:48.040> and<00:00:48.250> then<00:00:49.030> takes<00:00:49.300> this<00:00:49.540> huge

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:49.990 
ball strikes it and then takes this huge

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.500 
ball strikes it and then takes this huge
divot<00:00:50.440> and<00:00:50.650> a<00:00:51.310> lot<00:00:51.430> of<00:00:51.520> people<00:00:51.730> ask<00:00:51.970> me<00:00:52.150> as<00:00:52.480> a

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
divot and a lot of people ask me as a

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.180 
divot and a lot of people ask me as a
coach<00:00:52.840> they'll<00:00:53.079> ask<00:00:53.260> me<00:00:53.500> how<00:00:53.740> can<00:00:53.800> you<00:00:53.950> take

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
coach they'll ask me how can you take

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.250 
coach they'll ask me how can you take
such<00:00:54.370> a<00:00:54.400> huge<00:00:54.490> divot<00:00:55.120> and<00:00:55.300> hit<00:00:55.630> the<00:00:55.780> ball<00:00:55.960> so

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
such a huge divot and hit the ball so

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.950 
such a huge divot and hit the ball so
solidly<00:00:56.770> and<00:00:56.920> I<00:00:57.520> think<00:00:57.760> probably<00:00:57.970> the<00:00:58.270> main

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
solidly and I think probably the main

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.800 
solidly and I think probably the main
reason<00:00:58.989> for<00:00:59.500> that<00:00:59.770> question<00:01:00.040> is<00:01:00.510> many<00:01:01.510> people

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
reason for that question is many people

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.049 
reason for that question is many people
don't<00:01:02.050> realize<00:01:02.590> that<00:01:02.620> the<00:01:03.040> club<00:01:03.370> doesn't<00:01:03.790> hit

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
don't realize that the club doesn't hit

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.240 
don't realize that the club doesn't hit
the<00:01:04.239> ground<00:01:04.570> and<00:01:05.019> take<00:01:05.649> out<00:01:05.799> a<00:01:05.829> chunk<00:01:06.130> of

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
the ground and take out a chunk of

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.610 
the ground and take out a chunk of
ground<00:01:06.430> and<00:01:06.790> then<00:01:07.030> hit<00:01:07.240> the<00:01:07.329> ball<00:01:07.509> many<00:01:08.320> people

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
ground and then hit the ball many people

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.410 
ground and then hit the ball many people
think<00:01:08.890> that<00:01:08.950> that<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.700> club's<00:01:09.970> going<00:01:10.180> to<00:01:10.240> got

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
think that that the club's going to got

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.930 
think that that the club's going to got
has<00:01:10.840> to<00:01:10.870> go<00:01:11.170> then<00:01:11.380> under<00:01:11.979> the<00:01:12.100> ball<00:01:12.310> to<00:01:12.670> get<00:01:12.790> it

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
has to go then under the ball to get it

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.030 
has to go then under the ball to get it
up<00:01:13.060> in<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.330> air<00:01:13.479> and<00:01:13.750> so<00:01:14.500> when<00:01:14.650> they<00:01:14.770> see<00:01:14.830> that

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
up in the air and so when they see that

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.530 
up in the air and so when they see that
huge<00:01:15.280> divot<00:01:15.640> flying<00:01:15.909> they're<00:01:16.120> thinking<00:01:16.420> that

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
huge divot flying they're thinking that

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.240 
huge divot flying they're thinking that
the<00:01:16.659> club<00:01:16.870> has<00:01:17.020> come<00:01:17.229> in<00:01:17.409> it's<00:01:17.680> hit<00:01:17.860> the<00:01:17.890> ground

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
the club has come in it's hit the ground

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.210 
the club has come in it's hit the ground
and<00:01:18.520> gone<00:01:19.120> down<00:01:19.390> and<00:01:19.810> dragged<00:01:20.680> through<00:01:21.070> all

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
and gone down and dragged through all

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.890 
and gone down and dragged through all
this<00:01:21.430> turf<00:01:21.700> before<00:01:22.150> it<00:01:22.240> hit<00:01:22.360> the<00:01:22.390> ball<00:01:22.630> and

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
this turf before it hit the ball and

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.420 
this turf before it hit the ball and
that's<00:01:23.080> just<00:01:23.260> not<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.560> case<00:01:23.710> what<00:01:24.400> actually

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
that's just not the case what actually

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.340 
that's just not the case what actually
happens<00:01:25.360> when<00:01:25.540> the<00:01:25.630> ball<00:01:25.780> sitting<00:01:26.049> on<00:01:26.229> the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
happens when the ball sitting on the

happens when the ball sitting on the
ground<00:01:26.530> if<00:01:27.159> you're<00:01:27.370> a<00:01:27.430> tour<00:01:27.670> player<00:01:27.729> or<00:01:28.270> a<00:01:28.299> low

ground if you're a tour player or a low

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.200 
ground if you're a tour player or a low
handicap<00:01:29.220> what's<00:01:30.220> actually<00:01:30.400> happening<00:01:31.030> is

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
handicap what's actually happening is

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.950 
handicap what's actually happening is
the<00:01:31.810> club<00:01:32.140> is<00:01:32.470> on<00:01:32.860> its<00:01:33.040> way<00:01:33.100> down<00:01:33.580> as<00:01:34.030> it's

at<00:01:44.440> all<00:01:44.560> at<00:01:44.710> this<00:01:44.830> point<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.970> gonna<00:01:46.119> hit<00:01:46.330> the

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
at all at this point it's gonna hit the

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.080 
at all at this point it's gonna hit the
ball<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.869> ball<00:01:47.020> is<00:01:47.110> going<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.260> kind<00:01:47.500> of<00:01:47.909> fly<00:01:48.909> up

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
ball the ball is going to kind of fly up

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.760 
ball the ball is going to kind of fly up
in<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.270> air<00:01:49.360> and<00:01:49.689> then<00:01:50.049> the<00:01:50.080> club<00:01:50.439> is<00:01:50.560> going<00:01:50.710> to

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
in the air and then the club is going to

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.020 
in the air and then the club is going to
dig<00:01:51.100> through<00:01:51.549> the<00:01:52.299> turf<00:01:52.710> after<00:01:53.710> it<00:01:54.580> hits<00:01:54.850> the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
dig through the turf after it hits the

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.200 
dig through the turf after it hits the
ball<00:01:55.240> so<00:01:55.960> what<00:01:56.110> that<00:01:56.229> means<00:01:56.470> is<00:01:56.770> as<00:01:57.040> the<00:01:57.970> club's

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
ball so what that means is as the club's

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.600 
ball so what that means is as the club's
coming<00:01:58.510> to<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.720> ball<00:01:58.900> it's<00:01:59.830> still<00:02:00.159> up<00:02:00.369> it's

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
coming to the ball it's still up it's

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.399 
coming to the ball it's still up it's
still<00:02:00.790> up<00:02:01.000> it's<00:02:01.210> still<00:02:01.420> up<00:02:01.600> it's<00:02:01.810> still<00:02:02.020> up<00:02:02.200> it

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
still up it's still up it's still up it

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.399 
still up it's still up it's still up it
hits<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.740> ball<00:02:02.860> it's<00:02:03.130> still<00:02:03.369> traveling<00:02:03.939> down

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
hits the ball it's still traveling down

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.870 
hits the ball it's still traveling down
for<00:02:05.409> a<00:02:05.439> long<00:02:05.710> time<00:02:06.070> after<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.580> ball<00:02:06.759> is

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
for a long time after the ball is

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.649 
for a long time after the ball is
already<00:02:07.240> gone

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
already gone

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.710 
already gone
the<00:02:08.019> lowest<00:02:08.470> point<00:02:08.830> of<00:02:08.979> that<00:02:09.159> arc<00:02:09.489> is<00:02:10.420> going<00:02:10.659> to

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
the lowest point of that arc is going to

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.259 
the lowest point of that arc is going to
be<00:02:10.810> somewhere<00:02:11.230> between<00:02:11.500> two<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:12.340> six<00:02:12.999> inches

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
be somewhere between two and six inches

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.629 
be somewhere between two and six inches
on<00:02:13.719> the<00:02:14.230> target<00:02:14.650> side<00:02:14.859> of<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.069> ball<00:02:15.249> so<00:02:15.519> if

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:15.639 
on the target side of the ball so if

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:18.270 
on the target side of the ball so if
your<00:02:15.760> ball<00:02:15.909> were<00:02:16.060> here<00:02:16.389> and<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:17.529> struck

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
your ball were here and you struck

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.220 
your ball were here and you struck
solidly<00:02:18.880> you'd<00:02:19.209> hit<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:19.450> cleanly<00:02:19.840> without

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
solidly you'd hit it cleanly without

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.440 
solidly you'd hit it cleanly without
hitting<00:02:20.410> any<00:02:20.650> grass<00:02:20.920> on<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.310> way<00:02:21.400> down<00:02:21.640> then

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
hitting any grass on the way down then

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.910 
hitting any grass on the way down then
your<00:02:22.569> club<00:02:22.750> would<00:02:22.900> enter<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.380> turf<00:02:23.620> on<00:02:23.830> the

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
your club would enter the turf on the

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.030 
your club would enter the turf on the
target<00:02:24.280> side<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:25.750> go<00:02:25.959> through<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.380> turf<00:02:26.620> for

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
target side and go through the turf for

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.010 
target side and go through the turf for
depending<00:02:27.970> on<00:02:28.060> how<00:02:28.180> steep<00:02:28.510> your<00:02:28.660> angle<00:02:28.959> of

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
depending on how steep your angle of

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.050 
depending on how steep your angle of
attack<00:02:29.140> is<00:02:29.590> go<00:02:30.280> through<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.670> turf<00:02:30.880> from

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
attack is go through the turf from

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.840 
attack is go through the turf from
anywhere<00:02:31.450> anywhere<00:02:31.870> from<00:02:32.020> two<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:33.069> ten<00:02:33.430> inches

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
anywhere anywhere from two to ten inches

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.500 
anywhere anywhere from two to ten inches
and<00:02:34.090> then<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:34.930> would<00:02:35.050> exit<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:36.209> come<00:02:37.209> off<00:02:37.360> this

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
and then it would exit and come off this

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.420 
and then it would exit and come off this
way<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:37.720> that<00:02:37.989> divot<00:02:38.500> is<00:02:38.680> going<00:02:39.069> to<00:02:39.130> happen

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
way and that divot is going to happen

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.309 
way and that divot is going to happen
after<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.030> ball<00:02:40.209> is<00:02:40.360> already<00:02:40.540> airborne<00:02:40.900> so<00:02:41.230> it

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
after the ball is already airborne so it

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.020 
after the ball is already airborne so it
actually<00:02:41.500> has<00:02:41.739> no<00:02:41.980> effect<00:02:42.430> on<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.700> flight<00:02:42.910> of

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
actually has no effect on the flight of

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.330 
actually has no effect on the flight of
the<00:02:43.120> ball<00:02:43.270> so<00:02:44.110> this<00:02:44.440> is<00:02:44.620> really<00:02:44.890> important

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
the ball so this is really important

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.710 
the ball so this is really important
because<00:02:45.400> not<00:02:45.819> only<00:02:46.060> in<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.239> fairway<00:02:46.569> when

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
because not only in the fairway when

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.660 
because not only in the fairway when
your<00:02:46.840> balls<00:02:46.959> sitting<00:02:47.380> kind<00:02:47.860> of<00:02:47.980> cleanly<00:02:48.489> on<00:02:48.640> a

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
your balls sitting kind of cleanly on a

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.880 
your balls sitting kind of cleanly on a
nice<00:02:48.910> lie<00:02:49.209> when<00:02:49.870> it's<00:02:50.020> in<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.260> rough<00:02:50.440> if<00:02:50.739> your

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
nice lie when it's in the rough if your

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.449 
nice lie when it's in the rough if your
ball<00:02:51.070> sitting<00:02:51.370> down<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:52.860> it's<00:02:53.860> there's<00:02:54.250> all

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
ball sitting down and it's there's all

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.640 
ball sitting down and it's there's all
this<00:02:54.670> grass<00:02:55.000> around<00:02:55.390> your<00:02:55.600> golf<00:02:55.810> ball<00:02:56.110> when

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
this grass around your golf ball when

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.290 
this grass around your golf ball when
you're<00:02:56.769> trying<00:02:57.100> to<00:02:57.220> hit<00:02:57.310> it<00:02:57.459> solidly<00:02:57.910> if<00:02:58.150> you

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
you're trying to hit it solidly if you

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.420 
you're trying to hit it solidly if you
try<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.600> go<00:02:58.810> down<00:02:59.110> and<00:02:59.590> get<00:02:59.709> your<00:02:59.860> club<00:03:00.160> really

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
try to go down and get your club really

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.850 
try to go down and get your club really
low<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.030> get<00:03:01.209> underneath<00:03:01.720> that<00:03:01.930> ball<00:03:02.170> you

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
low and get underneath that ball you

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.380 
low and get underneath that ball you
would<00:03:02.980> have<00:03:03.160> to<00:03:03.280> enter<00:03:03.310> that<00:03:03.819> heavy<00:03:04.060> rough

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
would have to enter that heavy rough

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.900 
would have to enter that heavy rough
about<00:03:04.750> four<00:03:05.470> or<00:03:05.739> six<00:03:05.980> inches<00:03:06.280> back<00:03:06.489> behind<00:03:06.700> the

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
about four or six inches back behind the

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.059 
about four or six inches back behind the
ball<00:03:07.060> so<00:03:07.660> you'd<00:03:07.840> enter<00:03:08.260> all<00:03:08.410> this<00:03:08.560> heavy<00:03:08.769> rough

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
ball so you'd enter all this heavy rough

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.229 
ball so you'd enter all this heavy rough
your<00:03:09.340> club<00:03:09.550> would<00:03:09.670> be<00:03:09.760> going<00:03:09.880> through<00:03:10.090> all

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
your club would be going through all

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.080 
your club would be going through all
this<00:03:10.560> gnarly<00:03:11.560> rough<00:03:11.980> before<00:03:12.489> it<00:03:12.580> finally<00:03:12.850> hit

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
this gnarly rough before it finally hit

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.850 
this gnarly rough before it finally hit
the<00:03:13.120> ball<00:03:13.360> at<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:13.600> point<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.410> club<00:03:14.650> slowed

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
the ball at that point the club slowed

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.440 
the ball at that point the club slowed
down<00:03:15.040> so<00:03:15.400> much<00:03:15.640> that<00:03:15.970> it<00:03:16.060> doesn't<00:03:16.300> have<00:03:16.420> any

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
down so much that it doesn't have any

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.440 
down so much that it doesn't have any
force<00:03:16.989> it<00:03:17.769> can't<00:03:18.069> propel<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:18.700> ball<00:03:18.819> very<00:03:19.090> far

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
force it can't propel the ball very far

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.940 
force it can't propel the ball very far
and<00:03:19.750> also<00:03:20.290> you're<00:03:20.440> going<00:03:20.470> to<00:03:20.620> get<00:03:20.739> a<00:03:20.769> lot<00:03:20.920> of

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
and also you're going to get a lot of

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.590 
and also you're going to get a lot of
grass<00:03:21.250> in<00:03:21.580> between<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:21.940> clubface<00:03:22.299> and<00:03:22.360> the

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
grass in between the clubface and the

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.810 
grass in between the clubface and the
ball<00:03:22.780> so<00:03:23.500> that's<00:03:23.680> going<00:03:23.860> to<00:03:23.920> take<00:03:24.400> some<00:03:24.430> spin

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
ball so that's going to take some spin

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.940 
ball so that's going to take some spin
off<00:03:25.000> of<00:03:25.150> it<00:03:25.269> make<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:25.450> fly<00:03:25.720> funny<00:03:26.079> definitely

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
off of it make it fly funny definitely

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.100 
off of it make it fly funny definitely
make<00:03:27.100> it<00:03:27.130> fly<00:03:27.459> shorter<00:03:27.940> so<00:03:28.570> when<00:03:28.750> we're<00:03:28.900> in<00:03:28.989> the

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
make it fly shorter so when we're in the

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.050 
make it fly shorter so when we're in the
rough<00:03:29.320> if<00:03:29.530> we've<00:03:29.739> got<00:03:29.980> a<00:03:30.010> forward<00:03:30.549> low<00:03:30.730> point

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
rough if we've got a forward low point

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.990 
rough if we've got a forward low point
or<00:03:31.299> a<00:03:31.630> descending<00:03:32.350> angle<00:03:32.680> of<00:03:32.799> attack<00:03:33.000> then

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
or a descending angle of attack then

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.240 
or a descending angle of attack then
we're<00:03:34.150> going<00:03:34.269> to<00:03:34.299> miss<00:03:34.570> all<00:03:35.019> of<00:03:35.079> that<00:03:35.650> rough<00:03:35.980> on

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
we're going to miss all of that rough on

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.770 
we're going to miss all of that rough on
our<00:03:36.280> way<00:03:36.549> to<00:03:36.610> the<00:03:36.760> ball<00:03:36.940> we<00:03:37.090> might<00:03:37.239> clip<00:03:37.480> just<00:03:37.630> a

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
our way to the ball we might clip just a

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.120 
our way to the ball we might clip just a
little<00:03:38.110> bit<00:03:38.230> of<00:03:38.320> it<00:03:38.440> on<00:03:38.530> our<00:03:38.560> way<00:03:38.769> to<00:03:38.829> the<00:03:38.950> ball

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
little bit of it on our way to the ball

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.949 
little bit of it on our way to the ball
but<00:03:39.700> we're<00:03:39.820> going<00:03:39.910> to<00:03:39.970> miss<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.180> lot<00:03:40.329> of<00:03:40.540> it<00:03:40.810> and

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
but we're going to miss a lot of it and

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.300 
but we're going to miss a lot of it and
so<00:03:41.140> we're<00:03:41.260> going<00:03:41.350> to<00:03:41.410> hit<00:03:41.590> pretty<00:03:42.040> clean

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
so we're going to hit pretty clean

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.430 
so we're going to hit pretty clean
contact<00:03:42.820> still<00:03:43.060> spin<00:03:43.420> it<00:03:43.540> pretty<00:03:43.750> well<00:03:43.959> and

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
contact still spin it pretty well and

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.020 
contact still spin it pretty well and
we're<00:03:44.980> going<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:45.130> get<00:03:45.250> pretty<00:03:45.519> good<00:03:45.579> distance

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
we're going to get pretty good distance

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.509 
we're going to get pretty good distance
too<00:03:46.299> so<00:03:46.930> for<00:03:46.959> were<00:03:47.260> low<00:03:47.380> points<00:03:47.709> extremely

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
too so for were low points extremely

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.699 
too so for were low points extremely
important<00:03:49.030> when<00:03:49.120> we're<00:03:49.269> talking<00:03:49.450> about<00:03:49.709> any

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
important when we're talking about any

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.590 
important when we're talking about any
shot<00:03:51.100> where<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:51.370> ball<00:03:51.640> is<00:03:51.850> sitting<00:03:52.030> on<00:03:52.390> the

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
shot where the ball is sitting on the

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.210 
shot where the ball is sitting on the
ground<00:03:52.630> and<00:03:53.109> so<00:03:53.560> you've<00:03:53.709> kind<00:03:53.920> of<00:03:54.010> read

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
ground and so you've kind of read

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.620 
ground and so you've kind of read
through<00:03:54.250> that<00:03:54.640> in<00:03:54.790> Chapter<00:03:55.180> two<00:03:55.359> and<00:03:55.390> now

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
through that in Chapter two and now

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.090 
through that in Chapter two and now
you're<00:03:55.780> getting<00:03:55.959> a<00:03:56.049> decent<00:03:56.230> visual<00:03:56.859> of<00:03:56.950> what

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
you're getting a decent visual of what

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.160 
you're getting a decent visual of what
it<00:03:57.190> might<00:03:57.340> look<00:03:57.489> like<00:03:57.549> to<00:03:57.850> hit<00:03:58.000> a<00:03:58.030> shot<00:03:58.329> or<00:03:59.079> the

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
it might look like to hit a shot or the

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.340 
it might look like to hit a shot or the
club's<00:03:59.410> descending<00:04:00.130> striking<00:04:00.640> the<00:04:00.730> ball<00:04:00.880> and

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
club's descending striking the ball and

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.819 
club's descending striking the ball and
then<00:04:02.350> digging<00:04:02.920> through<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:03.400> turf<00:04:03.640> after<00:04:04.480> and

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
then digging through the turf after and

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.440 
then digging through the turf after and
exiting<00:04:05.829> anywhere<00:04:06.190> from<00:04:06.400> four<00:04:06.730> to<00:04:06.760> ten<00:04:07.269> inches

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
exiting anywhere from four to ten inches

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.200 
exiting anywhere from four to ten inches
past<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:08.019> ball
