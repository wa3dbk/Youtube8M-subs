00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.459
 In the year 2000 I bought them a new car with my parents. 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:19.550
 Then we looked at the small middle class, the Golfjes and the Astra and the Focussen. 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.939
 But what did it become? A Seat Leon! 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:24.509
 Now 12 years later they are ready for a new one 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:31.509
 and we are now in the new Seat Leon. Is that something for them? Well... 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.790
 Under the skin, the new Seat Leon has a lot in common with the Volkswagen Golf. 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.300
 They are just developed at the same time 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.080
 and they also basically have the same engines 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.040
 The Volkswagen Golf has become a lot lighter 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.890
 ..and so the Seat Leon too. 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.500
 About 90 kilograms 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.510
 They also went back to a simpler rear axle 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.790
 That was first a multi-link rear axle 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.290
 and that is a fairly complex and expensive solution 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.920
 and now is a very simple torsion axis. 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.860
 But is a simple torsion axis worse than a multi-link rear axle? 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.740
 Well that remains to be seen. The manufacturer claims 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.939
 that it offers the same handling - if not better - than that old man with a 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:12.550
 multilink rear axle. 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:19.550
 So we will judge that later! 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.460
 Pay attention not to those rims, because they belong to the expensive FR version. 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.300
 those are 18 "jetsers and normally there is 16" underneath. 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.310
 What we see here is a Leon 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.430
 it has become 5 centimeters shorter than its predecessor. Namely only 4.26 meters. 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.230
 But the axes are 6 cm further apart. 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.560
 So we will check that inside space. 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.280
 Well that space in the front is really huge. 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.400
 That seat adjustment can even be a volleyball player. All the way here. 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.870
 If I put it in the right position for my 1.87 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:05.870
 I'm going to sit behind myself. Well for a small middle class this is not wrong! 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:19.849
 Just a compliment for Seat for the ISOFIX child seat attachment. 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:24.599
 It is clearly indicated at the bottom where it is. 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.739
 And here in the trunk you will immediately find the Toptether. That is a mysterious term for that 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.129
 for the upper attachment point 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.919
 of the child seat. 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:35.809
 Viewed purely in liters, the trunk of the Leon is not too big for its class, 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:42.809
 but 400 liters but look, you can quite something in it. 

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:58.429
 The car also has two new interesting electronic safety features. 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:02.439
 These are the Driver Alert System and Lane Assist. 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.099
 The Driver Alert System 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.519
 that is a system that when you start to get sleepy 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.599
 then the car knows that and a light comes on 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:11.559
 take a cup of coffee. 

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:15.969
 He measures that very simply with steering movements. So if you drive somewhere and then 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:17.069
 you have to do this all of a sudden 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.409
 then he knows aha he becomes sleepy 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:20.609
 we intervene. 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.839
 The second is Lane Assist 

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:25.019
 and it doesn't work like other cars 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.769
 with a fairly strong steering movement that you end up on your lane, 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.140
 if you now come close to the road marking it will give small ones 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.099
 bumps back. 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.999
 We would come back to that handling. 

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:49.909
 We have sent quite a bit through the mountains and indeed 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:56.789
 this is really great! 

00:03:56.789 --> 00:04:01.349
 As a real scoop as a small mid-sized car, Seat offers lighting on this Leon Full LED. 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.299
 Only on the more expensive models. But we can show it on this FR. 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.049
 Today we actually ride a kind of sheep in wolf's clothes. 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.719
 The exterior is completely sporty and FR. 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:16.069
 And inside is the smallest 1.4-liter TSI petrol engine 

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:17.789
 with 122 hp. 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:22.710
 Only in 2013 there will also be a smaller 1.2 TSI with 90 or 105 hp 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.810
 and then of course also come much stronger gasoline engines that really fit this appearance. 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.030
 The smallest diesel version will be a 1.6 TDI with 90 hp. 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.400
 But if you really want to go for low consumption 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.210
 a 1.6 TDI with 105 hp and start / stop system. And then he just knocks 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:43.210
 99 grams of CO2 per kilometer. 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:50.399
 The conclusion could be that the new Leon is just as expensive as a Golf 

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:51.469
 But that's not true 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:54.819
 because for the money of a three-door Golf you get a five-door Leon, standard. 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:59.129
 This party starts around 19,500 euros 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:02.689
 And next year there will be a 1.2 TSI with automatic 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:05.339
 so that could in principle be quite interesting for the elderly among us .. 

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:08.349
 But daddy mommy, will this be it next year? 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:09.139
 Well, I think it's a little too sporty!
