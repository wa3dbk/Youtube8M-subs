00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.690
 there's more shine you for a new 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.120
 video for my top 5 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.500
 the library of players are hungry 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.170
 both started by resistance 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.240
 burning skies 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.160
 so we have to push back forces 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.630
 Allied 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.420
 which is annoying parents to play 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.359
 online one is obliged to have a code and 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.070
 the code it is usable a chain 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.760
 times he can not be entered on 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.580
 multiple accounts 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.669
 and when to let go of so many low chances 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.840
 impossible to najd in the fourth 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.149
 position 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.800
 it's in justice it's a fighting game 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.760
 between bad guys and super nice guys 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.300
 hero there are not many people on 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.340
 waiters 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.110
 so it's really very long to wait 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.500
 than a person who log in for 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.789
 play online with you so here but 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.030
 it's in his ball it's a beautiful game 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:58.260
 still in third position 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.989
 call of duty black ops this is a game of 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.760
 war as you know what is 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.729
 boring what has little in the present in 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:11.820
 the game and there is little in online maps 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:13.979
 so it's a bit of a hassle 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.119
 second position excuse me on 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:21.060
 killzone mercenaries with 6 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.520
 March Marie is a war that is 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.680
 unfolds in the future with a very good 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.970
 small player 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.470
 I advise you it is really 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.200
 dangerous in first position this is 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.689
 fifa 14 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.439
 it's a very good game too a very good 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.850
 game just as we like it is there 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.780
 has a very good grip of 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.030
 debut it's a great honest but the 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.740
 raches that are very very common so 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.340
 it's a bit of a mess 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.710
 the online gameplay 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.229
 so that was my top 5 games 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.969
 thank you for leaving an inch or in 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.899
 comment it would make me super fun 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.899
 now nose
