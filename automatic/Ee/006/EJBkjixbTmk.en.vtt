00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.790
 it will look like 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.370
 I do not know what this is for people to 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.380
 make a boot but what you know is 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:08.060
 only you look at what the coxinha joins 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:08.060
 kamal to a ball and that mass was the 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:21.570
 ball is ball and here is the template nezinho 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:26.100
 central in the middle for those who have never seen 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:38.750

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:38.750
 the mold a little mold 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.640
 this one is a rose made with 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.739
 various petals 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.290
 you can put as many petals as you want 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.750
 in pink can stay up giants if you 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.080
 want but depends on the amount of 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.420
 flour and saori 'whatever you put into it 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.930
 make the ingredients of your dough that 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:16.380
 here it is still about a little bit and 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.230
 Here you can see these things left over from you. 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.850
 can join you can do other 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.160
 sculptures to spare 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.360
 You can pick up a knife and you can pick up a 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.570
 Spoon 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.880
 This is a special place to cut 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:34.610
 things that are hard to cut 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:39.480
 so here you cut places here 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.290
 squeeze after you remove and will stay 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.170
 like this 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.500
 Then you split the dough then you 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.990
 can separate between you and your partner 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.130
 or you can make the cultures 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.459
