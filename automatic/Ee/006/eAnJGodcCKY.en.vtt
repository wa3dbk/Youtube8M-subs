and put it on large heads like this

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.010 
and put it on large heads like this

that's a rule of thumb but you also need

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.950 
that's a rule of thumb but you also need
an<00:01:05.339> ample<00:01:05.640> amount<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:06.060> volume<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.600> go<00:01:06.689> through

now all right what we have here is your

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.660 
now all right what we have here is your
typical<00:02:16.230> high-performance<00:02:17.040> aluminum<00:02:17.430> intake

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670

manifold<00:02:18.240> you<00:02:18.780> know<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.870> lot<00:02:19.080> of<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.260> people

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
manifold you know a lot of you people

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.750 
manifold you know a lot of you people
probably<00:02:19.740> think<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.100> can<00:02:20.190> just<00:02:20.280> pull<00:02:20.460> one<00:02:20.640> out

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
probably think you can just pull one out

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.220 
probably think you can just pull one out
of<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:20.910> box<00:02:21.120> bolted<00:02:21.510> on<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:21.870> get<00:02:21.990> extra

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
of the box bolted on and get extra

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.900 
of the box bolted on and get extra
horsepower<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:22.980> for<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.340> most<00:02:23.460> part<00:02:23.580> that's

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
horsepower and for the most part that's

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.220 
horsepower and for the most part that's
that's<00:02:24.210> pretty<00:02:24.390> much<00:02:24.540> true<00:02:24.600> but<00:02:25.020> you're<00:02:25.140> not

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
that's pretty much true but you're not

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.150 
that's pretty much true but you're not
getting<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.440> potential<00:02:25.890> out<00:02:26.010> of<00:02:26.100> the

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
mind you the runners are 210 CC on here

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.330 
mind you the runners are 210 CC on here
but<00:02:54.450> they<00:02:54.570> neck<00:02:54.900> down<00:02:55.230> right<00:02:55.590> here<00:02:55.950> because

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
but they neck down right here because

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.890 
but they neck down right here because
they<00:02:56.490> know<00:02:56.820> you're<00:02:57.030> going<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.240> port<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.600> I<00:02:57.750> mean

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
they know you're going to port it I mean

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.960 
they know you're going to port it I mean
all<00:02:58.380> race<00:02:58.980> engines<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.459> all<00:02:59.520> performance

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
all race engines and all performance

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.280 
all race engines and all performance
motors<00:03:00.270> they<00:03:00.390> figure<00:03:00.690> you're<00:03:00.810> going<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.020> port

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
motors they figure you're going to port

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.530 
motors they figure you're going to port
it<00:03:01.410> okay<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:02.940> that's<00:03:03.150> what<00:03:03.270> we're<00:03:03.390> showing

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
it okay and that's what we're showing

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.940 
it okay and that's what we're showing
you<00:03:03.660> here<00:03:03.900> is<00:03:03.930> how<00:03:04.080> to<00:03:04.140> do<00:03:04.380> this<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.590> what<00:03:04.830> to

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
you here is how to do this and what to

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.500 
you here is how to do this and what to
watch<00:03:05.130> for<00:03:05.190> so<00:03:05.640> when<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:05.850> take<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.060> nice

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
watch for so when you take a nice

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.850 
watch for so when you take a nice
performance<00:03:07.020> manifold<00:03:07.410> like<00:03:07.530> this<00:03:07.680> out<00:03:07.830> of

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
performance manifold like this out of

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.770 
performance manifold like this out of
the<00:03:07.950> box<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.310> you<00:03:08.430> bolt<00:03:08.640> it<00:03:08.730> on<00:03:08.910> you're<00:03:09.630> not

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
the box and you bolt it on you're not

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.030 
the box and you bolt it on you're not
even<00:03:09.990> matched<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.440> head<00:03:10.650> so<00:03:10.860> what's

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
even matched to the head so what's

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.949 
even matched to the head so what's
happening<00:03:11.370> is<00:03:11.459> you<00:03:11.550> got<00:03:11.670> this<00:03:11.790> 210<00:03:12.360> CC<00:03:12.720> runner

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
happening is you got this 210 CC runner

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.420 
happening is you got this 210 CC runner
flowing<00:03:13.320> down<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.740> it<00:03:13.830> next<00:03:14.010> down<00:03:14.250> at<00:03:14.370> the

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
flowing down and it next down at the

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.100 
flowing down and it next down at the
last<00:03:14.640> second<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.090> then<00:03:15.450> goes<00:03:15.570> into<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:15.930> head

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
last second and then goes into the head

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.300 
last second and then goes into the head
that's<00:03:16.590> not<00:03:16.740> going<00:03:16.830> to<00:03:16.920> get<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:17.130> anywhere

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
that's not going to get you anywhere

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.130 
that's not going to get you anywhere
because<00:03:17.670> this<00:03:18.239> area<00:03:18.480> right<00:03:18.810> here<00:03:18.870> is<00:03:18.989> only

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
because this area right here is only

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.960 
because this area right here is only
going<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.410> flow<00:03:19.590> so<00:03:19.920> much<00:03:20.160> okay<00:03:20.700> you're<00:03:20.880> not

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
going to flow so much okay you're not

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.580 
going to flow so much okay you're not
going<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.180> get<00:03:21.269> much<00:03:21.420> out<00:03:21.600> of<00:03:21.660> that<00:03:21.870> let's<00:03:22.440> show

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
going to get much out of that let's show

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.120 
going to get much out of that let's show
in<00:03:22.709> retrospect<00:03:23.250> here<00:03:23.519> on<00:03:23.670> a<00:03:24.510> ported<00:03:24.989> side<00:03:25.200> this

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
in retrospect here on a ported side this

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.210 
in retrospect here on a ported side this
side<00:03:26.340> right<00:03:26.400> here<00:03:27.110> is<00:03:28.110> ported<00:03:28.560> let's<00:03:28.890> show<00:03:29.070> the

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
side right here is ported let's show the

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.930 
side right here is ported let's show the
same<00:03:29.400> thing<00:03:30.050> this<00:03:31.050> is<00:03:31.290> look<00:03:31.620> at<00:03:31.709> this<00:03:31.890> how<00:03:32.550> nice

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
same thing this is look at this how nice

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.660 
same thing this is look at this how nice
this<00:03:33.120> is<00:03:33.180> right<00:03:33.510> here<00:03:34.220> exactly<00:03:35.220> match<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.580> the

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
this is right here exactly match to the

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.340 
this is right here exactly match to the
size<00:03:35.880> i<00:03:36.180> ported<00:03:36.600> this<00:03:36.720> right<00:03:36.900> here<00:03:37.080> just<00:03:37.260> to

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
size i ported this right here just to

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.080 
size i ported this right here just to
show<00:03:37.530> you<00:03:37.560> what<00:03:37.920> it<00:03:38.340> will<00:03:38.459> look<00:03:38.489> like<00:03:38.670> when

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
show you what it will look like when

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.270 
show you what it will look like when
it's<00:03:39.269> all<00:03:39.420> together<00:03:39.630> now<00:03:39.900> this<00:03:40.739> gasket<00:03:41.010> right

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
it's all together now this gasket right

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.680 
it's all together now this gasket right
here<00:03:41.459> fit<00:03:41.670> those<00:03:41.820> other<00:03:42.060> heads<00:03:42.300> that<00:03:42.390> I<00:03:42.510> just

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
here fit those other heads that I just

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.479 
here fit those other heads that I just
showed<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:42.989> second<00:03:43.260> ago<00:03:43.320> perfectly<00:03:43.980> all

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
showed you a second ago perfectly all

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.130 
showed you a second ago perfectly all
right<00:03:44.550> now<00:03:44.940> this<00:03:45.150> manifold<00:03:45.600> matches<00:03:46.019> the

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
right now this manifold matches the

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.930 
right now this manifold matches the
heads<00:03:46.350> you<00:03:46.470> got<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.620> nice<00:03:46.860> smooth<00:03:47.250> flow<00:03:47.580> no

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
heads you got a nice smooth flow no

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.150 
heads you got a nice smooth flow no
obstructions<00:03:48.540> in<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.720> way<00:03:48.959> it<00:03:49.500> doesn't<00:03:49.800> defer

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
obstructions in the way it doesn't defer

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.710 
obstructions in the way it doesn't defer
air<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:50.459> mean<00:03:50.790> it's<00:03:50.910> just<00:03:50.970> a<00:03:51.150> nice<00:03:51.330> even<00:03:51.600> flow

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
air I mean it's just a nice even flow

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.660 
air I mean it's just a nice even flow
fills<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.320> cylinder<00:03:52.680> up<00:03:52.830> and<00:03:53.010> like<00:03:53.370> we<00:03:53.489> said

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
fills the cylinder up and like we said

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.699 
fills the cylinder up and like we said
fill<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.300> cylinder<00:03:54.480> more<00:03:54.930> power<00:03:55.200> that's<00:03:55.590> the

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
fill the cylinder more power that's the

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.199 
fill the cylinder more power that's the
whole<00:03:55.739> name<00:03:56.040> of<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.190> game<00:03:56.250> but<00:03:56.880> let<00:03:57.000> me<00:03:57.030> show

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
whole name of the game but let me show

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.479 
whole name of the game but let me show
you<00:03:57.300> something<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.600> not<00:03:57.870> do<00:03:58.170> alright<00:03:58.980> let's

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
you something to not do alright let's

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:00.530 
you something to not do alright let's
pull<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.700> gasket<00:04:00.060> out<00:04:00.120> here<00:04:00.300> and<00:04:00.390> you<00:04:00.450> can

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
pull the gasket out here and you can

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.210 
pull the gasket out here and you can
look<00:04:00.720> right<00:04:00.930> here<00:04:00.989> you<00:04:01.890> get<00:04:02.010> my<00:04:02.100> little

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
look right here you get my little

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.370 
look right here you get my little
pointer<00:04:02.640> so<00:04:03.090> nice<00:04:03.300> and<00:04:03.450> smooth<00:04:03.750> this<00:04:03.930> is<00:04:04.170> in

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
pointer so nice and smooth this is in

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.350 
pointer so nice and smooth this is in
here<00:04:04.709> and<00:04:04.890> we're<00:04:05.489> not<00:04:05.580> talking<00:04:05.730> about<00:04:06.000> smooth

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
here and we're not talking about smooth

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.400 
here and we're not talking about smooth
texture<00:04:07.019> I'm<00:04:07.230> talking<00:04:07.920> about<00:04:07.980> smooth<00:04:08.580> as<00:04:08.940> in

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
texture I'm talking about smooth as in

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.050 
texture I'm talking about smooth as in
symmetrical<00:04:10.410> where<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:11.190> air<00:04:11.340> is<00:04:11.370> just<00:04:11.700> just

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
symmetrical where the air is just just

this<00:04:17.790> side<00:04:18.000> right<00:04:18.030> here<00:04:18.419> this<00:04:18.690> is<00:04:18.840> what<00:04:18.989> I<00:04:19.049> see

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
this side right here this is what I see

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.659 
this side right here this is what I see
coming<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:19.709> the<00:04:19.769> shop<00:04:19.950> a<00:04:20.010> lot<00:04:20.220> of<00:04:20.340> times<00:04:20.519> people

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
coming to the shop a lot of times people

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.310 
coming to the shop a lot of times people
say<00:04:20.820> yeah<00:04:21.060> I<00:04:21.090> got<00:04:21.299> a<00:04:21.330> ported<00:04:21.720> manifold<00:04:22.169> or<00:04:22.260> a

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
say yeah I got a ported manifold or a

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.070 
say yeah I got a ported manifold or a
portent<00:04:22.650> matched<00:04:23.100> intake<00:04:23.580> manifold<00:04:24.080> this

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
portent matched intake manifold this

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.890 
portent matched intake manifold this
right<00:04:25.320> here<00:04:25.620> is<00:04:25.650> crap<00:04:26.190> alright

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
right here is crap alright

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.840 
right here is crap alright
it<00:04:26.990> does<00:04:27.290> nothing<00:04:27.620> you<00:04:28.190> can<00:04:28.340> see<00:04:28.460> it<00:04:28.550> only<00:04:28.699> goes

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
it does nothing you can see it only goes

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.300 
it does nothing you can see it only goes
in<00:04:28.910> just<00:04:29.330> a<00:04:29.419> little<00:04:29.600> bit<00:04:29.720> right<00:04:30.620> here<00:04:30.680> we're

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
in just a little bit right here we're

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.830 
in just a little bit right here we're
still<00:04:31.520> small<00:04:31.910> I<00:04:31.940> mean<00:04:32.210> here's<00:04:32.360> the<00:04:32.479> edge<00:04:32.600> where

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
still small I mean here's the edge where

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.390 
still small I mean here's the edge where
the<00:04:32.870> gasket<00:04:33.320> goes<00:04:33.470> right<00:04:33.710> here<00:04:33.979> but<00:04:34.190> look<00:04:34.310> at

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
the gasket goes right here but look at

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.100 
the gasket goes right here but look at
we<00:04:34.490> come<00:04:34.729> in<00:04:34.940> and<00:04:35.120> it's<00:04:35.240> still<00:04:35.389> narrow<00:04:35.750> right

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
we come in and it's still narrow right

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.080 
we come in and it's still narrow right
here<00:04:36.350> this<00:04:36.979> does<00:04:37.220> nothing<00:04:37.370> you<00:04:37.639> need<00:04:37.729> to<00:04:37.820> go<00:04:37.940> in

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
here this does nothing you need to go in

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.159 
here this does nothing you need to go in
at<00:04:38.180> least<00:04:38.300> an<00:04:38.539> inch<00:04:38.690> inch<00:04:38.930> and<00:04:39.080> a<00:04:39.139> half

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
at least an inch inch and a half

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.230 
at least an inch inch and a half
sometimes<00:04:39.590> two<00:04:39.800> inches<00:04:40.340> to<00:04:40.490> get<00:04:40.610> that<00:04:40.789> blend

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
sometimes two inches to get that blend

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.150 
sometimes two inches to get that blend
and<00:04:41.449> to<00:04:41.750> get<00:04:41.870> to<00:04:41.990> the<00:04:42.080> larger<00:04:42.440> area<00:04:42.740> inside

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
and to get to the larger area inside

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.850 
and to get to the larger area inside
here<00:04:43.430> down<00:04:44.030> inside<00:04:44.479> it<00:04:44.720> is<00:04:44.840> larger<00:04:45.259> when<00:04:45.770> you

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
here down inside it is larger when you

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.350 
here down inside it is larger when you
come<00:04:46.009> out<00:04:46.039> here<00:04:46.190> like<00:04:46.550> I<00:04:46.639> say<00:04:46.789> they<00:04:46.970> neck<00:04:47.210> it

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
come out here like I say they neck it

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.460 
come out here like I say they neck it
down<00:04:47.539> because<00:04:47.720> they<00:04:47.900> figure<00:04:48.169> you're<00:04:48.289> gonna

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
down because they figure you're gonna

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.100 
down because they figure you're gonna
poured<00:04:48.889> it<00:04:49.009> okay<00:04:49.820> lesser<00:04:50.630> performance

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
poured it okay lesser performance

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.170 
poured it okay lesser performance
manifolds<00:04:51.590> like<00:04:51.710> the<00:04:51.800> RPM<00:04:52.220> series<00:04:52.550> manifolds

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
manifolds like the RPM series manifolds

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.659 
manifolds like the RPM series manifolds
and<00:04:53.270> other<00:04:53.419> other<00:04:53.720> brands<00:04:54.020> and<00:04:54.139> manifolds<00:04:54.680> for

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
and other other brands and manifolds for

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.430 
and other other brands and manifolds for
just<00:04:55.880> basic<00:04:56.449> street<00:04:56.660> performance<00:04:57.139> through

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
just basic street performance through

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.260 
just basic street performance through
already<00:04:57.680> sized<00:04:57.979> in<00:04:58.310> a<00:04:58.400> particular<00:04:58.880> area<00:04:58.910> I

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
already sized in a particular area I

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.700 
already sized in a particular area I
mean<00:04:59.449> it's<00:04:59.539> a<00:04:59.570> pretty<00:04:59.780> well<00:04:59.990> matched<00:05:00.229> just

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
mean it's a pretty well matched just

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.740 
mean it's a pretty well matched just
basic<00:05:01.100> performance<00:05:01.250> heads<00:05:01.789> when<00:05:02.419> you<00:05:02.510> get<00:05:02.660> in

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
basic performance heads when you get in

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.270 
basic performance heads when you get in
a<00:05:02.840> serious<00:05:03.199> manifold<00:05:03.620> is<00:05:03.710> like<00:05:03.889> this<00:05:04.039> like<00:05:04.250> a

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
a serious manifold is like this like a

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.400 
a serious manifold is like this like a
victor<00:05:04.610> junior<00:05:05.030> or<00:05:05.300> a<00:05:05.539> super<00:05:05.960> Victor<00:05:06.260> or

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
victor junior or a super Victor or

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:07.540 
victor junior or a super Victor or
something<00:05:06.680> like<00:05:06.770> that<00:05:06.830> where<00:05:07.160> the<00:05:07.220> runners

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
something like that where the runners

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.810 
something like that where the runners
are<00:05:07.669> to<00:05:07.820> 10<00:05:08.090> CC<00:05:08.510> to<00:05:08.810> 20<00:05:09.199> to<00:05:09.350> 30<00:05:09.590> cc<00:05:10.070> they<00:05:10.580> know

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
are to 10 CC to 20 to 30 cc they know

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.040 
are to 10 CC to 20 to 30 cc they know
you're<00:05:11.000> going<00:05:11.090> to<00:05:11.150> port<00:05:11.389> the<00:05:11.479> manifold<00:05:11.900> and

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
you're going to port the manifold and

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.240 
you're going to port the manifold and
they<00:05:12.139> can't<00:05:12.410> pre<00:05:12.620> do<00:05:12.770> it<00:05:12.860> because<00:05:13.010> they<00:05:13.100> don't

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
they can't pre do it because they don't

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.890 
they can't pre do it because they don't
know<00:05:13.310> how<00:05:13.550> big<00:05:13.910> you're<00:05:14.120> going<00:05:14.300> to<00:05:14.360> port<00:05:14.630> it<00:05:14.750> I

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
know how big you're going to port it I

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.379 
know how big you're going to port it I
mean<00:05:15.440> a<00:05:15.470> 350<00:05:16.190> cubic<00:05:16.400> inch<00:05:16.669> engine<00:05:16.880> is<00:05:17.210> going<00:05:17.330> to

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
mean a 350 cubic inch engine is going to

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:19.480 
mean a 350 cubic inch engine is going to
be<00:05:17.479> a<00:05:17.510> lot<00:05:17.780> different<00:05:17.810> sized<00:05:18.440> head<00:05:19.039> runners

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
be a lot different sized head runners

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:20.800 
be a lot different sized head runners
and<00:05:19.669> things<00:05:19.820> like<00:05:19.970> that<00:05:20.030> then<00:05:20.330> we<00:05:20.449> might<00:05:20.630> have

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
and things like that then we might have

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.379 
and things like that then we might have
on<00:05:20.960> a<00:05:20.990> 434<00:05:21.680> cubic<00:05:22.039> inch<00:05:22.190> small<00:05:22.250> block<00:05:22.490> where<00:05:23.300> we

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
on a 434 cubic inch small block where we

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:25.210 
on a 434 cubic inch small block where we
might<00:05:23.510> run<00:05:23.690> a<00:05:23.720> 2<00:05:23.960> 30<00:05:24.199> cc<00:05:24.620> head<00:05:24.860> or<00:05:25.039> something

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
might run a 2 30 cc head or something

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.060 
might run a 2 30 cc head or something
like<00:05:25.460> that<00:05:25.520> rather<00:05:25.910> than
