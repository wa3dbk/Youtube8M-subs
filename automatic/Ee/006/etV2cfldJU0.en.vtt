we're getting into our fifth and final
focus<00:00:07.680> point<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.130> this<00:00:08.730> one<00:00:08.940> is<00:00:09.300> all<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:10.260> do

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
focus point and this one is all to do

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.129 
focus point and this one is all to do
with<00:00:10.490> taking<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.610> power<00:00:11.790> phase<00:00:12.120> blending<00:00:13.049> it

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
with taking the power phase blending it

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.079 
with taking the power phase blending it
into<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.469> recovery<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.190> then<00:00:14.460> incorporating

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
into the recovery and then incorporating

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.660 
into the recovery and then incorporating
it<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.269> what<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.420> call<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:16.139> stretch<00:00:16.560> catch<00:00:17.310> and

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
it in what I call the stretch catch and

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.880 
it in what I call the stretch catch and
pull<00:00:18.150> now<00:00:18.900> what's<00:00:19.260> happened<00:00:19.590> with<00:00:19.650> most

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
pull now what's happened with most

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.040 
pull now what's happened with most
people<00:00:20.189> on<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.430> recovery<00:00:20.880> aspect<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.539> in<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
people on this recovery aspect is in the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.590 
people on this recovery aspect is in the
old<00:00:22.199> S<00:00:22.500> poll<00:00:22.800> with<00:00:23.279> their<00:00:23.430> hands<00:00:23.760> going<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.300> out

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
old S poll with their hands going in out

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.740 
old S poll with their hands going in out
and<00:00:25.109> back<00:00:25.680> down<00:00:26.099> here<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.760> lot<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.269> people<00:00:27.449> have

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
and back down here a lot of people have

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.960 
and back down here a lot of people have
what's<00:00:27.960> called<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.260> high<00:00:28.439> elbow<00:00:28.740> recovery<00:00:29.580> and

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
what's called a high elbow recovery and

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.250 
what's called a high elbow recovery and
that<00:00:30.060> would<00:00:30.210> mean<00:00:30.359> they<00:00:30.449> lift<00:00:30.720> from<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.960> elbow

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
that would mean they lift from the elbow

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.709 
that would mean they lift from the elbow
and<00:00:31.470> shove<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.070> hand<00:00:32.309> back<00:00:32.579> forward<00:00:33.120> well<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
and shove the hand back forward well the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.270 
and shove the hand back forward well the
problem<00:00:34.020> with<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.829> do<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.160> few

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
problem with this is you do that a few

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.770 
problem with this is you do that a few
million<00:00:35.670> times<00:00:36.059> you're<00:00:36.450> going<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.660> really

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
million times you're going to really

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.840 
million times you're going to really
tear<00:00:37.079> up<00:00:37.200> your<00:00:37.350> shoulder<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:37.920> we're<00:00:38.730> not

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
tear up your shoulder and we're not

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.790 
tear up your shoulder and we're not
going<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.510> out<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.899> back<00:00:40.140> we're<00:00:40.770> not

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
going in and out and back we're not

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.619 
going in and out and back we're not
getting<00:00:41.129> stuck<00:00:41.309> back<00:00:41.550> there<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> better

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
getting stuck back there so a better

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.090 
getting stuck back there so a better
more<00:00:42.899> efficient<00:00:43.350> way<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.469> do<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.860> would<00:00:44.040> be

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
more efficient way to do this would be

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.389 
more efficient way to do this would be
to<00:00:44.219> pull<00:00:44.969> straight<00:00:45.270> back<00:00:45.860> feather<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.129> hand

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
to pull straight back feather the hand

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.420 
to pull straight back feather the hand
out<00:00:47.899> into<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.020> recovery<00:00:49.350> back<00:00:50.070> into<00:00:50.399> a

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
out into the recovery back into a

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.670 
out into the recovery back into a
stretch<00:00:50.820> or<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.059> glider<00:00:51.360> extension<00:00:52.079> before<00:00:52.410> we

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
stretch or a glider extension before we

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.350 
stretch or a glider extension before we
start<00:00:52.920> our<00:00:53.010> next<00:00:53.070> pull<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:54.180> let<00:00:54.300> me

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
start our next pull so let me

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.760 
start our next pull so let me
demonstrate<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.899> again<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.590> hand

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
demonstrate of that again the hand

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.500 
demonstrate of that again the hand
couples<00:00:56.070> back<00:00:56.280> fingers<00:00:56.879> are<00:00:57.000> pointed<00:00:57.270> down<00:00:57.390> at

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
couples back fingers are pointed down at

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.240 
couples back fingers are pointed down at
the<00:00:57.570> bottom<00:00:57.870> when<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.410> fingers<00:00:58.770> can't<00:00:59.010> point

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
the bottom when the fingers can't point

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.529 
the bottom when the fingers can't point
down<00:00:59.460> here<00:00:59.489> at<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.760> bottom<00:01:00.030> anymore<00:01:00.149> you're

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
down here at the bottom anymore you're

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.910 
down here at the bottom anymore you're
pretty<00:01:00.750> much<00:01:00.899> done<00:01:01.140> with<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.289> power<00:01:01.469> phase<00:01:01.770> of

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
pretty much done with the power phase of

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.680 
pretty much done with the power phase of
the<00:01:01.980> pull<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.399> out<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.149> goes<00:01:03.180> into<00:01:03.600> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
the pull and out it goes into the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.390 
the pull and out it goes into the
recovery<00:01:03.989> now<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.739> don't<00:01:04.949> know<00:01:05.040> about<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.369> but

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
recovery now I don't know about you but

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.280 
recovery now I don't know about you but
last<00:01:05.729> Olympics<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.479> was<00:01:06.630> watching<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> arm

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
last Olympics I was watching the arm

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.960 
last Olympics I was watching the arm
recoveries<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.799> lot<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.189> freestylers<00:01:08.790> and

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
recoveries a lot of freestylers and

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.630 
recoveries a lot of freestylers and
really<00:01:09.630> pretty<00:01:09.840> much<00:01:09.990> anything<00:01:10.380> goes<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
really pretty much anything goes so the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.640 
really pretty much anything goes so the
most<00:01:11.909> important<00:01:12.479> aspect<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.080> recovery<00:01:13.530> is

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
most important aspect of the recovery is

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.890 
most important aspect of the recovery is
it<00:01:13.830> needs<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.220> be<00:01:14.369> relaxed<00:01:15.090> now<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> lot<00:01:15.869> of

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
it needs to be relaxed now a lot of

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.840 
it needs to be relaxed now a lot of
people<00:01:16.049> force<00:01:16.560> their<00:01:16.799> recovery<00:01:17.310> or<00:01:17.520> spend<00:01:17.759> a

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
people force their recovery or spend a

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.630 
people force their recovery or spend a
lot<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.030> extra<00:01:18.360> energy<00:01:18.590> recovery<00:01:19.590> means<00:01:20.130> rest

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
lot of extra energy recovery means rest

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.240 
lot of extra energy recovery means rest
or<00:01:20.880> relax<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:21.990> really<00:01:22.409> focus<00:01:22.830> on<00:01:22.979> emphasizing

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
or relax so really focus on emphasizing

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.640 
or relax so really focus on emphasizing
a<00:01:23.970> feathering<00:01:24.540> out<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.960> get<00:01:25.080> yourself<00:01:25.500> from

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
a feathering out to get yourself from

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.800 
a feathering out to get yourself from
not<00:01:25.830> being<00:01:25.979> stuck<00:01:26.400> back<00:01:26.580> here<00:01:26.640> feather<00:01:27.540> out

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
not being stuck back here feather out

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.960 
not being stuck back here feather out
into<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.140> recovery<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.920> into<00:01:29.460> their<00:01:29.610> stretch

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
into the recovery and into their stretch

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.109 
into the recovery and into their stretch
catch<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.170> then<00:01:31.470> pull<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:32.009> found<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.000> with

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
catch and then pull I found that with

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.999 
catch and then pull I found that with
almost<00:01:33.329> all<00:01:33.689> swimmers<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.229> triathletes<00:01:34.860> that

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
almost all swimmers and triathletes that

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.310 
almost all swimmers and triathletes that
many<00:01:35.220> people<00:01:35.400> have<00:01:35.640> way<00:01:36.000> too<00:01:36.060> much<00:01:36.360> rotation

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
many people have way too much rotation

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.410 
many people have way too much rotation
and<00:01:37.549> rotation<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.700> not<00:01:38.729> really<00:01:39.119> what<00:01:39.270> we're

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
and rotation is not really what we're

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.480 
and rotation is not really what we're
