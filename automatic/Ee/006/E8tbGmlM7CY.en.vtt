00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
time instead of enjoy it was to just

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.789 
time instead of enjoy it was to just
kind<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.720> be<00:01:48.960> on<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.110> computer<00:01:49.259> constantly

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
and this kind of grid limbo where I'm

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.510 
and this kind of grid limbo where I'm
waiting<00:01:51.750> for<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.799> events<00:01:53.009> tab<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:53.430> I'm

waiting for the events tab and like I'm

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.830 
waiting for the events tab and like I'm

waiting for Josh to come back or I'm
waiting<00:01:55.200> for<00:01:56.000> something<00:01:57.000> but<00:01:57.869> not<00:01:58.110> really

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
waiting for something but not really

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.780 
waiting for something but not really
living<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.950> not<00:01:59.100> really<00:01:59.340> doing<00:01:59.520> anything

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
living and not really doing anything

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.630 
living and not really doing anything
just<00:02:00.360> kind<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.630> living<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.640> purgatory

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
just kind of living in this purgatory

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.789 
just kind of living in this purgatory
space<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.600> it's<00:02:03.719> not<00:02:03.899> really<00:02:04.170> living<00:02:04.409> it's

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
space and it's not really living it's

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.260 
space and it's not really living it's
like<00:02:04.920> waiting<00:02:05.189> but<00:02:05.460> it's<00:02:05.579> also<00:02:05.790> speeding<00:02:06.030> by

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
like waiting but it's also speeding by

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.850 
like waiting but it's also speeding by
so<00:02:06.630> I'm<00:02:06.810> not<00:02:06.930> really<00:02:07.170> staying<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.500> one<00:02:07.649> place

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
so I'm not really staying in one place

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.339 
so I'm not really staying in one place
as<00:02:08.099> waiting<00:02:08.459> would<00:02:08.550> imply<00:02:08.819> I'm<00:02:09.090> also<00:02:09.349> losing

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
as waiting would imply I'm also losing

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.960 
as waiting would imply I'm also losing
time<00:02:10.679> by<00:02:11.129> doing<00:02:11.520> that

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
time by doing that

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.630 
time by doing that
and<00:02:12.060> so<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.810> started<00:02:13.770> trying<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.310> do<00:02:14.430> things

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
and so I started trying to do things

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.160 
and so I started trying to do things
like<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.270> first<00:02:15.450> thing<00:02:15.570> I<00:02:15.660> do<00:02:15.720> when<00:02:15.840> I<00:02:15.930> wake<00:02:16.020> up

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
like the first thing I do when I wake up

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.450 
like the first thing I do when I wake up
is<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.410> go<00:02:16.500> outside<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.010> breathe<00:02:17.190> some<00:02:17.310> fresh

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
is to go outside and breathe some fresh

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.940 
is to go outside and breathe some fresh
air<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.030> read<00:02:18.300> books<00:02:18.570> over<00:02:19.200> priority<00:02:19.740> over

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
air and to read books over priority over

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.070 
air and to read books over priority over
using<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.220> internet<00:02:20.550> along<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.300> alone<00:02:21.690> time

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
using the internet along the alone time

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.930 
using the internet along the alone time
and<00:02:22.410> during<00:02:22.650> versus<00:02:23.280> not<00:02:23.430> enjoying<00:02:23.790> there's

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
and during versus not enjoying there's

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.730 
and during versus not enjoying there's
obviously<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.450> alone<00:02:24.720> versus<00:02:25.170> lonely<00:02:25.560> thing

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
obviously the alone versus lonely thing

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.900 
obviously the alone versus lonely thing
where<00:02:25.920> just<00:02:26.070> because<00:02:26.280> you're<00:02:26.400> alone<00:02:26.610> doesn't

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
where just because you're alone doesn't

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.400 
where just because you're alone doesn't
mean<00:02:27.060> you're<00:02:27.210> lonely<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.900> can<00:02:27.990> be<00:02:28.080> lonely

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
mean you're lonely you can be lonely

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.530 
mean you're lonely you can be lonely
when<00:02:28.530> you're<00:02:28.590> not<00:02:28.740> alone<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:29.700> for<00:02:30.480> the

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
when you're not alone and I for the

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.390 
when you're not alone and I for the
longest<00:02:30.840> time<00:02:30.990> thought<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:31.710> any<00:02:31.890> sort<00:02:32.250> of

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
longest time thought that any sort of

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.950 
longest time thought that any sort of
activity<00:02:33.000> would<00:02:33.150> be<00:02:33.210> done<00:02:33.480> better<00:02:33.690> if

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
activity would be done better if

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.600 
activity would be done better if
somebody<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.350> liked<00:02:34.680> was<00:02:34.830> around<00:02:35.070> where<00:02:35.490> there

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
somebody I liked was around where there

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.340 
somebody I liked was around where there
was<00:02:35.700> reading<00:02:36.000> sleeping<00:02:36.210> showering<00:02:36.750> eating

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
was reading sleeping showering eating

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.500 
was reading sleeping showering eating
you<00:02:38.250> know<00:02:38.370> sitting<00:02:38.670> down<00:02:38.910> in<00:02:39.240> front<00:02:39.270> of<00:02:39.420> the

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
being alone and I still really don't

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.210 
being alone and I still really don't
like<00:02:45.960> being<00:02:46.290> alone<00:02:46.470> for<00:02:46.680> attended<00:02:46.920> periods<00:02:47.130> of

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
like being alone for attended periods of

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.160 
like being alone for attended periods of
time<00:02:47.370> but<00:02:47.700> I<00:02:47.970> am<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.420> lot<00:02:48.600> better<00:02:48.780> at<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.050> now

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
time but I am a lot better at it now

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.930 
time but I am a lot better at it now
than<00:02:49.380> I<00:02:49.440> was<00:02:49.590> before<00:02:49.710> and<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.400> have<00:02:50.610> started

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
than I was before and I have started

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.550 
than I was before and I have started
getting<00:02:51.150> into<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.390> part<00:02:51.630> where<00:02:51.810> I'm<00:02:52.020> enjoying

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
when I'd rather just be with myself

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.150 
when I'd rather just be with myself
because<00:02:58.080> that's<00:02:58.260> something<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.710> I<00:02:58.740> want<00:02:59.040> to

because that's something that I want to

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.320 
because that's something that I want to
do<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.490> the<00:02:59.670> video<00:02:59.880> that<00:03:00.000> I<00:03:00.060> talked<00:03:00.270> about

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
earlier again was trying to make it seem

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.560 
earlier again was trying to make it seem
like<00:03:01.830> something<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.430> cherish<00:03:02.640> like<00:03:03.060> it's<00:03:03.420> like

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
like something to cherish like it's like

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
like something to cherish like it's like
when<00:03:03.690> you<00:03:03.750> get<00:03:03.810> sent<00:03:04.080> to<00:03:04.140> your<00:03:04.230> room<00:03:04.470> when

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
when you get sent to your room when

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.780 
when you get sent to your room when
you're<00:03:04.680> kid<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.100> you<00:03:05.160> don't<00:03:05.340> realize<00:03:05.760> that

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
you're kid and you don't realize that

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.070 
you're kid and you don't realize that
you<00:03:06.000> have<00:03:06.150> all<00:03:06.300> the<00:03:06.450> toys<00:03:06.600> in<00:03:06.810> there<00:03:06.930> you're

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
again because it feels like a punishment

being forced into being alone it feels a

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.710 
being forced into being alone it feels a
lot<00:03:20.280> like<00:03:20.489> it's<00:03:20.610> happening<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.180> me<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:21.600> I've

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
lot like it's happening to me and I've

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.360 
lot like it's happening to me and I've
not<00:03:22.230> really<00:03:22.530> thought<00:03:22.709> of<00:03:22.830> it<00:03:22.950> as<00:03:23.040> something

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
not really thought of it as something

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.710 
not really thought of it as something
that<00:03:23.400> I<00:03:23.550> could<00:03:23.760> take<00:03:24.000> advantage<00:03:24.360> of<00:03:24.510> that<00:03:24.630> I

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
that I could take advantage of that I

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.850 
that I could take advantage of that I
could<00:03:24.840> look<00:03:24.900> around<00:03:25.020> and<00:03:25.350> see<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:25.739> there

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
could look around and see that there

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.830 
could look around and see that there
were<00:03:25.950> toys<00:03:26.190> in<00:03:26.430> this<00:03:26.520> room<00:03:26.820> that<00:03:27.000> I'm<00:03:27.120> in<00:03:27.150> also

even if I don't have anybody with me

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.770 
even if I don't have anybody with me
it's<00:03:31.950> like<00:03:32.070> how<00:03:32.220> I<00:03:32.250> never<00:03:32.400> Star<00:03:33.060> gazed<00:03:33.330> even

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
outside the room being the state of

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.479 
outside the room being the state of
being<00:03:42.360> alone<00:03:42.660> that<00:03:43.110> it<00:03:43.410> doesn't<00:03:43.739> have<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.040> be<00:03:44.459> a

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
being alone that it doesn't have to be a

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.190 
being alone that it doesn't have to be a
punishment<00:03:45.209> and<00:03:45.360> it<00:03:45.420> doesn't<00:03:45.690> have<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:46.050> be

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
punishment and it doesn't have to be

punishment and it doesn't have to be
something<00:03:46.500> awful<00:03:47.130> and<00:03:47.370> that<00:03:47.400> I<00:03:47.670> have<00:03:47.820> to
