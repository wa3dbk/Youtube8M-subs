00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
like I don't know I like them because of

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.280 
like I don't know I like them because of
the<00:01:37.770> fact<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.280> know<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.400> can<00:01:38.640> manipulate

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
the fact that you know I can manipulate

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.390 
the fact that you know I can manipulate
some<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.470> things<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.920> mat<00:01:41.100> like<00:01:41.310> I

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
some of the things in the mat like I

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.940 
some of the things in the mat like I
said<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.700> interactive<00:01:42.680> interactive<00:01:43.680> things

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
said the interactive interactive things

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.920 
said the interactive interactive things
I<00:01:44.130> think<00:01:44.610> it's<00:01:44.729> more<00:01:44.820> about<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.360> maps<00:01:45.600> than

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
I think it's more about the maps than

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.440 
I think it's more about the maps than
the<00:01:46.110> weapon<00:01:46.500> itself<00:01:46.770> obviously<00:01:47.490> because

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
the weapon itself obviously because

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.490 
the weapon itself obviously because
that's<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.720> what<00:01:48.869> has<00:01:48.960> always<00:01:49.110> been<00:01:49.290> about

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
that's the what has always been about

it<00:03:42.260> down<00:03:42.350> to<00:03:42.829> what<00:03:43.130> their<00:03:43.340> combination<00:03:44.060> would

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
it down to what their combination would

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.050 
it down to what their combination would
be<00:03:44.470> and<00:03:45.470> I<00:03:45.620> think<00:03:45.799> that<00:03:45.950> would<00:03:46.070> be<00:03:46.190> great<00:03:46.519> for

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
be and I think that would be great for

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.750 
be and I think that would be great for
this<00:03:47.209> type<00:03:47.480> of<00:03:47.799> you<00:03:48.799> know<00:03:48.829> futuristic

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
this type of you know futuristic

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.569 
this type of you know futuristic
gameplay<00:03:50.299> now<00:03:50.750> downhill<00:03:51.440> is<00:03:51.590> kind<00:03:51.829> of<00:03:51.950> weird<00:03:52.130> I

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
gameplay now downhill is kind of weird I

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.000 
gameplay now downhill is kind of weird I
think<00:03:53.030> it's<00:03:53.180> out<00:03:53.570> of<00:03:53.630> all<00:03:54.079> the<00:03:54.290> four<00:03:54.530> maps<00:03:54.739> it's

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
think it's out of all the four maps it's

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.680 
think it's out of all the four maps it's
probably<00:03:55.310> my<00:03:55.459> least<00:03:55.640> favorite<00:03:56.090> for<00:03:56.660> the

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
probably my least favorite for the

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.140 
probably my least favorite for the
symbol<00:03:57.049> Rick<00:03:57.200> fact<00:03:57.530> that<00:03:57.799> the<00:03:58.549> ends<00:03:58.970> of<00:03:59.060> the

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
symbol Rick fact that the ends of the

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.330 
symbol Rick fact that the ends of the
map<00:03:59.359> are<00:03:59.540> too<00:03:59.750> long<00:03:59.959> like<00:04:00.380> you<00:04:00.650> can<00:04:00.859> go<00:04:01.040> all<00:04:01.310> the

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
map are too long like you can go all the

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.910 
map are too long like you can go all the
way<00:04:01.760> back<00:04:02.090> to<00:04:02.150> that<00:04:02.420> house<00:04:02.810> and

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
different game types and I'm still still

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.940 
different game types and I'm still still
waiting<00:04:49.700> for<00:04:49.940> this<00:04:50.320> when<00:04:51.320> you<00:04:51.440> have<00:04:51.680> different

game types like you know you go from

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.460 
game types like you know you go from
groundwater<00:04:55.340> to<00:04:55.669> team<00:04:55.880> deathmatch<00:04:56.300> I<00:04:56.630> don't

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
groundwater to team deathmatch I don't

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.560 
groundwater to team deathmatch I don't
think<00:04:58.010> it<00:04:58.130> wasn't<00:04:58.340> world<00:04:58.729> at<00:04:58.910> war<00:04:59.090> they<00:04:59.300> used

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
think it wasn't world at war they used

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.480 
think it wasn't world at war they used
to<00:04:59.720> cut<00:04:59.960> the<00:05:00.139> maps<00:05:00.410> down<00:05:00.710> do<00:05:01.100> you<00:05:01.190> remember

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
to cut the maps down do you remember

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.930 
to cut the maps down do you remember
this<00:05:01.729> maybe<00:05:02.300> it<00:05:02.479> was<00:05:02.510> call<00:05:03.080> of<00:05:03.200> duty<00:05:03.229> three

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
this maybe it was call of duty three

this maybe it was call of duty three
were<00:05:04.940> they<00:05:05.090> used<00:05:05.270> to<00:05:05.389> like<00:05:05.600> the<00:05:06.020> maps<00:05:06.290> used<00:05:06.530> to

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
were they used to like the maps used to

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.680 
were they used to like the maps used to
be<00:05:06.710> smaller<00:05:07.010> I<00:05:07.190> know<00:05:07.250> for<00:05:07.610> a<00:05:07.639> fact<00:05:07.669> I'm<00:05:08.150> black

ops we that all the maps were different

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.650 
ops we that all the maps were different
from<00:05:12.710> team<00:05:13.010> deathmatch<00:05:13.430> to<00:05:13.669> growl<00:05:13.850> like<00:05:14.479> they

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
from team deathmatch to growl like they

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.330 
from team deathmatch to growl like they
would<00:05:14.780> shorten<00:05:15.140> the<00:05:15.229> maps<00:05:15.410> down<00:05:15.680> so<00:05:16.160> the

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
would shorten the maps down so the

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.710 
would shorten the maps down so the
action<00:05:16.760> I<00:05:16.789> was<00:05:16.910> like<00:05:17.000> wow<00:05:17.180> this<00:05:17.360> is<00:05:17.510> an<00:05:17.600> awesome

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.320 
idea like this the man of it like what
happened<00:05:21.530> there<00:05:21.800> I<00:05:22.010> mean<00:05:22.669> I<00:05:22.700> don't<00:05:22.789> get<00:05:23.090> it<00:05:23.210> is

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
happened there I mean I don't get it is

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.779 
happened there I mean I don't get it is
it<00:05:23.479> does<00:05:23.780> it<00:05:23.870> take<00:05:24.050> more<00:05:24.260> memory<00:05:24.680> on<00:05:25.070> to<00:05:25.580> this

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:25.789 
it does it take more memory on to this

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:28.779 
it does it take more memory on to this
does<00:05:26.150> it<00:05:26.300> cost<00:05:26.660> space<00:05:27.140> I<00:05:27.470> don't<00:05:28.100> have<00:05:28.310> the<00:05:28.520> clue

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:28.789 
does it cost space I don't have the clue

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:30.940 
does it cost space I don't have the clue
to<00:05:28.820> those<00:05:29.210> answers<00:05:29.660> but<00:05:30.200> it<00:05:30.289> seems<00:05:30.590> like<00:05:30.710> it'd

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
to those answers but it seems like it'd

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.460 
to those answers but it seems like it'd
be<00:05:31.070> more<00:05:31.220> logical<00:05:31.630> maybe<00:05:32.630> a<00:05:32.750> lot<00:05:33.110> of<00:05:33.260> things

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
be more logical maybe a lot of things

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.970 
be more logical maybe a lot of things
that<00:05:33.650> I'm<00:05:33.740> asking<00:05:34.190> for<00:05:34.690> like<00:05:35.830> you<00:05:36.830> know

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
that I'm asking for like you know

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.550 
that I'm asking for like you know
having<00:05:38.670> the<00:05:38.760> ability<00:05:38.970> to<00:05:39.420> remember<00:05:39.840> the

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
having the ability to remember the

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.530 
having the ability to remember the
sensitivity<00:05:41.490> for<00:05:41.700> different<00:05:41.970> loadouts<00:05:42.330> if

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
sensitivity for different loadouts if

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.060 
sensitivity for different loadouts if
your<00:05:42.780> character<00:05:43.020> picks<00:05:43.440> up<00:05:43.590> an<00:05:43.710> assault<00:05:44.040> rifle

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
your character picks up an assault rifle

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.990 
your character picks up an assault rifle
between<00:05:44.550> an<00:05:44.670> SMG<00:05:45.000> or<00:05:45.390> you<00:05:46.080> know<00:05:46.170> going<00:05:46.410> from

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
between an SMG or you know going from

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.700 
between an SMG or you know going from
killstreak<00:05:48.000> to<00:05:48.210> your<00:05:48.330> weapon<00:05:48.750> I<00:05:48.990> mean<00:05:49.440> that

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
killstreak to your weapon I mean that

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.100 
killstreak to your weapon I mean that
seems<00:05:50.300> sensitivity<00:05:51.300> is<00:05:51.360> always<00:05:51.570> the<00:05:51.660> same<00:05:51.690> so

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
seems sensitivity is always the same so

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.990 
seems sensitivity is always the same so
like<00:05:52.290> if<00:05:52.650> you<00:05:52.830> got<00:05:52.950> high<00:05:53.130> sensitivity<00:05:53.640> on<00:05:53.850> a

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
like if you got high sensitivity on a

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.820 
like if you got high sensitivity on a
lmg<00:05:54.480> order<00:05:54.810> slot<00:05:55.050> right<00:05:55.200> for<00:05:55.440> our<00:05:55.470> sniper

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
lmg order slot right for our sniper

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.650 
lmg order slot right for our sniper
rifle<00:05:56.250> and<00:05:56.430> then<00:05:56.790> you<00:05:56.910> pick<00:05:57.120> up<00:05:57.270> a<00:05:57.360> different

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
rifle and then you pick up a different

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.120 
rifle and then you pick up a different
weapon<00:05:57.780> you're<00:05:58.170> like<00:05:58.290> oh<00:05:58.440> my<00:05:58.650> god<00:05:58.800> this<00:05:58.830> isn't

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
weapon you're like oh my god this isn't

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.340 
weapon you're like oh my god this isn't
working<00:05:59.340> or<00:05:59.790> you<00:06:00.450> know<00:06:00.570> you<00:06:00.600> go<00:06:00.900> to<00:06:00.960> a<00:06:01.080> kill

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
working or you know you go to a kill

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.080 
working or you know you go to a kill
streak<00:06:01.470> and<00:06:01.860> you're<00:06:01.980> like<00:06:02.130> you've<00:06:02.700> got<00:06:02.940> your

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
streak and you're like you've got your

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.990 
streak and you're like you've got your
gall<00:06:03.360> over<00:06:03.720> the<00:06:03.810> place<00:06:04.020> you're<00:06:04.770> like<00:06:05.000> simple

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
gall over the place you're like simple

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.690 
gall over the place you're like simple
stuff<00:06:06.240> like<00:06:06.270> treyarch<00:06:06.870> logic<00:06:07.410> almost<00:06:08.310> and<00:06:08.490> I

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
stuff like treyarch logic almost and I

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.850 
stuff like treyarch logic almost and I
understand<00:06:09.240> I<00:06:09.600> understand<00:06:10.320> that<00:06:10.590> the<00:06:10.650> game

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
understand I understand that the game

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.010 
understand I understand that the game
was<00:06:10.980> only<00:06:11.340> out<00:06:11.490> for<00:06:11.520> eight<00:06:11.880> months<00:06:12.090> right<00:06:12.510> and

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
was only out for eight months right and

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.990 
was only out for eight months right and
after<00:06:13.410> eight<00:06:13.530> months<00:06:13.710> that's<00:06:14.220> it<00:06:14.400> they<00:06:14.700> change

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
after eight months that's it they change

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.690 
after eight months that's it they change
everything<00:06:15.270> so<00:06:16.170> I<00:06:16.470> mean<00:06:16.860> what<00:06:17.370> do<00:06:17.430> you<00:06:17.490> use

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.700 
everything so I mean what do you use

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.550 
everything so I mean what do you use
kill<00:06:17.970> you<00:06:18.120> eight<00:06:18.300> people<00:06:18.720> are<00:06:18.810> fans<00:06:19.110> and

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
kill you eight people are fans and

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.290 
kill you eight people are fans and
they're<00:06:19.800> just<00:06:19.980> gonna<00:06:20.100> gobble<00:06:20.520> it<00:06:20.730> up<00:06:20.820> anyway

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
they're just gonna gobble it up anyway

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.510 
they're just gonna gobble it up anyway
so<00:06:21.600> you<00:06:21.660> can't<00:06:21.960> always<00:06:22.410> do<00:06:22.830> everything<00:06:23.040> that

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 
so you can't always do everything that

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.480 
so you can't always do everything that
you<00:06:23.760> think<00:06:24.480> that<00:06:24.630> you<00:06:24.990> can<00:06:25.410> get<00:06:25.590> in<00:06:25.680> there<00:06:25.860> but

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
you think that you can get in there but

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.680 
you think that you can get in there but
it<00:06:26.580> seems<00:06:26.820> like<00:06:27.000> you<00:06:27.150> know<00:06:27.270> you<00:06:27.330> can<00:06:27.570> get

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690 
it seems like you know you can get

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.720 
it seems like you know you can get
triggered<00:06:28.170> you<00:06:28.590> can<00:06:28.770> get<00:06:28.950> logic<00:06:29.460> in<00:06:29.610> there

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:29.730 
triggered you can get logic in there

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.510 
triggered you can get logic in there
like<00:06:29.910> logical<00:06:30.570> things<00:06:30.870> and<00:06:31.290> it<00:06:31.800> and<00:06:32.010> as<00:06:32.340> like

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
like logical things and it and as like

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.500 
like logical things and it and as like
it<00:06:32.700> baffles<00:06:33.240> me<00:06:33.420> how<00:06:33.690> much<00:06:34.410> of<00:06:35.060> little<00:06:36.060> little

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
it baffles me how much of little little

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.030 
it baffles me how much of little little
bitty<00:06:36.750> things<00:06:37.110> that<00:06:37.290> we<00:06:37.410> could<00:06:37.560> just<00:06:37.740> put<00:06:37.950> in

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.040 
bitty things that we could just put in

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.250 
bitty things that we could just put in
there<00:06:38.220> to<00:06:38.460> make<00:06:38.910> everybody's<00:06:39.480> life<00:06:39.510> a<00:06:39.990> little

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
there to make everybody's life a little

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260 
there to make everybody's life a little
bit<00:06:40.410> better<00:06:40.590> I<00:06:40.920> mean<00:06:41.160> when<00:06:41.280> you<00:06:41.370> agree<00:06:41.700> don't

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:42.270 
bit better I mean when you agree don't

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.530 
bit better I mean when you agree don't
you<00:06:42.420> agree<00:06:42.630> I<00:06:42.720> think<00:06:42.840> so<00:06:43.230> right<00:06:43.580> so<00:06:44.580> anyways

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:45.540 
you agree I think so right so anyways

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.330 
you agree I think so right so anyways
overall<00:06:45.960> grade<00:06:46.260> on<00:06:46.410> this<00:06:46.500> map<00:06:46.770> I<00:06:46.980> think<00:06:47.220> it's

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 
overall grade on this map I think it's

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.430 
overall grade on this map I think it's
the<00:06:47.400> least<00:06:47.580> of<00:06:47.760> my<00:06:47.790> favorite<00:06:48.180> maps<00:06:48.360> I<00:06:48.750> deal

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 
the least of my favorite maps I deal

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.860 
the least of my favorite maps I deal
with<00:06:49.470> it<00:06:49.770> I<00:06:50.070> don't<00:06:50.550> mind<00:06:50.730> it<00:06:50.940> at<00:06:51.030> ground<00:06:51.330> war<00:06:51.600> I

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870 
with it I don't mind it at ground war I

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.240 
with it I don't mind it at ground war I
think<00:06:52.140> it's<00:06:52.260> terrible<00:06:52.710> in<00:06:52.860> team<00:06:53.070> deathmatch

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250 
think it's terrible in team deathmatch

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.540 
think it's terrible in team deathmatch
or<00:06:53.760> any<00:06:54.000> tour<00:06:54.680> because<00:06:55.680> there's<00:06:55.980> just<00:06:56.340> too

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.550 
or any tour because there's just too

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.370 
or any tour because there's just too
much<00:06:56.670> room<00:06:57.000> it's<00:06:57.420> kind<00:06:57.540> of<00:06:57.630> like<00:06:57.720> turbine<00:06:58.110> and

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.380 
much room it's kind of like turbine and

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.440 
much room it's kind of like turbine and
aftermath<00:06:58.740> but<00:06:59.280> you<00:06:59.940> know<00:07:00.030> that's<00:07:00.210> true<00:07:00.390> it

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:00.450 
aftermath but you know that's true it

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:01.940 
aftermath but you know that's true it
does<00:07:00.540> match<00:07:00.840> for<00:07:01.110> you<00:07:01.230> I<00:07:01.470> didn't<00:07:01.740> know<00:07:01.800> at<00:07:01.920> the

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:01.950 
does match for you I didn't know at the
