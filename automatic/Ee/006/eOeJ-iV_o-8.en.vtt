of<00:01:31.070> those<00:01:31.130> tricks<00:01:31.490> that<00:01:31.760> sometimes<00:01:32.420> works

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
of those tricks that sometimes works

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.630 
of those tricks that sometimes works
sometimes<00:01:32.810> does<00:01:33.410> it<00:01:33.560> well<00:01:33.740> at<00:01:33.979> least<00:01:34.130> logic

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
sometimes does it well at least logic

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.730 
sometimes does it well at least logic
makes<00:01:34.760> sense<00:01:35.030> in<00:01:35.180> my<00:01:35.300> own<00:01:35.420> minds<00:01:35.690> better<00:01:36.350> to

makes sense in my own minds better to

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.080 
makes sense in my own minds better to
get<00:01:36.830> a<00:01:36.860> little<00:01:36.950> bit<00:01:37.100> better<00:01:37.220> idea<00:01:37.580> of<00:01:37.820> who
