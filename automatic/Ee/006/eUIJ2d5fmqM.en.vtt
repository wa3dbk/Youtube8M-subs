00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:18.760
 I will say I want to talk first issued by 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:21.330
 percent in Japan between blogs Jets 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.330
 Last times 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.650
 welcome people to my channel 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.980
 new scale and she's trying to bring 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.860
 for you videos video games of course 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.050
 gameplay which brought is the analysis 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.720
 mainly with the games farms 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.960
 launching of new games or 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.130
 old or whatever you want 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.730
 and now bringing back here to give 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:49.570
 beginning the edge before 2 released on the 18th of 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:53.320
 September 2012 or little time is 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.450
 was released for pc ps3 xbox 360 and wii is 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.310
 a first-person action rpg that 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.940
 You know straight from the original board. 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.400
 slow 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.680
 launched in 2009 the two were 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.449
 developed by gearbox software 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.430
 instructed by 2k games 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.830
 first impressions right at the start 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.750
 the game is because it can transmit 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.300
 perfectly the idea of more violent 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.370
 humorous and a very funny game with 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.770
 that the mark of the 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.650
 game and of course the jokes the words of the 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.210
 enemies also the narrative and if of a 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.370
 greatly improved when compared to 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.420
 predecessor story is much more 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.340
 explored 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.050
 I think she 's more like that. 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.480
 first will be played at the point and not 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.840
 have such a happening do five years 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.300
 although as it happens the series that begins 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.540
 The story of the game puts you back 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.790
 even back before would be a hunter 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.310
 waltz is false would be a kind of 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.770
 alien warehouse cell for 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.620
 story how to say left by two 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.710
 alien races and there are 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.780
 valuable materials in the case of 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.750
 two calls elÃ­dio that are of great 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.210
 interest is clear from the antagonist who 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.049
 maniac he wants to dominate the world is 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.659
 use these materials and it has 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.069
 has an explorer of this material 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.069
 what is lion hype 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.079
 and so begins the battle of the vows 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.230
 you come back rangers with other people 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:18.489
 so interested in saving the world from 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.900
 pandora 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:24.700
 that's the megalomaniac there and they talk 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.230
 of history but also comment on that 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.159
 who did not play the first one does not have 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.439
 problem 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:32.139
 the game gives you a well-made prologue that 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:34.150
 leaves for the events xbox is 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:36.189
 important to know what happened 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.450
 transitorily of the first second 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.010
 game 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.709
 something that I could also notice in this 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.659
 game is faith difficulty she is well 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.540
 Challenger still promote a few times 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.760
 this challenge of the game happens due to the 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.219
 the system programming game he went 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.230
 based on a cooperative system or 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:55.120
 will have a very high organ of 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.290
 enemies the scenario if you have played 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.939
 alone 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.949
 of course it's much more fun to play and 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:02.139
 cooperative not only because it is easier to 

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:04.599
 but ends up having a lot more fun 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:06.790
 This reminds me that the current games do not 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.889
 have so much trouble so that I 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.900
 much interested though less games 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:11.919
 current and has a very large facility 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.530
 like this 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:17.169
 the gps you arrive at the mission not that he 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.239
 but has not not only not only this 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:21.639
 question but the enemies decision was over 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:25.329
 complicated not to mention that you live in the 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:27.669
 the attacks are strong at last I've already caught 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:30.879
 in the other situations I needed the nose 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:32.829
 so to start on the ground because due 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.449
 the pre-medial amount of shot and 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.549
 enemy on the scene 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:38.859
 I think the intention of just leaving because 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.959
 an interesting thing in this game is that 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:44.109
 already has a script a system that does 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:47.889
 the weapons are randomly generated 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:52.180
 good books like the boxes 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:55.359
 who is at risk makes the game 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.009
 much more challenging economic insee 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.590
 before sense of us and is always 

00:03:57.009 --> 00:04:02.139
 seeking and having the best weapons 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.989
 better finally improve your character 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:08.049
 Yesterday is already different with everything 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:10.419
 This system of this game criterion is a 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.579
 of skills in the unit for two to 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:15.039
 improve the original relationship 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:17.310
 now that a better defined evolution 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:19.810
 more effective you feel better 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.709
 uniqueness of each unit has been 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.840
 used 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.060
 are four characters in each and every one 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.340
 like every good rpg has a weapon of 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.990
 different truth each of the 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.930
 characters provide an experience 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.889
 unique gameplay will reflect a lot on your 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.529
 way to play 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.840
 or the opposite but the most 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:40.479
 of course, of course I'll tell you 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.089
 the nude thing you can always take and 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.130
 save in your tektek the amount of 

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:47.560
 items and differentiated weapon that will 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.909
 finding the game is absurd 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.680
 diversifying the player experience 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:52.990
 ready even more intelligence 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.360
 artificial has undergone one much change 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.630
 Good lap and half an hour to go to China. 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.039
 after being shot with you examine 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.570
 also help each other 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:04.570
 all this to leave its part more 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:07.419
 difficult course already has few and 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:10.000
 small bugs things like the enemy 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.729
 locking down the scenery but nothing 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.680
 very frequent in the dac or will get the 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.930
 other qualities that kim 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.510
 excelled can read both have notes 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.490

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.030
 competitor to the prize game of the year 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.580
 finally the kind of organ paper killing 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.190
 The guilty and alien a miss play 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.280
 advice people are to buy immediately is 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:37.670
