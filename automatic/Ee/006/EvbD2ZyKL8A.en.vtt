admittedly<00:03:12.459> I<00:03:12.760> didn't<00:03:13.030> quite<00:03:13.299> know<00:03:13.600> what<00:03:13.840> the

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
admittedly I didn't quite know what the

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.600 
admittedly I didn't quite know what the
word<00:03:14.140> of<00:03:14.410> an<00:03:14.650> abutment<00:03:14.920> I<00:03:15.510> assumed<00:03:16.510> it<00:03:16.900> meant

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
word of an abutment I assumed it meant

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.460

able<00:03:18.610> to<00:03:18.700> be<00:03:18.790> put<00:03:18.970> in<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.180> oven<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:19.840> actually

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
able to be put in the oven and actually

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.620 
able to be put in the oven and actually
after<00:03:21.130> looking<00:03:21.430> at<00:03:21.549> definitions<00:03:22.150> that's

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
after looking at definitions that's

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.960 
after looking at definitions that's
basically<00:03:23.049> what<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:23.380> means<00:03:23.610> what<00:03:24.610> I<00:03:24.670> have<00:03:24.940> a

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
basically what it means what I have a

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.000 
basically what it means what I have a
problem<00:03:25.150> with<00:03:25.510> is<00:03:25.750> why<00:03:26.260> even<00:03:26.650> need<00:03:26.799> to<00:03:26.860> put

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
problem with is why even need to put

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.160 
problem with is why even need to put
that<00:03:27.130> in<00:03:27.340> there<00:03:27.580> you<00:03:28.360> cook<00:03:28.540> it<00:03:28.660> in<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:28.840> oven<00:03:28.989> or

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
that in there you cook it in the oven or

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.800 
that in there you cook it in the oven or
you<00:03:29.650> deep-fry<00:03:30.130> it<00:03:30.160> I<00:03:30.760> would<00:03:31.420> assume<00:03:31.540> that

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
you deep-fry it I would assume that

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.809 
you deep-fry it I would assume that
because<00:03:32.380> you're<00:03:32.500> supposed<00:03:32.709> to<00:03:32.860> eat<00:03:33.190> this<00:03:33.459> and

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
because you're supposed to eat this and

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.319 
because you're supposed to eat this and
the<00:03:34.600> directions<00:03:35.049> say<00:03:35.319> oven<00:03:35.739> that<00:03:36.370> it's<00:03:37.120> going

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
the directions say oven that it's going

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.830 
the directions say oven that it's going
to<00:03:37.390> be<00:03:37.510> oven<00:03:37.930> a<00:03:38.019> bowl<00:03:38.200> so<00:03:38.680> I'm<00:03:39.040> not<00:03:39.220> quite<00:03:39.459> sure

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
to be oven a bowl so I'm not quite sure

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.259 
to be oven a bowl so I'm not quite sure
what<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:40.930> thinking<00:03:41.140> was<00:03:41.320> on<00:03:41.769> there<00:03:42.070> but<00:03:42.370> that

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
what the thinking was on there but that

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.060 
what the thinking was on there but that
that<00:03:43.540> could<00:03:43.720> create<00:03:43.930> more<00:03:44.140> confusion<00:03:44.739> than

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
that could create more confusion than

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.550 
that could create more confusion than
comfort<00:03:46.000> when<00:03:46.450> someone<00:03:46.750> reads<00:03:46.989> that<00:03:47.230> you

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
comfort when someone reads that you

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.170 
comfort when someone reads that you
should<00:03:47.739> probably<00:03:47.920> just<00:03:48.040> say<00:03:48.310> crispy<00:03:48.850> green

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
should probably just say crispy green

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.940 
should probably just say crispy green
