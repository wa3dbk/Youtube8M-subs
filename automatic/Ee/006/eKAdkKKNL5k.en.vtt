how<00:00:01.439> you<00:00:01.500> use<00:00:02.040> the<00:00:02.340> light<00:00:02.580> can<00:00:02.939> really<00:00:03.240> affect

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
how you use the light can really affect

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.099 
how you use the light can really affect
the<00:00:03.899> quality<00:00:04.080> of<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:04.920> colors<00:00:05.310> so<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.870> light

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
the quality of the colors so the light

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.379 
the quality of the colors so the light
that<00:00:07.379> my<00:00:07.830> model<00:00:08.280> carry<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:08.790> sitting<00:00:09.120> in<00:00:09.210> right

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
that my model carry is sitting in right

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.110 
that my model carry is sitting in right
now<00:00:09.420> is<00:00:09.809> actually<00:00:10.260> really<00:00:10.889> nice<00:00:11.280> light<00:00:11.730> for

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
now is actually really nice light for

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.570 
now is actually really nice light for
showing<00:00:12.750> more<00:00:13.080> vibrant<00:00:13.650> colors<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.160> that's

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
showing more vibrant colors and that's

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.890 
showing more vibrant colors and that's
why<00:00:14.700> we<00:00:14.849> went<00:00:15.000> ahead<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.269> kind<00:00:15.570> of<00:00:15.660> wrapped

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
why we went ahead and kind of wrapped

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.960 
why we went ahead and kind of wrapped
this<00:00:16.139> little<00:00:16.410> scarf<00:00:16.740> around<00:00:16.890> her<00:00:17.220> was<00:00:17.670> just<00:00:17.730> so

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
this little scarf around her was just so

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.330 
this little scarf around her was just so
that<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.240> could<00:00:18.420> see<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.869> effect<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.560> this

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
that you could see the effect of this

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.019 
that you could see the effect of this
soft<00:00:20.789> diffuse<00:00:21.390> light<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.020> how<00:00:22.609> because<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
soft diffuse light and how because the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.450 
soft diffuse light and how because the
contrast<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.199> shadows<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.769> those<00:00:26.310> other

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
contrast and the shadows and those other

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.759 
contrast and the shadows and those other
things<00:00:26.760> are<00:00:27.000> not<00:00:27.180> emphasized<00:00:27.960> as<00:00:28.260> much<00:00:28.470> and

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
things are not emphasized as much and

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.950 
things are not emphasized as much and
because<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.460> quality<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.330> light<00:00:30.510> allows

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
because the quality of the light allows

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.680 
because the quality of the light allows
for<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.380> more<00:00:31.529> saturated<00:00:32.099> color<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.969> Blues<00:00:33.270> in

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
for a more saturated color the Blues in

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.130 
for a more saturated color the Blues in
this<00:00:33.870> scarf<00:00:34.290> really<00:00:34.739> pop<00:00:34.980> now<00:00:35.910> if<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.840> were<00:00:37.050> to

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
this scarf really pop now if I were to

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.790 
this scarf really pop now if I were to
go<00:00:37.290> ahead<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.829> plug<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.940> our<00:00:39.210> harsh<00:00:40.079> direct

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
go ahead and plug in our harsh direct

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.709 
go ahead and plug in our harsh direct
light<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.820> aim<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.989> at<00:00:43.200> our<00:00:43.230> model<00:00:44.510> it<00:00:45.510> can

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
light and aim that at our model it can

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.520 
light and aim that at our model it can
actually<00:00:45.930> cut<00:00:46.590> down<00:00:46.980> on<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:48.059> overall

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
actually cut down on the overall

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.580 
actually cut down on the overall
saturation<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.800> color<00:00:50.930> now<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.199> light

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
saturation of the color now this light

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.560 
saturation of the color now this light
has<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.010> little<00:00:53.430> bit<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.610> an<00:00:53.699> orange<00:00:53.910> tent<00:00:54.300> so<00:00:54.539> i

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
has a little bit of an orange tent so i

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.479 
has a little bit of an orange tent so i
have<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.930> admit<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.949> kind<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.250> bringing

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
have to admit it it is kind of bringing

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.880 
have to admit it it is kind of bringing
the<00:00:56.730> yellows<00:00:57.090> out<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> little<00:00:57.480> bit<00:00:57.660> more<00:00:57.930> but<00:00:58.620> if

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
the yellows out a little bit more but if

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.040 
the yellows out a little bit more but if
this<00:00:59.250> were<00:00:59.430> direct<00:00:59.760> sunlight<00:01:00.090> like<00:01:00.809> say

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
this were direct sunlight like say

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.360 
this were direct sunlight like say
you're<00:01:01.230> photographing<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.949> field<00:01:02.190> of

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
you're photographing the field of

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.609 
you're photographing the field of
flowers<00:01:02.719> when<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.870> Sun<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.290> hitting<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
flowers when the Sun is hitting the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.399 
flowers when the Sun is hitting the
flowers<00:01:05.159> they<00:01:05.519> they<00:01:06.060> tend<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.330> seem<00:01:06.540> less

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
flowers they they tend to seem less

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.190 
flowers they they tend to seem less
saturated<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:09.000> colors<00:01:09.390> pop<00:01:09.420> less

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
saturated and the colors pop less

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.580 
saturated and the colors pop less
whereas<00:01:11.189> if<00:01:11.369> clouds<00:01:11.760> go<00:01:12.119> overhead<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:13.260> colors

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
whereas if clouds go overhead the colors

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.399 
whereas if clouds go overhead the colors
of<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.770> flowers<00:01:14.040> can<00:01:14.490> really<00:01:14.760> come<00:01:14.970> through

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
of the flowers can really come through

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.100 
of the flowers can really come through
so<00:01:16.409> another<00:01:16.830> thing<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.640> consider<00:01:17.810> with<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
so another thing to consider with the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.280 
so another thing to consider with the
with<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.189> light<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.659> time<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.080> day

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
with the light is that the time of day

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.920 
with the light is that the time of day
has<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> huge<00:01:23.220> impact<00:01:23.400> on<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.420> like<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.869> said

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
has a huge impact on it so like I said

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.690 
has a huge impact on it so like I said
with<00:01:25.200> this<00:01:25.350> tungsten<00:01:25.650> light<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.250> has<00:01:26.400> kind<00:01:26.670> of

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
with this tungsten light it has kind of

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.219 
with this tungsten light it has kind of
this<00:01:26.759> warmer<00:01:27.180> light<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.509> actually<00:01:27.840> almost<00:01:27.960> has

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
this warmer light it actually almost has

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.770 
this warmer light it actually almost has
a<00:01:28.259> little<00:01:28.680> bit<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.829> equalities<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.450> end<00:01:30.600> of

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
a little bit of equalities of the end of

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.260 
a little bit of equalities of the end of
the<00:01:30.930> day<00:01:31.170> where<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.189> have<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.549> golden<00:01:33.000> light

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
the day where you have the golden light

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.350 
the day where you have the golden light
or<00:01:33.570> early<00:01:34.259> morning<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.310> those<00:01:35.759> colors<00:01:36.210> like

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
or early morning so those colors like

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.510 
or early morning so those colors like
when<00:01:36.509> you're<00:01:36.630> looking<00:01:36.869> at<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.049> sunset<00:01:37.350> they<00:01:38.250> can

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
when you're looking at a sunset they can

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.780 
when you're looking at a sunset they can
make<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.600> Red<00:01:39.869> Sea<00:01:40.290> more<00:01:40.650> vibrant<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
make the Red Sea more vibrant and the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.819 
make the Red Sea more vibrant and the
yellows<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.299> all<00:01:42.810> those<00:01:42.960> other<00:01:43.200> colors<00:01:43.590> come

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
yellows and all those other colors come

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.120 
yellows and all those other colors come
out<00:01:43.950> or<00:01:44.189> those<00:01:44.310> dusky<00:01:44.970> blues<00:01:45.470> so<00:01:46.470> if<00:01:46.680> that's

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
out or those dusky blues so if that's

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.800 
out or those dusky blues so if that's
something<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.939> really<00:01:48.180> important<00:01:48.720> to

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
something that is really important to

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.260 
something that is really important to
the<00:01:48.930> mood<00:01:49.229> or<00:01:49.649> feeling<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:50.220> your<00:01:50.310> picture<00:01:50.729> then

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
the mood or feeling of your picture then

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.670 
the mood or feeling of your picture then
you<00:01:51.390> want<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.659> make<00:01:51.810> sure<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.229> have<00:01:52.439> your

you want to make sure that you have your
subject<00:01:53.220> whether<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> landscape<00:01:54.600> or<00:01:54.810> a
