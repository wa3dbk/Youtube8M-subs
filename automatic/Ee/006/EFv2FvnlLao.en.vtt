00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.070
 evening sarah of the territory the dieticians then listen to you 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.029
 offers a lot of tension after the excesses we slowly all known that 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:09.379
 do you go to better their death 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:12.659
 so to answer your question there are four main points 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:16.820
 they first found for one hundred and three main meals then 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.429
 preferably fixed so the breakfast 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:21.109
 a sufficient lunch 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.119
 to hold until the evening and an earlier dinner the geeks 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.689
 the second point is a balanced diet of the WHO as much as possible 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.659
 but cellar to do the best possible 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:33.499
 so with particular fruits and vegetables as was discussed at 

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:34.520
 topic 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.769
 so 5 1% 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:38.390
 if a portion will be about a handful 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.490
 and then and still limit all that is a little too alcoholic and 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.940
 sugary drinks 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.210
 all that is very fat to cycling is a nasty one like that 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.309
 so we are getting ready 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.850
 broth and ohio for three weeks 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.980
 it's hard to hold for three weeks 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.980
 after good for two days it's possible and it's not really essential 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.250
 it's even more interesting to eat three meals anyway 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.840
 complete to avoid being hungry and nibbling thereafter what is the 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.489
 risk with a diet 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.680
 too restrictive 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.800
 indeed timed 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.620
 ben arfa 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.890
 it just happened to mostly what we want to avoid 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.870
 then it's fresh vegetables a day the compostelle that goes through the food at 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.750
 proscribe 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.219
 foods to proscribe 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:18.960
 not necessarily is knowing how to limit them 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.090
 to be happy in the middle ground is above all that 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.780
 after there is not necessarily obvious here 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.080
 if you have small pleasures it is necessary above all to amass 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.960
 it was so without moderation that's what I said in all it takes 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.360
 not engage in the street will only take the compote to hold 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.110
 should we help dietary supplements or not 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.150
 so dietary supplements ensure a varied diet and 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.180
 balanced 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.680
 it's not necessary 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.760
 these are products% and a study that was recently done the top and which 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.810
 are often overdosed 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.810
 control it so that's why it's necessary if ever a pathology and 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.480
 including nutritional deficiencies 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.960
 but if we do not know these tags some may be tempted selling our 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.670
 sites to go organic is that 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.790
 of his wearer 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.130
 then organic products no quality for the estrie 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.610
 then fabien toolbox mulch no problem but to eat well it is not 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.189
 necessarily necessary to eat organic 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:14.060
 especially with the constraints 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.870
 economic of everyone knows not necessarily possible that it is a 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.240
 podium thanks a lot talk about her since he became the board 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.390
 european three meals a day p it's a vegetable thing a day thank you very much
