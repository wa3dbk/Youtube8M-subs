and<00:02:06.689> where<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.960> wires<00:02:07.170> are<00:02:07.350> coming<00:02:07.530> in<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:07.770> I'm

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
and where the wires are coming in so I'm

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.670 
and where the wires are coming in so I'm
about<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:09.050> remove<00:02:10.050> those<00:02:10.349> items<00:02:10.410> first<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.250> see

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
about to remove those items first I see

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.039 
about to remove those items first I see
is<00:02:11.769> off<00:02:11.950> so<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:15.489> next<00:02:15.730> step<00:02:16.000> now<00:02:16.180> is<00:02:16.209> to<00:02:16.420> find<00:02:16.930> a

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
is off so the next step now is to find a

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.069 
is off so the next step now is to find a
place<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.260> locate<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.579> amplifier<00:02:19.239> of<00:02:19.540> the

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.079 
place to locate the the amplifier of the

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:22.979 
place to locate the the amplifier of the
unit<00:02:20.439> and<00:02:20.590> then<00:02:20.739> run<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.099> power<00:02:21.280> -<00:02:22.209> I<00:02:22.599> think

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
unit and then run the power - I think

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.110 
unit and then run the power - I think
I'm<00:02:23.170> going<00:02:23.319> to<00:02:23.349> run<00:02:23.469> it<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.739> my<00:02:23.950> taillights<00:02:24.549> so

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
I'm going to run it to my taillights so

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.119 
I'm going to run it to my taillights so
that<00:02:25.239> it<00:02:25.329> only<00:02:25.420> comes<00:02:25.689> on<00:02:25.870> while<00:02:26.319> the<00:02:26.709> key<00:02:26.980> is

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
that it only comes on while the key is

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.309 
that it only comes on while the key is
in<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.340> on<00:02:27.489> position<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:28.750> it<00:02:28.810> won't<00:02:28.959> drain<00:02:29.139> my

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
in the on position so it won't drain my

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.069 
in the on position so it won't drain my
battery<00:02:29.469> so<00:02:29.859> my<00:02:30.189> next<00:02:30.459> step<00:02:30.639> is<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:31.030> get<00:02:31.959> the

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
battery so my next step is to get the

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.220 
battery so my next step is to get the
box<00:02:32.290> out<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.680> start<00:02:32.889> to<00:02:32.980> run<00:02:33.129> the<00:02:33.219> wires<00:02:34.230> okay

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
box out and start to run the wires okay

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.190 
box out and start to run the wires okay
so<00:02:35.790> that<00:02:36.790> took<00:02:37.000> about<00:02:37.090> an<00:02:37.299> hour<00:02:37.450> here's<00:02:38.019> what<00:02:38.170> I

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
so that took about an hour here's what I

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.569 
so that took about an hour here's what I
had<00:02:38.379> to<00:02:38.500> do<00:02:38.709> I<00:02:38.920> had<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:40.180> splice<00:02:40.900> into<00:02:41.579> the

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
had to do I had to splice into the

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.759 
had to do I had to splice into the
housing<00:02:43.000> that<00:02:43.030> has<00:02:43.359> my<00:02:43.599> taillight<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.470> I

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
housing that has my taillight and I

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.009 
housing that has my taillight and I
spliced<00:02:45.549> in<00:02:45.849> there<00:02:46.030> and<00:02:46.209> I<00:02:46.269> soldered<00:02:46.689> the<00:02:46.810> wire

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
spliced in there and I soldered the wire

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.190 
spliced in there and I soldered the wire
onto<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:48.129> taillight<00:02:48.689> wire<00:02:49.689> so<00:02:49.900> that<00:02:49.989> when<00:02:50.109> the

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
onto the taillight wire so that when the

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.379 
onto the taillight wire so that when the
key<00:02:50.409> comes<00:02:50.650> on<00:02:50.859> the<00:02:51.400> power<00:02:51.609> will<00:02:51.879> come<00:02:52.000> on

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:52.389 
key comes on the power will come on

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.240 
key comes on the power will come on
and<00:02:52.480> then<00:02:52.989> I<00:02:53.079> grounded<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.650> other<00:02:53.799> side<00:02:54.069> to

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
and then I grounded the other side to

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.379 
and then I grounded the other side to
the<00:02:54.340> battery<00:02:54.730> I<00:02:54.970> then<00:02:55.689> I'm<00:02:55.930> going<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.260> locate

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:57.389 
the battery I then I'm going to locate

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.780 
the battery I then I'm going to locate
the<00:02:58.389> the<00:02:58.780> unit<00:02:59.290> right<00:02:59.560> in<00:02:59.769> this<00:02:59.889> area<00:03:00.129> here<00:03:00.489> I

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
the the unit right in this area here I

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.459 
the the unit right in this area here I
have<00:03:00.969> to<00:03:01.060> drill<00:03:01.269> a<00:03:01.299> hole<00:03:01.389> in<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:02.200> compartment

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:02.469 
have to drill a hole in the compartment

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:03.720 
have to drill a hole in the compartment
that<00:03:02.680> holds<00:03:02.739> the<00:03:03.010> tool<00:03:03.219> so<00:03:03.370> I<00:03:03.400> can<00:03:03.549> run<00:03:03.639> the

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
that holds the tool so I can run the

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:04.770 
that holds the tool so I can run the
wire<00:03:03.879> sure<00:03:04.090> when<00:03:04.209> I'm<00:03:04.299> done<00:03:04.419> with<00:03:04.540> that<00:03:04.599> I'll

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
wire sure when I'm done with that I'll

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.709 
wire sure when I'm done with that I'll
show<00:03:04.989> you<00:03:05.019> but<00:03:05.680> I<00:03:05.739> ran<00:03:06.010> my<00:03:06.189> wires<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:07.480> can<00:03:07.599> see

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:07.719 
show you but I ran my wires you can see

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:09.209 
show you but I ran my wires you can see
the<00:03:07.810> speaker's<00:03:08.169> are<00:03:08.290> now<00:03:08.439> mounted<00:03:08.950> on<00:03:09.040> the

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:09.219 
the speaker's are now mounted on the

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:11.759 
the speaker's are now mounted on the
handlebars<00:03:09.609> right<00:03:10.510> by<00:03:10.689> the<00:03:11.079> mirrors<00:03:11.500> with<00:03:11.650> the

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
handlebars right by the mirrors with the

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.330 
handlebars right by the mirrors with the
mirror<00:03:12.750> bolts<00:03:13.750> that's<00:03:14.680> how<00:03:14.919> they<00:03:15.069> actually

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
mirror bolts that's how they actually

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.969 
mirror bolts that's how they actually
mounted<00:03:15.760> on<00:03:15.909> and<00:03:16.530> actually<00:03:17.530> look<00:03:17.650> pretty<00:03:17.829> good

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:17.979 
mounted on and actually look pretty good

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.729 
mounted on and actually look pretty good
right<00:03:18.250> they'll<00:03:18.519> back<00:03:18.790> up<00:03:19.409> so<00:03:20.409> that's<00:03:20.530> how

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
right they'll back up so that's how

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.050 
right they'll back up so that's how
they'll<00:03:20.919> be<00:03:21.069> mounted<00:03:21.400> onto<00:03:21.519> the<00:03:21.760> steering

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
they'll be mounted onto the steering

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.390 
they'll be mounted onto the steering
wheel<00:03:22.479> then<00:03:23.379> I<00:03:23.409> ran<00:03:23.650> my<00:03:23.799> wires<00:03:24.069> back<00:03:24.370> here

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
wheel then I ran my wires back here

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.800 
wheel then I ran my wires back here
haven't<00:03:24.879> hidden<00:03:25.030> them<00:03:25.180> completely<00:03:25.510> but<00:03:25.690> it

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
haven't hidden them completely but it

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.559 
haven't hidden them completely but it
went<00:03:25.989> down<00:03:26.199> through<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:28.000> forks<00:03:28.359> and<00:03:28.479> up

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
went down through the forks and up

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.689 
went down through the forks and up
underneath<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:29.079> gas<00:03:29.109> tank<00:03:29.590> and<00:03:29.680> they<00:03:29.829> now

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:30.699 
underneath the gas tank and they now

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:33.569 
underneath the gas tank and they now
come<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:31.659> hang<00:03:31.900> out<00:03:32.079> right<00:03:32.470> here<00:03:32.549> where<00:03:33.549> I

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
come and hang out right here where I

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.640 
come and hang out right here where I
will<00:03:33.819> then<00:03:34.019> clean<00:03:35.019> them<00:03:35.139> up<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.439> put<00:03:35.620> them

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
will then clean them up and put them

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.399 
will then clean them up and put them
away<00:03:35.829> in<00:03:35.979> there<00:03:36.310> so<00:03:36.750> next<00:03:37.750> time<00:03:37.900> you<00:03:38.019> see<00:03:38.169> it<00:03:38.199> it

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.409 
away in there so next time you see it it

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:39.770 
away in there so next time you see it it
should<00:03:38.650> be<00:03:38.769> looking<00:03:39.069> a<00:03:39.099> little<00:03:39.129> bit<00:03:39.280> better

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
should be looking a little bit better

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.749 
should be looking a little bit better
alright<00:03:40.780> so<00:03:40.959> I<00:03:40.989> have<00:03:41.139> it<00:03:41.259> all<00:03:41.349> run<00:03:41.919> and<00:03:42.220> mounted

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:42.759 
alright so I have it all run and mounted

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:46.800 
alright so I have it all run and mounted
in<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.479> tool<00:03:43.780> kit<00:03:44.079> area<00:03:44.680> so<00:03:45.639> the<00:03:46.359> amp<00:03:46.569> is

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
in the tool kit area so the amp is

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.170 
in the tool kit area so the amp is
sitting<00:03:47.109> right<00:03:47.259> there<00:03:47.549> all<00:03:48.549> the<00:03:48.729> wires<00:03:48.939> are

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
sitting right there all the wires are

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.490 
sitting right there all the wires are
running<00:03:49.419> I<00:03:49.479> drilled<00:03:49.750> a<00:03:49.810> hole<00:03:49.840> back<00:03:50.259> in<00:03:50.439> the

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
running I drilled a hole back in the

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.080 
running I drilled a hole back in the
back<00:03:50.709> right<00:03:50.949> there<00:03:51.099> around<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:51.459> wires<00:03:51.699> in

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
back right there around the wires in

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
right there I ended up having to put the

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.279 
right there I ended up having to put the
amp<00:04:21.930> in<00:04:22.229> the<00:04:22.590> tool<00:04:22.830> case<00:04:23.160> and<00:04:23.960> the<00:04:24.960> battery

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
amp in the tool case and the battery

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:26.930 
amp in the tool case and the battery
there<00:04:25.800> was<00:04:25.919> no<00:04:26.009> battery<00:04:26.340> for<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.580> remote<00:04:26.759> so<00:04:26.910> I

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
there was no battery for the remote so I

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.040 
there was no battery for the remote so I
have<00:04:27.030> to<00:04:27.090> go<00:04:27.150> get<00:04:27.270> a<00:04:27.330> battery<00:04:27.599> for<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:27.810> remote

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
have to go get a battery for the remote

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.990 
have to go get a battery for the remote
but<00:04:28.320> looks<00:04:28.710> like<00:04:28.860> if<00:04:29.099> I<00:04:29.250> want<00:04:29.460> to<00:04:29.520> turn<00:04:29.639> this<00:04:29.820> on

but looks like if I want to turn this on

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.400 
but looks like if I want to turn this on
I<00:04:30.030> have<00:04:30.240> to<00:04:30.389> open<00:04:30.599> the<00:04:30.660> tool<00:04:30.840> case<00:04:31.050> and<00:04:31.229> hit<00:04:31.320> the

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
I have to open the tool case and hit the

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.610

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
damp down here I'm gonna end up moving

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.180 
damp down here I'm gonna end up moving
into<00:05:03.780> the<00:05:03.930> saddlebag<00:05:04.590> because<00:05:04.860> from<00:05:05.040> my

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
into the saddlebag because from my

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.100 
into the saddlebag because from my
personal<00:05:05.610> purposes<00:05:06.330> it's<00:05:06.510> difficult<00:05:06.900> to<00:05:06.990> turn

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
personal purposes it's difficult to turn

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.740 
personal purposes it's difficult to turn
on<00:05:07.320> and<00:05:07.470> off<00:05:07.550> behind<00:05:08.550> that<00:05:08.880> door<00:05:09.270> so<00:05:09.570> I'm<00:05:09.660> gonna

on and off behind that door so I'm gonna
put<00:05:09.930> it<00:05:10.020> somewhere<00:05:10.169> easier<00:05:10.560> I<00:05:11.570> have<00:05:12.570> some

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810

trouble<00:05:13.050> with<00:05:13.139> the<00:05:13.229> inputs<00:05:13.530> of<00:05:13.620> the<00:05:13.680> speaker's

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
trouble with the inputs of the speaker's

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:23.209 
trouble with the inputs of the speaker's
too

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:23.219 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:24.889 

also<00:05:23.879> the<00:05:23.999> brackets<00:05:24.449> when<00:05:24.569> you're<00:05:24.689> driving

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:24.899

also the brackets when you're driving
the<00:05:25.110> brackets<00:05:25.969> then<00:05:26.969> come<00:05:27.149> with<00:05:27.179> it<00:05:28.159> bouncing

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:29.159 
the brackets then come with it bouncing

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:33.439 
the brackets then come with it bouncing
around<00:05:29.219> like<00:05:29.429> this<00:05:30.559> looks<00:05:31.559> like<00:05:31.709> that<00:05:32.449> when

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449 
around like this looks like that when

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.010 
around like this looks like that when
your<00:05:33.599> ride

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.410
