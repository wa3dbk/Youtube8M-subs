00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
a developmental stage and you might use

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.060 
a developmental stage and you might use
it<00:01:34.330> so<00:01:34.540> it<00:01:34.660> the<00:01:35.110> anti<00:01:35.410> it's<00:01:35.710> not<00:01:35.920> your

it so it the anti it's not your

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.380 
depends on what happens in the future
and<00:01:41.380> how<00:01:41.500> well<00:01:41.979> things<00:01:42.280> move<00:01:42.610> along<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.119> track

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
and whether or not someone feels it's

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.309 
and whether or not someone feels it's
appropriate<00:01:46.030> to<00:01:46.210> reach<00:01:46.390> into<00:01:46.720> a<00:01:46.750> development

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
appropriate to reach into a development

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:48.870 
appropriate to reach into a development
stage<00:01:47.500> and<00:01:47.830> see<00:01:48.009> if<00:01:48.130> something<00:01:48.520> might<00:01:48.700> be

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
stage and see if something might be

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.090 
stage and see if something might be
useful<00:01:49.030> as<00:01:49.420> was<00:01:49.960> the<00:01:50.140> case<00:01:50.319> with<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.710> unmanned

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
useful as was the case with the unmanned

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.930 
useful as was the case with the unmanned
aerial<00:01:51.340> vehicles<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:53.590> think<00:01:54.429> that's<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.759> point

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
aerial vehicles I think that's the point

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.850 
aerial vehicles I think that's the point
and<00:01:55.450> I<00:01:55.509> think<00:01:55.569> that<00:01:55.899> it's<00:01:56.050> we<00:01:56.289> have<00:01:56.710> I<00:01:56.830> think

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
and I think that it's we have I think

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.169 
and I think that it's we have I think
from<00:01:57.190> beginning<00:01:57.490> of<00:01:57.550> this<00:01:57.640> conflict<00:01:57.910> I<00:01:58.149> think

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
from beginning of this conflict I think

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:59.999 
from beginning of this conflict I think
general<00:01:58.509> Frank's<00:01:58.810> has<00:01:58.899> been<00:01:59.080> very<00:01:59.319> open<00:01:59.590> to

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
general Frank's has been very open to

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.059 
general Frank's has been very open to
looking<00:02:00.910> at<00:02:01.060> new<00:02:01.929> things<00:02:01.960> if<00:02:02.649> there<00:02:02.890> are<00:02:02.979> new

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
looking at new things if there are new

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.550 
looking at new things if there are new
things<00:02:03.250> available<00:02:03.759> and<00:02:03.940> there's<00:02:04.600> been<00:02:04.750> been

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
things available and there's been been

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.320 
things available and there's been been
willing<00:02:05.830> to<00:02:05.950> put<00:02:06.280> him<00:02:06.369> into<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:06.640> fight<00:02:06.819> even

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
willing to put him into the fight even

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.300 
willing to put him into the fight even
before<00:02:07.450> they<00:02:07.690> didn't<00:02:07.869> fully<00:02:08.020> run<00:02:08.830> out<00:02:09.009> and<00:02:09.160> I

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
before they didn't fully run out and I

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.010 
before they didn't fully run out and I
think<00:02:09.520> that's<00:02:09.700> not<00:02:10.539> referring<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:10.929> these

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
think that's not referring to these

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.660 
think that's not referring to these
