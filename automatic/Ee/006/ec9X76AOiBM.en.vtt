00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.599
 welcome heart to the channel with you tony and 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.730
 this is advance rp again 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.769
 Chocolate is now talk more and 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.779
 take the most profitable work which 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:21.779
 I've been working lately like so many 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.050
 male or this work at the airport then 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:29.160
 here is a huge profit in just four 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.759
 3000 minutes you can get to meet more 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:38.480
 gost fraction and get a penny there 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.480
 existing and so now the bottom of the plane 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:49.100
 from the video plane love ours this word 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.100
 and find the fly 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.610
 flew 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.260
 very long time mark punch from 6 to i 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.610
 pressed on everything but we all tried 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.710
 it seemed very simple 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:14.409
 press just a deuce I think that 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.080
 I advise you to put and the cycle times because 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.180
 what will be very much to be before tea 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.130
 drawing otherwise you just don't be 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.470
 rings if you see on short 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:28.590
 distance do not have time to dance and return 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:31.690
 I used to advise fearing too 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.940
 all sorts of military who take the world planes 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.640
 there are hydra and just for you rocket out 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:40.360
 and at the airport there are hinged sheep 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.050
 Villa Getty Bandos will come in a glass 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.550
 diameter shoot but he was blown up 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.610
 at the airport from okay because 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:53.369
 that there is refueling and free 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.369
 fixing the plane up to a hundred is so scary 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.170
 all worth noting that not all 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.229
 it turns out to power the plane but 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.179
 passengers and bought a ticket for speed 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.599
 administrations fix it though how much 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:12.879
 they wrote them shameful guys if 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:23.410
 you want a plane over there and you just 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:24.760
 kicks goes all a couple of minutes and a half 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.630
 thousands already have our pocket 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:32.049
 and now I wanted to talk about the pros and 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:35.190
 minuses of work plane minuses 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:37.390
 I have already listed most of it in advance 2 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:42.040
 there are a few more nuances 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:45.430
 if you hit a plane or just 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.140
 blew it you won't be given any money 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.870
 if they could bring down could land there 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.079
 let's say without flapping then everything will give you 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.760
 but you won't get the money yet 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:58.569
 land smoothly and don't stop 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.569
 a portion of the plane if you blew up the plane 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.459
 or exclaimed or you just 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.440
 Substances second the Internet and you do not 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.700
 appears have everything read disappeared 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.700
 and they will not give you money 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:17.609
 now let's move on to the pros pros 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.609
 this is a huge salary in a short time 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.630
 Well, probably interesting job that is 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.819
 that's how much I have n't been bored for years 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.819
 rainy day earned about 50 to already 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.690
 that not so much money but 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:37.480
 for example, our grid needs it all 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.480
 day to sit here and I firm in 2030 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.170
 neatly put to make songs 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:00.459
 so I give the author a route now 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:05.829
 let's see how much we paid 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:19.299
 150 little ring spike it so i was killed 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:23.389
 Chamisso lively look massagers 6440 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:26.509
 pelvis at 1221 march 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:28.820
 it's pretty profitable and accurate 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:31.820
 raise money at all if you have 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.130
 8 level and professional rights and on the 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.990
