fair amount EU recommended that I use

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.799 
fair amount EU recommended that I use
the<00:00:06.480> AEK<00:00:07.140> with<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.859> sniper<00:00:08.250> scope<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:08.940> the

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
the AEK with the sniper scope and the

was a fantastic challenge and I and I
did<00:00:36.030> not<00:00:36.180> think<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.660> was<00:00:36.809> going<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.170> be<00:00:37.380> this

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
did not think it was going to be this

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.790 
did not think it was going to be this
painful<00:00:38.430> but<00:00:39.239> going<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:39.989> trying<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.500> get

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
painful but going and trying to get

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.260 
painful but going and trying to get
gameplay<00:00:41.250> for<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.579> there<00:00:41.820> were<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.149> many

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
gameplay for this there were so many

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.510 
gameplay for this there were so many
times<00:00:42.390> where<00:00:43.020> if<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.829> was<00:00:43.980> just<00:00:44.129> like<00:00:44.250> if<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.489> was

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
times where if I was just like if I was

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.209 
times where if I was just like if I was
using<00:00:44.820> any<00:00:45.210> other<00:00:45.360> setup<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.710> would<00:00:46.950> because

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
using any other setup I I would because

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.910 
using any other setup I I would because
I'd<00:00:47.340> be<00:00:47.489> victorious<00:00:48.059> but<00:00:48.570> every<00:00:49.020> single<00:00:49.500> you

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
I'd be victorious but every single you

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.680 
I'd be victorious but every single you
know<00:00:49.950> engagement<00:00:50.640> every<00:00:50.760> single<00:00:51.030> firefight<00:00:51.539> I

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
know engagement every single firefight I

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.420 
know engagement every single firefight I
felt<00:00:52.020> uncomfortable<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.829> always<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.340> always

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
felt uncomfortable I always I always

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.150 
felt uncomfortable I always I always
knew<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.629> enemy<00:00:54.989> had<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.620> advantage<00:00:56.010> no

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
knew that the enemy had the advantage no

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.209 
knew that the enemy had the advantage no
matter<00:00:56.340> if<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.699> was<00:00:56.879> medium<00:00:57.690> close<00:00:58.410> or<00:00:58.710> long

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
matter if it was medium close or long

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.099 
matter if it was medium close or long
range<00:00:59.550> if<00:00:59.820> someone<00:01:00.329> was<00:01:00.480> shooting<00:01:00.660> at<00:01:00.960> me<00:01:01.079> I

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
range if someone was shooting at me I

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.349 
range if someone was shooting at me I
probably<00:01:01.649> was<00:01:02.190> not<00:01:02.370> going<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.850> win<00:01:03.090> that

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
probably was not going to win that

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.320 
probably was not going to win that
firefight<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:05.309> knowing<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.760> every

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
firefight and just knowing that every

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.270 
firefight and just knowing that every
single<00:01:06.600> time<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.229> get<00:01:07.409> into<00:01:07.530> engagement<00:01:08.159> is

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
single time you get into engagement is

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.760 
single time you get into engagement is
not<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> very<00:01:09.180> comfortable<00:01:09.689> thing<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.590> when

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
not a very comfortable thing that when

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.740 
not a very comfortable thing that when
you're<00:01:10.890> playing<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.280> video<00:01:11.520> game<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:12.450> really

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
you're playing a video game so really

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.990 
you're playing a video game so really
the<00:01:12.990> main<00:01:13.080> reason<00:01:13.140> why<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.650> was<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.520> painful

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
the main reason why this was so painful

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.289 
the main reason why this was so painful
is<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.930> combination<00:01:16.560> between<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:17.340> recoil<00:01:18.060> of

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
is a combination between the recoil of

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.870 
is a combination between the recoil of
the<00:01:18.360> AEK<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:20.040> fact<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.490> was<00:01:20.700> only

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
the AEK and the fact that I was only

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.210 
the AEK and the fact that I was only
using<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.689> single<00:01:22.170> fire<00:01:22.380> shot<00:01:22.710> because<00:01:23.009> when

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
using the single fire shot because when

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.700 
using the single fire shot because when
you<00:01:23.430> are<00:01:23.759> using<00:01:24.090> full<00:01:24.420> auto<00:01:24.630> when<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.380> pull

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
you are using full auto when you pull

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.050 
you are using full auto when you pull
down<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.950> trigger<00:01:26.310> for<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.820> know<00:01:26.909> their

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
down the trigger for you know their

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.330 
down the trigger for you know their
quick<00:01:27.299> burst<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.170> correct<00:01:28.439> for<00:01:28.680> you

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
quick burst and then you correct for you

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.679 
quick burst and then you correct for you
know<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.490> correct<00:01:29.790> for<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.030> recoil<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.630> you

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
know you correct for the recoil so you

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.380 
know you correct for the recoil so you
can<00:01:30.900> stay<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.140> target<00:01:31.500> it's<00:01:32.310> not<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.850> bad<00:01:33.090> and

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
can stay on target it's not that bad and

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.300 
can stay on target it's not that bad and
it's<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:33.689> it's<00:01:33.900> fairly<00:01:34.200> manageable<00:01:34.740> but

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
it's it's it's fairly manageable but

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.090 
it's it's it's fairly manageable but
every<00:01:35.640> single<00:01:35.850> time<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.659> click<00:01:37.079> for<00:01:37.590> single

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
every single time you click for single

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.490 
every single time you click for single
fire<00:01:38.340> your<00:01:38.970> cursor<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.900> gonna<00:01:40.079> go<00:01:40.200> all<00:01:40.470> over

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
fire your cursor is gonna go all over

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.859 
fire your cursor is gonna go all over
the<00:01:40.950> place<00:01:41.189> your<00:01:41.579> your<00:01:41.970> scope<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.390> bouncing

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.960 
the place your your scope is bouncing
left<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.290> right<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:44.100> really<00:01:44.460> hard<00:01:44.850> to

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
left and right and it's really hard to

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.510 
left and right and it's really hard to
manage<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.950> know<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.250> makes

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
manage that and that you know it makes

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.819 
manage that and that you know it makes
sense<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.030> that's<00:01:48.090> that's<00:01:48.360> exactly<00:01:48.990> how<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
sense and that's that's exactly how the

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.740 
sense and that's that's exactly how the
rifle<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.399> going<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.820> perform<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.450> know<00:01:51.570> it's

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
rifle is going to perform you know it's

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.030 
rifle is going to perform you know it's
it's<00:01:51.960> going<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.320> bounce<00:01:52.439> everywhere<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:52.979> is

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
it's going to bounce everywhere this is

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.280 
it's going to bounce everywhere this is
a<00:01:53.159> close<00:01:53.549> encounter<00:01:53.850> weapon<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.689> it's<00:01:55.110> gonna

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
a close encounter weapon and it's gonna

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.230 
a close encounter weapon and it's gonna
it's<00:01:55.530> gonna<00:01:55.649> have<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> lot<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.219> kick<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:57.090> this

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
it's gonna have a lot of kick and this

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.450 
it's gonna have a lot of kick and this
this<00:01:57.509> isn't<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.930> case<00:01:58.140> for<00:01:58.380> weapons<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.310> are

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
this isn't the case for weapons that are

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.389 
this isn't the case for weapons that are
meant<00:01:59.969> for<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.240> long<00:02:00.420> range<00:02:00.780> like<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.380> SKS<00:02:02.100> or

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
meant for a long range like the SKS or

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.700 
meant for a long range like the SKS or
really<00:02:02.909> any<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.600> Recon<00:02:03.990> weapons<00:02:04.409> while

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
really any of the Recon weapons while

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.100 
really any of the Recon weapons while
yeah<00:02:05.130> they<00:02:05.399> there<00:02:05.909> are<00:02:06.119> they<00:02:06.299> are<00:02:06.420> single-shot

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
yeah they there are they are single-shot

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.260 
yeah they there are they are single-shot
dice<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.160> made<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.610> they<00:02:08.879> don't<00:02:09.090> have

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
dice is made it so that they don't have

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.760 
dice is made it so that they don't have
a<00:02:09.300> lot<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.660> initial<00:02:10.050> recoil<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.560> they<00:02:10.649> just

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
a lot of initial recoil and they just

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.150 
a lot of initial recoil and they just
don't<00:02:10.860> really

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
don't really

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.980 
don't really
have<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.280> lot<00:02:11.460> of<00:02:11.490> recoil<00:02:11.910> in<00:02:12.060> general<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:12.750> even

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
have a lot of recoil in general so even

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.810 
have a lot of recoil in general so even
if<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.260> are<00:02:13.440> pulling<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.830> trigger<00:02:14.100> really

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
if you are pulling the trigger really

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.790 
if you are pulling the trigger really
quickly<00:02:15.180> it's<00:02:15.750> not<00:02:15.840> going<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.410> bounce<00:02:16.590> all

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
quickly it's not going to bounce all

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.070 
quickly it's not going to bounce all
over<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.100> place<00:02:17.310> like<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.670> AEK<00:02:18.390> does<00:02:18.630> so<00:02:19.050> I

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
over the place like the AEK does so I

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.260 
over the place like the AEK does so I
kind<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.070> found<00:02:20.190> myself<00:02:20.430> in<00:02:20.910> these

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
kind of found myself in these

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.360 
kind of found myself in these
predicaments<00:02:21.810> where<00:02:22.500> if<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.770> went<00:02:22.950> for<00:02:23.100> someone

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
predicaments where if I went for someone

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.980 
predicaments where if I went for someone
at<00:02:23.580> long<00:02:24.000> range<00:02:24.360> like<00:02:24.570> you<00:02:24.690> kind<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:24.900> would

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
at long range like you kind of would

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.230 
at long range like you kind of would
think<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.380> would<00:02:25.440> with<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.340> high<00:02:26.610> optic<00:02:26.970> scope

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
think I would with the high optic scope

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.360 
think I would with the high optic scope
I<00:02:27.450> had<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.900> take<00:02:28.050> every<00:02:28.440> single<00:02:28.770> shot<00:02:28.980> very

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
I had to take every single shot very

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.310 
I had to take every single shot very
slowly<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:30.030> was<00:02:30.120> kind<00:02:30.300> of<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.450> very<00:02:30.480> slow

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
slowly it was kind of a very slow

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.620 
slowly it was kind of a very slow
methodical<00:02:31.650> tap<00:02:32.340> tap<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:33.360> trigger

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
methodical tap tap of the trigger

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.300 
methodical tap tap of the trigger
because<00:02:34.020> if<00:02:34.170> I<00:02:34.260> went<00:02:34.440> any<00:02:34.590> faster<00:02:35.040> there<00:02:35.190> was

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
because if I went any faster there was

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.040 
because if I went any faster there was
there<00:02:35.610> was<00:02:35.730> no<00:02:35.970> way<00:02:36.210> that<00:02:36.240> any<00:02:36.630> of<00:02:36.750> my<00:02:36.810> shots

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
there was no way that any of my shots

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.510 
there was no way that any of my shots
were<00:02:37.170> gonna<00:02:37.290> land<00:02:37.500> because<00:02:38.100> of<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.340> high

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
were gonna land because of the high

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.300 
were gonna land because of the high
recoil<00:02:39.030> but<00:02:39.510> then<00:02:39.630> if<00:02:39.750> someone<00:02:39.990> was<00:02:40.470> medium<00:02:41.130> to

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
recoil but then if someone was medium to

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.160 
recoil but then if someone was medium to
close<00:02:41.550> range<00:02:41.880> I<00:02:42.090> was<00:02:42.390> at<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.510> disadvantage<00:02:42.780> as

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
close range I was at a disadvantage as

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.500 
close range I was at a disadvantage as
well<00:02:43.530> because<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.010> was<00:02:44.220> using<00:02:44.490> a<00:02:44.820> high<00:02:45.060> optic

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
well because I was using a high optic

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.450 
well because I was using a high optic
scope<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.530> scope<00:02:46.770> itself<00:02:46.890> because<00:02:47.340> I'm

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
scope so the scope itself because I'm

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.980 
scope so the scope itself because I'm
zoomed<00:02:47.700> in<00:02:47.880> it's<00:02:48.090> harder<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:48.420> track<00:02:48.690> and

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
zoomed in it's harder to track and

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.050 
zoomed in it's harder to track and
because<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.770> high<00:02:49.890> recoil<00:02:50.340> my<00:02:50.640> scope<00:02:50.910> is

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
because of the high recoil my scope is

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.310 
because of the high recoil my scope is
bouncing<00:02:51.360> all<00:02:51.450> over<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.690> place<00:02:51.750> so<00:02:52.050> once

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
bouncing all over the place so once

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.070 
bouncing all over the place so once
again<00:02:52.500> it's<00:02:53.100> hard<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.550> stay<00:02:53.760> on<00:02:54.030> target<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.720> so

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
again it's hard to stay on target and so

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.750 
again it's hard to stay on target and so
it<00:02:55.200> was<00:02:55.320> just<00:02:55.410> a<00:02:55.530> combination<00:02:55.770> of<00:02:56.280> all<00:02:56.490> of

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
it was just a combination of all of

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.600 
it was just a combination of all of
those<00:02:56.910> things<00:02:57.240> that<00:02:57.870> made<00:02:58.260> this<00:02:58.830> challenging

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
those things that made this challenging

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.570 
those things that made this challenging
this<00:03:00.090> this<00:03:00.360> challenge<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:01.230> difficult<00:03:01.800> so

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
this this challenge so difficult so

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.610 
this this challenge so difficult so
really<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:02.940> didn't<00:03:03.360> have<00:03:03.540> too<00:03:03.900> much<00:03:04.140> of<00:03:04.410> a

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
really I didn't have too much of a

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.040 
really I didn't have too much of a
battle<00:03:05.010> plan<00:03:05.040> go<00:03:05.550> into<00:03:05.820> this<00:03:05.970> at<00:03:06.390> first<00:03:06.780> I

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
battle plan go into this at first I

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.590 
battle plan go into this at first I
thought<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:07.500> maybe<00:03:07.710> that<00:03:08.100> I<00:03:08.160> could<00:03:08.420> just<00:03:09.420> hit

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
thought that maybe that I could just hit

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.840 
thought that maybe that I could just hit
fire<00:03:09.840> people<00:03:10.050> down<00:03:10.350> and<00:03:10.590> use<00:03:10.740> my<00:03:10.890> fast<00:03:11.520> trigger

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
fire people down and use my fast trigger

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.180 
fire people down and use my fast trigger
finger<00:03:12.240> to<00:03:12.690> take<00:03:13.110> people<00:03:13.380> out<00:03:13.530> but<00:03:14.010> that

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
finger to take people out but that

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.530

I did get accustomed to the high optic

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.630 
I did get accustomed to the high optic
scope<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.720> rhythmically<00:03:52.680> tap<00:03:53.280> firing

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
scope and rhythmically tap firing

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.030 
scope and rhythmically tap firing
depending<00:03:54.239> on<00:03:54.390> how<00:03:54.600> far<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.230> target<00:03:55.590> was<00:03:55.770> if

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
depending on how far the target was if

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.610 
depending on how far the target was if
they're<00:03:56.190> really<00:03:56.580> far<00:03:56.820> then<00:03:57.300> just<00:03:57.780> very<00:03:58.050> slowly

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
they're really far then just very slowly

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.350 
they're really far then just very slowly
tap<00:03:59.010> firing<00:03:59.340> and<00:03:59.610> up<00:03:59.700> close<00:03:59.910> maybe<00:04:00.150> go<00:04:00.330> a

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
tap firing and up close maybe go a

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.750 
tap firing and up close maybe go a
little<00:04:00.480> bit<00:04:00.630> faster<00:04:01.020> but<00:04:01.800> in<00:04:02.070> general<00:04:02.550> this

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
little bit faster but in general this

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.580 
little bit faster but in general this
this<00:04:03.120> was<00:04:03.270> very<00:04:03.510> hard<00:04:03.690> this<00:04:03.930> was<00:04:04.140> a<00:04:04.170> great

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590
