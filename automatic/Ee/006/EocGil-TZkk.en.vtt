occur from anadi obtaining these powers

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.980 
occur from anadi obtaining these powers
now<00:01:20.950> I'm<00:01:21.220> just<00:01:21.460> assuming<00:01:21.700> that<00:01:22.090> oka<00:01:22.509> has<00:01:22.750> been

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
now I'm just assuming that oka has been

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.050 
now I'm just assuming that oka has been
a<00:01:23.080> deity<00:01:23.530> for<00:01:23.830> quite<00:01:24.100> some<00:01:24.430> time<00:01:24.460> now<00:01:24.700> and

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
a deity for quite some time now and

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.330 
a deity for quite some time now and
being<00:01:25.660> a<00:01:25.810> shrine<00:01:26.140> god<00:01:26.380> I'm<00:01:26.590> pretty<00:01:26.920> sure<00:01:27.099> she

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
being a shrine god I'm pretty sure she

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.100 
being a shrine god I'm pretty sure she
knows<00:01:27.520> what<00:01:27.580> kind<00:01:27.940> of<00:01:28.060> problems<00:01:28.599> a<00:01:28.810> middle

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
knows what kind of problems a middle

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.990 
knows what kind of problems a middle
schooler<00:01:29.380> goes<00:01:29.709> through<00:01:29.979> so<00:01:30.459> why<00:01:30.700> would<00:01:30.970> she

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
schooler goes through so why would she

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.639 
schooler goes through so why would she
think<00:01:31.300> it<00:01:31.479> was<00:01:31.599> a<00:01:31.630> good<00:01:31.899> idea<00:01:31.959> to<00:01:32.470> give<00:01:32.619> a

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
think it was a good idea to give a

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:34.589 
think it was a good idea to give a

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
find out are hard to handle not only

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:38.999 
find out are hard to handle not only
that<00:01:36.910> but<00:01:37.090> given<00:01:37.869> powers<00:01:38.319> that<00:01:38.470> affected<00:01:38.860> her

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009
