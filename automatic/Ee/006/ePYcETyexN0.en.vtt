00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 So two of these is connected It is in this parallel is that I'm a voltage equal 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.250
 Based on that 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:16.260
 I would like to think about that, and then each sound lancer for electric c 1 c 2 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:20.020
 Let's say it's cold year by year It's cold and you can save it, this is q 1 q 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:24.520
 6 and 9 1 Secret Buddhas respectively 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:27.360
 It is in the final stage 6 Toka Shisu pump multiplied by the electrical capacity and voltage 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:33.120
 The Highness is required 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:39.420
 This is actually that two capacitors are being speeded up, but now it is 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:42.840
 I think that I think that it is one of the two capacitors of the two It is actually two but this two 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.650
 I have already put together two together 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.380
 Think of it as just one capacitor 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:53.800
 Likely out 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:59.890
 Then It is a charge q, which is stored in its entirety condenser to one of the source's this 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:01.880
 A nice 1 v + Chis v making it go together if both parties 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.640
 It is not made in this kind of wind 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:11.040
 In looks and voltage v yeah it Is this 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.930
 Both are equal, so the whole is a voltage v . Even if this is considered one, the voltage is vr. 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.900
 is 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:20.120
 In Considering that way thought you this person bracts two capacitors in the wind that's one 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.120
 When the electric capacity 4 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:29.630
 This is this 9 = cv from this formula 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:34.620
 c 1 + c juice It does not stop in this form of addition 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:38.940
 I say this as synthetic capacity 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:43.470
 It is the electric capacity synthesized with high precision. 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.460
 Synthesis capacity and I'm really of two capacitors and say what it is because it is 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:51.450
 It's one 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:54.610
 That is the fact that those also combined fields cooperation NiÃ±o of the now racer when considered in the wind that 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:02:01.210
 Thinking tiff + Toka's another 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:04.320
 In the case of parallel connection, it is concluded from the conclusion that its small-scale electrical capacity 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:08.520
 It means that it should be done by adding 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:13.230
 Well this was the configuration capacity in the case of a parallel connection that say 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:19.320
 Might also important also you need that remember the Well it is I am thinking of this hole 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:24.470
 Much more important than this is the idea that in the case of parallel connection the voltages will be equal 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.470
 It is important to understand that there
