00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.150 
them it's gonna have a smaller bucket
and<00:01:31.900> take<00:01:31.960> a<00:01:32.050> little<00:01:32.229> bit<00:01:32.410> longer<00:01:32.590> to<00:01:32.800> dig<00:01:33.010> but

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
and take a little bit longer to dig but

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.219 
and take a little bit longer to dig but
still<00:01:33.490> way<00:01:33.670> faster<00:01:34.150> than<00:01:34.180> digging<00:01:34.630> it<00:01:34.810> with<00:01:34.990> a
