bottom of the bone and start carving

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.850 
bottom of the bone and start carving
underneath<00:02:59.630> at<00:03:00.630> this<00:03:00.930> point<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.380> can<00:03:01.530> kind<00:03:01.739> of

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
underneath at this point I can kind of

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.300 
underneath at this point I can kind of
release<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:02.430> just<00:03:02.640> pick<00:03:03.510> up<00:03:03.660> like<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.470> let

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
release it just pick up like so and let

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.750 
release it just pick up like so and let
gravity<00:03:05.550> do<00:03:05.910> some<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.330> work<00:03:07.580> yeah

gravity do some of the work yeah

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.970 
gravity do some of the work yeah
pretty<00:03:09.300> simple<00:03:09.750> now<00:03:10.470> we're<00:03:10.620> going<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:10.800> cut

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
pretty simple now we're going to cut

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.009 
pretty simple now we're going to cut
around<00:03:11.069> the<00:03:11.310> base<00:03:11.519> of<00:03:11.550> it<00:03:11.910> it's<00:03:12.569> sort<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:12.930> a

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
around the base of it it's sort of a

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:19.310 
around the base of it it's sort of a
little<00:03:13.260> bone<00:03:13.500> spur<00:03:13.980> like<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.400> hook<00:03:18.049> you<00:03:19.049> got<00:03:19.200> to

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
little bone spur like a hook you got to

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.560 
little bone spur like a hook you got to
cut<00:03:19.470> up<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:19.860> around<00:03:20.070> that<00:03:20.340> eventually<00:03:21.090> if

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
cut up and around that eventually if

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.479 
cut up and around that eventually if
this<00:03:21.750> animal<00:03:22.170> was<00:03:22.260> allowed<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.590> mature<00:03:22.980> all

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
this animal was allowed to mature all

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.300 
this animal was allowed to mature all
the<00:03:23.640> way<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:24.510> bone<00:03:24.780> would<00:03:25.079> form<00:03:25.380> from<00:03:25.709> here<00:03:26.070> to

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
the way the bone would form from here to

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.840 
the way the bone would form from here to
here

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
here

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.720 
here
pull<00:03:27.329> this<00:03:27.510> nipple<00:03:27.840> bone<00:03:28.250> all<00:03:29.250> right<00:03:29.400> but

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
pull this nipple bone all right but

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.530 
pull this nipple bone all right but
that's<00:03:29.940> not<00:03:30.150> there<00:03:30.420> on<00:03:30.600> this<00:03:30.720> one<00:03:30.959> younger

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
that's not there on this one younger

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.729 
that's not there on this one younger
sometimes<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:33.660> find<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.049> beginnings<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.620> it

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
sometimes you find the beginnings of it

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.789 
sometimes you find the beginnings of it
right<00:03:34.950> in<00:03:35.100> here<00:03:35.340> a<00:03:35.400> little<00:03:35.640> like<00:03:36.480> half<00:03:37.290> formed

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
right in here a little like half formed

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.660 
right in here a little like half formed
bone<00:03:38.959> once<00:03:39.959> you<00:03:40.079> get<00:03:40.200> it<00:03:40.290> boned<00:03:40.500> out<00:03:40.739> you<00:03:41.489> can

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
bone once you get it boned out you can

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.890 
bone once you get it boned out you can
take<00:03:41.820> out<00:03:42.000> this<00:03:42.320> this<00:03:43.320> blood<00:03:43.739> vessel<00:03:44.900> that

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
take out this this blood vessel that

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:53.270 
take out this this blood vessel that
runs<00:03:46.170> through<00:03:46.440> here<00:03:51.410> and<00:03:52.410> start<00:03:52.769> to<00:03:52.859> clip<00:03:53.100> off

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
runs through here and start to clip off

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.340 
runs through here and start to clip off
these<00:03:53.489> pendants<00:03:54.150> all<00:03:54.600> right<00:03:54.780> let's<00:03:54.989> review

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
these pendants all right let's review

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.190 
these pendants all right let's review
what<00:03:56.040> is<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.190> first<00:03:56.430> thing<00:03:56.609> I<00:03:56.700> did<00:03:56.930> feel<00:03:57.930> good

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
what is the first thing I did feel good

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.310 
what is the first thing I did feel good
when<00:03:58.739> you<00:03:58.859> trim<00:03:59.549> off<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.970> heavy<00:04:00.269> exterior<00:04:00.989> fat

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
when you trim off the heavy exterior fat

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.180 
when you trim off the heavy exterior fat
membrane<00:04:01.920> then<00:04:02.340> what<00:04:03.560> you<00:04:04.560> found<00:04:04.829> the<00:04:05.010> bone

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
membrane then what you found the bone

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.370 
membrane then what you found the bone
was<00:04:05.790> like<00:04:05.970> this<00:04:07.130> cuts<00:04:08.130> down<00:04:08.190> one<00:04:08.489> side<00:04:08.760> and

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
was like this cuts down one side and

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.620 
was like this cuts down one side and
down<00:04:10.380> the<00:04:10.440> other<00:04:10.620> and<00:04:11.120> we<00:04:12.120> lift<00:04:12.329> it<00:04:12.450> up

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
down the other and we lift it up

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.410 
down the other and we lift it up
underneath<00:04:13.290> around<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:14.370> base<00:04:14.609> try<00:04:15.090> to<00:04:15.150> get<00:04:15.299> as

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
underneath around the base try to get as

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.039 
underneath around the base try to get as
much<00:04:15.540> meat<00:04:15.780> up<00:04:15.930> as<00:04:16.109> possible<00:04:17.539> all<00:04:18.539> right<00:04:18.599> so

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
much meat up as possible all right so

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.270 
much meat up as possible all right so
get<00:04:19.289> it<00:04:19.409> to<00:04:19.530> this<00:04:19.620> point<00:04:19.859> then<00:04:20.039> we'll<00:04:20.130> talk

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
get it to this point then we'll talk

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.459 
get it to this point then we'll talk
about
