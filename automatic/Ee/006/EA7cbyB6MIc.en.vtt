00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.980
 and then people connected here on the good channel 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.289
 Cheap Good Supplements Today As You 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.560
 combine that I'll bring a video of this 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.779
 product here is the top 3w volley of the 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.510
 max titanic mark one is being very 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.300
 spoken and now due to reports that 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.269
 left the idol of felix bonfim too 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.189
 They went out on Facebook and several 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.380
 pages on facebook also brought 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.190
 enamels and I could not fail to bring 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.010
 this is right here 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.600
 first of all this was a mistake not 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.450
 I was supposed to be with this product here 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.190
 I had asked the other and the mismanagement 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.500
 that is the total is only mine and I will not 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.239
 leave his picture here for you and 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.430
 company that I bought that I will not 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.210
 speak the name maybe say later leave the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.820
 name 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.789
 She sent me this wiki, I just did not 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.199
 I complained because if here is better 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.059
 than the one I was going to 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.550
 buy because if it were the opposite it is 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.899
 Of course I would complain but how 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.820
 a quality I 'm not being 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.490
 dishonest because even the process of 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.110
 give back to them that they send or 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.490
 take a month or more 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.369
 That's when I can not stay this time. 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.770
 without the wii so what are the 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:21.150
 positive points of his and first 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.220
 here is 32 grams of protein 5,8 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.740
 grammes of bcaa and this information 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.409
 really proceed because of the award that 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.150
 I'm going to show you here. 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.100
 I know it would be the same to do my 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.110
 side but only that it does not have conditions 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.619
 none to do it for every time 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.540
 that I bring here so I'll bring the 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.329
 other information for you later 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.030
 you see a lounge 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:46.079
 You can come here with the name, but I will. 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.979
 tell you 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.350
 it has 32 grams of protein 2.7 grams 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.920
 of total fat from saturated fats 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.549
 1.1 grams has an amount up to 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.649
 little high fat but okay I 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.630
 I think it does not interfere so much if a 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.700
 person is gaining want to gain weight 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.900
 if you do not want to lose 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.850
 weight gain 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.460
 no gram of fat so bought 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.100
 isolated, that's where the isolate already brings me. 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.990
 for another matter here the shaft calls 3w 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.690
 But what does it mean 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.900
 this w is the abbreviation of law that is 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.930
 here what happened and 3 w 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.660
 he of course has three kinds of oe law 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.760
 concentrate was isolated thousand hydrometers 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.130
 aside from the difference I'm going to speak 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.500
 here very succinct of the mind because I 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.060
 Never spent this video here to talk 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.340
 technical details to heat up and 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.920
 any search site you think was 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.760
 concentrate would be basically the one that 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.950
 has about 80% 80% protein in its 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.380
 composition the defendant would be fat and lactose 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.260
 also has a little carbohydrate in this 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.860
 composition was isolated would be the 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.020
 It has 90% more of its its 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.600
 composition made of protein the rest is 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.040
 lactose and the hydrolyzate 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.110
 The most difficult to explain 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.200
 It is formed by petit says that they are 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.840
 chains of amino acids that form 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.880
 Protein chains and chains make 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.130
 that their absorption is faster 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.090
 but also has a level of fat and 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.310
 lactose 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.900
 So for you who wants to lose weight, no 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.730
 want to gain no fat 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.860
 the most recommended for you to be buy 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.510
 only isolated but start having the 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.420
 three guys, I think it's a very 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.880
 Well, they did a mix and it worked. 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.800
 because the absorption of it is fast it 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.480
 also good quality and now 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.280
 talk too much about the positives and before 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.769
 I forgot to mention here I am 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.940
 came with sorry excuse that 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.070
 delayed 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.110
 you can see is not said how much the scup 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.269
 there is more only that it is possible to deduce 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.610
 I'm talking about the position and 40 grams 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:51.000
 two meters then each meter has 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.860
 20 grams of the iac of this protein 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.410
 That's why it has to do with the excuse 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.420
 I said I'm in the video, I'm going to repeat everything. 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.549
 the supplement has to come with sculpt 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.769
 to take the right measure for a 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.720
 supplement that does not exist or is 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.510
 taking sculptures of supplement they find 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.549
 that 20 grams of itself is 20 grams and another 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.280
 this is not a difference in intensity 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:15.269
 volume of the ir powders has these 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.250
 differences there, the taste of it is good and good 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.900
 I have to tell you what happened to me. 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.910
 tava without hardly'm here is 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.400
 drinking sugar I need the 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.860
 peak insulin after training is 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.320
 taking this together with the sugar and 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.199
 I liked it a lot but very good 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.660
 only when you drink without sugar with nothing 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:35.910
 a normal or medium taste still remains 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:40.169
 more to where you want natural flavor 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:42.960
 Vanilla I think its pretty good not 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.600
 flavor of vanilla does not taste is vitamin 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.350
 did not even know 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:52.190
 So it 's good, I've already had the taste. 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.350
 good fruit vitamin so taste is good 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:58.169
 find out now in the video then more 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:01.949
 positive points of this week the resignation 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.389
 his is good is more or less let's say 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:04.949
 not good or bad 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.660
 Depends on it so it seems to me that it has 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:09.270
 Will own times you mix in 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.150
 time to read he usually dilute the 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:15.000
 Sometimes it's a bit like a 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.340
 so layer with foam and various parts 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.590
 If you take some dust, wei said. 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.580
 then dilution is not so good but also 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.650
 it's not so bad 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.630
 This is what I wanted to recommend a lot 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.520
 for you guys, because one is good just remembering 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.139
 that 's a titan does not patronize me 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.240
 pays nothing to talk about supplements 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:33.000
 only when it is of high quality 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.310
 When you are in the market, there is good 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.300
 Brazilian quality on top I 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.979
 I think we have to emphasize 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.510
 mainly in that the channel 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:43.169
 but now I have to talk about the price 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:44.970
 nor the price of it is 86 90 is not a price 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:47.760
 very cheap and if I'm not mistaken or in 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.800
 more expensive than you already had here on the canal 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.720
 so you can see the level of the channel is 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.150
 good and inexpensive supplements will get your 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.280
 cheap thing same layout and more expensive 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.389
 that has in the channel but only who is going 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.130
 have quality 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:01.560
 I do not know if you are willing to 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.940
 pay that price if they are has several 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.680
 birigui landmarks 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.270
 in the channel you can see that I have 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.460
 the one that has almost the same quality 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.740
 from here and also with a very 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.810
 more then it's worth it if you 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.310
 you are 90 reais and eighty-six 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.280
 to make this investment case 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.479
 otherwise they have another one right 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.370
 so this was the video I wanted 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:22.169
 bring you the ones you wanted to talk to 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.940
 you be with god I'm sorry for the 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:24.490
 that's where I'm recording the 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.949
 night 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.690
 too bad it was but it's when 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:32.009
 Speak for yourself, by God, thanks. 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.009
 said that win everybody
