00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:17.260 
the training side of it being a little

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.960 
the training side of it being a little
bit<00:00:17.350> smaller<00:00:17.620> in<00:00:17.800> stature<00:00:17.950> I<00:00:18.400> was<00:00:18.670> always

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
bit smaller in stature I was always

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.120 
bit smaller in stature I was always
looking<00:00:19.090> for<00:00:19.450> a<00:00:19.480> way<00:00:19.539> to<00:00:19.720> try<00:00:20.230> and<00:00:20.410> you<00:00:20.770> know<00:00:20.890> be

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
looking for a way to try and you know be

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.550 
looking for a way to try and you know be
a<00:00:21.160> little<00:00:21.430> bit<00:00:21.550> stronger<00:00:21.880> a<00:00:22.030> little<00:00:22.240> quicker

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
a little bit stronger a little quicker

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.210 
a little bit stronger a little quicker
than<00:00:23.560> the<00:00:23.740> next<00:00:23.980> guy<00:00:24.160> as<00:00:24.610> I<00:00:24.880> grew<00:00:25.480> up<00:00:25.510> and<00:00:26.220> took

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
than the next guy as I grew up and took

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.279 
than the next guy as I grew up and took
courses<00:00:27.580> and<00:00:27.910> so<00:00:28.060> on<00:00:28.180> it<00:00:28.300> really<00:00:28.600> piqued<00:00:29.230> my

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
courses and so on it really piqued my

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:30.689 
courses and so on it really piqued my
interest<00:00:29.380> as<00:00:29.920> to<00:00:29.949> how<00:00:30.160> you<00:00:30.220> could<00:00:30.520> get

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
interest as to how you could get

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.339 
interest as to how you could get
somebody<00:00:31.449> who's<00:00:31.600> at<00:00:31.779> the<00:00:31.869> top<00:00:32.050> of<00:00:32.199> their<00:00:32.319> game

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
somebody who's at the top of their game

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.840 
somebody who's at the top of their game
to<00:00:32.769> be<00:00:32.859> a<00:00:32.890> little<00:00:33.129> bit<00:00:33.280> better

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
to be a little bit better

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.110 
to be a little bit better
geology<00:00:34.719> is<00:00:34.839> the<00:00:34.870> study<00:00:34.989> of<00:00:35.350> human<00:00:35.890> movement

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
geology is the study of human movement

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.979 
geology is the study of human movement
essentially<00:00:37.120> but<00:00:37.300> there's<00:00:37.569> a<00:00:37.659> lot<00:00:37.839> of

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
essentially but there's a lot of

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.169 
essentially but there's a lot of
different<00:00:38.319> streams<00:00:38.859> you<00:00:39.069> can<00:00:39.249> go<00:00:39.429> through<00:00:39.760> you

00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:40.179 
different streams you can go through you

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:43.049 
different streams you can go through you
can<00:00:40.210> go<00:00:40.479> through<00:00:41.550> biomechanics<00:00:42.550> of<00:00:42.670> courses

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
can go through biomechanics of courses

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:44.939 
can go through biomechanics of courses
is<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.239> thing<00:00:43.600> that<00:00:43.629> really<00:00:44.229> separates<00:00:44.739> the

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
is the thing that really separates the

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:46.889 
is the thing that really separates the
degree<00:00:45.219> from<00:00:45.429> other<00:00:45.579> degrees<00:00:45.969> but<00:00:46.149> for<00:00:46.420> me<00:00:46.600> I

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
degree from other degrees but for me I

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.200 
degree from other degrees but for me I
think<00:00:47.260> I<00:00:47.589> chose<00:00:47.859> it<00:00:48.129> mainly<00:00:48.489> because<00:00:48.819> it<00:00:49.179> was

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
think I chose it mainly because it was

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.840 
think I chose it mainly because it was
very<00:00:49.539> functional<00:00:50.139> it<00:00:50.530> covered<00:00:51.069> the<00:00:51.609> things

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
very functional it covered the things

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.579 
very functional it covered the things
that<00:00:52.030> I<00:00:52.059> wanted<00:00:52.420> to<00:00:52.539> cover<00:00:52.690> functional

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
that I wanted to cover functional

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.389 
that I wanted to cover functional

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
the players at this level put in a lot

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.980 
the players at this level put in a lot
of<00:01:38.619> work<00:01:38.859> and<00:01:39.100> when<00:01:39.880> they<00:01:40.060> start<00:01:40.420> seeing<00:01:40.719> the

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
of work and when they start seeing the

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.410 
of work and when they start seeing the
benefit<00:01:41.409> of<00:01:41.439> it<00:01:41.649> and<00:01:41.799> they<00:01:42.520> start<00:01:42.850> using<00:01:43.119> it<00:01:43.329> on

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
benefit of it and they start using it on

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.179 
benefit of it and they start using it on
the<00:01:43.539> ice<00:01:43.689> and<00:01:43.960> there's<00:01:44.079> score<00:01:44.320> more<00:01:44.530> goals<00:01:44.560> and

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
the ice and there's score more goals and

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:46.499 
the ice and there's score more goals and
they're<00:01:45.310> coming<00:01:45.609> to<00:01:45.700> me<00:01:45.820> after<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.179> game<00:01:46.210> and

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
saying hey what we've been working on is

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.340

working it's very gratifying and we all

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.899 
working it's very gratifying and we all
want<00:01:50.560> to<00:01:50.679> win<00:01:50.979> a<00:01:51.009> Stanley<00:01:51.249> Cup<00:01:51.460> here<00:01:51.850> in

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
want to win a Stanley Cup here in

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.819 
want to win a Stanley Cup here in
Vancouver<00:01:52.359> and<00:01:52.420> I<00:01:52.479> think<00:01:52.719> every<00:01:53.439> one<00:01:53.469> of<00:01:53.710> us

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
Vancouver and I think every one of us

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:55.289 
Vancouver and I think every one of us
the<00:01:53.979> coaching<00:01:54.369> staff<00:01:54.609> trainers<00:01:55.060> are<00:01:55.210> all

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
the coaching staff trainers are all

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.359 
the coaching staff trainers are all
playing<00:01:55.570> a<00:01:55.659> part<00:01:55.929> and<00:01:56.200> I<00:01:56.439> think<00:01:56.979> that's<00:01:57.159> our

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
playing a part and I think that's our

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.050 
playing a part and I think that's our
way<00:01:57.759> of<00:01:57.909> doing<00:01:58.149> that

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
way of doing that

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.180 
way of doing that
for<00:02:00.060> any<00:02:00.350> occupation<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.830> know<00:02:01.950> you're

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
for any occupation you know you're

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.100 
for any occupation you know you're
always<00:02:02.369> looking<00:02:02.580> to<00:02:03.060> get<00:02:03.360> better<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.900> from

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
always looking to get better and from

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.170 
always looking to get better and from
our<00:02:04.290> our<00:02:04.590> standpoint<00:02:05.040> we're<00:02:05.460> we're<00:02:06.090> an

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
our our standpoint we're we're an

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.330 
our our standpoint we're we're an
interesting<00:02:06.659> combination<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.350> science<00:02:07.979> as

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
interesting combination of science as

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.330 
interesting combination of science as
well<00:02:08.550> as<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:09.179> practical<00:02:09.690> approach<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.440> for<00:02:11.250> us

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
well as a practical approach and for us

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.820 
well as a practical approach and for us
we<00:02:11.610> need<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.970> stay<00:02:12.209> on<00:02:12.240> top<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.930> every<00:02:13.680> little

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
we need to stay on top of every little

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.680 
we need to stay on top of every little
thing<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.250> we<00:02:14.370> can<00:02:14.520> do<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.940> make<00:02:15.390> players

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
thing that we can do to make players

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.590 
thing that we can do to make players
better<00:02:16.050> so<00:02:16.380> not<00:02:17.100> only<00:02:17.459> are<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.300> players

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
better so not only are the players

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.120 
better so not only are the players
changing<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.260> getting<00:02:19.380> bigger<00:02:19.770> stronger

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
changing and getting bigger stronger

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.970 
changing and getting bigger stronger
faster<00:02:20.550> etc<00:02:20.850> but<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.870> game<00:02:22.080> is<00:02:22.260> changing<00:02:22.739> it's

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
faster etc but the game is changing it's

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:23.900 
faster etc but the game is changing it's
getting<00:02:23.340> faster

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
getting faster

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.729 
getting faster
technology's<00:02:24.480> getting<00:02:24.780> faster<00:02:25.170> skates<00:02:25.590> are

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
technology's getting faster skates are

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.210 
technology's getting faster skates are
getting<00:02:25.980> stiffer<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.910> know<00:02:27.030> six<00:02:27.420> are<00:02:27.569> getting

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
getting stiffer you know six are getting

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.770 
getting stiffer you know six are getting
faster<00:02:29.220> all<00:02:29.459> these<00:02:29.670> types<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.120> items<00:02:30.270> are

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
faster all these types of items are

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.199 
faster all these types of items are
happening<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:31.470> us<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.800> we<00:02:32.160> if<00:02:32.400> we<00:02:32.640> continue<00:02:33.090> to

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
happening to us and we if we continue to

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.240 
happening to us and we if we continue to
Train<00:02:33.510> guys<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.900> same<00:02:34.140> way<00:02:34.410> we're<00:02:34.860> not<00:02:35.040> good

Train guys the same way we're not good

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.910 
Train guys the same way we're not good
