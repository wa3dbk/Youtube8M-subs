00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 snow in winter for some people that means 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.269
 snowmobiling for the 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.410
 others get up early 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.360
 sprinkle snow shovels of salt 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.109
 because when it's snowing the must 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.170
 winter service for safe roads 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:20.400
 then the winter service is on the way 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.080
 the winter service is always then 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.880
 on the road when there is something to do and 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.720
 which can be very different in 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.200
 Last year we had very many 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.120
 was inserts for snow if we have 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.510
 almost no snowfall so far 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.879
 had our inserts were 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.340
 for the most part combat 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.170
 are designed by since the middle of november 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.440
 prepared with ours 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.500
 the service is the currents 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.949
 Of course we are well filled 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.870
 of course with the beginning of the readiness 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.359
 or winter readiness with the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.449
 november we are with riesel 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.700
 of course, people also salt how much 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.119
 you have bought exactly there material 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.310
 and how many vehicles are in use 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.080
 when you buy there is a movie with 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.200
 90 tons and a second we have 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.509
 we should also have 240 tons of salt 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.610
 have a player with about 400 tons 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.250
 split so we can already do one 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.430
 nice rod so time to serve you 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.250
 but also the alarm plan 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.820
 How exactly does he look like is the alarm 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.100
 plan provides that the on-duty 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.619
 employment manager with a weather service in 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.600
 contact is that he himself 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.680
 convinced everything can 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.860
 the weather services also not 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.320
 predict 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.570
 For example, a typical topic for us 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.590
 is the industry snow we are today 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:58.920
 not today but already had 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:02.619
 and then sends via sms the 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.320
 inserts out what to do exactly 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.690
 the corresponding staff members serve 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.640
 Parents in the alarm plan play a role 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:15.070
 How many men are in action 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:18.010
 ready in the emergency now 33 outside the 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.170
 serving time within the service time 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.170
 we can get on a bit more 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.630
 but not very much 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.880
 a lot because we have certain things to do 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.390
 have such as the garbage collection 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.900
 or the channel service must be his 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.910
 maintenance work on the collar and so on 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.980
 he can still continue to do so 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.959
 how much does winter service cost? 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:47.800
 cut in average a normal year 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:51.250
 costs about 200,000 euros if you like that 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.840
 something like the year before, you have to go with it 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.680
 twice to triple the amount 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.140
 count 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.010
 the costs are also partly due 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:03.180
 of course from which time of the 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.360
 winter is actually taking place now 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.040
 Sunday night is of course 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.500
 Staffing to see differently than when 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.239
 that happens during the service time 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.670
 winter is pretty much on its own now 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.739
 customers have been waiting for them a lot 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.540
 reduce 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:23.200
 Of course you have to count on us that way 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.690
 november to the end of december two small ones 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.549
 So missions had that's natural 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.079
 a lot of saving 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.730
 material and then of course 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.290
 overtime and you do not 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.579
 you have to forget the splash too 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.069
 Dismantle and dispose of again 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.900
 It also costs money when we have time 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:43.209
 sprinkled and when we use silica 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:47.269
 Scattered salt around gravel people scatter 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:50.480
 is that comes is coming comes from 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.889
 Commander of the command what scattered 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.060
 it will depend on how the 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:04:00.319
 Road conditions are at snowfall 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:03.469
 is usually trickle scatter 1 or 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.299
 Smoothness or smoothness is on the 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:06.980
 There is salt dispersion 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.819
 specific weather report on the you 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.699
 trust 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:13.340
 Of course we have weather reports 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:14.870
 of course internet and it is 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.579
 just does not stop the status of 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.989
 Deputy then gets up early 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.940
 when everyone is still sleeping and getting up 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.070
 of course a picture of it makes on the spot 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.900
 that is, at 2 o'clock in the morning 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.940
 get up to look like it actually does 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.940
 then look on the spot 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.700
 Of course it depends on the amount of rain 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.050
 and we have 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:36.730
 nor was it out there lying around in the 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.920
 landscape and 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.580
 but that does not have to be enough 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.150
 and if it is that devices 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.660
 then we will come, of course 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:50.350
 drive out and the whole Schwechat again 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.350
