00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
on and most of the time the balance of

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.080

right and I think they've got just the

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.639 
right and I think they've got just the
right<00:01:20.319> balance<00:01:20.499> because<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.179> UI<00:01:22.179> is<00:01:22.359> a<00:01:23.109> stream

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
right balance because the UI is a stream

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.580 
right balance because the UI is a stream
