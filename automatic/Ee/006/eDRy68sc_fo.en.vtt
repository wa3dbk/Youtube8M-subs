00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
2 is back i found myself absolutely

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.840 
2 is back i found myself absolutely
destroying<00:02:16.800> enemy<00:02:17.400> lines<00:02:17.700> with<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.630> ump45

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
destroying enemy lines with the ump45

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.420 
destroying enemy lines with the ump45
with<00:02:20.850> suppressor<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:21.960> rapid<00:02:22.530> fire<00:02:22.770> as<00:02:23.070> well

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
with suppressor and rapid fire as well

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.630 
with suppressor and rapid fire as well
as<00:02:23.640> with<00:02:23.940> only<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.480> suppressor<00:02:25.080> I<00:02:25.460> would<00:02:26.460> say

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
as with only the suppressor I would say

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.690 
as with only the suppressor I would say
this<00:02:26.790> gun<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.090> more<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:28.220> short<00:02:29.220> ranged

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
this gun is more of a short ranged

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.870 
this gun is more of a short ranged
medium<00:02:30.120> rain<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.600> gun<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:32.160> that's<00:02:32.430> where<00:02:32.730> it

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
medium rain to gun so that's where it

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.920 
medium rain to gun so that's where it
excels<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.690> would<00:02:34.350> also<00:02:34.590> say<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.100> ump45<00:02:35.930> ties

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
excels I would also say the ump45 ties

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.690 
excels I would also say the ump45 ties
in<00:02:37.230> close<00:02:37.500> with<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.920> mp7<00:02:38.540> after<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.690> patch<00:02:39.960> I

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
in close with the mp7 after the patch I

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.360 
in close with the mp7 after the patch I
will<00:02:41.700> definitely<00:02:41.910> be<00:02:42.270> using<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.870> ump45<00:02:43.500> more

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
will definitely be using the ump45 more

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.420 
will definitely be using the ump45 more

until<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.460> patch<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:50.820> course<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.750> mp5<00:02:52.290> was

given a higher fire rate in this patch I

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.410
