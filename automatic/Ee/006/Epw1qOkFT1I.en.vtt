00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.929 
big question for the shape platform will
be<00:01:52.200> whether<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.710> can<00:01:52.860> compete<00:01:53.250> with<00:01:53.310> sonos

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
be whether it can compete with sonos

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.940 
be whether it can compete with sonos
which<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.390> more<00:01:54.659> mature<00:01:54.899> platform<00:01:55.710> with

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
which is a more mature platform with

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.039 
which is a more mature platform with
similar<00:01:56.369> pricing<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.390> we're<00:01:57.540> looking<00:01:57.780> forward

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
similar pricing so we're looking forward

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.690 
similar pricing so we're looking forward
