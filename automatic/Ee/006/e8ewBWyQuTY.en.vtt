that Darwin had a real problem with

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.120 
that Darwin had a real problem with
peacock<00:00:05.520> in<00:00:06.480> fact<00:00:06.810> he<00:00:06.990> once<00:00:07.200> said<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.859> sight

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
of a peacock makes me sick because he

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.100 
of a peacock makes me sick because he
really<00:00:11.190> didn't<00:00:11.429> understand<00:00:11.910> how<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:12.960> could

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.670 

an<00:00:17.830> extreme<00:00:18.370> reaction<00:00:18.550> perhaps<00:00:19.320> but<00:00:20.320> it<00:00:20.470> is

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
an extreme reaction perhaps but it is

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.950 
an extreme reaction perhaps but it is
hard<00:00:21.010> to<00:00:21.100> see<00:00:21.340> a<00:00:21.370> peacocks<00:00:21.910> tail<00:00:22.060> as<00:00:22.510> something

away from a predator it took him several

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:51.900 
away from a predator it took him several
decades<00:00:50.320> to<00:00:50.500> think<00:00:50.800> of<00:00:50.920> it<00:00:51.040> but<00:00:51.220> eventually<00:00:51.460> he

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
decades to think of it but eventually he

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.340 
decades to think of it but eventually he
happened<00:00:52.300> upon<00:00:52.480> the<00:00:52.660> idea<00:00:52.899> of<00:00:53.020> sexual
