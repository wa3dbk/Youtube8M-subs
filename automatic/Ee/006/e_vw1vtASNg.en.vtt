00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.210
 then bag 5 is to be assembled 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:16.710
 just a piece of the ditch wall e 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.500
 the entrance stairs but there are gods 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.920
 link mechanisms that only 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.990
 as by now practice for castles from 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.070
 part from the other 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.070
 so when you go to 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.769
 mount semi smario then we leave 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.410
 that of these are the stairs that you 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.579
 can just connect let's see if 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:42.600
 one-handed disc 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:48.690
 the always very busy we support 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.780
 because otherwise I ca n't show one 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.090
 camera 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:58.300
 here is culture taken away the sun is there 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:00.769
 also the thunder that arrives in time 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.870
 we can turn all married 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.239
 support because otherwise it must be prevented with the 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.540
 hand I can not hello with the two 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:14.479
 it becomes difficult here wanting we can 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:17.090
 there is no more or less to open the ladder 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.460
 little skull I prefer the 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.830
 they release closed as they are the cai that 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.600
 they were in bag 5 with the faith and the 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.020
 sword 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.590
 the shield and if I remember correctly 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.899
 turning it is mounted on the left side 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.319
 because then there are two if I'm not mistaken i 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:40.520
 pieces and going to connect assures 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:43.100
 still let's see sorry site support 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.700
 very easily then there is the piece of 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.619
 function that this three for one that goes 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:55.000
 positioned quality to go to 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:59.920
 connect this is the first we said 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:04.610
 I believe it could be the entrance 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.380
 up to turning a first part of the wall 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.899
 on the left hand side there should be 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.600
 another think similar and the scale 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.019
 relative to the wind some routes 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.019
 tomorrow 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.250
 nothing proceed we started to open the 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.780
 package what we arrived said 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:30.370
 5th package stupid was package 3 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.370
 how it obliges package 4 which is here 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.870
 let's see for a moment what we find that 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.570
 I think it will be the part of here or liter way 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.560
 immediate on the instructions indeed 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:47.230
 this scale should be two others 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.590
 Unique magnificent art characters 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:55.120
 and aragon and the still piece of wall ad 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:58.000
 to be symmetrical what not 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.400
 I can understand so many times 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.390
 instructions that for strength are four 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.610
 volumes to see for example here 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.240
 but there are many, for example, far 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.090
 note that I have to put a piece is a 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.770
 piece ie you are directly here not 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.750
 there is 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.340
 at the end some volumes come out that more than 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.070
 another collector I say in the sense 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:25.170
 which then eventually accumulate boxes 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:30.550
 accumulate pieces all need space 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:34.200
 need more rooms oh well let's go with the 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.200
 package 48 later
