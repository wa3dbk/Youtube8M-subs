Scott it took me almost I want to say
about<00:01:36.130> a<00:01:36.280> year<00:01:36.580> and<00:01:36.640> a<00:01:36.700> half<00:01:36.760> I'm<00:01:37.720> for<00:01:38.080> it<00:01:38.110> to

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
about a year and a half I'm for it to

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.920 
about a year and a half I'm for it to
get<00:01:38.470> to<00:01:38.650> the<00:01:38.740> point<00:01:38.950> where<00:01:39.250> it<00:01:39.910> felt<00:01:40.390> right<00:01:41.610> and

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
get to the point where it felt right and

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.270 
get to the point where it felt right and
and<00:01:43.930> I<00:01:44.170> know<00:01:44.260> that<00:01:44.530> there<00:01:44.680> are<00:01:44.740> times<00:01:45.070> in

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
and I know that there are times in

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.160 
and I know that there are times in
situations<00:01:45.910> where<00:01:46.060> if<00:01:46.150> I<00:01:46.240> don't<00:01:46.270> stay<00:01:46.720> on<00:01:46.900> top

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
situations where if I don't stay on top

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.050 
situations where if I don't stay on top
of<00:01:47.200> it<00:01:47.410> as<00:01:47.590> far<00:01:47.830> as<00:01:47.920> how<00:01:48.100> I<00:01:48.130> work<00:01:48.490> out<00:01:48.670> and<00:01:48.880> take

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
of it as far as how I work out and take

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.710 
of it as far as how I work out and take
care<00:01:49.270> of<00:01:49.420> it<00:01:49.680> it'll<00:01:50.680> get<00:01:50.860> weaker<00:01:51.340> faster<00:01:52.180> but

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
care of it it'll get weaker faster but

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.240 
care of it it'll get weaker faster but
with<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:52.930> combination<00:01:53.230> of<00:01:53.590> how<00:01:53.800> I've<00:01:54.070> begun

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
with the combination of how I've begun

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.220 
with the combination of how I've begun
to<00:01:54.430> work<00:01:54.670> out<00:01:54.940> and<00:01:55.180> keep<00:01:55.390> my<00:01:55.540> body<00:01:55.750> in<00:01:55.900> shape

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
to work out and keep my body in shape

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.140
