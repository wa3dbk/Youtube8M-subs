00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.070
 again in the first place I wanted to give the 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.950
 thanks to prieto because it has been commissioned 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.660
 of this channel and it will surely follow 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.289
 doing because right now so good 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.230
 work issues many hours and 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.329
 When one comes home one takes a 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.429
 cappuccino as in the ad has no 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.159
 you want nothing the only thing I do is have dinner

 or eat at the time and I go to bed 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:33.030
 so I'm not aware of the channel 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.440
 but the project is this is being 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.070
 commissioning and really many 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.460
 thank you and well let's hope that we

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.949
 you will not see me as much as normal 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.879
 today is the moment of the news that is a 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.010
 genius 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.559
 genius in every rule and that is that 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.600
 star the proton-m rocket with the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.710
 Russian communications satellite more 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.109
 powerful is to say that you have to 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.379
 my crush of saying good to say 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.510
 that again the proton-m carrier rocket 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.930
 of the Russian communications satellite 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.560
 a 4 r was launched from the space 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.320
 located in the territory of kazakhstan 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.950
 the Russian space agency roscosmos prat 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.960
 in second Roscosmos reported that 540 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.360
 seconds after the launch it 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.040
 produced a shutdown of the engines the 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.440
 agency ria-nÃ³vosti reported that the 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.370
 rocket fell out of the territory of 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.170
 kazakhstan that happened this rocket then 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.910
 had the objective of putting into orbit the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.670
 Russian communications satellite more 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.620
 powerful more powerful and it has fallen so little 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.680
 after its release from the 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.240
 Baikonur cosmodrome the authorities of 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.130
 the space industry decided 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.670
 suspend all launches of 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.229
 proton type rockets from baikonur up 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.320
 that the causes of this are determined 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.290
 accident was planned that the express am4 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.450
 r will provide coverage of 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.850
 sustainable communication for all 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.060
 territory of Russia and the countries of 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.610
 community of independent states cei 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.130
 so good has been a genius or genius 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.620
 pretty good so I do not expect anything 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.239
 I have concerned is 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.790
