00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 welcome to another and friends today jay 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.819
 lice 'pokemon' and vo on today 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.220
 I bring you another one of these events that 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.170
 several people love to see 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.030
 of these events that are around 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.460
 everyone inside pokemon more 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.740
 specifically as always within 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.330
 Japan friends and good today 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.160
 I bring another event which is an event 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.380
 quite interesting already has a couple of 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.930
 days of leaving which was a 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.150
 event in which they dealt to be scoundrels 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.769
 with the hidden skill he replied that 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.720
 for the moment it was the only legal form 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.820
 to get it but do not worry 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.430
 friends you surely avoid taking to the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.290
 gts and look for some snide and most 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.059
 probable is that it is said hidden ability 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.219
 so have the skill hidden like this 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.440
 that the safest thing in the world is that 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.730
 it is exaggeratedly easy to get that 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.890
 is nobody with the ability to hide 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.440
 he replied that it works quite well 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.910
 a pretty competitive Pokémon but 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.230
 well you know, friends, let's talk to 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.500
 the dealer to see what exactly 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.840
 what tells us this should be good 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.120
 josefa I received a mysterious gift 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.160
 for you here you have and now we receive a 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.439
 be but which I will show next 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.050
 so we can see exactly how it comes 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.000
 what attacks brings 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.480
 if between some object like us what 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.610
 they handle my voice, well, the superior 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.260
 you can see that it is at level 50 it came out 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.840
 male so I guess he can go out 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.000
 completely random you can see that 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.770
 brings the movements 9 leaves which is the 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.960
 most indispensable movement for 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.520
 strategy of being superior since this 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.230
 Pokemon instead of downloading the attack 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.780
 special thanks to the hidden ability 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.210
 you start to search and I answer what 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.280
 What it does is reverse the characteristics 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.710
 you can also see that curiously what 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.350
 they handle what is clemency this 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.750
 movement that what it does is a false 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.400
 smack so to speak since it 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.230
 it takes life away from the rival but it's always going to 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.270
 stay with a ps so it does not matter that 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.130
 the rival has two fish if we use 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.350
 clemency will be left with a ps 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.900
 You can also see that 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.450
 It brings squeeze and this says is yours with 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.610
 strength the goal the more pst in the 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.830
 target more strength will have the attack well 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.360
 that more pst in the pokemon then 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.190
 can see what more harm we will do 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.040
 You can also see how I have finally 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.140
 won that curiously this if I do not 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.820
 I learned it wrong by level or something 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.100
 well but he's also a movement tutor 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.540
 so they handle it with 2 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.220
 while quite good which they 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.490
 it rains leaf follow drained that are 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.050
 indispensable for this pokemon ok here 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.790
 can see that the skill is responsive 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.280
 comes with the respective one because goal of 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.590
 event that is the red one you can see that 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.600
 comes to level 50 nature 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.240
 completely to the random the most 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.890
 sure and I think it would be everything but 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.810
 you know friends, we're going to show it to 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.140
 this pokemon in combats and that any 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.520
 instantly we welcome back 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.620
 friends well then let's try that 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.180
 this time be periods and make me 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.820
 case because remember that all 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.490
 pokémon that I show never pay attention to me 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:53.240
 let's see if this one to be but isolated 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.160
 the exception and want to attack does not appear 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.710
 that does not seem like they never want to make me 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.590
 case the event pokemon that I bring 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.640
 here the channel now falls asleep now it 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.640
 sleeps worse 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.690
 ok you know how the coast goes 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.790
 to try to attack until you decide 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.319
 attack being worse but not 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.480
 exactly what is the pronunciation 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.910
 correct 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.250
 but the point is that you understand me not 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.320
 in if the event is quite good 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.360
 mainly that is the only way 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.040
 legal to get this pokemon with 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.900
 the hidden ability can see that the 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.440
 pokemon here served me quite what 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.050
 did because now that I use 9 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.760
 God caused shot delay I started to 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.200
 lower me the speed that is what it does 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.840
 the movement increased my speed 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.060
 thanks to the skill he responded so 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.500
 it was perfect that he fell asleep because 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.270
 At least I could show how it is that 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.280
 the hidden ability of this works 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.870
 great pokemon I hope you liked it 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.610
 quite the event and if they liked it 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.010
 forget to destroy that button I like 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.350
 at the moment the event is nothing more 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.120
 active in japan so friends if they are not 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.600
 of Japan if they do not have a console 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.490
 Japanese I think it's going to be pretty 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.260
 difficult to achieve in a very 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.990
 quick but the safest thing is that if they go 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.820
 to people if they look for some it is navy already 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.850
 he handles them in some with a response like that 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.560
 which is almost 100% sure they can 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.910
 find one easily so friends 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.470
 I think it would be all for the video of the day 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.630
 today I hope you liked it 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.640
 quite and if they liked do not forget
