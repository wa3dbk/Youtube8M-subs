00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.750 

I<00:00:00.120> think<00:00:00.480> a<00:00:00.539> combination<00:00:00.750> of<00:00:01.319> a<00:00:01.439> couple<00:00:02.429> of<00:00:02.639> odd

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
I think a combination of a couple of odd

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.160 
I think a combination of a couple of odd
misses<00:00:03.120> and<00:00:03.300> obviously<00:00:03.600> a<00:00:03.659> very<00:00:03.929> poor

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
misses and obviously a very poor

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.270 
misses and obviously a very poor
decision<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:05.089> disallow<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.150> goal<00:00:06.450> was<00:00:07.280> was

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
decision to disallow the goal was was

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.770 
decision to disallow the goal was was
the<00:00:08.370> key<00:00:08.550> elements<00:00:09.000> why<00:00:09.150> we<00:00:09.330> ended<00:00:09.510> up<00:00:09.630> behind

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
the key elements why we ended up behind

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.419 
the key elements why we ended up behind
fallen<00:00:10.380> asleep<00:00:10.500> in<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.920> last<00:00:11.099> couple<00:00:11.280> of

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
fallen asleep in the last couple of

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.310 
fallen asleep in the last couple of
minutes<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:11.969> mean<00:00:12.690> after<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.080> first

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
minutes and I mean after the first

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.410 
minutes and I mean after the first
concede<00:00:13.830> in<00:00:13.920> this<00:00:14.040> second<00:00:14.340> was<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.580> bit<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.330> a

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
concede in this second was a bit of a

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.250 
concede in this second was a bit of a
blow<00:00:15.630> but<00:00:17.510> for<00:00:18.510> me<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.720> was<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.869> great<00:00:18.990> recovery

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
blow but for me it was a great recovery

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.080 
blow but for me it was a great recovery
in<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.710> second<00:00:20.010> now<00:00:20.130> for<00:00:20.400> not<00:00:20.580> obviously<00:00:21.029> we

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
in the second now for not obviously we

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.310 
in the second now for not obviously we
couldn't<00:00:21.300> recover<00:00:21.570> enough<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.020> get<00:00:22.170> anything

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
couldn't recover enough to get anything

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.220 
couldn't recover enough to get anything
out<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.710> game<00:00:22.890> but<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.750> like<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.869> say<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.080> think

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
out the game but I like to say I think

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.720 
out the game but I like to say I think
that<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.560> way<00:00:25.769> we're<00:00:25.980> going<00:00:26.130> at<00:00:26.310> home<00:00:26.430> if<00:00:26.640> we

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
that the way we're going at home if we

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.700 
that the way we're going at home if we
did<00:00:26.910> been<00:00:27.660> allowed<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.140> goal<00:00:28.349> as<00:00:28.529> we<00:00:28.650> should

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
did been allowed that goal as we should

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.160 
did been allowed that goal as we should
have<00:00:28.949> done<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.279> don't<00:00:30.210> think<00:00:30.630> with<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.810> loss<00:00:30.990> to

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
have done I don't think with the loss to

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.590 
have done I don't think with the loss to
Arsenal<00:00:31.320> today<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.980> mean<00:00:32.640> one<00:00:32.850> six<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.360> drawn

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
Arsenal today I mean one six and drawn

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.360 
Arsenal today I mean one six and drawn
one<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> year<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.770> last<00:00:34.890> seven<00:00:35.280> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
one a year in the last seven the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.069 
one a year in the last seven the
confidence<00:00:35.850> we<00:00:35.940> have<00:00:36.030> here<00:00:36.270> going<00:00:36.390> up<00:00:36.630> one<00:00:36.930> nil

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
confidence we have here going up one nil

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.280 
confidence we have here going up one nil
up<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.380> early<00:00:37.559> would<00:00:38.719> kick<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.870> lads<00:00:40.079> on<00:00:40.260> I

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
up that early would kick the lads on I

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.170 
up that early would kick the lads on I
think<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:40.920> think<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.370> store<00:00:41.969> would<00:00:42.059> have

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
think and I think in a store would have

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.760 
think and I think in a store would have
felt<00:00:42.360> life<00:00:43.140> very<00:00:43.379> difficult<00:00:43.620> from<00:00:44.040> there<00:00:44.219> on

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
felt life very difficult from there on

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.319 
felt life very difficult from there on
but<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.890> wasn't<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.280> being<00:00:47.460> sadly<00:00:47.910> we've<00:00:48.090> ended

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
but it wasn't to being sadly we've ended

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.750 
but it wasn't to being sadly we've ended
up<00:00:48.420> losing<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.870> game<00:00:49.050> which<00:00:49.289> was<00:00:49.469> probably<00:00:50.460> a

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
up losing the game which was probably a

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.869 
up losing the game which was probably a
great<00:00:51.030> spectacle<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.670> thought<00:00:53.670> we'd

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
great spectacle and I thought we'd

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.250 
great spectacle and I thought we'd
captured<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> end<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.230> last

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
captured it in the end in the last

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.080 
captured it in the end in the last
minute<00:00:55.710> should<00:00:56.129> have<00:00:56.219> been<00:00:56.340> nice<00:00:56.520> as<00:00:56.789> nothing

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
minute should have been nice as nothing

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.420 
minute should have been nice as nothing
better<00:00:57.300> than<00:00:57.739> something<00:00:58.739> happening<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
better than something happening in the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.040 
better than something happening in the
last<00:00:59.730> minute<00:01:00.059> for<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.359> give<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.719> result

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.580 
again when you know you're a hundred
percent<00:01:18.210> right<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.659> he's<00:01:18.990> only<00:01:19.200> got<00:01:19.290> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
percent right and he's only got the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.320 
percent right and he's only got the
visuals<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.310> when<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.640> actually<00:01:21.060> happened

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
visuals of when it actually happened

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.260 
visuals of when it actually happened
like<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.659> mean<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.290> can<00:01:22.909> you<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:24.090> really

like you mean so you can you can really

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.359 
like you mean so you can you can really
get<00:01:24.540> nowhere<00:01:24.810> by<00:01:25.259> telling<00:01:25.710> him<00:01:25.830> how<00:01:25.920> long<00:01:25.950> he's

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
get nowhere by telling him how long he's

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.819 
get nowhere by telling him how long he's
been<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.610> terms<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.270> what<00:01:27.960> decision<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.500> given
