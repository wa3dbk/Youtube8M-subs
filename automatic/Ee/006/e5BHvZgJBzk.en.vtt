00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 Tomsk created a unique robot 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.000
 welder who can produce 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.620
 elements for nuclear reactors a year ago 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.970
 order for inventions made one of 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.440
 giants domestic nuclear 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.900
 industry Novosibirsk plant 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.610
 chemical concentrate auto development 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.420
 they say they managed to beat all 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.420
 existing analogues 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.810
 on the training installation can be seen as 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.000
 there is a process of welding parts from 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.040
 zirconia for nuclear reactors main 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.490
 the lack of this technology is human 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.259
 factor 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.570
 exclude it completely 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.879
 development of tomsk polytechnic of robot 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.600
 welder the process of cooking itself lasts share 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:43.180
 there is no second metal overheating and 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.769
 there is no deformation and the quality and 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.900
 weld strength 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.000
 remains at a very high level 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.800
 the customer of the Novosibirsk plant kim 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.720
 concentrates robotic line 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.820
 needed for welding fuel cells 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.250
 nuclear reactor on such a production 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.489
 special requirements 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.500
 security 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.600
 the tubes will then regulate 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.430
 nuclear reaction rate at all 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.400
 Russian and some foreign 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.640
 and with to and here each connection each 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.510
 pipe with a stub were guaranteed 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.400
 welded by us designed this installations 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.299
 the complex of its main part is pride 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.630
 Tomsk Polytechnic scientists 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.760
 university power supply creators 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.009
 robots say for instant welding 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.380
 digital synthesizer delivers up to 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.840
 twenty four thousand amps literally 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.490
 from household outlet development overseas 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.799
 competitors require for such welding 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.469
 special power plant and 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.390
 this is not the only advantage created 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:38.920
 Tomsk poly technicians robot welder 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.810
 Now occupies almost the entire study 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.850
 the laboratory while he is the most 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.579
 compact and all existing analogues 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.590
 in the world interest in Tomsk robot already 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.990
 exhibit in countries participating nuclear 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.939
 club first in line china but on 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.409
 soon orders polytechnic of 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.109
 provided a domestic manufacturer 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.329
 atomic reactors application came from 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:59.649
 Rossa Tom who intends to abandon 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:01.450
 expensive purchases 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.789
 and less perfect germanic 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.600
