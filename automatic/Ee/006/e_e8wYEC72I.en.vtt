one of you hold style cassettes that's

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.580 
one of you hold style cassettes that's
what<00:01:00.000> actually<00:01:00.420> buena<00:01:00.660> was<00:01:00.809> stored<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.199> before

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
what actually buena was stored on before

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.210 
what actually buena was stored on before
discs<00:01:02.930> you<00:01:03.930> can<00:01:04.080> play<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.320> back<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.650> load

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
long as you play this into the computer

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.600 
long as you play this into the computer
it'll<00:01:19.170> actually<00:01:19.409> load<00:01:19.799> up<00:01:19.979> one<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.430> game

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
genetic sequence event all that noise

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.289 
genetic sequence event all that noise
right<00:01:27.859> there<00:01:28.070> that<00:01:28.189> you<00:01:28.310> here<00:01:28.640> that's

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
actually all the game data so here let's

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.880 
actually all the game data so here let's
uh<00:01:32.030> start<00:01:32.299> something<00:01:32.869> up<00:01:32.990> and<00:01:33.200> i'll<00:01:33.679> show<00:01:33.829> you

uh start something up and i'll show you
how<00:01:33.950> it<00:01:34.130> works<00:01:34.159> i<00:01:34.460> got<00:01:34.759> it<00:01:34.850> actually<00:01:35.149> loaded<00:01:35.420> on

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
how it works i got it actually loaded on

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.419 
how it works i got it actually loaded on
