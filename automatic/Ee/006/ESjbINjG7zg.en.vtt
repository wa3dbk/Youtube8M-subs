00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
than black ops grasses and trees and bow

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.049 
than black ops grasses and trees and bow
filled<00:01:02.780> for<00:01:02.990> lets<00:01:03.260> you<00:01:03.440> do<00:01:03.620> much<00:01:04.370> more<00:01:04.699> than

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
around on these huge maps and the these

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.790 
around on these huge maps and the these
maps<00:01:12.830> are<00:01:13.690> gigantic<00:01:14.690> you<00:01:14.840> can<00:01:15.020> fit<00:01:15.230> almost

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
maps are gigantic you can fit almost

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.950 
maps are gigantic you can fit almost
every<00:01:16.280> black<00:01:16.550> ops<00:01:16.820> 2<00:01:17.090> map<00:01:17.270> and<00:01:17.510> one<00:01:17.690> of<00:01:17.840> these

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
every black ops 2 map and one of these

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.950 
every black ops 2 map and one of these
conquest<00:01:18.500> maps<00:01:18.760> so<00:01:19.760> the<00:01:20.150> gun<00:01:20.360> sound<00:01:20.720> much

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
conquest maps so the gun sound much

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.200 
conquest maps so the gun sound much
different<00:01:21.010> comparing<00:01:22.010> them<00:01:22.190> bow<00:01:22.700> flute<00:01:22.970> for

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
different comparing them bow flute for

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.390 
different comparing them bow flute for
seems<00:01:23.630> a<00:01:23.840> little<00:01:24.050> quieter<00:01:24.620> than<00:01:24.890> black<00:01:25.100> ops

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
seems a little quieter than black ops

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.990 
seems a little quieter than black ops
but<00:01:26.030> powerful<00:01:26.690> for<00:01:26.960> I<00:01:27.230> just<00:01:27.770> like<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:28.490> sound<00:01:28.760> a

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
but powerful for I just like the sound a

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.550 
but powerful for I just like the sound a
little<00:01:29.120> more<00:01:29.420> personally<00:01:30.409> i<00:01:30.470> prefer

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
little more personally i prefer

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.030 
little more personally i prefer
battlefield<00:01:31.430> 4<00:01:31.909> or<00:01:32.210> any<00:01:32.870> battlefield<00:01:33.440> /<00:01:33.770> call

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
battlefield 4 or any battlefield / call

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.220 
battlefield 4 or any battlefield / call
duty<00:01:34.340> but<00:01:35.000> it's<00:01:35.210> almost<00:01:35.360> wrong<00:01:35.659> to<00:01:35.840> compare

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
duty but it's almost wrong to compare

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.840 
duty but it's almost wrong to compare
these<00:01:36.470> games<00:01:36.770> because<00:01:37.190> they're<00:01:37.430> like<00:01:37.610> totally

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
these games because they're like totally

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.140 
these games because they're like totally
different<00:01:39.040> I'll<00:01:40.040> put<00:01:40.310> 4<00:01:40.550> is<00:01:40.730> more<00:01:40.970> about

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
different I'll put 4 is more about

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.420 
different I'll put 4 is more about
teamwork<00:01:41.540> and<00:01:42.020> strategy<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:42.740> black<00:01:42.920> ops<00:01:43.220> is

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
teamwork and strategy and black ops is

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.140 
teamwork and strategy and black ops is
more<00:01:43.670> fast-paced<00:01:44.270> just<00:01:44.780> fun<00:01:45.050> play<00:01:45.380> around

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
more fast-paced just fun play around

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.630 
more fast-paced just fun play around
it's<00:01:46.540> convenient<00:01:47.020> and<00:01:47.320> I<00:01:47.710> think<00:01:48.370> they<00:01:48.490> do<00:01:48.550> a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
it's convenient and I think they do a

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.000 
it's convenient and I think they do a
better<00:01:48.880> job<00:01:48.970> at<00:01:49.450> advertising<00:01:49.800> so<00:01:50.800> there's

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
better job at advertising so there's

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.310 
better job at advertising so there's
more<00:01:51.160> people<00:01:51.520> with<00:01:51.670> that<00:01:51.880> I<00:01:52.360> think<00:01:52.690> black<00:01:53.050> ops

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
more people with that I think black ops

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.030 
more people with that I think black ops
does<00:01:53.830> have<00:01:54.280> a<00:01:54.310> better<00:01:54.790> campaign<00:01:55.180> and<00:01:55.780> I<00:01:56.500> give

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
does have a better campaign and I give

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.740 
does have a better campaign and I give
them<00:01:57.070> matte<00:01:57.370> but<00:01:57.580> battlefield<00:01:58.090> 4<00:01:58.300> is<00:01:58.330> bringing

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
them matte but battlefield 4 is bringing

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.290 
them matte but battlefield 4 is bringing
