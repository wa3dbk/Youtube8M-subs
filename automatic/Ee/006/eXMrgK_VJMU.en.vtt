00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
can get sent here for class and stuff

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.189 
can get sent here for class and stuff
and<00:01:01.559> if<00:01:02.250> we<00:01:02.460> go<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.000> right<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
and if we go to the right so to the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.330 
and if we go to the right so to the
south<00:01:04.530> at<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.040> place<00:01:05.369> we<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.479> find<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.340> mega

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
south at this place we can find a mega

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.230 
south at this place we can find a mega
taiga<00:01:08.970> biome<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.380> already<00:01:10.650> have<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.490> hot

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
taiga biome so you already have the hot

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.570 
taiga biome so you already have the hot
soil<00:01:12.600> here<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.020> don't<00:01:13.830> have<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.100> travel<00:01:14.340> too

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
soil here and don't have to travel too

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.499 
soil here and don't have to travel too
far<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.090> get<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.420> now<00:01:16.200> let's<00:01:16.409> try<00:01:16.619> over<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
far to get it now let's try over to the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.289 
far to get it now let's try over to the
south<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.740> island<00:01:19.770> because<00:01:20.670> here<00:01:20.909> we<00:01:21.119> meet

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
south of the island because here we meet

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.190 
south of the island because here we meet
a<00:01:21.570> ice<00:01:22.049> Plains<00:01:22.650> biome<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.570> if<00:01:24.570> we<00:01:24.780> follow<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
a ice Plains biome and if we follow the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.910 
a ice Plains biome and if we follow the
coast<00:01:25.470> again<00:01:26.299> through<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.540> Stiga<00:01:27.900> biome<00:01:28.290> we

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
coast again through the Stiga biome we

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.580 
coast again through the Stiga biome we
have<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.579> witch<00:01:30.000> hunt<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:31.140> also<00:01:31.320> build

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
have a witch hunt so you can also build

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.160 
have a witch hunt so you can also build
a<00:01:31.770> witch<00:01:31.979> farm<00:01:32.280> on<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.579> seat<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.180> now<00:01:33.960> let's

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
a witch farm on the seat and now let's

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.830 
a witch farm on the seat and now let's
go<00:01:34.320> further<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.250> south<00:01:35.579> about<00:01:36.180> 2,000

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
go further to the south about 2,000

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.620 
go further to the south about 2,000
blocks<00:01:37.079> because<00:01:37.979> here<00:01:38.250> we<00:01:38.400> have<00:01:38.610> ice<00:01:39.150> spikes

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
blocks because here we have ice spikes

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.499 
blocks because here we have ice spikes
by<00:01:40.020> them<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.549> you<00:01:41.549> can<00:01:41.759> get<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.060> peg<00:01:42.240> dice

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
by them and you can get the peg dice

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.429 
by them and you can get the peg dice
back<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.619> witch<00:01:43.770> hut<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.399> will<00:01:44.549> find<00:01:44.880> a

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
back to the witch hut we will find a

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.410 
back to the witch hut we will find a
roof<00:01:46.439> forest<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.159> if<00:01:47.640> we<00:01:47.790> follow<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.210> coast

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
roof forest and if we follow the coast

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.080 
roof forest and if we follow the coast
to<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.750> north<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.259> speed<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.590> up<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.770> bit<00:01:49.909> we<00:01:50.909> see

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
to the north I speed it up a bit we see

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.999 
to the north I speed it up a bit we see
that<00:01:51.240> we<00:01:51.390> have<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.750> nama<00:01:52.170> forest<00:01:52.619> team<00:01:52.829> and

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
that we have a nama forest team and

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.930 
that we have a nama forest team and
their<00:01:53.549> planes<00:01:53.820> if<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.210> want<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.450> find<00:01:54.689> horses

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
and after the splaine's the interesting

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.610 
and after the splaine's the interesting
part<00:02:02.030> is<00:02:02.120> here<00:02:02.390> is<00:02:02.540> because<00:02:02.930> here<00:02:03.380> we<00:02:03.500> have<00:02:03.710> a

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
part is here is because here we have a

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.090 
part is here is because here we have a
Mesa<00:02:06.620> so<00:02:07.370> you<00:02:07.430> can<00:02:07.730> get<00:02:07.820> clay<00:02:08.410> now<00:02:09.410> beg<00:02:09.770> at<00:02:09.950> the

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
Mesa so you can get clay now beg at the
