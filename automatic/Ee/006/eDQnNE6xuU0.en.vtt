00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:07.540
 shows how you can curl with rides 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.540
 to make 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:14.230
 I have made a lot of hair for her 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.610
 and I have two songs 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:21.560
 because I have none of that very fine 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:25.249
 I love curls of mountain rides on one 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:31.699
 centered towards each other about them 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:34.720
 being equal here does between her and what 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.720
 you do expose your hair 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:51.160
 is that you found one side over the other 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:51.160
 side and over it 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.780
 as you can see very easily 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.990
 pieces a bit tricky 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.560
 so that your last piece holds tight 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:38.979
 I have such a whole part here you are 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:42.680
 No, he doesn't fall tight 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.030
 then one gets a really awkward look 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:50.240
 in this way 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:55.759
 this flight to him here and goes into me 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:59.899
 no you can also sleep youtube virus 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:04.179
 say it so long I sit 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.179
 gets out then sit undercooling 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.649
 a bit wet 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.000
 what have you got all the places 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.790
 here two songs so if you're really fine 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.450

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.450

 increasingly 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:52.710
