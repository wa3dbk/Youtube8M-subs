00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 fiery greetings to you all over again 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.839
 and today I will tell you about 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.490
 how to become a lord of time literally 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.099
 sense of the word manage time 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.019
 so as you wish on the 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.630
 In fact, this guys are not the same cheat mod 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.480
 as I would like here it is much easier 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.830
 we have a special device which 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.230
 allows in accelerates all processes 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.590
 that happen in on a small 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.480
 areas for example plant growth 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.109
 remelting and resource stoves and work 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.000
 spavner of and several other 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.649
 phenomena in 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.079
 ok let's first take a look at what 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.780
 craft this thing called it here 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.579
 balls but or something like that, I hope 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.329
 correctly pronounced there the desert correctly 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.969
 put on 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.700
 and it is made from the usual torch which 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.190
 Kravtsa so here and then there are 4 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.920
 watch to this is a standard minecraft 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.570
 guys four gold 1 redstone all very 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.420
 simple and clear further to give or 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.390
 expert we will plant one bed 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.190
 which we will not expose you 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.220
 working on this very machine i am today 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.680
 your learned words guys on the floor 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.200
 quantum physics wonders with time 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.450
 next we need to put the torch next to 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.850
 right click 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.549
 clazzi we choose the range of this 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.270
 the torch itself, then click a button 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.330
 shift 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.220
 this squat button is usually this 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.350
 left shift and choose speed with 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.509
 where everything will work first 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.850
 the speed is plus one hundred percent that is 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.020
 in fact it doubles the growth rate 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.000
 as you can see 2 gis how to say the radius 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.790
 the actions of this torch we do not 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.130
 falls short of these beds and they are there 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.350
 grow as you see pretty slowly here 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.820
 This our beds are growing by themselves and 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.520
 these are under the influence of this 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.369
 devices so let's we have it a little bit 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.149
 radius is still a whisper and we'll do it here too 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.430
 matured just awesome now we clamp 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.619
 shift button and try even faster 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.110
 make the speed already 3 times faster 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.509
 will be four times faster will 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.100
 all processes occur for example 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.239
 four times we will just lead 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.330
 wheat is now 5 times the maximum 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.610
 the speed of this torch 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.330
 all so here we turn off work 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.880
 this torch 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.650
 now the most important guys if these 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.810
 torches simply increase 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.120
 the number of ticks per second therefore 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.860
 translating into Russian is shorter if you 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.720
 will put too many torches and 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.180
 speed up work too big 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.520
 the number of machines and devices then you 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.730
 there will be lags in cruel lags especially if 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.350
 you play the server and so by the way 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.930
 this torch accelerates anything 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.000
 work not only 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.430
 stoves and a plant from the standard 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.680
 minecraft but also cars from any other 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.960
 mods like this way you can 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.830
 speed up your work 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:54.209
 oil refinery for example and 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.820
 only worked nuclear reactor here it is 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.970
 400 mm if try it now 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.950
 let's we take i just lost 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.010
 a little decline go here i said 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:09.390
 and now the same experiment 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:11.430
 repeat already directly with the stoves in 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.250
 one stove we put a resource she will 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.400
 work alone and this stove we 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:22.050
 wherein accelerate to the maximum set 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.840
 stifle shift and narrow m 4 times as 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.290
 Now you increase the radius of action and 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.870
 3rd 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.880
 and now compare visually see with 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.540
 what speed work here from 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.340
 which works here barely a soul in 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.760
 body and it's all very fun 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.910
 hop hop awesome 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.760
 and this is the most useful mod in history 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.790
 minecraft as they say guys for that 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.950
 to use up on the server I don't give you 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.980
 advise is used tom will quickly die in 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:57.420
 logs continue to look how it works 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:59.100
 regular spriber creeper so we need 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.870
 know what to do to organize the night 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:05.580
 one creeper times somewhere in 15 20 30 seconds 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.450
 we are not engaged in mathematics today 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:14.880
 we will now accelerate under the maximum and 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:19.380
 set 1 radius 1 kuyper appeared 1 2 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:21.390
 creeper oh how good and so 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.640
 guys if you built for example a farm 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.590
 on the basis of the usual spuner found 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.600
 spawner world set absolutely 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.520
 vanilla design for example for 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.669
 I donâ€™t remember to get pores 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.949
 pores and bones for example and creaking 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:37.350
 let's put these near such a torch and you 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:41.449
 the skeleton starts spawning 5-6 times 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:45.180
 build than usual awesome 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:47.370
 awesome thing just awesome brynza 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.729
 Subscription views and likes are expensive 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.430
 friends actually wanted to say wrong 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.110
 option for watching and dear friends not 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.030
 forget to like if you are here 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.410
 liked don't forget to look into 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.540
 description under this video there are many 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.639
 a bunch of interesting links to different 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.400
 bodily videos playlists of my channel 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:07.110
 we stay with us also write to 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.479
 comments what else practical 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.530
