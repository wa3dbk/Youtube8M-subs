00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.940 
it so I'm basically just twisting it
around<00:02:33.200> until<00:02:34.840> I've<00:02:35.840> kind<00:02:36.260> of<00:02:36.290> gone<00:02:36.500> far

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
around until I've kind of gone far

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.530 
around until I've kind of gone far
enough<00:02:37.190> down<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.760> I<00:02:37.820> just<00:02:38.000> basically<00:02:38.270> want

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
enough down and I just basically want

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.199 
enough down and I just basically want
the<00:02:38.930> same<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.410> the<00:02:39.530> other<00:02:39.560> side<00:02:39.920> and<00:02:40.310> you<00:02:41.000> want

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
the same to the other side and you want

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.850 
the same to the other side and you want
to<00:02:41.300> make<00:02:41.420> sure<00:02:41.450> that<00:02:41.720> they're<00:02:42.260> both<00:02:42.410> kind<00:02:42.800> of

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
to make sure that they're both kind of

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.790 
to make sure that they're both kind of
really<00:02:43.160> nice<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:43.490> tight<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.030> also<00:02:44.630> I<00:02:45.230> do

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
really nice and tight and also I do

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.920 
really nice and tight and also I do
think<00:02:46.130> it<00:02:46.250> really<00:02:46.400> matters<00:02:46.820> if<00:02:47.120> you<00:02:47.330> do<00:02:47.570> both

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
think it really matters if you do both

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.320 
think it really matters if you do both
twist<00:02:48.410> in<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.650> same<00:02:48.860> way<00:02:49.070> because<00:02:49.940> obviously

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
twist in the same way because obviously

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.030 
twist in the same way because obviously
it<00:02:50.540> would<00:02:50.630> be<00:02:50.720> able<00:02:50.810> to<00:02:50.900> undone<00:02:51.290> but<00:02:51.890> you<00:02:51.950> just

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
it would be able to undone but you just

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.199 
it would be able to undone but you just
want<00:02:52.190> to<00:02:52.250> make<00:02:52.340> sure<00:02:52.400> that<00:02:52.610> you<00:02:52.820> leave<00:02:52.940> enough

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
want to make sure that you leave enough

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.090 
want to make sure that you leave enough
neck<00:02:53.600> room<00:02:53.959> because<00:02:54.350> I<00:02:54.380> actually<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:54.980> first

time<00:02:55.280> I<00:02:55.310> did<00:02:55.520> this<00:02:55.550> I<00:02:55.850> actually<00:02:55.970> woke<00:02:56.750> up<00:02:56.810> with

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
time I did this I actually woke up with

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.870 
time I did this I actually woke up with
a<00:02:57.050> would<00:02:57.290> really<00:02:57.770> sore<00:02:58.190> throat<00:02:58.520> because

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
a would really sore throat because

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.630 
a would really sore throat because
actually<00:02:59.770> rested<00:03:00.770> on<00:03:00.860> my<00:03:00.980> throat<00:03:01.250> throughout

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
actually rested on my throat throughout

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.860 
actually rested on my throat throughout
the<00:03:01.730> night<00:03:01.910> so<00:03:01.940> then<00:03:02.239> you<00:03:02.300> just<00:03:02.450> want<00:03:02.600> to<00:03:02.690> tie

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
the night so then you just want to tie

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.620 
the night so then you just want to tie
it<00:03:02.930> off<00:03:03.080> and<00:03:03.670> then<00:03:04.670> you<00:03:04.790> just<00:03:04.940> want<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.239> repeat

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
it off and then you just want to repeat

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.190 
it off and then you just want to repeat
the<00:03:05.840> same<00:03:06.110> process<00:03:06.860> on<00:03:07.239> another<00:03:08.239> bit<00:03:08.480> of<00:03:08.510> her

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.810 

again<00:03:12.200> I'm<00:03:12.320> taking<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.680> leftover<00:03:13.310> hair<00:03:13.520> and

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
again I'm taking the leftover hair and

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.080 
again I'm taking the leftover hair and
twisting<00:03:14.660> it<00:03:14.810> outwards<00:03:15.760> repeating<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.850> same

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
twisting it outwards repeating the same

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.210 
twisting it outwards repeating the same
process<00:03:17.720> until<00:03:18.200> I've<00:03:18.350> gone<00:03:18.500> far<00:03:18.890> enough<00:03:19.160> down

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
process until I've gone far enough down

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.040 
process until I've gone far enough down
and<00:03:19.820> then<00:03:20.120> I'm<00:03:20.209> just<00:03:20.300> going<00:03:20.480> to<00:03:20.540> tie<00:03:20.810> it<00:03:20.870> up

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
and then I'm just going to tie it up

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.600 
and then I'm just going to tie it up
again

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.190 

finally<00:03:24.610> if<00:03:24.820> your<00:03:25.030> hair<00:03:25.270> is<00:03:25.450> long<00:03:25.780> enough<00:03:25.810> to

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
finally if your hair is long enough to

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.020 
finally if your hair is long enough to
reach<00:03:26.350> this<00:03:26.620> step<00:03:26.980> then<00:03:27.220> I<00:03:27.400> suggest<00:03:27.670> that<00:03:27.910> you

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.090 
reach this step then I suggest that you
twist<00:03:28.330> it<00:03:28.450> again<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:28.960> just<00:03:29.560> repeat<00:03:29.830> the<00:03:29.890> same

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
twist it again and just repeat the same

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.250 
twist it again and just repeat the same
process<00:03:30.520> you<00:03:30.670> just<00:03:30.820> want<00:03:30.940> to<00:03:30.970> twist<00:03:31.180> it<00:03:31.450> tie<00:03:32.230> it

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
process you just want to twist it tie it

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.290 
process you just want to twist it tie it
