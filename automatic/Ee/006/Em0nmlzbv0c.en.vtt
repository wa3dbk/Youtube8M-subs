00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530 
doing years ago when I was training I

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.830 
doing years ago when I was training I
would<00:00:12.890> do<00:00:13.310> three<00:00:13.730> three-minute<00:00:14.270> rounds<00:00:14.570> four

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:14.840 
would do three three-minute rounds four

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.810 
would do three three-minute rounds four
three-minute<00:00:15.500> rounds<00:00:15.830> five<00:00:16.160> three-minute

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.730 
three-minute rounds five three-minute
rounds<00:00:17.150> then<00:00:17.690> when<00:00:17.900> I'm<00:00:18.020> in<00:00:18.140> really<00:00:18.380> good

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
rounds then when I'm in really good

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.890 
rounds then when I'm in really good
shape<00:00:19.240> five-minute<00:00:20.240> rounds<00:00:20.390> and<00:00:20.720> take<00:00:20.870> a

minute break

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.029 
minute break
I'd<00:00:22.310> say<00:00:22.610> the<00:00:22.880> split<00:00:23.300> between<00:00:23.450> training<00:00:24.320> your

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
I'd say the split between training your

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.580 
I'd say the split between training your
upper<00:00:25.340> body<00:00:25.580> in<00:00:25.760> your<00:00:25.910> bottom<00:00:26.780> is<00:00:26.960> the<00:00:27.350> same

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
upper body in your bottom is the same

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.820 
upper body in your bottom is the same
50/50<00:00:28.430> and<00:00:28.670> I<00:00:29.630> would<00:00:29.750> actually<00:00:29.869> really<00:00:30.470> say

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
50/50 and I would actually really say

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.090 
50/50 and I would actually really say
more<00:00:31.280> with<00:00:31.670> your<00:00:31.820> legs<00:00:32.119> because<00:00:32.599> your<00:00:32.780> legs

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
more with your legs because your legs

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.830 
more with your legs because your legs

important part of your boxing routine so

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.370 
important part of your boxing routine so
it's<00:00:52.850> more<00:00:53.120> like<00:00:53.300> you<00:00:53.690> know<00:00:53.809> you're<00:00:53.989> balancing

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.380 
it's more like you know you're balancing

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.100 
it's more like you know you're balancing
this<00:00:54.530> is<00:00:54.649> a<00:00:54.680> skipping<00:00:55.160> aspect<00:00:55.790> of<00:00:55.969> it<00:00:56.120> then<00:00:56.899> you

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
this is a skipping aspect of it then you

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.500 
this is a skipping aspect of it then you
push<00:00:57.380> you're<00:00:57.530> in<00:00:57.649> danger<00:00:58.100> out<00:00:58.340> of<00:00:58.670> danger<00:00:58.850> so

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
push you're in danger out of danger so

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.270 
push you're in danger out of danger so
you<00:00:59.600> got<00:00:59.719> to<00:00:59.809> be<00:00:59.899> fast<00:01:00.290> on<00:01:00.500> your<00:01:00.710> toes<00:01:00.920> so

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
you got to be fast on your toes so

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.669 
you got to be fast on your toes so
skipping<00:01:01.969> really<00:01:02.420> helps<00:01:05.170> when<00:01:06.170> I<00:01:06.200> speak<00:01:06.499> to

00:01:06.669 --> 00:01:06.679

skipping really helps when I speak to
kids<00:01:06.889> and<00:01:07.159> talk<00:01:07.729> to<00:01:07.880> them<00:01:08.030> about<00:01:08.090> boxing<00:01:08.810> and
