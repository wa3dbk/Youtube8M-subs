to<00:00:16.020> make<00:00:16.170> multiple<00:00:16.470> attempts<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.279> actually

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
to make multiple attempts to actually

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
so far every one of them has worked the

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.540 
so far every one of them has worked the
first<00:00:32.610> time<00:00:32.759> which<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.390> love<00:00:33.780> anyway<00:00:34.680> they<00:00:35.280> make

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
first time which I love anyway they make

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.410 
first time which I love anyway they make
straight<00:00:36.210> cables<00:00:36.860> then<00:00:37.860> make<00:00:38.070> angled<00:00:38.850> cables

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
straight cables then make angled cables

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.979 
straight cables then make angled cables
you<00:00:40.260> get<00:00:40.410> ten<00:00:40.710> ends<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.550> three<00:00:42.149> meters<00:00:42.600> of

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
you get ten ends and three meters of

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.709 
you get ten ends and three meters of
wire<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:44.040> you've<00:00:44.160> got<00:00:44.309> enough<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.730> make<00:00:44.760> five

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
wire so you've got enough to make five

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.100 
wire so you've got enough to make five
cables<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.620> you'll<00:00:47.160> have<00:00:47.780> millions<00:00:48.780> and
