what<00:00:22.520> I'd<00:00:22.610> like<00:00:22.760> to<00:00:22.910> do<00:00:23.060> today<00:00:23.210> is<00:00:23.330> is<00:00:23.779> start

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
what I'd like to do today is is start

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.589 
what I'd like to do today is is start
out<00:00:24.200> with<00:00:24.439> a<00:00:24.740> series<00:00:25.430> of<00:00:25.460> rook<00:00:25.730> endings<00:00:26.090> that<00:00:26.300> I

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
out with a series of rook endings that I

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.560 
out with a series of rook endings that I
think<00:00:26.930> would<00:00:27.250> be<00:00:28.250> extremely<00:00:28.669> useful<00:00:29.119> for<00:00:29.150> just

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
think would be extremely useful for just

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.229 
think would be extremely useful for just
about<00:00:29.689> all<00:00:30.080> levels<00:00:30.529> I've<00:00:31.189> taught<00:00:31.580> this<00:00:31.880> series

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
about all levels I've taught this series

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.530 
about all levels I've taught this series
of<00:00:32.390> positions<00:00:32.900> to<00:00:33.230> students<00:00:33.710> anywhere<00:00:34.070> from

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
of positions to students anywhere from

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.259 
of positions to students anywhere from
1200<00:00:35.540> to<00:00:35.570> 2000<00:00:36.320> and<00:00:36.699> depending<00:00:37.699> on<00:00:37.820> whether<00:00:38.150> or

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:38.269 
1200 to 2000 and depending on whether or

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:39.700 
1200 to 2000 and depending on whether or
not<00:00:38.330> they've<00:00:38.660> been<00:00:38.690> shown<00:00:39.050> these<00:00:39.230> positions

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
not they've been shown these positions

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.880 
not they've been shown these positions
before<00:00:39.860> or<00:00:40.340> seeing<00:00:41.059> the<00:00:41.150> ideas<00:00:41.570> would<00:00:42.290> would

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
before or seeing the ideas would would

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.290 
before or seeing the ideas would would
tell<00:00:43.100> us<00:00:43.250> exactly<00:00:43.460> how<00:00:43.790> much<00:00:43.970> they<00:00:44.150> know<00:00:44.269> about

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
tell us exactly how much they know about

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.380 
tell us exactly how much they know about
it<00:00:44.690> so<00:00:44.900> I<00:00:45.650> guess<00:00:46.339> the<00:00:46.460> recommended<00:00:46.970> level<00:00:47.269> then

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
it so I guess the recommended level then

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.180 
it so I guess the recommended level then
would<00:00:47.629> be<00:00:47.780> somewhere<00:00:48.200> between<00:00:48.379> 1,200<00:00:49.100> and

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
would be somewhere between 1,200 and

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.229 
would be somewhere between 1,200 and
2,000<00:00:49.850> and<00:00:50.800> here<00:00:51.800> we<00:00:51.860> go<00:00:52.010> okay<00:00:52.879> so<00:00:52.940> this

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
2,000 and here we go okay so this

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:54.700 
2,000 and here we go okay so this
beginning<00:00:53.660> position<00:00:53.750> here<00:00:54.170> this<00:00:54.379> is<00:00:54.530> called

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
beginning position here this is called

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.529 
beginning position here this is called
the<00:00:54.860> Lucena<00:00:55.309> position<00:00:55.850> or<00:00:56.090> the<00:00:56.329> bridge

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
the Lucena position or the bridge

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:57.940 
the Lucena position or the bridge
position

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
position

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.240 
position
Lucina<00:00:58.610> was<00:00:58.879> a<00:00:58.910> famous<00:00:59.480> endgame<00:01:00.250> constructor

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
Lucina was a famous endgame constructor

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.160 
Lucina was a famous endgame constructor
and<00:01:01.460> position<00:01:01.879> constructor<00:01:02.420> back<00:01:02.750> in<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.020> day

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
and position constructor back in the day

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.460 
and position constructor back in the day
and<00:01:03.670> so<00:01:04.670> a<00:01:04.699> lot<00:01:04.970> of<00:01:05.089> these<00:01:05.239> rook<00:01:05.750> endings<00:01:06.170> are

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
and so a lot of these rook endings are

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.810 
and so a lot of these rook endings are
named<00:01:07.130> after<00:01:07.310> him

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
named after him

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.120 
named after him
but<00:01:08.539> anyway<00:01:08.990> so<00:01:09.020> what<00:01:09.229> I<00:01:09.289> like<00:01:09.410> to<00:01:09.470> do<00:01:09.740> here<00:01:09.770> is

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
but anyway so what I like to do here is

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.450 
but anyway so what I like to do here is
start<00:01:10.460> out<00:01:10.610> with<00:01:11.800> with<00:01:12.800> this<00:01:13.039> position

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
start out with with this position

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.550 
start out with with this position
because<00:01:13.850> once<00:01:14.660> you<00:01:14.780> learn<00:01:14.990> this<00:01:15.170> winning

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
because once you learn this winning

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.010 
because once you learn this winning
method<00:01:15.920> the<00:01:16.280> idea<00:01:16.670> of<00:01:16.940> exactly<00:01:17.479> how<00:01:17.690> are<00:01:17.869> we

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
method the idea of exactly how are we

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.990 
method the idea of exactly how are we
gonna<00:01:18.110> Queen<00:01:18.470> this<00:01:18.649> pawn<00:01:18.920> when<00:01:19.580> our<00:01:19.700> king<00:01:19.970> is

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
gonna Queen this pawn when our king is

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.660 
gonna Queen this pawn when our king is
stuck<00:01:20.330> in<00:01:20.479> front<00:01:20.630> of<00:01:20.810> it<00:01:21.130> once<00:01:22.130> you<00:01:22.220> learn<00:01:22.459> this

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
stuck in front of it once you learn this

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.730 
stuck in front of it once you learn this
method<00:01:22.880> it<00:01:23.270> can<00:01:23.330> be<00:01:23.630> repeated<00:01:24.170> for<00:01:24.709> every

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
method it can be repeated for every

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.790 
method it can be repeated for every
single<00:01:25.220> pawn<00:01:25.550> you<00:01:26.090> see<00:01:26.330> anywhere<00:01:27.229> from<00:01:27.289> the

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
single pawn you see anywhere from the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.620 
single pawn you see anywhere from the
from<00:01:28.399> the<00:01:28.520> knight<00:01:28.700> pawn<00:01:28.970> to<00:01:29.179> the<00:01:29.300> other<00:01:29.420> night

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
from the knight pawn to the other night

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.230 
from the knight pawn to the other night
on<00:01:29.979> now<00:01:30.979> the<00:01:31.039> rook<00:01:31.280> pawns<00:01:31.520> tend<00:01:31.849> to<00:01:31.940> have<00:01:32.060> their

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
on now the rook pawns tend to have their

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.400 
on now the rook pawns tend to have their
own<00:01:32.360> set<00:01:32.630> of<00:01:32.660> rules

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
own set of rules

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.290 
own set of rules
just<00:01:33.860> like<00:01:33.979> in<00:01:34.099> king<00:01:34.280> upon<00:01:34.580> endings<00:01:34.940> and<00:01:35.090> a<00:01:35.179> lot

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
just like in king upon endings and a lot

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.790 
just like in king upon endings and a lot
of<00:01:35.330> other<00:01:35.569> end<00:01:35.780> games<00:01:35.929> that<00:01:36.140> were<00:01:36.229> pawns<00:01:36.500> tend

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
of other end games that were pawns tend

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.949 
of other end games that were pawns tend
to<00:01:36.860> be<00:01:36.979> exceptions<00:01:37.520> and<00:01:38.330> we<00:01:38.390> will<00:01:38.720> have<00:01:38.929> a

00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:38.959 
to be exceptions and we will have a

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:41.169 
to be exceptions and we will have a
video<00:01:39.530> coming<00:01:40.160> to<00:01:40.340> you<00:01:40.459> about<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:40.910> corner

without any trouble and then we're gonna
move<00:01:56.690> on<00:01:56.899> to<00:01:57.050> some<00:01:57.319> more<00:01:57.560> difficult<00:01:58.009> positions

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
move on to some more difficult positions

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.449 
move on to some more difficult positions
moving<00:01:59.000> backwards<00:01:59.479> to<00:01:59.599> forwards<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:01.130> again<00:02:01.369> I

know I'm talking here before the moves
but<00:02:03.110> I<00:02:03.170> want<00:02:03.380> to<00:02:03.470> touch<00:02:03.950> on<00:02:04.130> that<00:02:04.280> real<00:02:04.489> quick

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
but I want to touch on that real quick

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.760 
but I want to touch on that real quick
for<00:02:04.940> all<00:02:05.000> you<00:02:05.270> interested<00:02:06.259> players<00:02:06.500> out<00:02:06.739> there

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
for all you interested players out there

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.949 
for all you interested players out there
I<00:02:07.130> think<00:02:07.580> a<00:02:07.759> very<00:02:07.970> important<00:02:08.360> point<00:02:08.569> is<00:02:08.780> that

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
I think a very important point is that

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.140 
I think a very important point is that
when<00:02:09.500> you<00:02:09.619> study<00:02:09.800> in<00:02:10.069> games<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.520> try<00:02:10.700> to<00:02:10.819> study

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
when you study in games to try to study

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.610 
when you study in games to try to study
it<00:02:11.300> with<00:02:11.420> that<00:02:11.599> backwards<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.440> forwards

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
it with that backwards to forwards

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.110 
it with that backwards to forwards
method<00:02:13.220> and<00:02:13.400> what<00:02:14.120> I<00:02:14.150> mean<00:02:14.390> by<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:14.780> is<00:02:15.290> that<00:02:15.620> a

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
method and what I mean by that is that a

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
method and what I mean by that is that a
lot<00:02:17.120> of<00:02:17.150> times<00:02:17.390> young<00:02:17.569> players<00:02:17.840> have<00:02:18.020> the

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
lot of times young players have the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.990 
lot of times young players have the
illusion<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.560> grandmasters<00:02:19.220> can<00:02:19.430> calculate

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
illusion the grandmasters can calculate

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.390 
illusion the grandmasters can calculate
50<00:02:20.510> moves<00:02:20.720> ahead<00:02:20.900> or<00:02:21.290> 70<00:02:21.800> moves<00:02:21.980> ahead<00:02:22.129> or

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
50 moves ahead or 70 moves ahead or

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.400 
50 moves ahead or 70 moves ahead or
something<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.450> on<00:02:23.599> occasion<00:02:24.140> there<00:02:24.290> are

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
something and and on occasion there are

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.780 
something and and on occasion there are
some<00:02:24.590> great<00:02:24.740> calculators<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:25.400> I<00:02:25.430> think<00:02:25.670> on

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
some great calculators and I think on

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.130 
some great calculators and I think on
occasion<00:02:26.240> sometimes<00:02:26.600> you<00:02:26.720> have<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.990> do

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
occasion sometimes you have to do

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.120 
occasion sometimes you have to do
something<00:02:27.500> like<00:02:27.620> that

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
something like that

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.280 
something like that
we<00:02:28.250> try<00:02:28.460> to<00:02:28.520> calculate<00:02:28.760> but<00:02:29.720> most<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.080> time

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
we try to calculate but most the time

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.770 
we try to calculate but most the time
their<00:02:30.800> ability<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.370> solve<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.210> position<00:02:32.660> that's

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
their ability to solve a position that's

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.270 
their ability to solve a position that's
in<00:02:32.930> front<00:02:33.110> of<00:02:33.230> them<00:02:33.320> at<00:02:33.470> a<00:02:33.530> high<00:02:33.680> level<00:02:33.710> is

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
in front of them at a high level is

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.550 
in front of them at a high level is
based<00:02:35.090> on<00:02:35.330> how<00:02:35.510> well<00:02:35.720> they<00:02:35.930> know<00:02:35.960> the<00:02:36.320> next

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
based on how well they know the next

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.500 
based on how well they know the next
position<00:02:36.830> they<00:02:37.310> have<00:02:37.700> so<00:02:37.910> much<00:02:38.030> experience

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
position they have so much experience

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.970 
position they have so much experience
and<00:02:38.750> they've<00:02:38.870> seen<00:02:39.110> these<00:02:39.260> ideas<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:39.800> many

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
and they've seen these ideas so many

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.040 
and they've seen these ideas so many
times<00:02:40.280> they've<00:02:40.880> seen<00:02:41.090> ideas<00:02:41.480> that<00:02:41.750> work<00:02:41.900> in

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
times they've seen ideas that work in

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.410 
times they've seen ideas that work in
one<00:02:42.200> position<00:02:42.680> work<00:02:42.860> in<00:02:43.010> another<00:02:43.190> position<00:02:43.430> so

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
one position work in another position so

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.630 
one position work in another position so
once<00:02:45.230> you<00:02:45.380> really<00:02:45.710> learn<00:02:45.920> an<00:02:46.070> idea<00:02:46.430> and

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
once you really learn an idea and

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.550 
once you really learn an idea and
memorize<00:02:47.000> an<00:02:47.150> idea<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:47.630> can<00:02:47.660> apply<00:02:48.110> that<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.410> a

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
memorize an idea you can apply that to a

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.110 
memorize an idea you can apply that to a
million<00:02:49.040> different<00:02:49.160> positions<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.820> lot<00:02:49.940> of<00:02:50.000> the

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
million different positions a lot of the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.480 
million different positions a lot of the
times<00:02:50.360> and<00:02:50.570> that's<00:02:51.140> why<00:02:51.400> when<00:02:52.400> you're

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
times and that's why when you're

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.430 
times and that's why when you're
studying<00:02:52.760> in<00:02:53.060> games<00:02:53.330> I<00:02:53.510> think<00:02:53.570> if<00:02:53.780> you<00:02:54.170> start

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
studying in games I think if you start

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.560 
studying in games I think if you start
with<00:02:54.530> some<00:02:54.740> basic<00:02:55.250> position<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:55.880> then<00:02:56.360> move

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
with some basic position and then move

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.150 
with some basic position and then move
to<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:56.750> next<00:02:56.840> most<00:02:57.230> advanced<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:57.770> then<00:02:57.980> then

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
to the next most advanced and then then

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.800 
to the next most advanced and then then
move<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:58.580> next<00:02:58.700> most<00:02:59.030> advanced<00:02:59.300> and<00:02:59.420> so<00:02:59.630> on

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
move to the next most advanced and so on

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.480 
move to the next most advanced and so on
and<00:02:59.960> so<00:03:00.080> forth<00:03:00.380> all<00:03:00.530> of<00:03:00.650> a<00:03:00.980> sudden<00:03:01.220> you<00:03:01.310> find

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
and so forth all of a sudden you find

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.520 
and so forth all of a sudden you find
yourself<00:03:01.970> looking<00:03:02.120> at<00:03:02.360> a<00:03:02.420> position<00:03:02.870> with<00:03:03.500> a

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
yourself looking at a position with a

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.520 
yourself looking at a position with a
number<00:03:04.280> of<00:03:04.400> pieces<00:03:04.610> on<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.940> board<00:03:05.380> what<00:03:06.380> would

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
number of pieces on the board what would

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.600 
number of pieces on the board what would
seem<00:03:06.800> very<00:03:07.070> would<00:03:07.340> have<00:03:07.430> seemed<00:03:07.580> very

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
seem very would have seemed very

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.640 
seem very would have seemed very
complicated<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:08.630> you<00:03:08.720> maybe<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:08.990> month<00:03:09.260> before

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
complicated to you maybe a month before

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.530 
complicated to you maybe a month before
that<00:03:09.680> but<00:03:10.370> now<00:03:10.520> you<00:03:10.550> look<00:03:10.850> at<00:03:10.970> this<00:03:11.090> position

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
that but now you look at this position

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.840 
that but now you look at this position
with<00:03:11.660> a<00:03:11.690> very<00:03:11.990> clear<00:03:12.320> idea<00:03:12.350> of<00:03:12.920> not<00:03:13.490> only<00:03:13.520> how

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
with a very clear idea of not only how

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.150 
with a very clear idea of not only how
you're<00:03:14.030> gonna<00:03:14.090> win<00:03:14.420> it<00:03:14.570> but<00:03:15.200> but<00:03:15.590> exactly<00:03:15.890> what

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
you're gonna win it but but exactly what

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.830 
you're gonna win it but but exactly what
the<00:03:16.310> steps<00:03:16.520> are<00:03:16.670> going<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:16.850> be<00:03:16.910> because<00:03:17.660> you've

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
the steps are going to be because you've

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.210 
the steps are going to be because you've
solved<00:03:18.200> it<00:03:18.260> in<00:03:18.410> this<00:03:18.530> backwards<00:03:18.980> to<00:03:19.070> forwards

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
solved it in this backwards to forwards

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.430 
solved it in this backwards to forwards
method<00:03:19.730> so<00:03:20.420> coming<00:03:20.720> back<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:20.990> what<00:03:21.110> I'm<00:03:21.200> saying

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
method so coming back to what I'm saying

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.710 
method so coming back to what I'm saying
here<00:03:21.710> is<00:03:21.800> that<00:03:21.830> this<00:03:22.100> Lucena<00:03:22.610> position<00:03:23.120> is<00:03:23.330> a

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
here is that this Lucena position is a

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.720 
here is that this Lucena position is a
very<00:03:24.110> is<00:03:24.380> a<00:03:24.440> very<00:03:24.770> important<00:03:25.190> position<00:03:25.340> for

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
very is a very important position for

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.720 
very is a very important position for
that

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730
