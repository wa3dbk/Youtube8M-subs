00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.430
 These questions were asked by a boy and I tried to answer as a philosopher 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.079
 because we are human beings and animals 

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:11.479
 because it's me and the urban 

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:13.410
 the questions are very interesting 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.520
 I answered it seems to me that they raise very different things I will say that what 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.199
 I think that my point of view pivote puerperals 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.119
 If you think of relief 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.679
 I think the important thing is the charlatan and I've been thinking together for you 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:28.679
 you said you think it's okay and what does not seem right 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.620
 first ask why are we human beings and animals 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.730
 I think we are both 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.210
 we are human beings but human beings are animals 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.790
 both expressions 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.140
 with things different from other animals but as animals as a tiger 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.460
 compact 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.560
 we are body endowed with life that one day we are going to die we have functions 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.840
 organic like eating sleep yawning sighing we reproduce sexually 70 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.450
 and how animals are part of a chain of life that goes from the 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.300
 smaller organisms to the most complex 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.300
 it is true that we are rare animals that we invent internet and the atomic bomb 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.740
 but that does not make us escape from nature 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.740
 everything that man produces is part of nature 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.530
 but it seems to me that what you want to raise appears more clearly the 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.100
 second question that is a classic garment within philosophy because 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.840
 it's me and not a pigeon 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.270
 the philosophers ask why I am and there was no other thing 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.700
 and I think that question has no answer 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.360
 philosophy and one known by the philosopher believes that everything throws a 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.360
 answer and it can be explained and the truth is that it is not like that 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.070
 because we are but another person a dove has no explanation 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.930
 I think the question expresses the naturally important astonishment of the human being 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:43.960
 What is it 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.220
 in such a strange universe so complex 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.650
 the truth is that those calpino juan 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.510
 vidal other and that your body of the girl who will then be woman's body 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.910
 this reality 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.410
 that reality raises many questions and does not fail to cause amazement 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.830
 marvel 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.340
 I propose to you that the question is the issue is not so much because they are who I am 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.370
 yes no who am 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.410
 and even that is the question is not answered directly but through 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.119
 the things that one wants 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:13.219
 about us 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:17.829
 to know you ask you what things you like what to undo 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.829
 so to present that fip what future you project 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:25.489
 What you want is what will define you and what will shape you as the person 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.169
 that grows and advances 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:31.059
 Well I hope my answer is that they have not served anything we can 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:34.419
 keep thinking if you ask me a new chabot question and thanks
