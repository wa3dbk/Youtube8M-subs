I<00:00:22.619> never<00:00:23.279> liked<00:00:23.640> shark<00:00:24.029> products<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.689> past

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
I never liked shark products in the past

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.140 
I never liked shark products in the past
but<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.859> tried<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.310> one<00:00:26.460> out<00:00:26.580> just<00:00:26.910> because<00:00:27.000> I

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
but I tried this one out just because I

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.279 
but I tried this one out just because I
liked<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.510> way<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.660> looked<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.170> was

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
liked the way it looked and I was

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.019 
liked the way it looked and I was
intrigued<00:00:28.650> by<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.890> cordless<00:00:29.220> abilities<00:00:29.789> and

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
intrigued by the cordless abilities and

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.299 
intrigued by the cordless abilities and
I<00:00:30.720> liked<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.260> much<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.710> ended<00:00:31.980> up<00:00:32.070> not

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
I liked it so much that I ended up not

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.920 
I liked it so much that I ended up not
taking<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.910> back<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:33.270> threw<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.600> box<00:00:33.780> and

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
taking it back I threw the box and

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.440 
taking it back I threw the box and
receipt<00:00:34.230> away<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.559> kept<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.640> that's

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
receipt away and kept it so that's

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.170 
receipt away and kept it so that's
really<00:00:36.710> it<00:00:37.710> really<00:00:37.829> says<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.190> lot<00:00:38.280> because<00:00:38.670> I

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
really it really says a lot because I

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.660 
really it really says a lot because I
hate<00:00:39.840> shark<00:00:40.079> products<00:00:40.440> as<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> rule<00:00:40.860> they<00:00:41.640> are

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
hate shark products as a rule they are

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.770 
hate shark products as a rule they are
getting<00:00:41.940> better<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.270> think<00:00:42.510> they're<00:00:42.600> kind<00:00:42.750> of

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
getting better I think they're kind of

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.060 
getting better I think they're kind of
like<00:00:42.870> Hyundai<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.290> Kia<00:00:43.500> where<00:00:43.739> they<00:00:43.829> started

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
like Hyundai and Kia where they started

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.319 
like Hyundai and Kia where they started
out<00:00:44.190> really<00:00:44.430> bad<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.940> they're<00:00:45.030> starting<00:00:45.210> to

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
out really bad and they're starting to

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.600 
out really bad and they're starting to
improve<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.780> little<00:00:45.899> bit<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.500> that's<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.430> good

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
improve a little bit so that's a good

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.850 
improve a little bit so that's a good
thing<00:00:47.670> but<00:00:48.510> they<00:00:49.079> say<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.410> thing<00:00:49.469> will<00:00:49.829> run

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
thing but they say this thing will run

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.240 
thing but they say this thing will run
for<00:00:50.340> 40<00:00:50.610> minutes<00:00:50.899> I<00:00:51.899> haven't<00:00:52.800> used<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.129> that

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
for 40 minutes I haven't used it that

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.189 
for 40 minutes I haven't used it that
much<00:00:53.430> because<00:00:53.640> my<00:00:53.850> place<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.210> small<00:00:54.329> so

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
much because my place is small so

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.720 
much because my place is small so
usually<00:00:55.739> I'll<00:00:55.829> use<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.100> for<00:00:56.250> five<00:00:56.399> or<00:00:56.430> ten

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
usually I'll use it for five or ten

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.490 
usually I'll use it for five or ten
minutes<00:00:57.000> at<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.149> time<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.600> then<00:00:57.690> stop<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.410> it

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
minutes at a time and then stop but it

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.049 
minutes at a time and then stop but it
does<00:00:58.680> charge<00:00:58.980> pretty<00:00:59.250> quickly<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.699> charges

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
does charge pretty quickly it charges

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.970 
does charge pretty quickly it charges
within<00:01:00.239> maybe<00:01:00.510> three<00:01:00.809> hours<00:01:00.960> or<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.320> and

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
within maybe three hours or so and

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.770 
within maybe three hours or so and
that's<00:01:02.640> what<00:01:02.789> they<00:01:02.910> say<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.239> will<00:01:03.329> charge<00:01:03.600> in

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
that's what they say it will charge in

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.630 
that's what they say it will charge in
so<00:01:03.989> that's<00:01:04.110> that's<00:01:04.350> good<00:01:04.500> but<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.460> has<00:01:05.610> a

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
so that's that's good but it has a

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.370 
so that's that's good but it has a
button<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.360> bottom<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.780> that's<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.049> only

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
button on the bottom and that's the only

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.649 
button on the bottom and that's the only
real<00:01:08.159> button<00:01:08.400> or<00:01:08.580> control<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> thing<00:01:09.450> but

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
real button or control on the thing but

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.080 
real button or control on the thing but
it's<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.260> button<00:01:10.590> here<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.220> press<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.490> to

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
it's a button here and you press that to

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.480 
it's a button here and you press that to
turn<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> machine<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:12.869> or<00:01:13.200> off<00:01:13.439> or<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.220> turn<00:01:14.369> it

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
turn the machine on or off or to turn it

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.249 
turn the machine on or off or to turn it
on<00:01:14.549> too<00:01:14.760> little<00:01:14.939> speed<00:01:15.299> for<00:01:15.570> bare<00:01:15.720> floors<00:01:16.020> and

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
on too little speed for bare floors and

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.620 
on too little speed for bare floors and
that<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:17.280> slows<00:01:17.490> down<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.909> brushroll<00:01:18.299> and

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
that just slows down the brushroll and

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.960 
that just slows down the brushroll and
the<00:01:18.750> suction<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.130> don't<00:01:20.340> get<00:01:20.490> dirt<00:01:20.729> going

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
the suction so you don't get dirt going

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.749 
the suction so you don't get dirt going
everywhere<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:22.229> does<00:01:22.470> not<00:01:22.799> however<00:01:23.189> turn<00:01:23.640> off

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
everywhere it does not however turn off

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.940 
everywhere it does not however turn off
the<00:01:23.939> brushroll<00:01:24.270> but<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.020> brush<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:25.650> soft

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
the brushroll but the brush is so soft

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.230 
the brushroll but the brush is so soft
that<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.250> really<00:01:26.460> doesn't<00:01:26.640> kick<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.090> dirt

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
that it really doesn't kick the dirt

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.960 
that it really doesn't kick the dirt
back<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:28.619> wheels<00:01:28.799> are<00:01:29.009> replicated<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:29.790> that's

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
back the wheels are replicated so that's

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
is to see a replaceable battery but this

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.690 
is to see a replaceable battery but this

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
make sure that the machine is actually

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.030 
make sure that the machine is actually
you<00:01:57.659> know<00:01:57.780> centered<00:01:58.140> over<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.439> big<00:01:58.590> stuff<00:01:58.860> so

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
you know centered over the big stuff so

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.560 
you know centered over the big stuff so
it<00:01:59.159> doesn't<00:01:59.369> push<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.640> out<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.880> way<00:02:00.030> but

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
it doesn't push it out of the way but

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.910 
it doesn't push it out of the way but
then<00:02:00.659> it's<00:02:00.810> got<00:02:00.960> these<00:02:01.049> little<00:02:01.110> bars<00:02:01.560> here

fast<00:03:03.670> as<00:03:03.880> you<00:03:03.970> can<00:03:04.090> see<00:03:04.300> I<00:03:04.330> just<00:03:04.630> washed<00:03:04.870> this

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
fast as you can see I just washed this

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.050 
fast as you can see I just washed this
two<00:03:05.320> days<00:03:05.500> ago<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:06.220> it's<00:03:06.400> already<00:03:06.520> dirty

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
two days ago and it's already dirty

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.240 
two days ago and it's already dirty
so<00:03:07.270> the<00:03:07.540> system's<00:03:08.170> not<00:03:08.350> sealed<00:03:08.620> very<00:03:08.860> well<00:03:09.070> but

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
so the system's not sealed very well but

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.830 
so the system's not sealed very well but
it's<00:03:09.370> just<00:03:09.490> a<00:03:09.640> quick<00:03:09.790> vac<00:03:10.090> it's<00:03:10.300> not<00:03:10.510> anything

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
it's just a quick vac it's not anything

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.320 
it's just a quick vac it's not anything
that<00:03:11.080> isn't<00:03:11.650> it<00:03:11.709> to<00:03:11.890> replace<00:03:12.130> a<00:03:12.220> big<00:03:12.550> vacuum<00:03:12.760> so

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
that isn't it to replace a big vacuum so

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.880 
that isn't it to replace a big vacuum so
I<00:03:13.660> don't<00:03:14.650> expect<00:03:15.010> perfection<00:03:16.410> now<00:03:17.410> that<00:03:17.739> was

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
I don't expect perfection now that was

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.710 
I don't expect perfection now that was
just<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:18.220> get<00:03:18.790> that<00:03:18.880> filter<00:03:19.209> out<00:03:19.239> that<00:03:19.510> top

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
just to get that filter out that top

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.270 
just to get that filter out that top
release<00:03:20.230> there<00:03:20.530> if<00:03:20.620> you<00:03:20.709> want<00:03:20.860> to<00:03:20.980> release<00:03:21.220> it

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
release there if you want to release it

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.830

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
they copied when they did this but let's

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.690 
they copied when they did this but let's
put<00:03:28.150> that<00:03:28.330> back<00:03:28.660> a<00:03:29.280> lot<00:03:30.280> of<00:03:30.340> people<00:03:30.550> have<00:03:30.670> a

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
problem with this power switch I

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.780 
problem with this power switch I
actually<00:03:32.320> like<00:03:32.739> this<00:03:32.950> power<00:03:33.160> switch<00:03:33.370> because

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
actually like this power switch because

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.150 
actually like this power switch because
I<00:03:33.820> like<00:03:34.030> foot<00:03:34.239> switches<00:03:34.480> but<00:03:34.870> it<00:03:35.170> is<00:03:35.739> easy<00:03:35.920> to

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
I like foot switches but it is easy to

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.000

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
piece of low furniture you can actually

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.199 
piece of low furniture you can actually
hit<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:41.050> the<00:03:41.410> furniture<00:03:41.890> and<00:03:42.100> the<00:03:42.970> button

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
hit the the furniture and the button

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:44.880 
hit the the furniture and the button
together<00:03:43.390> and<00:03:43.870> make<00:03:44.080> the<00:03:44.230> Machine<00:03:44.500> turn<00:03:44.709> off

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
together and make the Machine turn off

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.310 
together and make the Machine turn off
inadvertently<00:03:45.580> so<00:03:45.820> not<00:03:46.180> a<00:03:46.209> good<00:03:46.390> thing<00:03:46.660> but<00:03:47.050> it

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.760 
but and I'm having to use my left hand
for<00:05:08.300> this<00:05:08.539> because<00:05:08.810> of<00:05:09.020> this<00:05:09.110> new<00:05:09.259> camera<00:05:09.500> I

for use in right hands it's funny

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.330 
for use in right hands it's funny
because<00:05:15.199> I've<00:05:15.349> always<00:05:15.500> used<00:05:15.710> the<00:05:15.949> cell<00:05:16.159> phone

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
because I've always used the cell phone

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.860 

okay<00:06:14.580> and<00:06:14.849> then<00:06:14.940> we<00:06:15.030> can<00:06:15.180> see<00:06:15.360> the<00:06:15.479> dirt<00:06:15.660> right

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
okay and then we can see the dirt right

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.370 
okay and then we can see the dirt right
in<00:06:15.930> there<00:06:17.449> of<00:06:18.449> course<00:06:18.509> it's<00:06:18.810> not<00:06:18.930> as<00:06:19.050> pretty<00:06:19.259> as

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
in there of course it's not as pretty as

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.249 
in there of course it's not as pretty as
it<00:06:19.560> is<00:06:19.650> on<00:06:19.800> the<00:06:19.889> box<00:06:20.130> because<00:06:20.669> on<00:06:21.569> the<00:06:21.690> box

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:22.259 
it is on the box because on the box

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:24.170 
it is on the box because on the box
it's<00:06:22.560> all<00:06:22.800> clear<00:06:23.220> they<00:06:23.490> vacuum<00:06:23.849> within<00:06:24.090> the

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
it's all clear they vacuum within the

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.490 
it's all clear they vacuum within the
dirt<00:06:24.300> doesn't<00:06:24.479> go<00:06:24.690> inside<00:06:24.990> of<00:06:25.139> it<00:06:25.229> because

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
dirt doesn't go inside of it because

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.570 
dirt doesn't go inside of it because
they<00:06:25.650> want<00:06:25.770> to<00:06:25.830> make<00:06:25.919> it<00:06:26.009> look<00:06:26.099> pretty

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
they want to make it look pretty

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.390 
they want to make it look pretty
so<00:06:26.759> bagless<00:06:27.690> is<00:06:27.840> not<00:06:28.020> pretty<00:06:28.259> it's<00:06:28.470> messy<00:06:28.889> so

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
so bagless is not pretty it's messy so

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.960 
so bagless is not pretty it's messy so
just<00:06:29.880> know<00:06:30.870> that<00:06:31.190> but<00:06:32.190> they<00:06:32.520> really<00:06:32.759> didn't

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970 
just know that but they really didn't

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.839 
just know that but they really didn't
promote<00:06:33.120> this<00:06:33.389> thing<00:06:33.449> very<00:06:33.840> well<00:06:34.849> because

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:35.849 
promote this thing very well because

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:37.570 
promote this thing very well because
there<00:06:36.090> was<00:06:36.270> no<00:06:36.419> infomercial<00:06:36.840> about<00:06:37.199> it<00:06:37.349> and

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
there was no infomercial about it and

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.620 
there was no infomercial about it and
there<00:06:38.580> was<00:06:38.729> just<00:06:38.910> there<00:06:39.240> wasn't<00:06:39.389> a<00:06:39.479> lot<00:06:39.599> of

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.630 
there was just there wasn't a lot of

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.779 
there was just there wasn't a lot of
advertising<00:06:40.139> about<00:06:40.319> it<00:06:40.590> which<00:06:41.400> is<00:06:41.580> really

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:41.789 
advertising about it which is really

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:43.490 
advertising about it which is really
surprising<00:06:42.030> because<00:06:42.720> it's<00:06:42.870> a<00:06:42.930> pretty<00:06:43.319> good

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 
surprising because it's a pretty good

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.230 
surprising because it's a pretty good
vacuum<00:06:43.889> for<00:06:44.099> being<00:06:44.250> cordless<00:06:44.639> I<00:06:44.819> really<00:06:45.060> like

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.020 
it looks like on the charger and that'll

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.610 
it looks like on the charger and that'll
