think<00:00:11.900> about<00:00:12.200> being<00:00:12.559> around<00:00:13.430> a<00:00:13.730> fireplace<00:00:14.120> and

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:14.930 
think about being around a fireplace and

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.700 
think about being around a fireplace and
snuggling<00:00:15.860> in<00:00:16.040> with<00:00:16.190> big<00:00:16.430> sweaters<00:00:17.000> and
