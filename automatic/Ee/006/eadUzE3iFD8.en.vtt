00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.140
 ah 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:13.200
 for humanity today 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.950
 felt of any color 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.910
 stapler a mold in the form of a cloud 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.950
 decorative paper and silicone cardboard 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.259
 we take our cardboard boxes and go 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:29.030
 to take our mold with marker 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:32.680
 black and we will highlight 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.680
 our our mold 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.720
 we will do the same with the two layers and what 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.730
 we will cut once we have finished 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.860
 of cutting us to two layers of cardboard in 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.090
 shape of cloud let's take our 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.630
 decorative paper 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.200
 and we are going to cover the distant ones by the two 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.090
 sides 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.300
 once we have finished forming 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:04.750
 our two faces of our clouds 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.460
 remember that you have to put two 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.740
 squares or rectangles more like 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:14.280
 legs to our clouds 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.960
 so you can do support at the time 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.500
 that we put the next one next 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.600
 cardboard we are going to take another cardboard and what 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.600
 we're going to fold in half this way 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.050
 let's mark that sharpness 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:36.020
 in our 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.020
 in our cardboard we take the procurador 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.580
 and we mark the vee 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.000
 thus 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.050
 and we will do the same in the next 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.050
 we take the ub 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.840
 this 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:05.920
 and the same angle that we have marked 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.920
 we are going to mark it 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.210
 here 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.620
 thus 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.620
 now let's take the cutter 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.620
 and we are going to cut out the great granddaughter 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:37.430
 let's close this part we can place 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.430
 the felt 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.460
 and we train 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:48.060
 what are these parts 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:51.560
 we can take the silicon right now to 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.560
 stapler to catch this 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.650
 this part of our canton are we going 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.650
 to catch 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.120
 once we have also cut this 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.800
 part of the mass with this lack of 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.800
 carton we have formed 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.820
 and we are going to introduce it 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.820
 little by little 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.049
 picks them up with silicones and let's go 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.049
 sticking a little bit 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.250
 once we have already achieved 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.640
 stabilize the already we can put 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.640
 our books 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.800
 and that would be the end of our bad 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.120
 I hope you liked it and I do not 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.120
 we do until the next video
