things<00:00:28.660> really<00:00:28.930> one<00:00:29.349> the<00:00:29.560> controls<00:00:30.149> it

00:00:31.139 --> 00:00:31.149 
things really one the controls it

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:33.540 
things really one the controls it
doesn't<00:00:31.540> have<00:00:31.750> you<00:00:32.560> know<00:00:32.590> how<00:00:33.040> every<00:00:33.370> game

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
doesn't have you know how every game

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.910 
doesn't have you know how every game
every<00:00:34.090> every<00:00:34.540> game<00:00:34.720> how<00:00:35.020> you<00:00:35.290> use<00:00:35.649> the<00:00:35.770> right

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
every every game how you use the right

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.650 
every every game how you use the right
stick<00:00:36.160> and<00:00:36.340> you<00:00:36.399> can<00:00:36.430> you<00:00:37.180> straight<00:00:37.420> with<00:00:37.600> the

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
stick and you can you straight with the

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.940 
stick and you can you straight with the
left<00:00:37.840> stick<00:00:37.989> move<00:00:38.320> the<00:00:38.440> camera<00:00:38.710> with<00:00:38.740> the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
left stick move the camera with the

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.380 
left stick move the camera with the
right<00:00:38.980> stick<00:00:39.310> you<00:00:39.430> know<00:00:39.520> move<00:00:39.700> forward<00:00:39.730> you

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
right stick you know move forward you

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.060 
right stick you know move forward you
know<00:00:40.540> that<00:00:41.080> it's<00:00:41.170> just<00:00:41.320> like<00:00:41.440> a<00:00:41.470> standardized

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
know that it's just like a standardized

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.160 
know that it's just like a standardized
control<00:00:42.460> system<00:00:42.850> now<00:00:43.030> basically<00:00:43.240> ya<00:00:43.780> mannan

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
control system now basically ya mannan

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.630 
control system now basically ya mannan
there's<00:00:44.410> an<00:00:44.500> controller<00:00:44.770> that<00:00:45.010> fuel<00:00:45.550> no

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
there's an controller that fuel no

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.190 
there's an controller that fuel no
strength<00:00:45.880> you<00:00:46.030> have<00:00:46.150> to<00:00:46.270> hold<00:00:46.450> the<00:00:46.750> trigger

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
strength you have to hold the trigger

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.260 
strength you have to hold the trigger
button<00:00:47.410> and<00:00:47.710> then<00:00:48.040> like<00:00:48.310> that<00:00:48.610> allows<00:00:49.000> you<00:00:49.240> to

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
button and then like that allows you to

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.690 
button and then like that allows you to
strafe<00:00:49.630> so<00:00:50.200> just<00:00:50.530> simple<00:00:51.130> movement<00:00:51.520> through

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:51.700 
strafe so just simple movement through

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.640 
strafe so just simple movement through
the<00:00:51.730> world<00:00:52.000> is<00:00:52.180> so<00:00:52.360> complicated<00:00:52.780> I<00:00:53.290> don't

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
the world is so complicated I don't

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.680 
the world is so complicated I don't
remember<00:00:53.830> being<00:00:54.040> a<00:00:54.100> problem<00:00:54.280> at<00:00:54.490> the<00:00:54.520> time<00:00:54.760> but

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
remember being a problem at the time but

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.300 
remember being a problem at the time but
that's<00:00:55.840> because<00:00:56.290> there<00:00:56.680> were<00:00:56.770> all<00:00:57.040> different

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.310 
that's because there were all different

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.950 
that's because there were all different
ways<00:00:57.640> of<00:00:57.820> controlling<00:00:58.120> games<00:00:58.510> back<00:00:58.780> then

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
ways of controlling games back then

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.650 
ways of controlling games back then
which<00:00:59.290> there<00:00:59.500> really<00:00:59.770> aren't<00:01:00.010> any<00:01:00.160> more<00:01:00.370> so<00:01:01.240> so

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
which there really aren't any more so so

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.840 
which there really aren't any more so so
that<00:01:01.840> was<00:01:01.990> like<00:01:02.140> a<00:01:02.200> a<00:01:02.710> real<00:01:03.040> barrier<00:01:03.340> at<00:01:03.610> first

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
that was like a a real barrier at first

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.539 
that was like a a real barrier at first
to<00:01:04.269> get<00:01:04.600> my<00:01:04.659> head<00:01:04.780> round<00:01:04.900> and<00:01:05.220> then<00:01:06.220> I'm<00:01:06.340> still

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
to get my head round and then I'm still

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:08.100 
to get my head round and then I'm still
really<00:01:06.820> impressed<00:01:07.150> by<00:01:07.299> the<00:01:07.360> tone<00:01:07.689> of<00:01:07.720> it<00:01:07.990> it's

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
really impressed by the tone of it it's

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
year old ps2 game conduct these days

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.959 
year old ps2 game conduct these days
yeah<00:01:20.859> but<00:01:20.979> it<00:01:21.069> was<00:01:21.189> always<00:01:21.460> meant<00:01:21.609> to<00:01:21.759> look

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:21.969 
yeah but it was always meant to look

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:24.450 
yeah but it was always meant to look
like<00:01:22.030> a<00:01:22.240> grubby<00:01:22.600> old<00:01:22.689> VHS<00:01:23.380> video<00:01:23.799> anyway<00:01:24.189> yeah

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
like a grubby old VHS video anyway yeah

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.730 
like a grubby old VHS video anyway yeah
it<00:01:24.909> does<00:01:25.119> but<00:01:25.329> you<00:01:25.359> know<00:01:25.569> it<00:01:26.020> just<00:01:26.049> in<00:01:26.380> terms<00:01:26.590> of

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
it does but you know it just in terms of

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.349 
it does but you know it just in terms of
not<00:01:27.039> not<00:01:27.579> in<00:01:27.700> terms<00:01:27.850> of<00:01:27.939> the<00:01:27.999> detail

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:28.359 
not not in terms of the detail

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:29.669 
not not in terms of the detail
necessarily<00:01:28.899> just<00:01:29.079> in<00:01:29.170> terms<00:01:29.350> of<00:01:29.530> that<00:01:29.619> you

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679 
necessarily just in terms of that you

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:31.080 
necessarily just in terms of that you
can<00:01:29.889> see<00:01:30.100> how<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.340> levels<00:01:30.700> are<00:01:30.819> put<00:01:30.969> together

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
can see how the levels are put together

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.179 
can see how the levels are put together
like<00:01:31.420> levels<00:01:31.780> whereas<00:01:32.109> these<00:01:32.319> days<00:01:32.530> things

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
like levels whereas these days things

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:34.709 
like levels whereas these days things
tend<00:01:33.429> to<00:01:33.460> look<00:01:33.579> a<00:01:33.700> little<00:01:33.819> more<00:01:34.030> organic<00:01:34.509> you

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:34.719 
tend to look a little more organic you

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:36.300 
tend to look a little more organic you
know<00:01:35.170> you<00:01:35.259> can<00:01:35.380> just<00:01:35.530> see<00:01:35.649> that<00:01:35.679> like<00:01:36.159> the

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
know you can just see that like the

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.969 
know you can just see that like the
joins<00:01:36.579> and<00:01:36.939> the<00:01:36.999> angles<00:01:37.389> of<00:01:37.740> tunnels<00:01:38.740> and

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
joins and the angles of tunnels and

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.899 
joins and the angles of tunnels and
corridors<00:01:39.280> and<00:01:39.819> courtyards<00:01:40.740> but<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.850> know

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
corridors and courtyards but you know

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.510 
corridors and courtyards but you know
the<00:01:43.090> tone<00:01:43.810> and<00:01:44.079> the<00:01:44.139> mood<00:01:44.289> is<00:01:44.709> still<00:01:45.039> one<00:01:45.399> of

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
the tone and the mood is still one of

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
long did it take you to get over the

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
long did it take you to get over the
issues<00:02:51.099> with<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.310> controls<00:02:52.019> mmm<00:02:53.220> 10<00:02:54.220> minutes

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
issues with the controls mmm 10 minutes

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.390 
issues with the controls mmm 10 minutes
I'm<00:02:55.030> pretty<00:02:55.900> because<00:02:56.800> sometimes<00:02:57.130> I<00:02:57.340> play

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
I'm pretty because sometimes I play

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.729 
I'm pretty because sometimes I play
inverted<00:02:58.000> generally<00:02:58.630> sometimes<00:02:59.140> you<00:02:59.650> know

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
inverted generally sometimes you know

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.440 
inverted generally sometimes you know
you<00:02:59.980> can't<00:03:00.190> play<00:03:00.340> inverted<00:03:00.819> right<00:03:01.030> yeah

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
you can't play inverted right yeah

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.020 
you can't play inverted right yeah
whether<00:03:01.930> it<00:03:02.110> be<00:03:02.260> your<00:03:02.890> Russia<00:03:03.310> press<00:03:03.640> event<00:03:03.910> or

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
whether it be your Russia press event or

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.190 
whether it be your Russia press event or
the<00:03:04.120> game<00:03:04.269> doesn't<00:03:04.600> support<00:03:04.810> it<00:03:04.989> or<00:03:05.080> whatever

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
the game doesn't support it or whatever

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.900 
the game doesn't support it or whatever
so<00:03:05.799> I've<00:03:05.920> accepted<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.459> fact<00:03:06.489> that<00:03:06.700> sometimes

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
so I've accepted the fact that sometimes

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.910 
so I've accepted the fact that sometimes
I've<00:03:07.239> just<00:03:07.360> got<00:03:07.540> to<00:03:07.630> accept<00:03:08.590> that<00:03:08.650> I'm<00:03:08.769> gonna

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
I've just got to accept that I'm gonna

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.630 
I've just got to accept that I'm gonna
be<00:03:09.040> cumbersome<00:03:09.430> with<00:03:10.330> controlling<00:03:10.690> games<00:03:11.019> and

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
be cumbersome with controlling games and

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.280 
be cumbersome with controlling games and
yeah<00:03:12.640> so<00:03:13.060> I<00:03:13.090> just<00:03:13.360> got<00:03:13.780> my<00:03:13.870> head<00:03:13.989> around<00:03:14.019> it

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
yeah so I just got my head around it

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.210 
yeah so I just got my head around it
thankfully<00:03:14.530> early<00:03:14.920> on

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
thankfully early on

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.850
