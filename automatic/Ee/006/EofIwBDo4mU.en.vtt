00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.600
 I will display a series of numbers and remember them when I ask you about them. ready? 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.320
 6,3,4,7,1,5,2 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.949
 This is the image of my dog, which in my opinion seems ridiculous 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.459
 Do you remember the series of numbers? 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.250
 If you remember all seven numbers in the right order, your working memory, well it works. 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.800
 But there are people who have trouble repeating those numbers. 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.841
 Known for having a terrible memory, 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.079
 This is Henry Mulasson, also known as "Patient H.", one of the most famous patients in science 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.250
 Mentality. 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.350
 As a child, H. hit his head and began to feel sick. And it is getting worse and worse 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.070
 When he was 27 years old, he underwent e. M for surgery on part of the temporal lobe containing the hippocampus 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.879
 He was pulled out of his head. 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.160
 It was in the early 1950s, and no one was sure what would happen next. 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.020
 His spells stopped. M, but he is suffering from forgetfulness 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.900
 He could not retrieve and recall the few years' information that had passed before the surgery. 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.710
 The researchers felt puzzled. He can remember some things and forget about others so they decided to study the case of Hm. 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.759
 To try to synthesize his behavior. 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.519
 Without the hippocampus, H. could not store his memories clearly 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.460
 Our memories are about facts like phone number or dog breed. 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.160
 But he can retain procedural memories - those responsible for learning skills, such as riding a bike. 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.060
 H. kept repeating tasks where he used the mirror only to see the reflection of his hand 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.090
 It draws a shape between two lines. And to implement his motor skills to maintain and improve this task 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.170
 Although he has no memory of completing it before. 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.809
 Researchers have discovered the existence of these different types of memory. 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.060
 And they depend on different areas of the brain. 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.909
 When identification memories are formed, information passes to the hippocampus before it unites 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.090
 It is stored permanently. 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.340
 When procedural memories form, they depend on other regions: the cerebellum 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.259
 And the base contract. 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.719
 Without hippocampus hm forgets very important parts. 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.580
 H.'s case helped us understand the nature of memory, as there are different types of it 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.580
 Which depend on different parts of the brain. 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.640
 His brain was a big deal in 2009 after he passed away part of his brain to 2401 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.780
 Slide the paper thinly and reconstruct it into a three-dimensional model. 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.260
 More than 60 years have passed since the hippocampus was first extracted from his brain 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.790
 We are still learning from H.H. 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.100
 The last thing! Do you remember that series of numbers? 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:51.120
 If you have forgotten, 6,3,4,7,1,5,2. Do not worry. You will not even remember EM 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.980
 If I ask you about it in the first place. 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.400
 Oh, here's another picture of my dog ​​and if you remember it. 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.640
 Maybe you want to see it again. 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.360
 Looks good. 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:13.810
