we're gonna pop that in the oven it

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.659 
we're gonna pop that in the oven it
should<00:05:24.000> be<00:05:24.180> gas<00:05:24.750> mark<00:05:25.050> 6<00:05:25.350> about<00:05:25.830> 200<00:05:26.370> degrees

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669

should be gas mark 6 about 200 degrees
Celsius<00:05:27.120> or<00:05:27.360> 400<00:05:27.930> degrees<00:05:28.350> Fahrenheit<00:05:29.100> now

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
Celsius or 400 degrees Fahrenheit now

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:35.690
