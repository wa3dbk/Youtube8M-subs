how to make the tactical light on the
nerf<00:00:07.859> n-strike<00:00:08.809> recon<00:00:09.809> CX<00:00:10.679> looks<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.610> lot

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
nerf n-strike recon CX looks a lot

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.110 
nerf n-strike recon CX looks a lot
brighter<00:00:12.870> because<00:00:13.170> if<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.130> have<00:00:14.670> one<00:00:14.969> you

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
brighter because if you have one you

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.180 
brighter because if you have one you
know<00:00:15.269> that<00:00:15.299> this<00:00:16.199> little<00:00:16.350> light<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:16.920> comes

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
know that this little light that comes

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.660 
know that this little light that comes
in<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.640> not<00:00:17.820> bright<00:00:18.150> at<00:00:18.600> all<00:00:19.100> this<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.310> like

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
in it is not bright at all this is like

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.540 
in it is not bright at all this is like
little<00:00:20.970> red<00:00:21.240> light<00:00:21.510> that's<00:00:21.900> crap<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:23.160> all<00:00:23.369> you

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
little red light that's crap so all you

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.140 
little red light that's crap so all you
really<00:00:23.580> do<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.180> cut<00:00:25.189> those<00:00:26.189> two<00:00:26.430> wires<00:00:26.640> there

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
really do is cut those two wires there

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.839 
really do is cut those two wires there
and<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:28.769> don't<00:00:28.920> have<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.279> put<00:00:29.429> longer<00:00:29.699> wires

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
and you don't have to put longer wires

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.930 
and you don't have to put longer wires
on<00:00:30.119> but<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.330> did<00:00:30.599> just<00:00:30.840> make<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.170> easier<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.940> I

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
on but I did just make it easier and I

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.840 
on but I did just make it easier and I
just<00:00:33.480> pretty<00:00:34.230> much<00:00:34.350> hooked<00:00:34.770> up<00:00:35.010> an<00:00:35.160> LED<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.700> it

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
just pretty much hooked up an LED to it

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.290 
just pretty much hooked up an LED to it
made<00:00:36.059> sure<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.420> port<00:00:36.690> polarity<00:00:37.649> was<00:00:37.829> right

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
made sure the port polarity was right

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:45.440 
made sure the port polarity was right
and<00:00:39.300> now<00:00:39.480> it's<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:40.320> lot<00:00:41.250> brighter<00:00:41.660> and<00:00:44.450> pretty

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
and now it's a lot brighter and pretty

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.729 
and now it's a lot brighter and pretty
much<00:00:45.539> just<00:00:45.600> gotta<00:00:45.960> unscrew<00:00:46.140> everything

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
much just gotta unscrew everything

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.100 
much just gotta unscrew everything
including<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> battery<00:00:47.640> cover<00:00:47.840> or<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:48.989> not

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
including the battery cover or it's not

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.900 
including the battery cover or it's not
gonna<00:00:49.289> come<00:00:49.469> off<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.920> don't<00:00:52.579> take<00:00:53.579> off<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
gonna come off you don't take off the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.549 
gonna come off you don't take off the
battery<00:00:54.180> cover<00:00:55.850> and<00:00:56.850> if<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.360> glue<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.140> LED

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
battery cover and if you glue on the LED

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.260 
battery cover and if you glue on the LED
on<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.829> very<00:00:59.010> end<00:00:59.129> like<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.430> did<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.940> cannot

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
on the very end like I did you cannot

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.720 
on the very end like I did you cannot
push<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.109> all<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.410> way<00:01:01.530> up<00:01:01.739> or<00:01:02.010> it'll<00:01:02.309> Bend<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
push it all the way up or it'll Bend the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.490 
push it all the way up or it'll Bend the
LED<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.300> I'll<00:01:03.480> break<00:01:03.719> off<00:01:05.570> so<00:01:06.570> don't<00:01:07.020> do<00:01:07.290> that

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
LED and I'll break off so don't do that

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.960 
LED and I'll break off so don't do that
if<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:10.010> glued<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.369> same<00:01:11.549> place<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.939> did

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
if you glued it in the same place I did

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.740 
if you glued it in the same place I did
I<00:01:12.360> don't<00:01:12.600> really<00:01:12.869> care<00:01:13.590> if<00:01:13.950> it's<00:01:14.790> up<00:01:15.000> there<00:01:15.570> or

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
I don't really care if it's up there or

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.420 
I don't really care if it's up there or
not<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:16.140> like<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.470> there<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.189> gets<00:01:17.310> a

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
not I like it there so that it gets a

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.020 
not I like it there so that it gets a
wider<00:01:19.490> floodlight<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.729> guess<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:23.030> you're

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
wider floodlight I guess and you're

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.050 
wider floodlight I guess and you're
gonna<00:01:24.150> want<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.509> take<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.840> thing<00:01:25.110> out<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
gonna want to take this thing out the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.600 
gonna want to take this thing out the
little<00:01:27.360> spring<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.829> little<00:01:29.130> orange<00:01:29.340> sin

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
little spring and the little orange sin

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.050 
little spring and the little orange sin
or<00:01:30.450> it'll<00:01:31.079> pop<00:01:31.409> out<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.610> you're<00:01:32.729> gonna<00:01:32.820> make

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
or it'll pop out so you're gonna make

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.990 
or it'll pop out so you're gonna make
sure<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:34.250> take<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.430> out<00:01:35.549> before<00:01:35.970> you

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
sure that you take it out before you

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.700 
sure that you take it out before you
take<00:01:36.630> everything<00:01:37.020> apart<00:01:37.670> and<00:01:38.990> it's<00:01:39.990> just<00:01:40.590> a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
take everything apart and it's just a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.090 
take everything apart and it's just a
matter<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.270> reassembling<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:43.070> and<00:01:46.100> putting

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
matter of reassembling it and putting

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.420 
matter of reassembling it and putting
all<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.310> parts<00:01:47.579> back<00:01:47.670> in

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.970 

we're<00:01:51.430> hoping<00:01:51.850> that<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:53.770> fits<00:01:54.190> on<00:01:54.370> here<00:01:55.980> like

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
we're hoping that this fits on here like

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:03.150 
we're hoping that this fits on here like
that<00:01:57.220> and<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.810> battery<00:02:02.140> cover<00:02:02.470> is<00:02:02.710> sometimes

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
that and the battery cover is sometimes

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.430 
that and the battery cover is sometimes
a<00:02:03.370> pain<00:02:03.670> to<00:02:04.530> get<00:02:05.530> on<00:02:05.680> and<00:02:05.920> I<00:02:06.040> think<00:02:06.130> I<00:02:07.440> have

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
a pain to get on and I think I have

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.560 
a pain to get on and I think I have
troubles<00:02:09.100> getting<00:02:09.310> it<00:02:09.490> on<00:02:09.580> another<00:02:09.910> why<00:02:10.180> but

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
troubles getting it on another why but

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.220 
troubles getting it on another why but
it's<00:02:10.780> just<00:02:11.020> very<00:02:11.700> annoying<00:02:12.750> trying<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:14.050> get

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
it's just very annoying trying to get

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:22.740 
it's just very annoying trying to get
the<00:02:15.120> battery<00:02:16.120> cover<00:02:16.360> on<00:02:17.130> but<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:20.080> I<00:02:20.890> think<00:02:21.750> you

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
the battery cover on but it I think you

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.750 
the battery cover on but it I think you
just<00:02:22.840> don't<00:02:23.320> worry<00:02:23.620> about<00:02:23.950> breaking<00:02:24.460> it

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
just don't worry about breaking it

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.400 
just don't worry about breaking it
because<00:02:24.970> it's<00:02:25.090> not<00:02:25.210> going<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.450> break<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:26.260> way

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
because it's not going to break the way

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.440 
because it's not going to break the way
because<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.160> got<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.430> put<00:02:27.580> it<00:02:27.670> on<00:02:27.760> kind<00:02:28.150> of<00:02:28.300> a

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
because you got to put it on kind of a

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.980 
because you got to put it on kind of a
weird<00:02:29.380> way<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:29.830> all<00:02:30.510> looks<00:02:31.510> like<00:02:31.690> it<00:02:31.810> might

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
weird way that all looks like it might

00:02:31.990 --> 00:03:21.360 
weird way that all looks like it might
very<00:02:32.200> good<00:02:32.410> or<00:02:32.560> something<00:03:19.709> so<00:03:20.709> I'm<00:03:21.130> going<00:03:21.340> to

screw in first and you stir it in a

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.020 
screw in first and you stir it in a
little<00:03:54.709> bit

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:12.970

bright<00:04:21.049> as<00:04:21.199> you<00:04:21.350> can<00:04:21.500> see<00:04:21.769> that's<00:04:22.010> the

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
bright as you can see that's the

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.350 
bright as you can see that's the
floodlight<00:04:22.789> and<00:04:22.820> if<00:04:23.090> you<00:04:23.210> pull<00:04:23.419> this<00:04:23.570> back<00:04:25.360> it

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
floodlight and if you pull this back it

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.490 
floodlight and if you pull this back it
makes<00:04:27.139> it<00:04:27.820> very<00:04:28.820> dim<00:04:29.510> and<00:04:29.870> actually<00:04:30.139> shuts<00:04:30.350> it

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
makes it very dim and actually shuts it

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.469 
makes it very dim and actually shuts it
off<00:04:30.620> for<00:04:30.860> some<00:04:30.949> reason<00:04:33.430> and<00:04:34.430> this<00:04:35.000> is<00:04:35.060> like

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
off for some reason and this is like

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:41.110 
off for some reason and this is like
focus<00:04:36.349> light<00:04:37.570> and<00:04:38.570> flip<00:04:38.900> light<00:04:39.139> so<00:04:40.120> it's

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
focus light and flip light so it's

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.159 
focus light and flip light so it's
