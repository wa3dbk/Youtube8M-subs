Kind<00:00:32.880> you're<00:00:33.450> definitely<00:00:33.660> going<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.020> need

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
Kind you're definitely going to need

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.620 
Kind you're definitely going to need
some<00:00:34.860> help<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.579> quick<00:00:35.880> trial<00:00:36.120> will<00:00:36.270> definitely

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
some help so quick trial will definitely

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.350 
some help so quick trial will definitely
give<00:00:36.750> any<00:00:36.930> advantage<00:00:37.399> this<00:00:38.399> thermal<00:00:39.059> sight

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
give any advantage this thermal sight

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.240 
give any advantage this thermal sight
I've<00:00:39.660> talked<00:00:39.960> about<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.350> before<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.950> really

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
I've talked about this before it really

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.520 
I've talked about this before it really
has<00:00:41.430> almost<00:00:41.790> no<00:00:42.090> recoil<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:43.020> you're<00:00:43.260> not<00:00:43.379> going

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
has almost no recoil so you're not going

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.619 
has almost no recoil so you're not going
to<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.739> any<00:00:43.920> problems<00:00:44.370> killing<00:00:44.579> people<00:00:45.059> but

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
to have any problems killing people but

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.299 
to have any problems killing people but
when<00:00:45.780> they<00:00:45.899> use<00:00:46.110> assassin<00:00:46.800> it's<00:00:46.980> going<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.160> be

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
when they use assassin it's going to be

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.270 
when they use assassin it's going to be
very<00:00:47.340> difficult<00:00:47.879> for<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:48.899> if<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.039> whole

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
very difficult for you so if the whole

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.100 
very difficult for you so if the whole
team<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.700> using<00:00:50.910> SAS<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.719> would<00:00:51.899> probably

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
team is using SAS and I would probably

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.260 
team is using SAS and I would probably
suggest<00:00:52.440> not<00:00:52.860> using<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.430> thermal<00:00:53.670> because<00:00:54.090> in

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
suggest not using the thermal because in

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.209 
suggest not using the thermal because in
that<00:00:54.420> way<00:00:54.629> you're<00:00:55.559> gonna<00:00:55.680> have<00:00:55.860> some<00:00:56.039> issues

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
that way you're gonna have some issues

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.209 
that way you're gonna have some issues
right<00:00:56.550> there<00:00:57.350> so<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.620> wanted<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.010> talk<00:00:59.190> about

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
right there so I wanted to talk about

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.340 
right there so I wanted to talk about
support<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.239> death<00:01:00.449> streaks<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.109> game

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
support and death streaks in this game

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.979 
support and death streaks in this game
and<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.829> actually<00:01:02.789> brought<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.329> up<00:01:03.420> on<00:01:03.600> Twitter

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
and I actually brought it up on Twitter

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.640 
and I actually brought it up on Twitter
and<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.280> an<00:01:05.489> idea<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.060> mine<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:07.560> know

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
and this is an idea of mine and you know

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.370 
and this is an idea of mine and you know
you<00:01:07.710> could<00:01:08.010> go<00:01:08.189> with<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.580> whatever<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.570> really

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
you could go with it whatever I really

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.320 
you could go with it whatever I really
don't<00:01:10.530> care<00:01:10.590> what's<00:01:11.369> your<00:01:11.520> opinion<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:12.119> it

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
don't care what's your opinion on it

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.320 
don't care what's your opinion on it
what<00:01:12.510> do<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.659> think<00:01:13.040> would<00:01:14.040> help<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.939> game

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
what do you think would help this game

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.539 
what do you think would help this game
overall<00:01:15.900> because<00:01:16.380> they're<00:01:17.100> going<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.280> patch

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
overall because they're going to patch

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.820 
overall because they're going to patch
things<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.509> are<00:01:18.689> mechanically<00:01:19.470> wrong<00:01:19.770> with

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
things that are mechanically wrong with

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.640 
things that are mechanically wrong with
the<00:01:20.040> game<00:01:20.340> first<00:01:20.960> because<00:01:21.960> there's<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.380> lot<00:01:22.619> of

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
the game first because there's a lot of

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.830 
the game first because there's a lot of
some<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> lot<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.400> issues<00:01:23.549> on<00:01:23.909> ps3<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.689> they

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
some a lot of issues on ps3 that they

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.840 
some a lot of issues on ps3 that they
need<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.140> address<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:26.009> they<00:01:26.189> haven't<00:01:26.490> got<00:01:26.640> to

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
need to address and they haven't got to

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.190 
need to address and they haven't got to
them<00:01:26.970> yet<00:01:27.000> which<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.630> believe<00:01:27.900> they're

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
them yet which I believe they're

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.160 
them yet which I believe they're
supposed<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.860> get<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.310> them<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.759> if<00:01:30.360> they<00:01:30.420> do

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
supposed to get to them and if they do

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.429 
supposed to get to them and if they do
get<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.220> them<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.700> they<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.090> know<00:01:33.119> fix<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.259> lot

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
get to them and they you know fix a lot

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.770 
get to them and they you know fix a lot
of<00:01:34.619> issues<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.130> then<00:01:35.579> they<00:01:35.759> start<00:01:36.299> working<00:01:36.630> on

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
of issues and then they start working on

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.080 
of issues and then they start working on
actual<00:01:37.770> things<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.130> we<00:01:38.340> want<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.700> see<00:01:38.850> change

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
actual things that we want to see change

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.600 
actual things that we want to see change
maybe<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.869> little<00:01:40.079> bit<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.439> game<00:01:40.650> besides

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
maybe a little bit in the game besides

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.520 
maybe a little bit in the game besides
nerfing<00:01:42.329> weapons<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:43.049> really<00:01:43.290> don't<00:01:43.439> care

you died three times and needs to

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.230 
you died three times and needs to
restart<00:03:13.270> or<00:03:13.860> four<00:03:14.860> times<00:03:15.100> or<00:03:15.400> five<00:03:15.640> times<00:03:15.910> or

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.730 
restart or four times or five times or
something<00:03:16.750> because<00:03:17.590> you<00:03:18.190> died<00:03:18.640> 10<00:03:18.940> times<00:03:19.240> or

something because you died 10 times or
15<00:03:20.740> times<00:03:20.980> whatever<00:03:21.580> and<00:03:22.090> you<00:03:22.510> still<00:03:22.780> get<00:03:22.900> your

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
15 times whatever and you still get your

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.660 
15 times whatever and you still get your
killstreaks<00:03:23.650> I<00:03:23.830> really<00:03:24.100> don't<00:03:24.280> think<00:03:24.370> that's

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
killstreaks I really don't think that's

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.400 
killstreaks I really don't think that's
fair<00:03:24.970> especially<00:03:25.240> the<00:03:25.630> EMP<00:03:26.080> that's<00:03:26.320> a

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
fair especially the EMP that's a

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.250 
fair especially the EMP that's a
40-second<00:03:27.340> killstreak<00:03:27.910> long<00:03:28.240> 40<00:03:28.720> seconds

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
40-second killstreak long 40 seconds

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.530 
40-second killstreak long 40 seconds
come<00:03:30.130> on<00:03:30.280> they<00:03:30.490> can<00:03:30.640> we<00:03:30.760> lower<00:03:30.970> that<00:03:31.180> down<00:03:31.209> to

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
come on they can we lower that down to

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.560 
come on they can we lower that down to
maybe<00:03:31.770> 30<00:03:32.770> seconds<00:03:33.340> or<00:03:33.550> 20<00:03:33.880> seconds<00:03:34.390> at<00:03:34.540> least

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
maybe 30 seconds or 20 seconds at least

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.800 
maybe 30 seconds or 20 seconds at least
I<00:03:35.370> really<00:03:36.370> think<00:03:36.580> that<00:03:36.700> that<00:03:37.000> can<00:03:37.209> definitely

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
I really think that that can definitely

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.030
