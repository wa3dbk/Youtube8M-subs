everything over here and I'm going to

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.710 
everything over here and I'm going to
get<00:01:04.339> into<00:01:04.519> the<00:01:04.610> cooler<00:01:04.820> features<00:01:05.089> about<00:01:05.540> this

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
get into the cooler features about this

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.370 
get into the cooler features about this
thing<00:01:06.220> over<00:01:07.220> here<00:01:07.250> is<00:01:07.430> our<00:01:07.579> exhaust<00:01:08.380> what

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
thing over here is our exhaust what

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.690 
thing over here is our exhaust what
actually<00:01:09.710> happens<00:01:10.070> is<00:01:10.189> there's<00:01:10.399> a<00:01:10.460> heat

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
actually happens is there's a heat

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.420 
actually happens is there's a heat
exchanger<00:01:11.360> and<00:01:11.560> there's<00:01:12.560> a<00:01:12.649> water<00:01:12.950> loop<00:01:13.250> in

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
exchanger and there's a water loop in

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.340 
exchanger and there's a water loop in
there<00:01:13.610> and<00:01:13.880> it<00:01:14.180> actually<00:01:14.630> absorbs<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.320> heat

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
there and it actually absorbs the heat

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.639 
there and it actually absorbs the heat
off<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:16.369> exhaust<00:01:16.820> before<00:01:17.030> exits<00:01:17.869> and<00:01:18.079> then

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
off the exhaust before exits and then

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:20.500 
off the exhaust before exits and then
any<00:01:18.860> of<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:19.159> condensation<00:01:19.729> actually<00:01:20.299> gets

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
any of the condensation actually gets

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.530 
any of the condensation actually gets
carried<00:01:20.930> into<00:01:21.170> there<00:01:21.320> and<00:01:21.440> gets<00:01:21.620> pumped<00:01:22.040> away

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
carried into there and gets pumped away

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:30.010 
carried into there and gets pumped away

this was a oil to gas conversion here's
the<00:01:30.170> track<00:01:30.470> pipe<00:01:30.799> that<00:01:31.520> we<00:01:31.670> ran<00:01:32.740> outside<00:01:33.740> is<00:01:34.280> a

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
the track pipe that we ran outside is a

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.070 
the track pipe that we ran outside is a
meter<00:01:34.610> set<00:01:34.909> which<00:01:35.210> we<00:01:35.390> did<00:01:35.570> with<00:01:35.720> New<00:01:35.869> Jersey

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
notice is that there's a push-pull two

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.190 
notice is that there's a push-pull two
pumps<00:01:54.850> one<00:01:55.850> is<00:01:55.970> actually<00:01:56.210> pretty<00:01:56.570> exhaust<00:01:56.990> the

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
pumps one is actually pretty exhaust the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.870 
pumps one is actually pretty exhaust the
other<00:01:57.320> one's<00:01:57.530> for<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.830> return<00:01:58.280> you<00:02:03.729> have<00:02:04.729> an
