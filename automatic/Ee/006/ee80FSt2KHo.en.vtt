to level out a Crooked horizon and I
thought<00:00:11.400> it'd<00:00:11.519> be<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.670> good<00:00:11.820> opportunity<00:00:11.880> to

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
tell the horizon is nowhere near level

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.209 
tell the horizon is nowhere near level
the<00:00:33.239> quickest<00:00:33.660> way<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:34.020> leveling<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.890> out<00:00:35.010> is

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
the quickest way of leveling it out is

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.389 
the quickest way of leveling it out is
to<00:00:35.940> get<00:00:36.149> your<00:00:36.690> ruler<00:00:37.469> tool<00:00:37.739> which<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.040> hidden

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.439 
to the other side right let go right on
the<00:00:55.110> horizon<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.730> then<00:00:56.730> all<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.120> need<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.329> do

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
the horizon and then all you need to do

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.779 
the horizon and then all you need to do
is<00:00:57.480> go<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:58.039> image<00:00:59.149> image<00:01:00.149> rotation<00:01:01.789> arbitrary

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
is go to image image rotation arbitrary

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.810 
is go to image image rotation arbitrary
now<00:01:03.629> here's<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.930> real<00:01:04.140> neat<00:01:04.379> part<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.460> second<00:01:05.760> i

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
now here's a real neat part the second i

now here's a real neat part the second i
select<00:01:06.180> arbitrary<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.560> puts<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.250> exact

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
select arbitrary it puts in the exact

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.289 
select arbitrary it puts in the exact
number<00:01:09.210> required<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:10.110> level<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.500> out<00:01:11.210> if<00:01:12.210> I

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
number required to level that out if I

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.460 
number required to level that out if I
hit<00:01:12.450> OK<00:01:13.400> there<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.640> perfectly<00:01:15.330> level<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.869> can

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
hit OK there it is perfectly level I can

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.670 
hit OK there it is perfectly level I can
go<00:01:16.619> ahead<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.100> select<00:01:18.000> my<00:01:18.270> crop<00:01:18.600> however<00:01:19.560> I

like it let's select enter and there you

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.450 
like it let's select enter and there you
go<00:01:24.560> perfectly<00:01:25.560> level<00:01:25.950> takes<00:01:26.880> two<00:01:27.150> seconds<00:01:28.460> so

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
go perfectly level takes two seconds so

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.620 
go perfectly level takes two seconds so
I'm<00:01:29.520> going<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.670> go<00:01:29.790> ahead<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.060> do<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.240> in

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
I'm going to go ahead and do that in

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.620 
I'm going to go ahead and do that in
