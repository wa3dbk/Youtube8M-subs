a huge improvement I mean this thing is
so<00:00:41.670> much<00:00:41.850> better<00:00:42.090> than<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.300> original<00:00:42.379> it<00:00:43.379> has

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559

40% louder volume 700 percent higher

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.100 
40% louder volume 700 percent higher
data<00:00:46.530> rate<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:47.100> stronger<00:00:47.879> suction<00:00:48.300> cup<00:00:48.539> larger

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
data rate a stronger suction cup larger

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.930 
data rate a stronger suction cup larger
more<00:00:49.260> intuitive<00:00:49.710> controls<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.399> triple<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
more intuitive controls and triple the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.270 
more intuitive controls and triple the
battery<00:00:51.300> life<00:00:51.559> so<00:00:52.559> yeah<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.890> mean<00:00:53.010> they've<00:00:53.160> also

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
battery life so yeah I mean they've also

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.860 
battery life so yeah I mean they've also
improved<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.820> microphone<00:00:54.180> quality<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
improved the microphone quality the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.200 
improved the microphone quality the
durability<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.770> removed<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.789> removed<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
durability and removed and removed the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.029 
durability and removed and removed the
multiple<00:00:57.629> low<00:00:57.750> battery<00:00:58.140> alerts<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.800> thing

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
multiple low battery alerts this thing

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.410 
multiple low battery alerts this thing
is<00:00:59.190> much<00:00:59.609> more<00:00:59.850> advanced<00:01:00.090> than<00:01:00.180> its

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
is much more advanced than its

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.420 
is much more advanced than its
predecessor

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
predecessor

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.729 
predecessor
so<00:01:02.430> at<00:01:02.760> 69<00:01:03.420> 95<00:01:03.870> there<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.199> stiff<00:01:04.500> competition

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
so at 69 95 there is stiff competition

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.179 
so at 69 95 there is stiff competition
it<00:01:05.339> faces<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.299> know<00:01:06.450> some<00:01:07.110> opposition<00:01:07.500> from<00:01:08.130> a

manuals nothing particularly exciting

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.039 
manuals nothing particularly exciting
there<00:01:29.119> but<00:01:30.119> as<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.270> can<00:01:30.450> see<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.930> actual

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
there but as you can see the actual

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.749 
there but as you can see the actual
branding<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:32.040> really<00:01:32.340> really<00:01:32.490> quite

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
branding of this is really really quite

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.749 
branding of this is really really quite
cool<00:01:32.970> it's<00:01:33.240> kind<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:33.630> some<00:01:34.159> this<00:01:35.159> man<00:01:35.549> in

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
cool it's kind of this some this man in

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.310 
cool it's kind of this some this man in
some<00:01:35.970> sort<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.210> swimsuit<00:01:36.689> by<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.900> looks<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.200> it

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
some sort of swimsuit by the looks of it

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.690 
some sort of swimsuit by the looks of it
so<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.680> guess<00:01:37.920> their<00:01:38.130> focus<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.579> on

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
so I guess their focus is on

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.130 
so I guess their focus is on
waterproofing<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.540> just<00:01:39.720> sort<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:39.930> rugged

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140

with you now the emphasis here is not

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.639 
with you now the emphasis here is not
necessarily<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:45.240> audiophile<00:01:45.869> quality<00:01:46.409> or

booming base or anything like that it's

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.149 
booming base or anything like that it's
more<00:01:48.360> just<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.630> sort<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.899> feature<00:01:49.649> set<00:01:50.009> and
