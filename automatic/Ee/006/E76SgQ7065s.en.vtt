00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:14.480
 in this audience eight book shelves 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.119
 part of the fault is on the day of the book 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.180
 but if every month there was a 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.550
 day of the book I'm not going to complain much 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.559

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.689

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:28.489
 for the opening of the channel or is the excuse 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.009
 that I put myself I wanted to have 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:33.140
 but still not read this year in the 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.020
 bunker that members of the publisher 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.200
 destination have 303 pages that is pasta 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.480
 soft with flaps and weighs a little 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.309
 I still have not read but has a 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.140
 it looks amazing the plot takes me 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.570
 very much and I hope very soon to be able 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.309
 tell you about the following books that you 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.559
 I'm going to teach are my boyfriend's gifts 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.670
 from here I want to thank you

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.050
 It makes me very happy forever 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.260
 one of them that is the most part in 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.600
 Icelandic that I swallow from the already soler is 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.460
 from the editorial platform leo and I have 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.720
 to give a point in favor to this 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:15.800
 editorial because the 0.7 I think it is yes 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.960
 of sales go for one lee hee and I 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.229
 it seems a pretty nice detail in that 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.350
 sense has 256 pages is pasta 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.600
 soft with flaps and has distributed 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.360
 all over the book blank images and 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.759
 black of the sites that are traveling and 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.710
 I think it's because she does not see color and 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.720
 I know because it's one of these books that 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.300
 I do not want to know much information either 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.729
 about them which I do not have an idea 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.009
 but I think that out there for the shots 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.160
 I have to say that the cover is very 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.740
 nice clinic the following books do not 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.500

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.080
