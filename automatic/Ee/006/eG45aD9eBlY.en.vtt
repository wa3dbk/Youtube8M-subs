00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
have a lot more hours on this rubber now

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.170 
have a lot more hours on this rubber now
I<00:00:18.890> did<00:00:19.890> some<00:00:20.070> extensive<00:00:20.400> training<00:00:20.939> on<00:00:21.029> this

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
I did some extensive training on this

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.939 
I did some extensive training on this
rubber<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.779> played<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.050> tournament<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:22.920> I

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
rubber and I played a tournament so I

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.800 
rubber and I played a tournament so I
can<00:00:23.130> get<00:00:23.279> real-time<00:00:23.580> feedback<00:00:24.150> on<00:00:24.600> how<00:00:24.750> to

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
can get real-time feedback on how to

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.230 
can get real-time feedback on how to
perform<00:00:25.230> when<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:25.800> was<00:00:25.980> executing<00:00:26.640> shots<00:00:26.910> to

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
perform when I was executing shots to

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.890 
perform when I was executing shots to
win<00:00:27.449> any<00:00:28.170> competition<00:00:29.480> now<00:00:30.480> let's<00:00:30.720> talk<00:00:30.840> about

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.999 
win any competition now let's talk about
the<00:00:31.199> training

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
the training

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.850 
the training
I<00:00:32.040> put<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.850> Tuttle<00:00:33.149> Beijing<00:00:33.750> fall<00:00:34.050> on<00:00:34.290> my

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
I put the Tuttle Beijing fall on my

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.590 
I put the Tuttle Beijing fall on my
backhand<00:00:35.399> three<00:00:35.730> weeks<00:00:35.940> after<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.300> Olympic

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
backhand three weeks after the Olympic

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.780 
backhand three weeks after the Olympic
Trials<00:00:36.899> where<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.260> had<00:00:37.649> been<00:00:37.680> using<00:00:38.100> short<00:00:38.520> pips

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
Trials where I had been using short pips

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.450 
Trials where I had been using short pips
and<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.329> was<00:00:39.480> surprised<00:00:39.899> how<00:00:40.500> fast<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.980> adjusted

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
and I was surprised how fast I adjusted

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.020 
and I was surprised how fast I adjusted
to<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:42.590> was<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.829> habit<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.340> hitting<00:00:44.610> more

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
to it I was in the habit of hitting more

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.180 
to it I was in the habit of hitting more
than<00:00:45.090> looping<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.350> was<00:00:46.530> nice<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.770> have<00:00:47.160> a

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
than looping so it was nice to have a

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.310 
than looping so it was nice to have a
soft<00:00:47.579> sponge<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.390> really<00:00:48.660> gave<00:00:48.870> me<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.079> feel

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
soft sponge that really gave me the feel

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.680 
soft sponge that really gave me the feel
I<00:00:49.350> wanted<00:00:49.860> not<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.340> ball<00:00:50.550> springing<00:00:51.360> out<00:00:51.480> so

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
I wanted not the ball springing out so

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.420 
I wanted not the ball springing out so
fast

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.209 

backhand<00:00:56.360> looping<00:00:56.719> I<00:00:56.930> did<00:00:57.559> some<00:00:57.770> drills<00:00:58.070> that

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
backhand looping I did some drills that

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.220 
backhand looping I did some drills that
allowed<00:00:58.489> me<00:00:58.699> to<00:00:58.730> really<00:00:59.090> monitor<00:00:59.420> the<00:00:59.870> arc

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
allowed me to really monitor the arc

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.709 
allowed me to really monitor the arc
with<00:01:00.949> the<00:01:01.070> turtle<00:01:01.460> in<00:01:01.730> the<00:01:01.969> field<00:01:02.239> that<00:01:02.510> came

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
with the turtle in the field that came

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.930 
with the turtle in the field that came
from<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.050> top<00:01:03.260> sheet<00:01:03.559> and<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:03.949> sponge<00:01:04.250> was

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
from the top sheet and the sponge was

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.899 
from the top sheet and the sponge was
great<00:01:05.619> what<00:01:06.619> was<00:01:06.770> more<00:01:06.950> important<00:01:07.490> is<00:01:07.610> based

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
great what was more important is based

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.940 
great what was more important is based
on<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:08.180> amount<00:01:08.390> of<00:01:08.450> effort<00:01:08.869> I<00:01:08.960> did<00:01:09.290> on<00:01:09.710> the

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
on the amount of effort I did on the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.950 
on the amount of effort I did on the
backhand<00:01:10.340> loop<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:11.000> turtle<00:01:11.390> allowed<00:01:11.750> me<00:01:11.930> to

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
backhand loop the turtle allowed me to

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.630 
backhand loop the turtle allowed me to
have<00:01:12.259> command<00:01:12.770> over<00:01:12.950> spin<00:01:13.700> and<00:01:14.090> death<00:01:14.930> now

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
have command over spin and death now

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.450 
have command over spin and death now
most<00:01:16.640> rubbers<00:01:17.210> give<00:01:17.899> you<00:01:18.140> one<00:01:18.500> or<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:19.220> other

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
most rubbers give you one or the other

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.800 
most rubbers give you one or the other
if<00:01:19.729> it<00:01:19.970> gives<00:01:20.240> you<00:01:20.600> good<00:01:21.259> spin<00:01:21.800> then<00:01:22.810> it's

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
if it gives you good spin then it's

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.889 
if it gives you good spin then it's
gonna<00:01:24.320> pretty<00:01:24.799> much<00:01:24.890> not<00:01:25.880> be<00:01:26.210> consistent<00:01:26.810> with

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
gonna pretty much not be consistent with

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.690 
gonna pretty much not be consistent with
the<00:01:27.049> depth<00:01:27.350> or<00:01:27.770> if<00:01:28.070> it<00:01:28.190> gives<00:01:28.399> you<00:01:28.670> a

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
the depth or if it gives you a

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.810 
the depth or if it gives you a
consistent<00:01:29.240> depth<00:01:29.720> on<00:01:29.899> the<00:01:30.020> table<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:31.340> spin

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
consistent depth on the table the spin

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.510 
consistent depth on the table the spin
is<00:01:32.149> not<00:01:32.509> gonna<00:01:32.750> be<00:01:32.929> quality<00:01:33.440> and<00:01:33.679> turtle<00:01:34.220> gave

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
is not gonna be quality and turtle gave

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.690 
is not gonna be quality and turtle gave
me<00:01:34.789> the<00:01:35.060> perfect<00:01:35.840> balance<00:01:36.050> of<00:01:36.410> spin<00:01:37.009> and<00:01:37.220> depth

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.170 

now<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:42.350> blocking<00:01:42.830> is<00:01:43.070> just<00:01:43.490> silent<00:01:43.850> with

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
now the blocking is just silent with

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.719 
now the blocking is just silent with
this<00:01:44.360> road<00:01:44.570> because<00:01:45.049> um<00:01:45.409> the<00:01:45.890> soft<00:01:46.130> sponge<00:01:46.490> and

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
this road because um the soft sponge and

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.969 
this road because um the soft sponge and
I<00:01:46.820> do<00:01:46.880> after<00:01:47.360> man<00:01:47.630> one<00:01:47.960> statement<00:01:48.259> I<00:01:48.500> made<00:01:48.710> from

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
I do after man one statement I made from

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.039 
I do after man one statement I made from
the<00:01:49.130> original<00:01:49.340> total<00:01:49.909> review<00:01:50.270> when<00:01:50.720> I<00:01:50.750> said

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
the original total review when I said

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.679 
the original total review when I said
that<00:01:51.080> this<00:01:51.470> rubber<00:01:51.799> had<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:52.820> Chinese<00:01:53.299> style

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
that this rubber had the Chinese style

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.899 
that this rubber had the Chinese style
top<00:01:54.110> sheet<00:01:54.380> it's<00:01:54.770> really<00:01:55.189> more<00:01:55.399> of<00:01:55.460> the

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
top sheet it's really more of the

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.570 
top sheet it's really more of the
Japanese<00:01:56.600> style<00:01:56.899> type<00:01:57.530> sheet<00:01:57.740> a<00:01:57.860> sponge<00:01:58.159> even

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
Japanese style type sheet a sponge even

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.279 
Japanese style type sheet a sponge even
though<00:01:58.789> when<00:01:59.030> I<00:01:59.060> opened<00:01:59.509> it<00:01:59.570> it<00:01:59.750> looked<00:02:00.080> to

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
though when I opened it it looked to

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:08.990 
though when I opened it it looked to
have<00:02:00.500> that<00:02:00.740> same<00:02:01.780> look

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.220 

underspend<00:02:09.509> now<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.580> also<00:02:12.230> another

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
underspend now this is also another

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.880 
underspend now this is also another
place<00:02:14.100> that<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:15.080> tunnel<00:02:16.080> Beijing<00:02:16.590> for

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
place that the tunnel Beijing for

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.980 
place that the tunnel Beijing for
impressed<00:02:17.460> me<00:02:17.610> with<00:02:17.820> regards<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.300> spend<00:02:18.750> and

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
impressed me with regards to spend and

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.980 
impressed me with regards to spend and
death<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.650> was<00:02:19.920> doing<00:02:20.280> some<00:02:20.610> drills<00:02:21.540> for

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
death I was doing some drills for

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.490 
death I was doing some drills for
looping<00:02:22.410> back<00:02:22.740> spin<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:24.060> was<00:02:25.050> start<00:02:25.350> out

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
looping back spin and I was start out

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.340 
looping back spin and I was start out
with<00:02:25.709> doing<00:02:26.240> spinny<00:02:27.240> loops<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.780> see<00:02:28.020> if<00:02:28.170> I

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
with doing spinny loops to see if I

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.770 
with doing spinny loops to see if I
really<00:02:28.800> put<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.520> lot<00:02:29.850> of<00:02:30.209> spin<00:02:30.270> on<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.600> ball

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
really put a lot of spin on the ball

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.810 
really put a lot of spin on the ball
could<00:02:31.110> I<00:02:31.200> find<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.590> consistent<00:02:31.980> place<00:02:32.459> and<00:02:32.760> I

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
could I find a consistent place and I

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.820 
could I find a consistent place and I
had<00:02:33.090> success<00:02:33.660> with<00:02:33.690> being<00:02:34.530> able<00:02:34.650> to

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
had success with being able to

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.250 
had success with being able to
practically<00:02:35.640> close<00:02:35.910> my<00:02:36.120> eyes<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.630> just<00:02:36.660> focus

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
practically close my eyes and just focus

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.720 
practically close my eyes and just focus
on<00:02:37.380> a<00:02:37.440> lot<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.770> friction<00:02:37.980> knowing<00:02:38.490> that<00:02:38.610> it

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
on a lot of friction knowing that it

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.110 
on a lot of friction knowing that it
would<00:02:38.790> land<00:02:39.590> in<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:41.190> safe<00:02:41.370> place<00:02:41.670> on<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:41.940> table

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
would land in a safe place on the table

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.090 
would land in a safe place on the table
and<00:02:42.540> on<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:42.959> flip<00:02:43.230> side<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.470> that<00:02:43.530> coin<00:02:43.830> I

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
and on the flip side of that coin I

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.790 
and on the flip side of that coin I
decided<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.700> just<00:02:45.239> rip<00:02:45.840> some<00:02:46.110> backhand<00:02:46.320> loops

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
decided to just rip some backhand loops

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.120 
decided to just rip some backhand loops
and<00:02:47.010> so<00:02:47.100> that<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.340> could<00:02:47.550> still<00:02:48.270> get<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:49.410> picture

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
and so that I could still get a picture

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.210 
and so that I could still get a picture
of<00:02:50.280> how<00:02:50.880> that<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.630> rubber<00:02:51.840> profile<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.770> even

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
of how that the rubber profile and even

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.670 
of how that the rubber profile and even
though<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.370> was<00:02:53.700> ripping<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.390> ball<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:55.470> can

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
though I was ripping the ball you can

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.070 
though I was ripping the ball you can
clearly<00:02:55.950> see<00:02:56.070> that<00:02:56.580> it<00:02:57.270> was<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.510> consistent

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
clearly see that it was a consistent

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.320 
clearly see that it was a consistent
depth<00:02:58.560> on<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:58.860> table<00:02:59.250> so<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.610> quality<00:03:00.150> of

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
depth on the table so the quality of

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.320 
depth on the table so the quality of
shot<00:03:00.959> didn't<00:03:01.380> change<00:03:01.709> with<00:03:02.700> regards<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.300> a

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
shot didn't change with regards to a

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.160 
shot didn't change with regards to a
heavy<00:03:03.630> spin<00:03:04.110> or<00:03:04.489> heavy<00:03:05.489> force<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.360> really<00:03:07.020> at

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
heavy spin or heavy force and really at

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.040 
heavy spin or heavy force and really at
that<00:03:07.380> point<00:03:07.709> I<00:03:07.890> wasn't<00:03:08.489> sure<00:03:09.000> which<00:03:09.750> one<00:03:10.020> of

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
that point I wasn't sure which one of

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.500 
that point I wasn't sure which one of
those<00:03:10.260> loops<00:03:10.650> I<00:03:10.980> liked<00:03:11.430> better<00:03:11.790> because<00:03:12.239> it

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
those loops I liked better because it

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.410 
those loops I liked better because it
was<00:03:12.660> so<00:03:12.870> balanced<00:03:13.500> that<00:03:13.760> in<00:03:14.760> both<00:03:15.150> situations

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
was so balanced that in both situations

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.410 
was so balanced that in both situations
I<00:03:15.959> could<00:03:15.989> decide<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.440> spin<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.100> ball<00:03:17.310> or<00:03:17.640> I

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
I could decide to spin the ball or I

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.650 
I could decide to spin the ball or I
could<00:03:18.840> rip<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.049> ball<00:03:19.350> so<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.920> +4<00:03:20.820> tunnel

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
could rip the ball so a +4 tunnel

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.740 
could rip the ball so a +4 tunnel
Beijing<00:03:21.989> for<00:03:22.260> having<00:03:22.650> perfect<00:03:23.070> balanced

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
Beijing for having perfect balanced

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.720 
Beijing for having perfect balanced
competition<00:03:24.750> after<00:03:25.680> three<00:03:25.950> real<00:03:26.400> training

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730

competition after three real training
says<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:27.120> I<00:03:27.180> decided<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.690> put<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:27.989> turtle<00:03:28.640> to

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
says that I decided to put the turtle to

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.660 
says that I decided to put the turtle to
the<00:03:29.760> test<00:03:30.030> in<00:03:30.299> competition<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.470> even<00:03:32.370> knowing

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
the test in competition and even knowing

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.550 
the test in competition and even knowing
that<00:03:32.820> I<00:03:32.910> had<00:03:33.120> two<00:03:33.269> short<00:03:33.510> pips<00:03:33.810> I<00:03:34.019> still<00:03:34.320> had

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
that I had two short pips I still had

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.530 
that I had two short pips I still had
the<00:03:34.680> confidence<00:03:35.220> in<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.820> turtle<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.299> I<00:03:36.390> was

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
the confidence in the turtle and I was

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.310 
the confidence in the turtle and I was
impressed<00:03:36.989> with<00:03:37.709> every<00:03:38.370> aspect<00:03:39.079> from<00:03:40.079> this

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
impressed with every aspect from this

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.470 
impressed with every aspect from this
rubber<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:40.920> I<00:03:40.950> could<00:03:41.220> analyze<00:03:41.430> with<00:03:41.940> regards

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
rubber that I could analyze with regards

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.080 
rubber that I could analyze with regards
to<00:03:42.540> competing<00:03:43.470> with<00:03:43.739> it<00:03:43.860> I<00:03:44.040> decided<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:44.940> go

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
to competing with it I decided to go

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.580 
to competing with it I decided to go
with<00:03:45.209> a<00:03:45.299> more<00:03:45.480> conservative<00:03:45.870> shot<00:03:46.290> which<00:03:46.560> was

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
with a more conservative shot which was

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.259 
with a more conservative shot which was
just<00:03:46.920> spinning<00:03:47.250> shot<00:03:47.610> and<00:03:47.940> I<00:03:48.090> had<00:03:48.239> a

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
just spinning shot and I had a

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.650 
just spinning shot and I had a
tremendous<00:03:48.900> amount<00:03:49.049> of<00:03:49.650> success<00:03:50.660> almost

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
tremendous amount of success almost

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.870 
tremendous amount of success almost
every<00:03:52.019> one<00:03:52.200> of<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:52.829> backhand<00:03:53.310> loops<00:03:53.549> that<00:03:53.820> I

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
every one of the backhand loops that I

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.729 
every one of the backhand loops that I
attempted<00:03:54.570> that<00:03:54.660> was<00:03:54.840> spinning<00:03:55.260> was<00:03:55.380> blocked

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
attempted that was spinning was blocked

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.800 
attempted that was spinning was blocked
off<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.459> end<00:03:56.700> and<00:03:56.910> I<00:03:57.030> think<00:03:57.329> it<00:03:57.480> was<00:03:57.630> the

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
off the end and I think it was the

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.590 
off the end and I think it was the
combination<00:03:58.170> of<00:03:58.650> spin<00:03:59.280> and<00:03:59.489> depth<00:04:00.000> because

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
combination of spin and depth because

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.069 
combination of spin and depth because
when<00:04:00.870> you<00:04:01.560> make<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.250> loop<00:04:02.579> with<00:04:02.640> this<00:04:02.940> rubber<00:04:03.079> it

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
when you make a loop with this rubber it

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.280 
when you make a loop with this rubber it
makes<00:04:04.470> a<00:04:04.709> great<00:04:05.340> spin<00:04:05.820> but<00:04:06.180> because<00:04:06.630> the<00:04:06.840> depth

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
makes a great spin but because the depth

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.430 
makes a great spin but because the depth
is<00:04:07.560> so<00:04:08.130> far<00:04:08.489> on<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.790> table<00:04:09.209> that<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:10.019> person

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
is so far on the table that the person

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.110 
is so far on the table that the person
doesn't<00:04:10.709> block<00:04:11.070> like<00:04:11.340> this<00:04:11.370> they<00:04:11.820> have<00:04:12.000> to

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
doesn't block like this they have to

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.910 
doesn't block like this they have to
actually<00:04:12.630> bring<00:04:12.900> that<00:04:12.959> racket<00:04:13.350> to<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.650> end<00:04:13.829> of

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
actually bring that racket to the end of

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.890 
actually bring that racket to the end of
the<00:04:14.010> table<00:04:14.250> and<00:04:14.549> open<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.120> angle<00:04:15.480> more<00:04:15.660> and

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
the table and open the angle more and

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.500 
the table and open the angle more and
that<00:04:15.989> allows<00:04:16.290> to<00:04:16.590> spin<00:04:17.039> to<00:04:17.580> actually<00:04:17.910> jump<00:04:18.209> so

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
that allows to spin to actually jump so

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.090 
that allows to spin to actually jump so
I<00:04:19.140> owe

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
I owe

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.520 
I owe
spinny<00:04:21.730> backhand<00:04:22.300> loops<00:04:22.510> that<00:04:22.810> everybody<00:04:23.230> did

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
spinny backhand loops that everybody did

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.090 
spinny backhand loops that everybody did
off<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:24.220> table<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:26.020> tunnel<00:04:26.320> Beijing<00:04:26.650> for<00:04:26.889> I

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
off the table the tunnel Beijing for I

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.850 
off the table the tunnel Beijing for I
did<00:04:27.520> have<00:04:27.699> some<00:04:27.880> success<00:04:28.330> with<00:04:28.570> the<00:04:29.410> back<00:04:29.590> end

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
did have some success with the back end

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.469 
did have some success with the back end
hit<00:04:30.040> even<00:04:30.370> though<00:04:30.490> I<00:04:30.550> didn't<00:04:30.880> use<00:04:31.090> it<00:04:31.120> that

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
hit even though I didn't use it that

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.290 
hit even though I didn't use it that
much<00:04:31.510> but<00:04:32.050> I<00:04:32.260> did<00:04:32.500> have<00:04:33.040> some<00:04:33.070> really<00:04:33.910> good

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
much but I did have some really good

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.870 
much but I did have some really good
punch<00:04:34.930> blocks<00:04:35.320> the<00:04:35.500> way<00:04:35.620> I<00:04:35.650> really<00:04:36.040> felt<00:04:36.340> the

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
punch blocks the way I really felt the

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.659 
punch blocks the way I really felt the
rubber<00:04:37.120> vibrate<00:04:38.110> through<00:04:38.380> the<00:04:38.500> handle<00:04:38.919> and<00:04:39.130> I

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
rubber vibrate through the handle and I

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:44.310 
rubber vibrate through the handle and I
had<00:04:40.120> total<00:04:40.570> command<00:04:41.050> over<00:04:41.680> that<00:04:41.830> shot<00:04:43.320> rubber

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
had total command over that shot rubber

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.710 
had total command over that shot rubber
sounds<00:04:44.650> perfect<00:04:45.040> so<00:04:45.130> far<00:04:45.370> but<00:04:45.940> there<00:04:46.120> was<00:04:46.360> one

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
sounds perfect so far but there was one

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.870 
sounds perfect so far but there was one
barometer<00:04:47.229> that<00:04:47.460> underperformed<00:04:48.460> and<00:04:48.610> that

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
barometer that underperformed and that

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.689 
barometer that underperformed and that
is<00:04:49.060> durability<00:04:49.919> from<00:04:50.919> the<00:04:51.040> first<00:04:51.250> review<00:04:51.669> I

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
is durability from the first review I

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.400 
is durability from the first review I
didn't<00:04:52.180> have<00:04:52.360> a<00:04:52.389> lot<00:04:52.600> of<00:04:52.630> feedback<00:04:53.110> on<00:04:53.320> the

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
didn't have a lot of feedback on the

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.340 
didn't have a lot of feedback on the
durability<00:04:53.770> but<00:04:54.520> after<00:04:55.180> using<00:04:55.389> a<00:04:55.570> rubber<00:04:55.780> for

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
durability but after using a rubber for

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:03.120 
durability but after using a rubber for
three<00:04:57.340> months<00:04:57.870> it<00:04:58.870> does<00:05:01.139> doesn't<00:05:02.139> handle<00:05:02.770> a

three months it does doesn't handle a

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.730 
three months it does doesn't handle a
wear<00:05:03.490> and<00:05:03.639> tear<00:05:03.850> so<00:05:04.090> well<00:05:04.330> and<00:05:04.570> even<00:05:05.350> in<00:05:05.530> my

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
wear and tear so well and even in my

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.950 
wear and tear so well and even in my
fully<00:05:06.130> retired<00:05:06.700> mode<00:05:07.030> I<00:05:07.330> do<00:05:07.389> find<00:05:07.870> myself

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
fully retired mode I do find myself

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.879 
fully retired mode I do find myself
training<00:05:08.800> three<00:05:09.639> times<00:05:09.940> a<00:05:10.120> week<00:05:10.180> with<00:05:10.990> Raphael

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
training three times a week with Raphael

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.340 
training three times a week with Raphael
or<00:05:12.190> Richard<00:05:12.639> so<00:05:12.850> I'm<00:05:13.000> playing<00:05:13.330> at<00:05:13.750> least<00:05:13.990> six

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
or Richard so I'm playing at least six

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.140 
or Richard so I'm playing at least six
hours<00:05:14.560> a<00:05:14.770> week<00:05:14.979> the<00:05:15.160> way<00:05:15.250> I'm<00:05:15.370> really<00:05:15.760> putting

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
hours a week the way I'm really putting

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.719 
hours a week the way I'm really putting
in<00:05:16.360> some<00:05:17.139> good<00:05:17.380> contact<00:05:17.889> into<00:05:18.130> the<00:05:18.250> rubber<00:05:18.490> and

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
in some good contact into the rubber and

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:24.170 
in some good contact into the rubber and
after<00:05:19.360> about<00:05:19.750> five<00:05:19.810> weeks<00:05:20.620> a<00:05:21.240> big<00:05:22.240> bubble

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
after about five weeks a big bubble

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.909 
after about five weeks a big bubble
developed<00:05:25.180> in<00:05:25.300> the<00:05:25.389> middle<00:05:25.720> and<00:05:25.960> I<00:05:26.289> don't

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
developed in the middle and I don't

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.830 
developed in the middle and I don't
think<00:05:27.340> this<00:05:27.520> is<00:05:27.550> a<00:05:27.700> bad<00:05:27.940> sheet<00:05:28.150> a<00:05:28.270> sheet<00:05:28.720> of

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
think this is a bad sheet a sheet of

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.360 
think this is a bad sheet a sheet of
rubber<00:05:29.020> I<00:05:29.169> just<00:05:29.440> think<00:05:29.650> it<00:05:29.800> wasn't<00:05:30.010> glued

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
rubber I just think it wasn't glued

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.010 
rubber I just think it wasn't glued
properly<00:05:30.910> because<00:05:32.220> it<00:05:33.220> just<00:05:34.030> came<00:05:34.600> up<00:05:34.630> a

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
properly because it just came up a

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.379 
properly because it just came up a
little<00:05:35.200> bit<00:05:35.410> too<00:05:35.560> easy<00:05:35.830> and<00:05:36.280> and<00:05:36.610> whenever<00:05:37.240> I

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:37.389 
little bit too easy and and whenever I

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:39.600 
little bit too easy and and whenever I
bubble<00:05:37.660> a<00:05:37.960> rubber<00:05:38.470> I<00:05:38.620> always<00:05:39.039> say<00:05:39.250> it's<00:05:39.490> a

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
bubble a rubber I always say it's a

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.029 
bubble a rubber I always say it's a
factor<00:05:40.060> of<00:05:40.090> the<00:05:40.720> fact<00:05:41.020> that<00:05:41.169> I<00:05:41.200> coach<00:05:41.770> with<00:05:42.010> the

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
factor of the fact that I coach with the

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:44.670 
factor of the fact that I coach with the
same<00:05:42.310> racket<00:05:42.639> that<00:05:42.760> I<00:05:42.940> train<00:05:43.270> with<00:05:43.300> and<00:05:43.990> we

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
same racket that I train with and we

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.529 
same racket that I train with and we
have<00:05:44.919> really<00:05:45.310> hot<00:05:45.520> weather<00:05:45.849> here<00:05:46.210> in<00:05:46.300> South

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
have really hot weather here in South

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:51.360 
have really hot weather here in South
Florida<00:05:46.860> and<00:05:48.210> it's<00:05:49.210> just<00:05:49.750> the<00:05:50.620> constant

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
Florida and it's just the constant

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.659 
Florida and it's just the constant
contact<00:05:52.030> in<00:05:52.599> the<00:05:52.870> sweet<00:05:53.169> spot<00:05:53.500> so<00:05:53.669> with

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
contact in the sweet spot so with

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.290 
contact in the sweet spot so with
regards<00:05:55.210> to<00:05:55.289> durability<00:05:56.289> is<00:05:57.070> probably<00:05:57.639> the

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
regards to durability is probably the

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.890 
regards to durability is probably the
only<00:05:58.570> thing<00:05:59.410> about<00:05:59.680> this<00:06:00.130> rubber<00:06:00.520> that<00:06:01.120> I<00:06:01.419> felt

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
only thing about this rubber that I felt

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.589 
only thing about this rubber that I felt

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:04.599 
you know under perform for a rubber

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:06.600 
you know under perform for a rubber
that's<00:06:05.020> way<00:06:05.320> less<00:06:05.620> expensive<00:06:05.830> and<00:06:06.490> the

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
that's way less expensive and the
