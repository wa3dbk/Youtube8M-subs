 signs the national traffic service 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.500
 is informing about the presence of 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.120
 medium front very weak still it 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.189
 located on the Yucatan Peninsula 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.279
 where we expect rainfall of 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.169
 moderate to strong the arrival of humidity 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.029
 look you see on the southeast of the 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.770
 Mexican Republic on behalf of this 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.660
 large unstable area that has 60 by 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.090
 cent to become a new 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.220
 tropical cyclone and it continues to invade not 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.750
 only the southeast all the center of 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.790
 the Mexican Republic and subsequently 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.370
 it will do about the west and part of the 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.519
 center and at those points we hope 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.110
 precipitation from strong to intense in 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.269
 the center of the Mexican republic of 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.489
 moderate to strong precipitation by 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:49.489
 the turn that this great area has 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.920
 unstable that aims to become 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.989
 tropical cyclone for the states of 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.089
 north little cloudiness little precipitation 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.070
 light in Durango in Zacatecas in waters 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.710
 hot temperatures up to 38 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.110
 degrees there in what is the low peace 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.089
 california that the maximum level at level 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.460
 national and I'm going to put you have 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.290
 this large area important cloudiness with 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.520
 precipitation while the 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.920
 temperatures for the north of the littoral 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.049
 wait 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.090
 I arrived and arrived in front of number 5 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.540
 cool the temperature enough to 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.310
 the northwest region but before 31-34 with 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.320
 the maximum temperature for what sound 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.180
 and Baja California on the way down and fornia 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.250
