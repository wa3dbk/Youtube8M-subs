00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.929
 hi friends today we are with you 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.030
 talk about the pictures we will have a new one 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.190
 The section is dedicated to photography photos 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.560
 in mental dentistry is gaining everything 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.580
 more and more turns 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.460
 accordingly it is impossible not to 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.789
 speak but before considering 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.340
 specific examples we need to go through the whole 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.550
 way from the beginning and all we have is blood and 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.960
 our legs are just newbies and some 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.930
 people don't even have a general idea 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.309
 how to hold the hands of the camera and from this we 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.550
 we will begin to consider 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.750
 specific cameras 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.910
 let's say applicable mental 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.850
 dentistry which is more or less optimal 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.670
 better to buy with what money and whether 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.940
 go ahead and spend hundreds of thousands 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.620
 rubles for the camera in this I will help 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.090
 you figure it out before you start 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.910
 let's start with the theory 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.820
 you can voice it straight in two words 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.420
 photos are drawing with light 8 hectare 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.299
 office you do not need to know something there 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.909
 talk his matrix about lenses and 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.299
 so on but this will all move 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.369
 further the main thing that understood the photo 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.009
 directly depends on the color and blue color 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.479
 Here photos will never have 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.310
 we will be bad you will be bad 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.900
 photo that is all you do not have 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.310
 enough sandpouts of light either 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.509
 low light correspondence 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.060
 you will get pictures 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.290
 Low quality 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.780
 let's go to the story very 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.520
 interesting picture developed in its 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.130
 time though trying to get 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.439
 photographic image refers to 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.189
 seventeenth century but still dates 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.710
 the invention of photography considers she 1839 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:51.110
 the year when it appeared in paris 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.610
 called daguerotype or shorten it 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.420
 based on my own research 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.549
 and experiences not yet they are epta 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.020
 dagger explorer got 1 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.409
 photographic steady image 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.670
 which will be one person is the date 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.560
 refers to the red room of what 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.929
 eight hundred thirty ninth year 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.300
 parallel studies were conducted on 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.810
 creating a negative positive process 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:21.790
 he was engaged in William henry ford so gould 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.230
 he began experiments in 1833 and already in 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.410
 one thousand eight hundred and thirty-fifth 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.020
 first negative was received 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:32.500
 25 by 25 millimeters but when 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.989
 he learned that dagger aviation market he 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.630
 began to prove his priority 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.230
 research and already in 1 thousand eight 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:46.930
 the forty first year he received a patent on 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:48.819
 invention so do and can say 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.920
 what exactly is this time exploring 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.049
 photos began to gain more 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.360
 high revs 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.380
 photo putting the cat a number like 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.430
 invention is no longer road ways 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.489
 steam locomotives and other inventions 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.890
 so scientists and artists and simple 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.080
 art lovers proclaimed that 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.209
 nothing more perfect can be killed and 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.609
 more amazing about what these loyal 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.769
 reflections of reality puffiness 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.720
 dignity from him the record is wrong 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.310
 travelers unusual drawing 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.880
 could without problems in the process juice 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.010
 to portray the cultural monuments of Kiev 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.380
 animal plants but others 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.049
 necessary actions that before 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.180
 carried out with a pencil they carried 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.579
 in just a few minutes and with high 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.480
 The accuracy in this respect is very 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.910
 helped a lot 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.020
 this by the way very much frightened many 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.080
 painters as it is now 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.600
 one technicians scares introduction to there so 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.510
 for example, one artist stated that 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.730
 today nothing lung is dead but in 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.190
 our time let's photograph it 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.970
 everyday occurrence and when we hear 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.390
 chair there is no camera or built 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.120
 camera 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.010
 we have a smartphone calling it on it 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.580
 wonder how then liza caused 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.040
 surprise 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.920
 photography is now photography for above 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.070
 commonplace phenomenon we each have 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.540
 at home at least one what camera and 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.250
 we are surprised 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.970
 if the person does not have accordingly 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:22.040
 which camera or camera is built it 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:25.670
 smartphones phone though we possess 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:28.430
 cry of being able to shoot every day and 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:31.340
 various objects and situations but we have 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.250
 the picture is not very good 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.290
 a very interesting photo has become a length 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.910
 events for all these pictures that we 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.490
 do it just dream 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.110
 they contain some kind of simple 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.900
 certain information pleasant 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.540
 krendachey no artistry or 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.700
 gets to find them no but there is become of 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.160
 on a partial one often not only by 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.530
 quality and the corresponding 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.640
 the picture will fill to avoid it 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:01.670
 and it begins to develop the best hard 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.680
 watch my channel subscribe and 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.770
 put huskies well and accordingly 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:10.190
 do repost my video it will give 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.980
 the opportunity for other people to see my 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.860
 channel subscribe to learn a lot 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.420
 new and 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.490
 respectively actually grow here 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.490
 that's all thanks to everyone 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:39.760
 i am familiar with now which guy 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:42.760
 she will say that he has brought China all these 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.760
 recent 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.520
 it but because it is again pour colpino 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.910
 no, there are those who are willing to love
