00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:02.780
 my uncle 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.100
 we really have a 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.899
 a strong sensitivity at the junction all covered for a few 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.470
 days the owner of the man starts to notice a problem of 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.239
 market at his mare 

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:16.239
 to remedy it here in full osteopathy session 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.899
 a purely manual therapy that may seem impressive but nevertheless 

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:24.409
 safe for the veterinarian 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:26.710
 this is an excellent move 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.329
 contrary to what may be manipulating the animal must be 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:29.829
 calm 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.970
 it's always the horse that goes 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.460
 oriented more or less feast handling 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.220
 according to scott and facilitation a sense when we're going to go in the sense that that 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.360
 do not hurt by the way on the second time 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.770
 since I started 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.650
 to see the course of the face 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.510
 and I left a little bit we are at the party the choice went to get 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.120
 to bring me back into business many still think of the rise of 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.510
 unemployment and at that time he even pushed are earlier I was 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.680
 asked to go get a title concerning the municipality between the two 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.570
 lost two 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.110
 so use 2 free him in fact the set in his favor 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.380
 well known in humans to this discipline is quite new in the 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.090
 horse 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.689
 Dr. Yates has been practicing these patients for about ten years. 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.160
 horses but also dogs of cats and even rabbits 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.570
 osteopathy to the odds and we call on practitioners turn more and 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.040
 more pathologies 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.640
 why am I being called 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.160
 all often for locomotor problems 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.500
 percent eminem now a little bit more for problems in his wheels 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.110
 so we'll say and first time for example reims% or in preventive 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.980
 % equivalent to a start of competition for 100 euros 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.730
 prepare a young German her performances 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.240
 even aware that usually at 48 hours hall for the return to a state 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.720
 viable she said the monarchy must walk about to have between 5 and 7 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.729
 why what is 3 6% 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.030
 are they dead 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.770
 after more than half an hour of manipulation the effect is almost 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.930
 instantaneous 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.220
 it will take a few days, however, to rebalance and therefore rest at the 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.730
 mare but thanks to osteopathy is a vision that could be cured in 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.819
 softness and without any medication
