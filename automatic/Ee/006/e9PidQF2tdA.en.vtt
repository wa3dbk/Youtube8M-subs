00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.600 

so<00:00:10.320> here<00:00:10.590> are<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.800> new<00:00:10.980> parts

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
so here are the new parts

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.690 
so here are the new parts
or<00:00:11.820> should<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.240> say<00:00:12.480> rebuilt<00:00:12.960> parts<00:00:13.549> you<00:00:14.549> could

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
or should I say rebuilt parts you could

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.540 
or should I say rebuilt parts you could
actually<00:00:14.910> probably<00:00:15.389> purchase<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.949> same<00:00:17.250> one

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
actually probably purchase the same one

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.550 
actually probably purchase the same one
these<00:00:17.880> are<00:00:18.029> right<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.449> left<00:00:18.510> notice<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.289> only

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
these are right and left notice the only

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.130 
these are right and left notice the only
difference<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.279> let's<00:00:21.060> see<00:00:21.270> if<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.539> can<00:00:21.750> zoom<00:00:21.930> in

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
difference is let's see if I can zoom in

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.310 
difference is let's see if I can zoom in
here<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:23.090> the<00:00:24.090> location<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.990> bleeder

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
here is the location of the bleeder

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.460 
here is the location of the bleeder
screw<00:00:27.230> is<00:00:28.640> opposite<00:00:29.810> but<00:00:30.810> besides<00:00:31.289> that

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
screw is opposite but besides that

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.280 
screw is opposite but besides that
they're<00:00:31.890> identical<00:00:32.480> so<00:00:33.480> if<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.809> bought<00:00:33.960> two

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
they're identical so if you bought two

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.090 
they're identical so if you bought two
of<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.559> same<00:00:34.829> no<00:00:35.670> big<00:00:35.880> deal<00:00:36.739> it<00:00:37.739> wouldn't

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
of the same no big deal it wouldn't

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.200 
of the same no big deal it wouldn't
matter<00:00:39.469> now<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.530> changed<00:00:40.980> my<00:00:41.100> brake<00:00:41.370> fluid<00:00:41.850> so

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
matter now I changed my brake fluid so

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:51.729 
matter now I changed my brake fluid so
this<00:00:42.750> vehicle<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:46.100> 96<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.780> it's<00:00:48.780> now<00:00:49.219> 2013

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
this vehicle is a 96 and it's now 2013

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.189 
this vehicle is a 96 and it's now 2013
and<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:53.090> calipers<00:00:54.090> are<00:00:54.270> now<00:00:54.420> just<00:00:54.719> sticking

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
and the calipers are now just sticking

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.299 
and the calipers are now just sticking
at<00:00:55.940> 230,000<00:00:56.940> miles<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:58.969> I<00:01:00.559> probably<00:01:01.559> gave

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
at 230,000 miles so I probably gave

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.160 
at 230,000 miles so I probably gave
these<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.609> little<00:01:02.940> bit<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.180> life<00:01:03.359> by<00:01:03.629> changing

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
these a little bit of life by changing

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.950 
these a little bit of life by changing
the<00:01:04.260> fluid<00:01:04.640> maybe<00:01:05.640> maybe<00:01:06.030> not<00:01:06.240> they<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.689> stick

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the fluid maybe maybe not they can stick

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.130 
the fluid maybe maybe not they can stick
at<00:01:07.080> any<00:01:07.229> time<00:01:07.530> they<00:01:07.860> can<00:01:08.040> never<00:01:08.220> stick<00:01:09.140> what

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
at any time they can never stick what

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.350 
at any time they can never stick what
happened<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.680> when<00:01:10.890> we<00:01:11.610> got<00:01:11.760> out<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.119> car

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
happened is when we got out of the car

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.780 
happened is when we got out of the car
we<00:01:12.630> noticed<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.200> bunch<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.680> smoke<00:01:14.010> bellowing

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
we noticed a bunch of smoke bellowing

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.210 
we noticed a bunch of smoke bellowing
out<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.180> wheel<00:01:15.590> smelled<00:01:16.590> like<00:01:16.860> burnt

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
out of the wheel smelled like burnt

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.780 
out of the wheel smelled like burnt
rubber<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:19.290> wheel<00:01:19.470> was<00:01:19.680> very<00:01:19.860> hot<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.580> could

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
rubber the wheel was very hot you could

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.880 
rubber the wheel was very hot you could
put<00:01:21.030> your<00:01:21.180> hand<00:01:21.420> near<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.780> tire<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.590> feel

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
put your hand near the tire and feel

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.460 
put your hand near the tire and feel
heat<00:01:23.159> coming<00:01:23.520> out<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:24.350> measured<00:01:25.350> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
heat coming out I measured the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.380 
heat coming out I measured the
temperature<00:01:25.759> compared<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.119> other

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
temperature compared it to the other

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.950 
temperature compared it to the other
three<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.500> one<00:01:28.710> was<00:01:28.860> much<00:01:29.790> hotter<00:01:30.150> it

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
three and this one was much hotter it

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.960 
three and this one was much hotter it
was<00:01:31.110> 50<00:01:31.470> degrees<00:01:31.500> hotter<00:01:32.240> so<00:01:34.430> and<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.820> was

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
was 50 degrees hotter so and that was

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.450 
was 50 degrees hotter so and that was
after<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.390> cooled<00:01:36.630> off<00:01:36.840> for<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.110> little<00:01:37.259> bit<00:01:37.500> so

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
after it cooled off for a little bit so

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.200 
after it cooled off for a little bit so
I<00:01:38.820> knew<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.960> caliper<00:01:40.890> was<00:01:41.100> stuck<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:42.090> we're

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
I knew the caliper was stuck so we're

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.800 
I knew the caliper was stuck so we're
going<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.390> go<00:01:42.540> ahead<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:42.990> replace<00:01:43.290> both<00:01:43.710> just

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
going to go ahead and replace both just

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.350 
going to go ahead and replace both just
it's<00:01:45.810> just<00:01:46.320> smarter<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.250> easier<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:48.060> just

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
it's just smarter and easier to just

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.999 
it's just smarter and easier to just
take<00:01:48.659> care<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.079> them<00:01:49.200> both<00:01:49.380> even<00:01:49.740> though<00:01:49.860> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
take care of them both even though the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.600 
take care of them both even though the
other<00:01:50.130> side<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.850> fine<00:01:51.720> for<00:01:52.140> now<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.649> may<00:01:53.189> not<00:01:53.220> be

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
other side is fine for now it may not be

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.469 
other side is fine for now it may not be
in<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.759> week<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.930> may<00:01:55.170> be<00:01:55.229> less<00:01:55.530> forever<00:01:56.479> but

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
in a week it may be less forever but

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.880 
in a week it may be less forever but
we'll<00:01:57.750> just<00:01:57.810> go<00:01:57.990> ahead<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.350> swap<00:01:58.560> them<00:01:58.740> both

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
we'll just go ahead and swap them both

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.700 
we'll just go ahead and swap them both
out<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.969> this<00:02:00.210> will<00:02:00.420> involve<00:02:00.840> removing<00:02:01.439> three

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
out so this will involve removing three

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.749 
out so this will involve removing three
bolts<00:02:02.130> we<00:02:02.340> have<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.969> brake<00:02:03.420> hose<00:02:04.490> bolt<00:02:05.490> which

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
bolts we have the brake hose bolt which

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.650 
bolts we have the brake hose bolt which
is<00:02:05.939> 9/16<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.229> we<00:02:08.220> have<00:02:08.399> two<00:02:08.670> half-inch<00:02:09.179> bolts

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
is 9/16 and we have two half-inch bolts

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.070 
is 9/16 and we have two half-inch bolts
that<00:02:09.840> hold<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.140> caliper<00:02:10.709> on<00:02:11.300> to

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
that hold the caliper on to

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.010 
that hold the caliper on to
the<00:02:13.230> hub<00:02:13.820> so<00:02:14.820> what<00:02:15.180> I'm<00:02:15.270> going<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.450> do<00:02:15.630> is<00:02:15.810> while

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
the hub so what I'm going to do is while

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.830 
the hub so what I'm going to do is while
it's<00:02:16.230> mounted<00:02:16.770> I'm<00:02:17.760> going<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.030> break<00:02:18.330> the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
it's mounted I'm going to break the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.990 
it's mounted I'm going to break the
brake<00:02:19.550> hose<00:02:21.290> nut<00:02:22.290> loose<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.760> that'll

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
brake hose nut loose and that'll

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.610 
brake hose nut loose and that'll
probably<00:02:24.120> drip<00:02:24.570> a<00:02:24.600> little<00:02:24.900> bit<00:02:25.050> I'm<00:02:25.260> not<00:02:25.410> too

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
probably drip a little bit I'm not too

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.510 
probably drip a little bit I'm not too
worried<00:02:25.920> about<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.600> then<00:02:28.340> we'll<00:02:29.340> go<00:02:29.490> from

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
worried about it and then we'll go from

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.110 
worried about it and then we'll go from
there

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
there

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.900 
there
so<00:02:30.540> we'll<00:02:30.750> break<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.290> nut<00:02:32.070> loose<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.550> holds

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
so we'll break the nut loose that holds

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.160 
so we'll break the nut loose that holds
the<00:02:33.060> hose<00:02:33.270> on<00:02:33.570> that<00:02:34.350> was<00:02:34.470> surprisingly<00:02:35.130> easy

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
the hose on that was surprisingly easy

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.040 
the hose on that was surprisingly easy
since<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:37.440> was<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:37.830> easy<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:39.540> break<00:02:39.780> that

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
since that was so easy to break that

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.930 
since that was so easy to break that
loose<00:02:41.690> just<00:02:42.920> leave<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.070> loose<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.580> I'll<00:02:44.700> take

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
loose just leave it loose and I'll take

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.670 
loose just leave it loose and I'll take
off<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:46.200> two<00:02:47.720> mounting<00:02:48.720> bolts<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.290> remove

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.890 
off the two mounting bolts and remove
the<00:02:50.010> caliper<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:51.180> have<00:02:51.420> my<00:02:51.600> replacement

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.080 
new one okay there are copper washers on
the<00:03:02.610> bolt<00:03:02.820> so<00:03:03.210> I'll<00:03:03.680> replace<00:03:04.680> them<00:03:05.070> so<00:03:05.730> as<00:03:05.910> you
