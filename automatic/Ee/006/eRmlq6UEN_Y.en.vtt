this<00:00:27.380> is<00:00:27.590> a<00:00:27.619> very<00:00:27.949> specific<00:00:28.279> grub<00:00:28.820> it's<00:00:29.029> called

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
this is a very specific grub it's called

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.749 
this is a very specific grub it's called
a<00:00:29.390> finesse<00:00:29.930> fish<00:00:30.289> and<00:00:30.890> this<00:00:31.039> particular<00:00:31.609> one

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
a finesse fish and this particular one

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:33.729 
a finesse fish and this particular one
is<00:00:32.000> 4<00:00:32.300> inches<00:00:32.480> long<00:00:32.899> and<00:00:33.110> I<00:00:33.140> got<00:00:33.290> to<00:00:33.410> tell<00:00:33.559> you

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
is 4 inches long and I got to tell you

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.770 
is 4 inches long and I got to tell you
even<00:00:34.220> though<00:00:34.460> it<00:00:34.579> looks<00:00:34.790> simple<00:00:35.269> there's<00:00:35.600> no

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
even though it looks simple there's no

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.110 
even though it looks simple there's no
action<00:00:36.260> tail<00:00:36.559> it's<00:00:37.190> kind<00:00:37.430> of<00:00:37.489> a<00:00:37.610> flexible

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
action tail it's kind of a flexible

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.479 
action tail it's kind of a flexible
plastic<00:00:38.420> when<00:00:39.409> you<00:00:39.530> add<00:00:39.680> a<00:00:39.710> jig<00:00:40.010> head<00:00:40.190> to<00:00:40.309> this

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
plastic when you add a jig head to this

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.009 
plastic when you add a jig head to this
and<00:00:40.790> you<00:00:40.879> just<00:00:40.970> let<00:00:41.120> it<00:00:41.239> drop<00:00:41.420> to<00:00:41.480> the<00:00:41.690> bottom

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.019 
and you just let it drop to the bottom

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:44.590 
and you just let it drop to the bottom
and<00:00:42.170> you<00:00:42.260> shake<00:00:42.530> it<00:00:42.559> it<00:00:42.860> looks<00:00:43.220> more<00:00:43.640> realistic

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
and you shake it it looks more realistic

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.840 
and you shake it it looks more realistic
than<00:00:44.780> a<00:00:44.839> real<00:00:45.199> fish<00:00:45.620> now<00:00:46.370> what's<00:00:46.610> really

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
than a real fish now what's really

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.880 
than a real fish now what's really
important<00:00:47.600> is<00:00:47.690> that<00:00:47.720> you<00:00:47.870> rig<00:00:48.199> these<00:00:48.379> properly

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
important is that you rig these properly

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.140 
important is that you rig these properly
and<00:00:49.070> I'm<00:00:49.129> going<00:00:49.309> to<00:00:49.370> show<00:00:49.519> you<00:00:49.550> two<00:00:49.879> ways<00:00:49.909> to

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
and I'm going to show you two ways to

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.450 
and I'm going to show you two ways to
rig<00:00:50.600> these<00:00:50.750> and<00:00:51.019> how<00:00:51.080> critical<00:00:51.350> it<00:00:51.680> is<00:00:51.799> that

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
rig these and how critical it is that

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.070 
rig these and how critical it is that
when<00:00:52.610> you<00:00:52.699> read<00:00:52.939> these<00:00:53.119> finesse<00:00:53.510> fish<00:00:53.809> that

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.080 
when you read these finesse fish that

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.960 
when you read these finesse fish that
they're<00:00:54.229> rigged<00:00:54.409> the<00:00:54.559> right<00:00:54.710> way<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.699> first

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
they're rigged the right way the first

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.369 
they're rigged the right way the first
way<00:00:56.210> that<00:00:56.239> I'm<00:00:56.449> going<00:00:56.600> to<00:00:56.659> show<00:00:56.809> you<00:00:56.839> to<00:00:56.989> rig<00:00:57.199> it

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
way that I'm going to show you to rig it

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.729 
way that I'm going to show you to rig it
is<00:00:57.500> by<00:00:57.949> using<00:00:58.189> the<00:00:58.489> actual<00:00:58.850> finesse<00:00:59.540> jig<00:01:00.500> head

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
is by using the actual finesse jig head

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.829 
is by using the actual finesse jig head
that<00:01:00.890> I'm<00:01:01.010> holding<00:01:01.369> here<00:01:01.640> okay<00:01:02.330> you<00:01:02.390> can<00:01:02.659> see

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
that I'm holding here okay you can see

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:04.630 
that I'm holding here okay you can see
that<00:01:03.019> it's<00:01:03.140> kind<00:01:03.320> of<00:01:03.500> a<00:01:03.619> flat<00:01:03.799> it's<00:01:04.159> not<00:01:04.400> round

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
that it's kind of a flat it's not round

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.880 
that it's kind of a flat it's not round
like<00:01:04.820> a<00:01:04.850> round<00:01:05.150> jig<00:01:05.390> head<00:01:05.630> and<00:01:05.810> you<00:01:06.530> can<00:01:06.710> also

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
like a round jig head and you can also

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.310 
like a round jig head and you can also
notice<00:01:07.280> that<00:01:07.310> there's<00:01:07.580> very<00:01:07.880> special<00:01:08.540> grub

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
notice that there's very special grub

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.840 
notice that there's very special grub
barbs<00:01:09.740> here<00:01:10.009> that<00:01:10.130> almost<00:01:10.280> looks<00:01:10.640> like<00:01:10.729> a

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
barbs here that almost looks like a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.300 
barbs here that almost looks like a
finishing<00:01:11.540> nail<00:01:11.750> each<00:01:12.380> one<00:01:12.650> of<00:01:12.770> those<00:01:12.890> grabs

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
finishing nail each one of those grabs

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.310 
finishing nail each one of those grabs
so<00:01:14.000> when<00:01:14.119> you<00:01:14.210> put<00:01:14.390> that<00:01:14.509> finesse<00:01:14.840> fish<00:01:15.110> on

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
so when you put that finesse fish on

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.929 
so when you put that finesse fish on
this<00:01:15.530> jig<00:01:15.770> head<00:01:15.920> it<00:01:16.040> really<00:01:16.159> stays<00:01:16.520> on<00:01:16.729> there

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
this jig head it really stays on there

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.450 
this jig head it really stays on there
now<00:01:17.390> notice<00:01:17.900> that<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.229> hook<00:01:18.470> is<00:01:18.500> not<00:01:18.890> centered

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
now notice that the hook is not centered

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.000 
now notice that the hook is not centered
in<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:19.880> jig<00:01:20.119> head<00:01:20.360> it's<00:01:20.810> closer<00:01:21.229> to<00:01:21.439> the<00:01:21.650> top

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
in the jig head it's closer to the top

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.360 
in the jig head it's closer to the top
it's<00:01:22.790> very<00:01:23.180> important<00:01:23.900> when<00:01:24.500> you<00:01:24.710> go<00:01:24.890> to<00:01:24.950> put

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
it's very important when you go to put

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.590 
it's very important when you go to put
one<00:01:25.580> of<00:01:25.730> these<00:01:25.880> on<00:01:26.240> your<00:01:27.460> finesse<00:01:28.460> fish<00:01:28.880> that

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
one of these on your finesse fish that

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.050 
one of these on your finesse fish that
you<00:01:29.810> measure<00:01:30.170> and<00:01:30.590> you<00:01:30.650> figure<00:01:31.190> out<00:01:31.220> where<00:01:31.940> it

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
you measure and you figure out where it

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.640 
you measure and you figure out where it
has<00:01:32.240> to<00:01:32.510> penetrate<00:01:33.050> you<00:01:33.140> don't<00:01:33.320> want<00:01:33.440> to<00:01:33.500> put

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
has to penetrate you don't want to put

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.830 
has to penetrate you don't want to put
it<00:01:33.770> in<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:34.010> middle<00:01:34.190> in<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:34.490> center<00:01:35.210> of<00:01:35.360> the

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
it in the middle in the center of the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.630 
it in the middle in the center of the
actual<00:01:36.320> fish<00:01:36.560> body<00:01:36.800> you<00:01:37.100> want<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:37.370> put<00:01:37.520> it

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
actual fish body you want to put it

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.820 
actual fish body you want to put it
closer<00:01:37.940> to<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.390> top<00:01:38.630> so<00:01:39.290> that<00:01:39.320> it<00:01:39.590> stays

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
closer to the top so that it stays

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.040 
closer to the top so that it stays
straight<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.460> one<00:01:40.610> key<00:01:40.850> thing<00:01:41.150> about<00:01:41.330> rigging

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
straight the one key thing about rigging

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.870 
straight the one key thing about rigging
these<00:01:42.320> finesse<00:01:42.710> fish<00:01:42.979> is<00:01:43.220> that<00:01:43.280> they<00:01:43.670> are

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
these finesse fish is that they are

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.240 
these finesse fish is that they are
straight<00:01:44.330> on<00:01:44.570> your<00:01:44.720> hook<00:01:45.020> just<00:01:45.530> like<00:01:45.800> this<00:01:45.979> one

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
straight on your hook just like this one

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.860 
straight on your hook just like this one
here<00:01:46.549> you<00:01:46.670> see<00:01:46.850> how<00:01:46.970> that<00:01:47.120> one<00:01:47.270> is<00:01:47.390> straight<00:01:47.659> if

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
here you see how that one is straight if

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.530 
here you see how that one is straight if
I<00:01:48.020> hold<00:01:48.170> it<00:01:48.290> this<00:01:48.470> way<00:01:48.530> in<00:01:48.890> this<00:01:49.040> way<00:01:49.100> okay<00:01:49.940> so

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
I hold it this way in this way okay so

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.940 
I hold it this way in this way okay so
what<00:01:50.630> I'm<00:01:50.720> saying<00:01:50.990> is<00:01:51.170> when<00:01:51.380> you<00:01:51.500> actually

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
what I'm saying is when you actually

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.370 
what I'm saying is when you actually
place<00:01:52.610> it<00:01:52.640> on<00:01:53.000> I'm<00:01:53.180> gonna<00:01:53.360> just<00:01:53.659> start<00:01:54.049> this

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
place it on I'm gonna just start this

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.800 
place it on I'm gonna just start this
one<00:01:54.680> instead<00:01:55.460> of<00:01:55.520> hooking<00:01:55.790> it<00:01:56.120> here<00:01:56.570> in<00:01:56.720> the

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
one instead of hooking it here in the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.560 
one instead of hooking it here in the
center<00:01:57.170> I'm<00:01:57.320> gonna<00:01:57.620> hook<00:01:57.860> it<00:01:57.970> just<00:01:58.970> below<00:01:59.540> the

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
center I'm gonna hook it just below the

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.890 
center I'm gonna hook it just below the
top<00:02:00.229> and<00:02:00.740> then<00:02:01.280> I'm<00:02:01.400> going<00:02:01.580> to<00:02:01.610> push<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:02.299> hook

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
top and then I'm going to push the hook

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.590 
top and then I'm going to push the hook
right<00:02:03.380> down<00:02:03.650> the<00:02:03.979> middle<00:02:04.220> of<00:02:04.430> the<00:02:05.240> finesse

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
right down the middle of the finesse

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.380 
right down the middle of the finesse
fish<00:02:05.930> just<00:02:06.500> like<00:02:06.710> that<00:02:06.950> and<00:02:07.280> then<00:02:07.940> you<00:02:08.060> can<00:02:08.209> see

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
fish just like that and then you can see

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.880 
fish just like that and then you can see
where<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.690> grub<00:02:08.869> barbs<00:02:09.200> are<00:02:09.379> going<00:02:09.530> to<00:02:09.590> go<00:02:09.709> in

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
where the grub barbs are going to go in

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.100 
where the grub barbs are going to go in
it's<00:02:10.700> going<00:02:10.940> to<00:02:11.000> go<00:02:11.150> tight<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.659> head<00:02:11.870> and

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
it's going to go tight to the head and

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.259 
it's going to go tight to the head and
if<00:02:12.349> it's<00:02:12.620> got<00:02:12.830> a<00:02:12.860> bend<00:02:13.190> like<00:02:13.400> this<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:13.970> want<00:02:14.180> to

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
if it's got a bend like this you want to

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:15.699 
if it's got a bend like this you want to
take<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:14.629> out<00:02:14.720> so<00:02:14.930> all<00:02:14.989> I<00:02:15.049> do<00:02:15.230> is<00:02:15.260> I<00:02:15.409> apply

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
take it out so all I do is I apply

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.699 
take it out so all I do is I apply
pressure<00:02:16.069> so<00:02:17.000> that<00:02:17.209> it<00:02:17.330> tears<00:02:17.629> because<00:02:18.230> every

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
pressure so that it tears because every

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.130 
pressure so that it tears because every
jig<00:02:19.010> hook<00:02:19.250> is<00:02:19.430> a<00:02:19.459> little<00:02:19.790> different<00:02:20.239> until

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
jig hook is a little different until

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.380 
jig hook is a little different until
it's<00:02:21.439> perfectly<00:02:22.010> straight<00:02:22.459> so<00:02:22.849> the<00:02:23.000> body<00:02:23.239> of

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
it's perfectly straight so the body of

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.990 
it's perfectly straight so the body of
the<00:02:23.689> finesse<00:02:24.019> fish<00:02:24.290> is<00:02:24.530> parallel<00:02:25.099> to<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.760> top

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
the finesse fish is parallel to the top

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.199 
the finesse fish is parallel to the top
of<00:02:26.240> the<00:02:26.750> flat<00:02:27.170> head<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.650> it's<00:02:28.370> also<00:02:28.819> straight

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
of the flat head and it's also straight

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.880 
of the flat head and it's also straight
if<00:02:29.330> I<00:02:29.420> look<00:02:29.599> at<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:29.840> this<00:02:29.959> way<00:02:30.200> there's<00:02:30.440> no<00:02:30.500> big

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
if I look at it this way there's no big

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:31.600 
if I look at it this way there's no big
curve<00:02:31.280> see

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
curve see

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.880 
curve see
it's<00:02:31.850> straight<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:33.050> will<00:02:33.230> allow<00:02:33.470> this<00:02:33.710> to

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
it's straight that will allow this to

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.040 
it's straight that will allow this to
actually<00:02:33.950> fall<00:02:34.670> when<00:02:35.240> you<00:02:35.360> let<00:02:35.510> it<00:02:35.630> drop<00:02:35.810> it'll

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
actually fall when you let it drop it'll

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.990 
actually fall when you let it drop it'll
plane<00:02:36.350> to<00:02:36.590> one<00:02:36.800> side<00:02:37.130> and<00:02:37.460> when<00:02:37.520> you<00:02:37.640> lift<00:02:37.850> it

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
plane to one side and when you lift it

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.400 
plane to one side and when you lift it
up<00:02:38.090> it'll<00:02:38.360> give<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:38.510> this<00:02:38.690> kind<00:02:38.960> of<00:02:39.050> darting

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
up it'll give it this kind of darting

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.620 
up it'll give it this kind of darting
action<00:02:39.800> on<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.070> bottom<00:02:40.460> so<00:02:40.970> it<00:02:41.090> planes<00:02:41.390> from

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
action on the bottom so it planes from

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.080 
action on the bottom so it planes from
side<00:02:41.960> to<00:02:41.990> side<00:02:42.200> very<00:02:42.800> important<00:02:43.250> action<00:02:43.670> with

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
side to side very important action with

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.240 
side to side very important action with
the<00:02:44.240> finesse<00:02:44.540> jig<00:02:44.810> heads<00:02:45.050> now<00:02:45.320> let<00:02:45.920> me<00:02:46.040> show

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
the finesse jig heads now let me show

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.740 
the finesse jig heads now let me show
you<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.520> second<00:02:46.910> way<00:02:46.970> that<00:02:47.000> you<00:02:47.180> can<00:02:47.240> rig<00:02:47.570> them

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
you the second way that you can rig them

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.780 
you the second way that you can rig them
with<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.410> round<00:02:48.740> you<00:02:49.040> get<00:02:49.280> most<00:02:49.490> of<00:02:49.610> you<00:02:49.730> are

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
with the round you get most of you are

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.130 
with the round you get most of you are
familiar<00:02:49.940> with<00:02:50.240> the<00:02:50.390> round<00:02:50.570> jig<00:02:50.810> head<00:02:50.990> you

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
familiar with the round jig head you

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.750 
familiar with the round jig head you
notice<00:02:51.470> this<00:02:51.590> one<00:02:51.770> doesn't<00:02:51.950> have<00:02:52.220> any<00:02:52.400> real

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
notice this one doesn't have any real

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.210 
notice this one doesn't have any real
good<00:02:53.360> grub<00:02:53.630> barb<00:02:53.900> so<00:02:54.500> after<00:02:54.740> getting<00:02:54.890> one<00:02:55.190> or

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
good grub barb so after getting one or

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.850 
good grub barb so after getting one or
two<00:02:55.460> walleyes<00:02:56.050> this<00:02:57.050> finesse<00:02:57.440> fish<00:02:57.680> will

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
two walleyes this finesse fish will

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.620 
two walleyes this finesse fish will
probably<00:02:58.130> slip<00:02:58.460> back<00:02:58.670> so<00:02:59.240> you<00:02:59.300> have<00:02:59.390> to<00:02:59.540> adjust

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
probably slip back so you have to adjust

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.290 
probably slip back so you have to adjust
it<00:03:00.050> every<00:03:00.260> time<00:03:00.500> now<00:03:01.070> in<00:03:01.190> case<00:03:01.370> in<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.820> case<00:03:02.060> of

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
it every time now in case in the case of

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.810 
it every time now in case in the case of
the<00:03:02.450> round<00:03:02.690> you<00:03:02.960> get<00:03:03.140> you'll<00:03:03.350> notice<00:03:03.800> that<00:03:04.580> the

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
the round you get you'll notice that the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.060 
the round you get you'll notice that the
hook<00:03:05.060> actually<00:03:05.810> goes<00:03:06.020> right<00:03:06.260> in<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:06.590> center

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
hook actually goes right in the center

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.430 
hook actually goes right in the center
of<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.520> jig<00:03:07.760> head<00:03:07.970> you<00:03:08.330> see<00:03:08.540> that<00:03:08.750> it's<00:03:09.140> not<00:03:09.320> at

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
of the jig head you see that it's not at

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.340 
of the jig head you see that it's not at
the<00:03:09.470> top<00:03:09.590> so<00:03:10.459> when<00:03:10.670> I<00:03:10.700> put<00:03:11.150> this<00:03:11.690> hook<00:03:11.959> into<00:03:12.170> it

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
the top so when I put this hook into it

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.660 
the top so when I put this hook into it
I<00:03:12.380> want<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.740> make<00:03:12.890> sure<00:03:13.070> that<00:03:13.190> I'm<00:03:13.340> in<00:03:13.520> the

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
I want to make sure that I'm in the

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.940 
I want to make sure that I'm in the
center<00:03:14.090> of<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.870> finesse<00:03:15.290> fish<00:03:15.560> see<00:03:15.800> how<00:03:15.890> I

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
center of the finesse fish see how I

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.800 
center of the finesse fish see how I
have<00:03:16.160> it<00:03:16.280> in<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.459> center<00:03:16.760> there<00:03:16.970> it's<00:03:17.660> not

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
have it in the center there it's not

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.810 
have it in the center there it's not
close<00:03:18.020> to<00:03:18.050> the<00:03:18.200> top<00:03:18.470> I'm<00:03:18.680> going<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.340> put<00:03:19.550> it<00:03:19.670> in

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
close to the top I'm going to put it in

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.430 
close to the top I'm going to put it in
and<00:03:20.030> I'm<00:03:20.330> going<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.510> try<00:03:20.720> to<00:03:20.780> keep<00:03:21.050> the<00:03:21.230> hook

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
and I'm going to try to keep the hook

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.370 
and I'm going to try to keep the hook
going<00:03:21.740> down<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.190> middle<00:03:22.370> and<00:03:22.610> then<00:03:23.510> I<00:03:23.780> try<00:03:24.350> to

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
going down the middle and then I try to

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.470 
going down the middle and then I try to
pierce<00:03:24.830> it<00:03:25.040> so<00:03:25.280> that<00:03:25.400> it<00:03:25.520> comes<00:03:25.700> out<00:03:25.910> the

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
pierce it so that it comes out the

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.600 
pierce it so that it comes out the
center<00:03:26.840> of<00:03:26.990> the<00:03:27.110> back<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:27.590> I<00:03:27.980> very<00:03:28.250> gently

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
center of the back and I very gently

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.230 
center of the back and I very gently
push<00:03:28.910> the<00:03:29.890> finesse<00:03:30.890> fish<00:03:31.190> onto<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:31.820> jig<00:03:32.030> head

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
push the finesse fish onto the jig head

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.060 
push the finesse fish onto the jig head
and<00:03:32.450> you<00:03:32.930> can<00:03:33.110> see<00:03:33.260> that<00:03:33.410> it's<00:03:33.590> on<00:03:33.770> there

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
and you can see that it's on there

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.250 
and you can see that it's on there
pretty<00:03:34.430> straight<00:03:34.910> and<00:03:35.120> that<00:03:35.630> the<00:03:35.750> jig<00:03:35.959> head<00:03:36.140> is

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
pretty straight and that the jig head is

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.750 
pretty straight and that the jig head is
in<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.470> right<00:03:36.500> position<00:03:36.800> and<00:03:37.280> again<00:03:37.370> at<00:03:37.670> the

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
in the right position and again at the

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.660 
in the right position and again at the
top<00:03:37.970> of<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:38.540> finesse<00:03:38.870> fish<00:03:39.170> body<00:03:39.590> comes<00:03:40.489> right

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
top of the finesse fish body comes right

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.449 
top of the finesse fish body comes right
to<00:03:40.700> the<00:03:40.850> top<00:03:41.120> of<00:03:41.300> the<00:03:41.420> jig<00:03:41.660> head<00:03:41.900> so<00:03:42.560> this<00:03:43.220> one

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
to the top of the jig head so this one

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.580 
to the top of the jig head so this one
won't<00:03:43.700> plane<00:03:44.120> when<00:03:44.600> you<00:03:44.630> pull<00:03:44.989> this<00:03:45.170> up<00:03:45.410> and

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
won't plane when you pull this up and

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.199 
won't plane when you pull this up and
you<00:03:45.680> drop<00:03:45.920> it<00:03:46.100> it's<00:03:46.250> gonna<00:03:46.340> fall<00:03:46.700> straight

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
you drop it it's gonna fall straight

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.630 
you drop it it's gonna fall straight
down<00:03:47.500> and<00:03:48.500> because<00:03:48.860> of<00:03:49.010> that<00:03:49.100> it's<00:03:49.310> actually

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
down and because of that it's actually

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.800 
down and because of that it's actually
going<00:03:49.730> to<00:03:49.820> stand<00:03:50.120> up<00:03:50.239> like<00:03:50.360> that<00:03:50.480> near<00:03:50.780> the

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
going to stand up like that near the

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.320 
going to stand up like that near the
bottom<00:03:51.050> so<00:03:51.320> when<00:03:51.470> I'm<00:03:51.590> twitching<00:03:52.190> this<00:03:52.400> it's

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
bottom so when I'm twitching this it's

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.880 
bottom so when I'm twitching this it's
actually<00:03:53.720> going<00:03:53.810> to<00:03:53.870> do<00:03:53.989> this<00:03:54.140> kind<00:03:54.380> of<00:03:54.440> action

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
actually going to do this kind of action

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.949 
actually going to do this kind of action
instead<00:03:55.519> of<00:03:55.790> planing<00:03:56.209> this<00:03:56.600> way<00:03:56.780> when<00:03:56.870> you

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
instead of planing this way when you

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.750 
instead of planing this way when you
pull<00:03:57.170> up<00:03:57.320> it<00:03:57.440> actually<00:03:57.530> planes<00:03:58.070> one<00:03:58.519> way

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
pull up it actually planes one way

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.210 
pull up it actually planes one way
planes<00:03:59.630> the<00:03:59.900> other<00:04:00.050> way<00:04:00.290> okay<00:04:00.739> so<00:04:00.890> sometimes

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
planes the other way okay so sometimes

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.370 
planes the other way okay so sometimes
you<00:04:01.489> want<00:04:01.670> a<00:04:01.730> planing<00:04:02.180> jig<00:04:02.390> head<00:04:02.600> sometimes

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
you want a planing jig head sometimes

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.690 
you want a planing jig head sometimes
you<00:04:03.530> want<00:04:03.680> around<00:04:03.769> you<00:04:04.190> get<00:04:04.370> that<00:04:04.519> fall

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
you want around you get that fall

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.759 
you want around you get that fall
straights<00:04:05.120> down<00:04:05.360> and<00:04:05.630> that<00:04:06.200> the<00:04:06.320> wallet<00:04:06.620> can

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
straights down and that the wallet can

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:08.320 
straights down and that the wallet can
come<00:04:06.980> on<00:04:07.100> top<00:04:07.340> of<00:04:07.519> it<00:04:07.610> and<00:04:07.760> actually<00:04:07.850> seize<00:04:08.180> the

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
come on top of it and actually seize the

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:16.830 
come on top of it and actually seize the
tail<00:04:08.570> sticking<00:04:09.230> into<00:04:09.410> the<00:04:09.769> off<00:04:10.580> the<00:04:10.640> bottom

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.090 

you<00:04:17.840> know<00:04:17.959> when<00:04:18.079> you<00:04:18.169> think<00:04:18.199> of<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.680> Timmins

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
you know when you think of the Timmins

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.759 
you know when you think of the Timmins
in<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.549> Kapuskasing<00:04:20.000> area<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:21.079> you<00:04:21.470> can<00:04:21.620> see

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
in the Kapuskasing area and you can see

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.650 
in the Kapuskasing area and you can see
here<00:04:21.979> on<00:04:22.070> Horwood<00:04:22.460> lake<00:04:22.699> there's<00:04:23.150> actually<00:04:23.540> an

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
here on Horwood lake there's actually an

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.750 
here on Horwood lake there's actually an
old<00:04:23.900> gold<00:04:24.260> mine<00:04:24.590> right<00:04:24.860> up<00:04:25.220> on<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.460> shoreline

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
old gold mine right up on the shoreline

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.790 
old gold mine right up on the shoreline
which<00:04:26.030> i<00:04:26.120> think<00:04:26.180> is<00:04:26.449> kind<00:04:26.690> of<00:04:26.780> neat<00:04:26.990> and<00:04:27.650> we

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
which i think is kind of neat and we

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.110 
which i think is kind of neat and we
were<00:04:27.889> fishing<00:04:28.250> some<00:04:28.430> of<00:04:28.550> this<00:04:28.669> gravel

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
were fishing some of this gravel

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.600 
were fishing some of this gravel
structure<00:04:29.630> that's<00:04:29.810> right<00:04:29.990> in<00:04:30.139> front<00:04:30.350> of<00:04:30.470> it

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
structure that's right in front of it

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.670 
structure that's right in front of it
and<00:04:31.610> I<00:04:32.090> think<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:32.389> walleye<00:04:32.630> are<00:04:32.990> attracted<00:04:33.560> to

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
and I think the walleye are attracted to

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.620 
and I think the walleye are attracted to
that<00:04:33.770> gravel<00:04:34.340> and<00:04:34.460> I<00:04:34.520> can<00:04:34.669> imagine<00:04:34.910> that<00:04:35.449> when

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
that gravel and I can imagine that when

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.810 
that gravel and I can imagine that when
the<00:04:35.720> fish<00:04:35.930> are<00:04:36.080> spawning<00:04:36.410> right<00:04:37.340> along<00:04:37.639> that

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
the fish are spawning right along that

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.790 
the fish are spawning right along that
edge<00:04:38.060> there's<00:04:38.479> probably<00:04:38.870> lots<00:04:39.080> of<00:04:39.320> fish<00:04:39.530> there

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
edge there's probably lots of fish there

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.770 
edge there's probably lots of fish there
Bard<00:04:40.400> you<00:04:40.520> wanted<00:04:40.699> you<00:04:40.760> send<00:04:40.970> me<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.150> net<00:04:41.300> okay
