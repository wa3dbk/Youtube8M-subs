00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.879
 from the random yara bottle series here 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.860

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.890
 Create for me 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.420
 this was our previous class in the previous one 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.439
 episode but we played really 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.640

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.010
 let the cabbage and gravy do so 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.690

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.640
 and then go oh this is pretty cunt class 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.219
 bullshit so okay we have a bison 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.910
 upcoming beetle is a good weapon 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.969
 in addition 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.320
 mp 443 power to as the secondary die 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.820
 probably not use 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.890
 frag grenade to have something to but 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.190

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.930

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.359
 worst but also knows the best fully 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.890
 loaded is of course can sort of 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.489
 screen your pro piece starts with a lot 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.780
 ml 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.210
 photos is that your rig but air it out 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.009
 goes emprise James wardrobe stream of lean 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.479
 is that I can throw my grenade further 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.550
 and charity is so I can walk fast 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.899
 if live action sports lightpak is with 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.920
 the set comes the first priority and 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.810
 digital at ricoh 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.270

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.670
 a game so down to some people 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.020
 adios hi boys we are here in the jar 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.090
 come as can see the steam bath 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.250
 optimal prison break with is the bison and 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.539
 some people in the previous episode 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.250
 said the van jan 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.500
 you only get chilling weapons 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.599
 because you don't have every weapon and lure and 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.920
 of course with this random class one 

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:37.229
 djilbaab and you have to get the weapon 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.890
 and lures i have for i with this 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.360
 series began 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.459
 every weapon that is even there in it 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.810
 I bought the game for a while 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:44.810
 I will also get them in this 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.599
 in this series and I city against and 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.060
 ubisoft stomach and everyone kempen 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:52.739
 they don't joke but I have the feeling 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.330
 at least but of course in one 

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:56.099
 series I also connect changez to the 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.619
 classes that gets the knowledge that i 

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:00.090
 now must pass with this class is already 30 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.739
 Jos in the team and with the spotlight 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.910
 every sport scarf is pretty good 

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:04.229
 difficult because of course there can be 5 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.000
 his skills are made 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.740
 and then sit pussy pussy pussy pussy pussy 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.899
 cunt 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.220
 and that's the time limit on it but we 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.810
 also have our score strings 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.069
 of course the jungle wet and the air 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.930
 we can also supply plates with that 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.950
 kills get computer behind me i have 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:23.340
 also got some nice and oh what what 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.450
 what is an ai timon what a dildo 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.550
 why is he with his own that too 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.019
 play mantis prison break anyway as 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.860
 people to which have to stand and know 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.720
 you anyway 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.800
 it's a camper people who don't kemp 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.940
 have also sewn that stand up 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.440
 namely what you have nothing at all there 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.090
 to acrylic teammate 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.890
 I have already made a set so come 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.989
 slide beckers is of course so that if 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.610
 you dead hole in between your score strings 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.620
 then you can still just bark the tree 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.910
 store so count if I die now 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.650
 the style my score study i put you 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.750
 just by between the rail strike fans 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.799
 I find a nice addition to your 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.980
 call of Duty 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:56.340
 because oh oh hey 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.840
 when the tomato packs the support line 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.190
 like add to call of duty 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.560
 because you can just get your sllist 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.180
 second in between just dies there 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.220
 maybe once dying is like 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.630
 i yo man but what i dont like is chill 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.700
 at beyond Middelburg 3 or of course 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.049
 Also the sport strike back is that they are at 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.269
 mother warfare 3 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.590
 the couple bombs add that because 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.940
 It is of course not a support pack 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.260
 that they just want to be part of the real thing 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.700
 own so she must of course 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.140
 think logically about this but on this 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.850
 call of duty ghosts you have risks 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.890
 just all chair the strips at the 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.420
 support places are like jane had this 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.590
 is now on to be the very priority that 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.690
 everything in the air 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.430
 shoot from the air and I'm very 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.570
 paying attention where I walk 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.040
 because I know that there is a bit of it 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.130
 so Kempen are every corner of me 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.079
 but also I walk past and I check 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.510
 forget to look on the roof 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.530
 I check every corner and I forget 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.079
 look at the roof 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.720
 I checked every corner and the roof 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.160
 I forget what a boss okay kill that 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.930
 dude please wait i'm leaving 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.810
 sit down if you like that is the fairground sniper 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.280
 what I am going to do I try a score 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.489
 pick strings so that's the jungle 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.709
 and once I have jammed that 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.450
 you can of course very much that camper 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.950
 easy killer and 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.720
 now state italy was of his knowledge 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.550
 is now s priority I have now 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.930
 but I still have nothing on us 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.890
 first priority because the and who do you have 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.480
 Of course another score in the sleek 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.070
 air spray should hang a bow 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.120
 you shoot everything that is in the air fear 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.460
 shoot from the sky so that means 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.959
 as the ms duo river or so drop or 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:21.160
 no if nothing becomes such a thing and 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.930
 and have healthy air here on earth 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.550
 then I call myself supplier someone 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.050
 then he does of course fit work well 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.130
 must of thiel swinging leg and tot 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.050
 so far we have half the kills 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.550
 made that keep on going like this 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.720
 it would be fine we could easily 30 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.830
 get kills 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.120
 it goes so far but it could seem like me 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.200
 am really i am really looking for 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.370
 de and miss you 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.650
 it is nice that it is running around 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.990
 with to find but search for and him 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.940
 is that I really think the pinnacle of 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.200
 you actually like irritation because I want to 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.790
 not search for my music programs 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.680
 come to the name so let's go 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.760
 wines mies is running Rose is Rose 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.660
 that's what I want from good food 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.730
 come on here 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.710
 jim multi kilo man4 man4 pack a carafe 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.520
 on i could tap rp scale on move 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.169
 to go 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.880
 so supposed to go guys come on and him 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.530
 keep walking around 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.210
 I wait a while to press in fame 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.890
 I had creamy care pack at the same time 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.150
 in with my juggernaut 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.669
 but now I want the campus again 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.720
 times because I think you see again 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.820
 somewhere is camping la die vent on purpose 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.710
 walk because look here looks one 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.450
 they kempen and if you of course that guy 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.190
 just all that chilled so here 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.630
 walked upstairs then he is now exactly what 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.669
 that I now admit that I am a pure one 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.870
 standing square is logical thinking 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:21.700
 if you know there is a cam chat culture 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.680
 first camper and then go behind the 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.669
 person to whom you mainly take action there 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.010
 because otherwise you go naturally 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.180
 just die by the camper or by 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.870
 that person who may have already walked like that 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.940
 is 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.680
 always pay attention because they are 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.000
 bullshit jets and nobody wants that 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.620
 I have to go to Speyer team almost again 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.700
 the new one is I can get him pretty good 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.990
 of course call in and I want to have a moment 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.490
 a few kills do to grips with jim 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.380
 had a pakkie then we go to about 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.600
 walking around that you will be done 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.490
 but once it no boys allowed 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.550
 not okay I do in my score pieces 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.080
 care package and the juggernaut 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.550
 and see if I stand still 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.440
 the church patch of get 111 of course 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.570
 again for some extra children 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.010
 So once again the bison is of course 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.040
 made stronger in the latest update and 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.390
 that thing is boy now oh i love care 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.430
 Package for stubborn care pack is snei 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.780
 what's in an ams that I can do 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.540
 good use is just about this and 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.130
 the mine someone down porn glasgow msn this 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.110
 is a jungle at ricoh 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.849
 That means that of course you travel 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.229
 shot app and a magnum 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:18.550
 whatever the gun was with such a thick one 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:19.599
 magnum a cunt as long as i am the gun 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.789
 Grandma that I will never meet 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:22.240
 shoot you ok wait wait wait I'm going 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:24.309
 do it differently
