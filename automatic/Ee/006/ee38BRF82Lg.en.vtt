years of prayers came together and in

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.610 
years of prayers came together and in

sixth grade I wasn't interested anymore
I<00:02:30.040> liked<00:02:30.489> a<00:02:30.580> girl<00:02:30.760> named<00:02:31.030> Kim<00:02:31.410> but<00:02:32.410> the

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
I liked a girl named Kim but the

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.500 
I liked a girl named Kim but the
question<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:33.070> prayer<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.700> what<00:02:33.970> do<00:02:34.120> we<00:02:34.269> pray

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
question of prayer and what do we pray

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.390 
question of prayer and what do we pray
for<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:34.930> is<00:02:35.019> God<00:02:35.230> listening<00:02:35.739> like<00:02:35.950> that<00:02:36.130> dog

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
for and is God listening like that dog

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.580 
for and is God listening like that dog
in<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.760> far<00:02:36.970> side<00:02:37.209> coming<00:02:37.480> for<00:02:38.140> you<00:02:38.230> know<00:02:38.350> what

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
in the far side coming for you know what

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.140 
in the far side coming for you know what
do<00:02:38.799> we<00:02:38.950> pray<00:02:39.220> for<00:02:41.519> sometimes<00:02:42.519> we<00:02:42.670> don't<00:02:42.940> get

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
do we pray for sometimes we don't get

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.479 
do we pray for sometimes we don't get
the<00:02:43.299> answer<00:02:43.690> that<00:02:43.720> we're<00:02:44.080> wanting<00:02:44.560> you<00:02:45.340> know

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
the answer that we're wanting you know

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.600 
the answer that we're wanting you know
maybe<00:02:45.820> God<00:02:46.120> is<00:02:46.150> saying<00:02:46.870> no<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:47.290> our<00:02:47.709> prayer

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
maybe God is saying no to our prayer

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.070 
maybe God is saying no to our prayer
and<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:49.060> think<00:02:49.360> with<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:50.290> gift<00:02:51.220> of<00:02:51.400> our<00:02:51.520> faith

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
and I think with the gift of our faith

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.350 
and I think with the gift of our faith
we<00:02:53.080> see<00:02:53.320> a<00:02:53.350> different<00:02:53.770> side<00:02:54.010> of<00:02:54.070> things<00:02:54.520> the

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
we see a different side of things the

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.940 
we see a different side of things the
Christian<00:02:55.840> approach<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.410> prayer<00:02:56.710> is

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
Christian approach to prayer is

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.220 
Christian approach to prayer is
completely<00:02:57.700> different<00:02:57.910> you<00:02:58.750> know<00:02:58.870> we<00:02:59.050> don't

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
completely different you know we don't

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.050 
completely different you know we don't
need<00:02:59.470> to<00:02:59.620> treat<00:02:59.860> God<00:03:00.130> as<00:03:00.340> if<00:03:00.490> he's<00:03:00.670> Santa<00:03:00.970> Claus

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
need to treat God as if he's Santa Claus

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.570 
need to treat God as if he's Santa Claus

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
rather Jesus taught us to pray and to

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.910 
rather Jesus taught us to pray and to

seek and to ask that we may bring our

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.400 
seek and to ask that we may bring our
own<00:03:12.100> hearts<00:03:12.520> into<00:03:12.940> accord<00:03:13.330> with<00:03:13.660> God's<00:03:14.080> will

own hearts into accord with God's will

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.100 
own hearts into accord with God's will
not<00:03:14.890> our<00:03:15.160> will<00:03:15.460> sometimes<00:03:16.390> when<00:03:16.630> we<00:03:16.780> pray

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
not our will sometimes when we pray

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.140 
not our will sometimes when we pray
we're<00:03:17.590> trying<00:03:17.860> to<00:03:17.950> figure<00:03:18.220> out<00:03:18.280> how<00:03:18.730> to<00:03:18.790> get

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
we're trying to figure out how to get

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.800 
we're trying to figure out how to get
God<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.480> do<00:03:20.140> what<00:03:20.440> we<00:03:20.890> want<00:03:21.130> him<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.430> do<00:03:21.690> but<00:03:22.690> our

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
God to do what we want him to do but our

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.770 
God to do what we want him to do but our
faith<00:03:23.170> shows<00:03:23.860> us<00:03:24.130> that<00:03:24.460> Christian<00:03:25.240> prayer<00:03:25.540> is

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
faith shows us that Christian prayer is

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.410 
faith shows us that Christian prayer is
actually<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.500> opposite<00:03:27.010> when<00:03:27.970> we<00:03:28.120> pray<00:03:28.390> we

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
actually the opposite when we pray we

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.960 
actually the opposite when we pray we
should<00:03:29.020> ask<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.590> Lord<00:03:29.830> for<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.190> grace<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.459> do

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
should ask the Lord for the grace to do

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.050 
should ask the Lord for the grace to do
what<00:03:31.720> he<00:03:32.050> wants<00:03:32.380> us<00:03:32.530> to<00:03:32.560> do<00:03:32.920> so<00:03:33.310> when<00:03:33.490> I<00:03:33.520> started

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
what he wants us to do so when I started

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.120 
what he wants us to do so when I started
to<00:03:34.120> pray<00:03:34.450> I<00:03:34.480> was<00:03:34.870> asking<00:03:35.260> God<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:35.470> give<00:03:35.740> me<00:03:35.920> a

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
to pray I was asking God to give me a

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.699 
to pray I was asking God to give me a
girlfriend<00:03:36.730> named<00:03:36.940> Kristi<00:03:37.450> and<00:03:37.690> now<00:03:38.530> I've
