00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.650
 of the pokémon 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.680
 emeraude I recently made a video 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.510
 showing how to create them practically 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.970
 you find the guy swaps the item with 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.949
 he gets the evolutionary stones if 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.590
 You want to check the link is there in the 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.390
 description but today I would show the 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.820
 the location of each of them that you 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.510
 usually found by the game ok 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.879
 the first one will be the free stone 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.210
 so you come here to strengthen and 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.820
 Leave a rebellion hurry ok you come 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.280

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.260
 zinha will have a bridge here you will not 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.210
 cross her ok 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.789
 come to this lag where you have captured 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.680
 fibers that are in them and see that I 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.510
 I walked almost to the end of it to 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.410
 find the fibers but I found this 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.379
 It does not matter 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.539
 You come here and look at the chain. 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.369
 It's here, it's here, man. It's not here. 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.119
 obviously here in my game because I already 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.000
 I caught 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.729
 but anyway alif stone will be here is just 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.090
 You pick up ok, the next one's gonna be the 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.770
 thunder stone for us to achieve 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.340

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.210
 the generator of the city and itself that the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.350

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.890

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.020
 stepping on buttons is very quiet this 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.910
 only by pressing the 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:14.470
 this one does not 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.870

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.880
 She's going to think here or here at last. 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.690

 big party already the deal but ours 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.490
 main objective from the beginning was 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.150

 that simple galera so for the stones 

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.800
 of evolution because I 'm doing 

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:45.630
