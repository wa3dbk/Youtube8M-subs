00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.860
 mere women okay today we're going 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.330
 have about mop richard de snaijer and 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.610
 will that be the garcia 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.470
 it's Monday, November 28 and this is the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:22.199
 very last episode of the rabo 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:24.029
 hockey journal with 19 points out of 13 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.269
 the women stand up from competitions 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.189
 the sixth place in the rabo main class 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.019
 an unprecedented savage for the newcomer 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.369
 excuse the last two duels 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.930
 the winter break not only six points 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.960
 left with encounters with haagse 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.340
 club hckz and hdm but it also proved it 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.500
 certainly does not depend on the 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.710
 penalty corner from lieke van wijk and in 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.210
 lesser floor of mountains 4 of the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.059
 last five hits were used up 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.860
 namely field goal it will be the team 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.600
 from coach toon siepman only more 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.949
 strong in the idea that it is main class 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.989
 at least with the season 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.280
 can be extended 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.570
 however, it should not be hunted too early 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.129
 be in brabant 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.719
 Hurley because the season was at 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.800
 entering the winter break also good 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.420
 in front of 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.339
 but after a dramatic sequel saw the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.470
 the red line is still anxiously close 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.330
 to prevent such a scenario 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.810
 so a bell can be stuck in Amsterdam 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.810
 no harm 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.830
 attachment went last week 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.770
 of course not about hckz that sunday 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.420
 simply was defeated with 6 one 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.220
 no with the proud and unapproachable 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.810
 the frontrunner in the throw everything was in it 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.580
 sign of the very all around wieke 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.100
 dijkstra that since Thursday by the 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.600
 life goes as a former international 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.040
 our reporter bastian rattle 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.540
 to laren coach richard de 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.730
 snaijer just his pronunciation in it 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.710
 general newspaper for the snaijer 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.420
 namely that he was expecting dijkstra 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.430
 to take on training as a wreck 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.960
 let's first say that 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.610
 it faces true that I got 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.890
 thereby also said it may also be that 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.390
 she is relieved we come on train and 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.580
 so those two extremes 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.810
 of the emotional people 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.900
 of course you also have to go human 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.430
 he handle super super picked up 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.900
 professional immediately has a delicious taste 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.280
 are training with a smile 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.380
 he actually picked them up differently 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.080
 was relieved that the door is closed and that 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.790
 she now clarifies he has and that we 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.320
 Just have the Friday back there too 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.280
 very well talked about from one on 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.929
 human way 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.460
 so you can coach you must of course 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.440
 You must of course continue hockey 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.150
 look but i also think it's human 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.530
 must also be in it and then we grab 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.540
 very good on the team too 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.190
 and that is why it is Sunday today 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.489
 just played well week was too 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.489
 good today 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.860
 that garcia will be in top form in the 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.080
 last four duels before the winter break 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.060
 the argentine striker of schc was good 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.530
 for eight goals including the 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.940
 winning goal in the top match Sunday 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.530
 against the forest 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.630
 a goal that could be seen live at the 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.470
 nos but of which we unfortunately have no images 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.940
 to have 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.920
 that's why we work with youtube 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.570
 material it might be the 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.410
 garcia's last goal for foundation 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.680
 may have been 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.240
 at least with regard to carlos retake who 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.890
 the Argentinian national coach in silence 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.560
 garcia to include in its selection as 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.210
 be tall in a our competition 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.340
 garcia hope retake who else on 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.050
 to be able to bring thoughts but as the 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.490
 argentine is wise he keeps himself 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.290
 to his word 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.660
 create an exception position for 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.730
 a player even though he is like garcia 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.440
 of an exceptional level is disastrous 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.550
 in a team sport 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.960
 certainly in the run-up to it 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.110
 most important thing that exists 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.000
 the olympic games well 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.920
 the decor can go because this was the 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.230
 very last episode of the rabo 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.970
 hockey news very likely until 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.980
 relief from the person on whose toes we 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.690
 the past few years have stood but 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.250
 hopefully mostly to regret the 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.540
 thousands of hokkien enthusiasts who each 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.650
 week again took the trouble to get a new one 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.330
 view episode 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.330
 for which our thank you day
