not a bad one either here we go with
another<00:00:43.920> land<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:44.910> now<00:00:45.600> we<00:00:45.660> can<00:00:45.870> play<00:00:45.989> firing

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
another land so now we can play firing

another land so now we can play firing
turn<00:00:46.890> form<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.399> then<00:00:47.460> we've<00:00:47.610> got<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.789> pretty

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
turn form and then we've got a pretty

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.920 
turn form and then we've got a pretty
aggressive<00:00:48.590> line<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:50.629> compare<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.780> my

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
aggressive line to compare to my

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.200 
aggressive line to compare to my
opponents<00:00:52.530> nothing<00:00:53.100> with<00:00:53.309> three<00:00:53.520> mana<00:00:56.210> so

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
opponents nothing with three mana so

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.450

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
even though started out on five it's

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.799 
even though started out on five it's
looking<00:00:59.640> pretty<00:00:59.940> good<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.120> far<00:01:02.629> all<00:01:03.629> right

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
looking pretty good so far all right

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.460 
firing Phoenix threatening note counter
with<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> scatter<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.340> that's<00:01:11.360> unfortunate<00:01:12.470> now

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
with a scatter so that's unfortunate now

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.469

we've<00:01:13.680> got<00:01:15.470> Griffin<00:01:16.470> protector<00:01:17.009> which<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.790> play

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
we've got Griffin protector which I play

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.830 
we've got Griffin protector which I play
or<00:01:18.720> grapples<00:01:19.140> first<00:01:19.409> see<00:01:19.680> what<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.830> spin<00:01:20.400> up<00:01:20.840> so

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
or grapples first see what I spin up so

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.840 
or grapples first see what I spin up so
we've<00:01:21.990> got<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> choice<00:01:22.650> between<00:01:22.890> s<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.340> scatter

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
we've got a choice between s and scatter

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.179 
we've got a choice between s and scatter
and<00:01:24.030> downpour<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.600> even<00:01:24.960> though<00:01:25.080> my<00:01:25.770> opponent

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
and downpour and even though my opponent

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.999 
and downpour and even though my opponent
is<00:01:26.250> going<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.880> see<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.119> I've<00:01:27.479> got<00:01:28.009> essence

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
is going to see that I've got essence

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.060 
is going to see that I've got essence
cat<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.220> choose<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.700> over<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.150> downpour<00:01:30.689> I

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
cat I choose that over the downpour I

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.280 
cat I choose that over the downpour I
think<00:01:32.070> it's<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.340> stronger<00:01:32.729> cut<00:01:33.290> especially

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
think it's the stronger cut especially

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.620 
think it's the stronger cut especially
with<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.470> board<00:01:34.710> as<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.329> and<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.450> plays

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
with the board as it is and it plays

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.200 
with the board as it is and it plays
tricks<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.259> trade<00:01:38.150> making<00:01:39.150> an

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
tricks of the trade making an

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.660 
tricks of the trade making an
unblockable<00:01:39.869> protector

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.490 

so<00:01:45.670> maybe<00:01:46.120> there's<00:01:46.450> a<00:01:46.540> crucial<00:01:47.050> place<00:01:47.230> should

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
so maybe there's a crucial place should

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.570 
so maybe there's a crucial place should
i<00:01:47.530> have<00:01:47.710> taken<00:01:47.860> the<00:01:48.040> downpour<00:01:48.490> we'll<00:01:48.910> see<00:01:49.500> in

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
i have taken the downpour we'll see in

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.320 
i have taken the downpour we'll see in
43<00:01:51.580> again<00:01:51.910> with<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.150> world<00:01:52.330> concern<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.970> pass

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
43 again with the world concern and pass

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.550 
43 again with the world concern and pass
it<00:01:55.540> back<00:01:55.660> so<00:01:55.930> the<00:01:56.500> race<00:01:56.680> is<00:01:56.710> looking<00:01:57.190> okay<00:01:58.560> it

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
it back so the race is looking okay it

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.900 
it back so the race is looking okay it
could<00:01:59.770> go<00:01:59.920> either<00:01:59.950> way<00:02:00.280> at<00:02:00.490> this<00:02:00.610> stage

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
could go either way at this stage

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.030 
could go either way at this stage

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
if I draw anything like unsummon should

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.470 
if I draw anything like unsummon should
be<00:02:06.130> in<00:02:06.250> good<00:02:06.460> stead<00:02:06.670> for<00:02:06.730> winning<00:02:07.090> this<00:02:07.210> race
