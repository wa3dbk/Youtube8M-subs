00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.870
 although we have several videos there is 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.630
 How many of these people have no doubt? 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.270
 but it 's the ones I get the most from 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.330
 facebook here on the channel are like 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.820
 update windows phone 8.1 despite 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.609
 It's good to talk about the staff talk about a 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.279
 review that only speaks in groups and videos 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.910
 still a lot of people have doubts about 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.250
 that 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.620
 so today I'm going to make a video there 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.000
 explain how you can receive 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.520
 the updates predicted fuck velox as the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.890
 already says are previous are 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.530
 planned for developers and 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.500
 can have a seat or not 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.510
 usually the updates I did 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.860
 It's not that stupid, Microsoft is 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:01:00.090
 using there since the gdr 32 roni 8 there came 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:04.140
 to 12 by 8 1 and now gdf from me - phone 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.390
 81 million people update has bugs sim 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.189
 but most have no problem account 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.020
 I never had that myself 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.200
 but I have to let this pattern can 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.479
 Yes occur bugs in the system because it 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.860
 it is about a system still in 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.869
 development 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.540
