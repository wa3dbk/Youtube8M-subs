00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:15.480
 the main parts of the concrete mixer are 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:18.119
 tipper chassis gamboa crown 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.550
 segmented gear rack 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.490
 pedal spring steering wheel 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.039
 The chassis of the concrete mixer is 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.830
 square tubular structure with 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.470
 two millimeters with reinforcements between 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.140
 functions for greater rigidity and 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.660
 stability for the equipment beyond 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.210
 better finish and durability 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.250
 for being a unique chassis providing 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.190
 greater ease of unloading the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.660
 Concrete or rocker is reinforced 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.140
 composed of rectangular tubes and 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.170
 with a thickness of 3 millimeters 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.629
 the drum mixer has Menegotti 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.789
 the design of the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.070
 drum and the angle of the three phases 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.890
 mixers provide greater efficiency 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.750
 and less time allowing a mixture 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.970
 more homogeneous material 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.729
 the drum is manufactured through the process 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.140
 of cold stamping which together with 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.790
 reinforcements ensure longer life 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.250
 segmented rack model of the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.240
 menegotti is patented pioneer in 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.740
 market divided into six equal parts and 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.170
 interchangeable with the entire rack 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.890
 has the benefits of greater ease 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.890
 of exchange and adjustment with better opinion 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.040
 quality of tooth formation and lower 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.960
 noise in the event of disruption shock is 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.990
 possible to exchange only one 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.020
 reduction of logistics costs and 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.990
 to have business thinking about 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.939
 a better economy for the operator 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.340
 developed the steering wheel 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.189
 brings lightness and ease in the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.009
 tipping of the drum is made with 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.409
 stamped and has a closed system that 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.659
 ensures durability and avoids 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.790
 any type of accident 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.489
 the pedal spring that used to be 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.829
 now traction compression 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:15.900
 this type of ball is more durable and 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:15.900
 allows you to switch easily
