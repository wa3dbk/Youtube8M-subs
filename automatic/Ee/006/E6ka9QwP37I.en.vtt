00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
you don't like to feel it in the fish so

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.199

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:53.209 
because we haven't actually scaled this

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:56.889 
because we haven't actually scaled this
one<00:01:53.450> so<00:01:54.289> what<00:01:54.709> I'll<00:01:54.860> do<00:01:55.039> is<00:01:55.069> I'll<00:01:55.750> put<00:01:56.750> the
