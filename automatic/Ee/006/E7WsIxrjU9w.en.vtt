00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.770 

now<00:05:34.729> it<00:05:35.360> is<00:05:35.600> taking<00:05:36.380> me<00:05:36.530> to<00:05:36.740> all<00:05:37.040> the<00:05:37.370> steps<00:05:37.780> so

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
now it is taking me to all the steps so

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.960 
now it is taking me to all the steps so
I<00:05:38.810> guess<00:05:38.930> it's<00:05:39.290> going<00:05:39.620> to<00:05:39.740> get<00:05:39.889> connected<00:05:42.970> I'm

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
I guess it's going to get connected I'm

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:55.930 
I guess it's going to get connected I'm
going<00:05:44.450> to<00:05:44.539> try<00:05:44.840> to<00:05:44.960> set<00:05:45.380> up<00:05:45.530> as<00:05:45.740> a<00:05:45.770> new

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.740 

I<00:05:57.580> would<00:05:58.580> just<00:05:58.610> make<00:05:59.030> sure<00:05:59.240> whether<00:05:59.480> it<00:05:59.630> is

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
I would just make sure whether it is

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.020 
I would just make sure whether it is
connected<00:06:00.430> getting<00:06:01.430> connected<00:06:01.790> to<00:06:01.910> the

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
connected getting connected to the

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.910 
connected getting connected to the
network<00:06:02.240> or<00:06:02.660> not<00:06:02.810> so<00:06:03.020> what<00:06:03.230> I'm<00:06:03.320> going<00:06:03.530> to<00:06:03.620> do

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:03.920 
network or not so what I'm going to do

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.430 
network or not so what I'm going to do
right<00:06:03.950> now<00:06:04.190> is<00:06:04.700> I'm<00:06:05.570> going<00:06:05.810> to<00:06:05.900> scape<00:06:06.230> all

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
right now is I'm going to scape all

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.380 
right now is I'm going to scape all
these<00:06:06.650> points<00:06:06.890> and<00:06:07.250> I<00:06:07.340> want<00:06:07.550> to<00:06:07.580> see<00:06:07.910> whether

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.390 
these points and I want to see whether

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:17.260 
these points and I want to see whether
it<00:06:08.630> gets<00:06:08.810> connected<00:06:09.080> to<00:06:09.500> the<00:06:09.620> network<00:06:12.940> so<00:06:16.270> it

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
it gets connected to the network so it

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.750 
it gets connected to the network so it
is<00:06:17.330> asking<00:06:17.900> me<00:06:18.080> if<00:06:18.260> I<00:06:18.530> am<00:06:18.590> sure<00:06:18.830> I<00:06:18.890> want<00:06:19.250> to<00:06:19.310> get

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:19.760 
is asking me if I am sure I want to get

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.250 
is asking me if I am sure I want to get
it<00:06:19.820> started<00:06:20.750> without<00:06:21.170> that<00:06:21.500> so<00:06:21.740> I'm<00:06:21.980> going<00:06:22.310> to

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
it started without that so I'm going to

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:41.770 
it started without that so I'm going to
say<00:06:24.260> yes<00:06:37.900> if<00:06:38.900> you<00:06:39.500> see<00:06:39.950> here<00:06:40.460> on<00:06:40.670> the<00:06:41.090> top<00:06:41.390> it<00:06:41.720> is

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:41.780 
say yes if you see here on the top it is

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:46.000 
say yes if you see here on the top it is
showing<00:06:42.200> that<00:06:42.560> it<00:06:42.710> is<00:06:42.890> connected<00:06:43.250> to<00:06:43.700> h2<00:06:45.010> you

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.010 
showing that it is connected to h2 you

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.780 
showing that it is connected to h2 you
see<00:06:46.190> that<00:06:47.350> so<00:06:48.350> that<00:06:48.590> means<00:06:48.830> it<00:06:49.130> can<00:06:49.490> get

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:49.790 
see that so that means it can get

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:54.100 
see that so that means it can get
connected<00:06:51.160> to<00:06:52.160> any<00:06:52.400> network<00:06:52.970> and<00:06:53.150> it's<00:06:53.930> not

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.110 
connected to any network and it's not

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.500 
connected to any network and it's not
h2o<00:06:54.560> when<00:06:54.800> it<00:06:54.920> works<00:06:55.130> with<00:06:55.370> h2o<00:06:55.880> it<00:06:56.120> will<00:06:56.300> work

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.510 
h2o when it works with h2o it will work

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.159 
h2o when it works with h2o it will work
with<00:06:56.720> AT&amp;T<00:06:57.160> which<00:06:58.160> is<00:06:58.340> having<00:06:58.870> which<00:06:59.870> is<00:07:00.020> also

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:00.169 
with AT&amp;T which is having which is also

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:05.130 
with AT&amp;T which is having which is also
using<00:07:00.560> I<00:07:02.110> story<00:07:03.110> is<00:07:03.200> using<00:07:03.500> AT&amp;T<00:07:04.280> network<00:07:04.610> and

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:05.140 
using I story is using AT&amp;T network and

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:09.000 
using I story is using AT&amp;T network and
then<00:07:06.370> you<00:07:07.370> can<00:07:07.520> also<00:07:07.640> use<00:07:07.850> the<00:07:08.210> same<00:07:08.419> with

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.010 
then you can also use the same with

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.900 
then you can also use the same with
tmobile<00:07:10.010> or<00:07:10.220> any<00:07:10.940> other<00:07:11.150> circle<00:07:11.660> card

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:12.910 
tmobile or any other circle card

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.409 
tmobile or any other circle card
whichever<00:07:13.910> gsm<00:07:14.390> company<00:07:14.750> you<00:07:14.810> want<00:07:14.870> to<00:07:15.050> use<00:07:15.200> it

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:16.419
