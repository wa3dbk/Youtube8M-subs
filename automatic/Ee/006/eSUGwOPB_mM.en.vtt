00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.190 

so<00:00:07.950> some<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.429> people<00:00:08.820> wanted<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.179> know<00:00:09.360> how<00:00:10.110> am

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
so some of people wanted to know how am

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.080 
so some of people wanted to know how am
I<00:00:10.260> ballistic<00:00:10.740> knife<00:00:10.920> action<00:00:11.429> worked<00:00:11.700> because

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
I ballistic knife action worked because

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.030 
I ballistic knife action worked because
I<00:00:12.389> didn't<00:00:12.630> explain<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:13.019> very<00:00:13.170> well<00:00:13.290> in<00:00:13.650> my<00:00:13.769> last

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
I didn't explain it very well in my last

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.790 
I didn't explain it very well in my last
video<00:00:14.219> so<00:00:14.610> I'm<00:00:14.700> gonna<00:00:14.880> take<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.150> apart<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.800> you

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
video so I'm gonna take it apart and you

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:25.939 
video so I'm gonna take it apart and you
guys<00:00:16.949> will<00:00:17.100> see<00:00:21.890> so<00:00:22.890> um<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.789> gun<00:00:24.000> works<00:00:24.949> with

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
guys will see so um the gun works with

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.230 
guys will see so um the gun works with
this<00:00:26.189> quick<00:00:26.519> release<00:00:26.820> from<00:00:27.000> an<00:00:27.119> air

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
this quick release from an air

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.779 
this quick release from an air
compressor<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:28.050> got<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.890> was<00:00:29.580> just

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
compressor that I got it and was just

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.400 
compressor that I got it and was just
left<00:00:30.029> with<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.449> empty<00:00:30.779> thing<00:00:31.050> with<00:00:31.260> the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
left with the empty thing with the

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.049 
left with the empty thing with the
actual<00:00:31.820> release<00:00:32.820> mechanism<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:34.340> um<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
actual release mechanism and um the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.299 
actual release mechanism and um the
knife<00:00:36.239> blade<00:00:36.660> would<00:00:36.989> be<00:00:37.170> here<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.620> took<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.250> off

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
knife blade would be here I took it off

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.209 
knife blade would be here I took it off
for<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> demonstration<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.770> that<00:00:40.770> goes<00:00:40.920> in

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
for a demonstration and that goes in

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.940 
for a demonstration and that goes in
like<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:42.170> normally<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.290> would<00:00:43.469> be<00:00:43.590> in

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
like so and normally this would be in

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.729 
like so and normally this would be in
the<00:00:44.460> knife<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.809> basically<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.410> have<00:00:46.559> the

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
the knife and so basically you have the

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.080 
the knife and so basically you have the
piston<00:00:47.280> here<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:48.320> when<00:00:49.320> it's<00:00:49.530> pressurized

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
piston here and when it's pressurized

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.830 
piston here and when it's pressurized
the<00:00:51.090> piston<00:00:51.680> pushes<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.660> when<00:00:54.660> you

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
the piston pushes on this and when you

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.529 
the piston pushes on this and when you
release<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.590> quick<00:00:55.800> release<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.940> flies<00:00:57.270> out

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
release the quick release this flies out

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.340 
release the quick release this flies out
and<00:00:58.250> the<00:00:59.250> stopper<00:00:59.760> which<00:01:00.239> we<00:01:00.480> normally<00:01:00.930> be

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
and the stopper which we normally be

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.270 
and the stopper which we normally be
here<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:02.270> a<00:01:03.290> stop<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.530> piston<00:01:04.890> from<00:01:05.040> coming

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
here is a stop the piston from coming

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.219 
here is a stop the piston from coming
out<00:01:05.400> all<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.670> way<00:01:05.790> which<00:01:06.510> starts<00:01:06.869> there<00:01:07.020> from

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
out all the way which starts there from

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.170 
out all the way which starts there from
escaping<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.950> that's<00:01:08.549> why<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.820> knife's

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
escaping and that's why the knife's

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.170 
escaping and that's why the knife's
silent<00:01:09.270> too<00:01:10.100> so<00:01:11.100> here<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.729> ballistic<00:01:12.150> knife

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
silent too so here the ballistic knife

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.440 
silent too so here the ballistic knife
has<00:01:12.630> been<00:01:13.280> pre<00:01:14.280> charged<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.880> ready<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.210> fire

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
has been pre charged and ready to fire

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.830 
has been pre charged and ready to fire
it's<00:01:16.259> ready<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.619> fire<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.570> it's<00:01:18.570> at<00:01:18.659> low

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
it's ready to fire and it's at low

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.570 
it's ready to fire and it's at low
pressure<00:01:19.110> now<00:01:19.350> for<00:01:19.590> demonstration<00:01:19.710> purposes

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
pressure now for demonstration purposes

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.320 
pressure now for demonstration purposes
and<00:01:21.439> so<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:23.159> pull<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.490> trip<00:01:23.729> quick<00:01:23.970> release

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
and so you pull the trip quick release

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.490 
and so you pull the trip quick release
here<00:01:24.840> pull<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.350> back<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.549> releases<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
here pull it back and it releases the

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.550 
here pull it back and it releases the
head<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.659> would<00:01:30.810> normally<00:01:30.960> fly<00:01:31.380> out

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
head and this would normally fly out

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.149 
head and this would normally fly out
with<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.860> blade<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:33.799> piston<00:01:34.799> would

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
with the blade and the piston would

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.980 
with the blade and the piston would
obviously<00:01:35.460> stay<00:01:35.729> inside<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.600> bumper

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
obviously stay inside and the bumper

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.310 
obviously stay inside and the bumper
right<00:01:37.799> there<00:01:38.040> would<00:01:38.909> stop<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.420> for<00:01:39.840> making<00:01:40.170> any

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
right there would stop it for making any

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.940 
right there would stop it for making any
noise<00:01:40.590> because<00:01:41.100> no<00:01:41.430> air<00:01:41.640> escape<00:01:42.000> here<00:01:42.869> um<00:01:43.140> you

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
noise because no air escape here um you

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.840 
noise because no air escape here um you
can<00:01:44.100> see<00:01:45.320> very<00:01:46.320> silent<00:01:46.799> except<00:01:47.340> i'm<00:01:47.549> gonna<00:01:47.729> hit

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
can see very silent except i'm gonna hit

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.710 
can see very silent except i'm gonna hit
my<00:01:48.000> fridge<00:01:48.240> um<00:01:48.710> yeah
