preferred<00:00:15.030> method<00:00:15.650> if<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.800> can<00:00:16.949> see<00:00:17.160> of

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
preferred method if you can see of

preferred method if you can see of
taking<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.760> piece<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.029> EMT<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:21.109> beat<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.260> flat

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
taking a piece of EMT and beat it flat

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.650 
taking a piece of EMT and beat it flat
and<00:00:25.279> so<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.340> can<00:00:26.490> take<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.670> quarter<00:00:27.119> inch<00:00:27.359> lag

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
and so it can take a quarter inch lag

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.560 
and so it can take a quarter inch lag
screw<00:00:28.130> that's<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.400> quarter-inch<00:00:29.789> bolt<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.539> nut

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
screw that's a quarter-inch bolt and nut

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.810 
screw that's a quarter-inch bolt and nut
down<00:00:31.349> here<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.930> plumbing<00:00:33.930> strap

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
down here and this is a plumbing strap

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.510 
down here and this is a plumbing strap
okay<00:00:35.820> that's<00:00:36.090> within<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.540> top<00:00:36.950> 1/3<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:40.520> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
okay that's within the top 1/3 and the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.029 
okay that's within the top 1/3 and the
bottom<00:00:41.940> 1/3<00:00:43.460> okay<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.960> this<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.829> is

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
bottom 1/3 okay and this is a this is

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.080 
bottom 1/3 okay and this is a this is
very<00:00:47.399> good

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
very good

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.850 
very good
to<00:00:48.809> do<00:00:49.969> because<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.239> just<00:00:51.690> hard<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.500> see<00:00:52.680> what

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
to do because I just hard to see what

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.029 
to do because I just hard to see what
the<00:00:52.890> space<00:00:53.510> is<00:00:54.510> quite<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.960> bit<00:00:55.199> behind<00:00:55.620> here<00:00:56.129> and

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
the space is quite a bit behind here and

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.889 
the space is quite a bit behind here and
in<00:00:59.039> other<00:00:59.340> methods<00:00:59.910> you<00:00:59.969> have<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.210> block<00:01:00.600> with

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
in other methods you have to block with

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.280 
in other methods you have to block with
a<00:01:00.960> piece<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.260> 2x4<00:01:02.129> or<00:01:02.609> something<00:01:03.270> that's<00:01:03.960> very

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
a piece of 2x4 or something that's very

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.710 
a piece of 2x4 or something that's very
difficult<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.979> do<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.400> situation<00:01:05.720> there

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
difficult to do in this situation there

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.289 
difficult to do in this situation there
is<00:01:06.930> actually<00:01:07.439> an<00:01:07.979> older<00:01:08.510> water<00:01:09.510> heater<00:01:09.930> strap

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
is actually an older water heater strap

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.440 
is actually an older water heater strap
right<00:01:12.299> here<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.810> top<00:01:14.030> without<00:01:15.030> really<00:01:15.270> is

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
right here on the top without really is

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.289 
right here on the top without really is
it<00:01:15.630> sufficient<00:01:15.900> for<00:01:16.140> today's<00:01:16.560> codes<00:01:17.270> so<00:01:18.270> I

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
it sufficient for today's codes so I

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.749 
it sufficient for today's codes so I
just<00:01:18.509> left<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.900> there<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:20.009> addition

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
just left it there this is addition

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.510 
just left it there this is addition
additional<00:01:21.570> protection<00:01:22.610> this<00:01:23.610> will

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
additional protection this will

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.550 
additional protection this will
definitely<00:01:26.520> write<00:01:26.729> out<00:01:26.939> an<00:01:27.150> 9<00:01:28.049> or<00:01:28.259> 10

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
definitely write out an 9 or 10

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.950 
definitely write out an 9 or 10
