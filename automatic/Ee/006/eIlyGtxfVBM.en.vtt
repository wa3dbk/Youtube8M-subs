to better alignment the SuperDrive multi
is<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.770> more<00:01:58.950> modern<00:01:59.340> Leslie<00:01:59.729> type<00:01:59.969> and

unlike<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:07.030> earlier<00:02:07.060> models<00:02:07.659> it<00:02:07.810> does<00:02:07.990> not

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
unlike the earlier models it does not

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.540 
unlike the earlier models it does not
need<00:02:08.410> an<00:02:08.619> idler<00:02:08.979> pulley

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
need an idler pulley

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.339 
need an idler pulley
but<00:02:09.970> this<00:02:10.119> means<00:02:10.390> I<00:02:10.509> will<00:02:10.539> have<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:10.989> get<00:02:11.140> hold

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
but this means I will have to get hold

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.890 
but this means I will have to get hold
of<00:02:11.500> a<00:02:11.590> couple<00:02:11.739> of<00:02:11.950> belts<00:02:12.190> of<00:02:12.519> the<00:02:13.120> right<00:02:13.300> type

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.660 

so<00:02:16.900> that's<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.290> two<00:02:17.440> motors<00:02:17.860> fitted<00:02:18.220> more<00:02:18.550> or

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
so that's the two motors fitted more or

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.880 
so that's the two motors fitted more or

horn<00:02:21.099> and<00:02:21.310> Driver<00:02:23.069> I'd<00:02:24.069> now<00:02:25.000> like<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.390> mention

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.509 
horn and Driver I'd now like to mention
one<00:02:25.900> or<00:02:26.050> two<00:02:26.170> things<00:02:26.380> about<00:02:26.560> trilling<00:02:27.069> drivers

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
one or two things about trilling drivers

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.160 
one or two things about trilling drivers
over<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.450> years<00:02:28.690> have<00:02:28.840> done<00:02:28.989> much

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
over the years have done much

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.410 
over the years have done much
experimenting<00:02:30.010> with<00:02:30.130> leather<00:02:30.370> speakers<00:02:30.970> and

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
experimenting with leather speakers and

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.289 
experimenting with leather speakers and
from<00:02:32.349> a<00:02:32.440> tonal<00:02:32.830> point<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.220> view<00:02:33.459> I've<00:02:33.970> always

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
from a tonal point of view I've always

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.050 
from a tonal point of view I've always
found<00:02:34.540> with<00:02:34.780> Jenson<00:02:35.319> 321<00:02:36.250> drivers<00:02:36.730> the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
found with Jenson 321 drivers the

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.990 
found with Jenson 321 drivers the
original<00:02:37.510> ones<00:02:37.690> to<00:02:37.930> be<00:02:38.049> the<00:02:38.200> best<00:02:38.380> sounding

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
original ones to be the best sounding

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.039
