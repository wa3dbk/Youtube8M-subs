00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.330
 while aggressive with a spend 

00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:06.010
 mounted in a good mini hammer now 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.130
 dream of my life and drive a 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:11.019
 lamborghini surrounded by more hello how about 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.820
 guys in this video I will teach how 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.950
 you will be able to change the appearance to 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.289
 character the lifestyle if he sleeps 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.510
 more and sleep less although the character 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.830
 take a thousand years created that you already know that 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.869
 in the beginning it will leave us is a trick 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.970
 very very simple although it becomes a 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.010
 little bored when it comes to stop being 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.140
 changing character first thing 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.420
 we will create a new character 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.950
 if we have two characters we will erase the 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.620
 that we do not like if we want to do the 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.120
 trick and we will create a new character yo 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.559
 I had already deleted the 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.420
 character before doing the trick to 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.000
 save me work once we arrived 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.579
 here to the creator we will create another character 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.160
 and we will enter with him he will tell us if 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.660
 we want to repeat the tutorial obviously 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.280
 we are going to say that neither of 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.140
 once we see with the second 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.140
 character what we should do will be 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.790
 change back to the first one once 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.470
 we have already skipped the tutorial and 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.670
 we can manage with the character that 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.650
 we just created that is our 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.420
 secondary character we will give him again 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.570
 the changer and as you can see we will return to 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.580
 select our main character 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.460
 once we are again in the online 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.220
 with our main character as if 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.290
 we were masochians we will change again and 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.600
 we will go back to the character that 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.460
 we just created by doing this it's going to 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.930
 create a bug because the game recognizes 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.880
 that is the first time we go to that 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.860
 character after having created it and 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.380
 gives us the option to modify the 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.840
 aspect, now you will see how 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.890
 when I choose the second character this 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.110
 it's the second time I'm going to that 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.000
 character the first thing created I left my 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.830
 main character and now I'm 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.509
 going back to this when you come back to this you see 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.399
 I get the window if I want 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.340
 modify it because I'm going to disconnect 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.140
 I'm going to go to the story mode once I'm 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.240
 in the story mode I will give you to choose 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.560
 character will force me to connect better 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.450
 hectare on the internet to choose the 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.459
 character and choose the character 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.740
 main and when choosing the character 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:02:00.290
 main I will continue as before 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.180
 will give me the option to change the style 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.560
 of life and appearance and everything that 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.970
 we want to change the main character 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.369
 so nothing guys I hope you 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.399
 update a little bit all the caritas 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.360
 a healthy one beats always help and 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.580
 until next time 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.069

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.610
