00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
alright what's up everyone Duchaine 23

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.730 
alright what's up everyone Duchaine 23
here<00:00:48.060> bringing<00:00:48.330> you<00:00:48.450> my<00:00:48.510> very<00:00:48.900> first<00:00:49.200> halo<00:00:49.500> 4

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:49.740 
here bringing you my very first halo 4

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.990 
here bringing you my very first halo 4
custom<00:00:49.950> map<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.580> is<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> racetrack

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
custom map and this is a racetrack

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.750 
custom map and this is a racetrack
called<00:00:51.570> Star<00:00:51.960> Wars<00:00:52.200> space<00:00:52.560> battle<00:00:53.040> this<00:00:53.460> was

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
called Star Wars space battle this was

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.210 
called Star Wars space battle this was
inspired<00:00:54.060> by<00:00:54.600> my<00:00:54.630> you<00:00:55.350> know<00:00:55.470> track<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.010> reach

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
inspired by my you know track and reach

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.340 
inspired by my you know track and reach
so<00:00:57.210> that's<00:00:57.360> why<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.540> decided<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.990> just<00:00:58.110> call<00:00:58.320> it

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
so that's why I decided to just call it

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.530 
so that's why I decided to just call it
the<00:00:58.470> same<00:00:58.710> thing<00:00:58.740> and<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.790> jump<00:01:00.060> right<00:01:00.270> here

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
the same thing and this jump right here

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.900 
the same thing and this jump right here
in<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> jump<00:01:01.020> above<00:01:01.380> it<00:01:01.620> works<00:01:02.550> probably

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
in the jump above it works probably

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.240 
in the jump above it works probably
about<00:01:03.330> 90%<00:01:04.020> of<00:01:04.050> the<00:01:04.140> time<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.410> worked<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.220> for

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
about 90% of the time I worked on it for

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.070 
about 90% of the time I worked on it for
hours<00:01:05.729> upon<00:01:05.880> hours<00:01:06.060> upon<00:01:06.330> hours<00:01:06.540> trying<00:01:07.020> to

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
hours upon hours upon hours trying to

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.690 
hours upon hours upon hours trying to
get<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.410> work<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.920> know<00:01:08.040> as<00:01:08.220> best<00:01:08.460> as

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
get it to work you know as best as

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.170 
get it to work you know as best as
possible<00:01:09.320> but<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.770> works<00:01:10.979> about<00:01:11.190> 90%<00:01:11.910> of<00:01:11.970> time

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
possible but it works about 90% of time

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.000 
possible but it works about 90% of time
every<00:01:12.450> once<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.810> while<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.960> won't<00:01:13.229> now<00:01:13.740> right

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
every once in a while I won't now right

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.730 
every once in a while I won't now right
here<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.550> this<00:01:14.760> little<00:01:15.200> gravity<00:01:16.200> lift<00:01:16.440> part

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
here on this little gravity lift part

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.130 
here on this little gravity lift part
where<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.340> know<00:01:17.369> score<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.970> hill<00:01:18.240> you

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
where you you know score in the hill you

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.530 
where you you know score in the hill you
can<00:01:19.470> go<00:01:19.680> on<00:01:19.800> the<00:01:19.890> far<00:01:20.070> right<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.369> right<00:01:21.150> you

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
can go on the far right of right you

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.120 
can go on the far right of right you
know<00:01:21.660> before<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.110> go<00:01:22.380> flying<00:01:22.710> through<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
know before you go flying through the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.830 
know before you go flying through the
air<00:01:23.160> you<00:01:23.700> can't<00:01:23.940> go<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.270> right<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.690> there

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
air you can't go on the right and there

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.830 
air you can't go on the right and there
is<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.960> barrel<00:01:25.320> roll<00:01:25.440> section<00:01:26.119> but<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> lot

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
is a barrel roll section but it is a lot

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.930 
is a barrel roll section but it is a lot
like<00:01:28.650> it's<00:01:28.830> really<00:01:29.009> difficult<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.580> be<00:01:29.670> able<00:01:29.820> to

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
like it's really difficult to be able to

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.760 
like it's really difficult to be able to
make<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.330> barrel<00:01:30.630> roll<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.410> that's<00:01:31.590> why<00:01:31.710> you

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
make the barrel roll so that's why you

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.620 
make the barrel roll so that's why you
can<00:01:31.979> also<00:01:32.130> stay<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.550> the<00:01:32.729> left<00:01:32.759> how<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.119> did

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
can also stay to the left how I did

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.570 
can also stay to the left how I did
where<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.110> won't<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.590> know<00:01:34.710> hit<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.100> barrel

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
where you won't you know hit that barrel

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.190 
where you won't you know hit that barrel
and<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.150> know<00:01:36.270> you'll<00:01:36.450> make<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.810> perfectly

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
and you know you'll make it perfectly

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.900 
and you know you'll make it perfectly
fine<00:01:37.500> but<00:01:37.740> pretty<00:01:38.009> much<00:01:38.070> every<00:01:38.430> single<00:01:38.700> time

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
fine but pretty much every single time

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.660 
fine but pretty much every single time
and<00:01:39.660> now<00:01:39.900> all<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.290> jumps<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.950> work<00:01:41.220> like<00:01:41.520> at

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
and now all the jumps in it work like at

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.340 
and now all the jumps in it work like at
least<00:01:41.820> all<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.119> small<00:01:42.390> jumps<00:01:42.690> work<00:01:42.899> at<00:01:43.020> 100%

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
least all the small jumps work at 100%

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.749 
least all the small jumps work at 100%
at<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.649> time<00:01:43.830> as<00:01:44.009> long<00:01:44.190> as<00:01:44.250> you're<00:01:44.490> going<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
at a time as long as you're going the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.609 
at a time as long as you're going the
full<00:01:44.910> speed<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.390> right<00:01:45.960> here<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.290> there<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.530> a

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
full speed and right here is there is a

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.350 
full speed and right here is there is a
split<00:01:46.979> section<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.670> either<00:01:47.910> go<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
split section you can either go to the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.210 
split section you can either go to the
right<00:01:48.390> or<00:01:49.260> you<00:01:49.290> could<00:01:49.500> go<00:01:49.620> to<00:01:49.650> the<00:01:49.830> left<00:01:50.010> how<00:01:50.190> I

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
right or you could go to the left how I

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.930 
right or you could go to the left how I
did<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.670> left<00:01:50.940> is<00:01:51.120> a<00:01:51.180> little<00:01:51.690> bit<00:01:51.900> faster<00:01:52.940> but

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
did the left is a little bit faster but

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.430 
did the left is a little bit faster but
of<00:01:54.060> course<00:01:54.330> it's<00:01:54.510> a<00:01:54.600> little<00:01:54.750> bit<00:01:54.960> more

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
of course it's a little bit more

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.080 
of course it's a little bit more
difficult<00:01:55.950> as<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.280> can<00:01:56.430> see<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.060> a

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
difficult as you can see this is a

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.090 
difficult as you can see this is a
complete<00:01:57.750> single<00:01:58.170> wide<00:01:58.320> right<00:01:58.530> there<00:01:58.770> and

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
complete single wide right there and

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.590 
complete single wide right there and
it's<00:01:59.400> a<00:01:59.490> little<00:01:59.640> bit<00:01:59.820> more<00:01:59.940> difficult<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.420> get

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
it's a little bit more difficult to get

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.520 
it's a little bit more difficult to get
into

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
into

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.910 
into
and<00:02:02.210> then<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.420> know<00:02:03.570> some<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.440> Star<00:02:04.890> Wars

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
and then you know some of the Star Wars

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.370 
and then you know some of the Star Wars
vehicles<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.760> I<00:02:05.850> have<00:02:06.120> on<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.450> map<00:02:06.720> are<00:02:07.049> you

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
vehicles that I have on this map are you

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.750 
vehicles that I have on this map are you
know<00:02:07.500> I'm<00:02:07.620> about<00:02:07.830> to<00:02:07.890> pass<00:02:08.160> under<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.519> tie

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
know I'm about to pass under a tie

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.270 
know I'm about to pass under a tie
bomber<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.239> drops<00:02:09.720> little<00:02:10.229> fusion<00:02:10.830> coils

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
bomber that drops little fusion coils

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.640 
bomber that drops little fusion coils
little<00:02:11.580> bombs<00:02:11.820> and<00:02:12.269> stuff<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.380> got<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.560> be

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
little bombs and stuff so you got to be

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.320 
little bombs and stuff so you got to be
