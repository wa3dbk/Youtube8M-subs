one of the benefits of owning a
predatory<00:00:03.840> fish<00:00:04.170> that<00:00:04.380> can<00:00:04.560> eat<00:00:04.770> a<00:00:04.950> larger

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
predatory fish that can eat a larger

predatory fish that can eat a larger
food<00:00:05.609> items<00:00:06.029> is<00:00:06.890> there<00:00:07.890> are<00:00:07.980> so<00:00:08.099> many

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
food items is there are so many

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.430 
food items is there are so many
different<00:00:08.639> ways<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:09.210> get<00:00:09.300> extra<00:00:09.719> vitamins<00:00:10.230> and

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
different ways to get extra vitamins and

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.079 
different ways to get extra vitamins and
nutrients<00:00:10.830> in<00:00:11.070> them<00:00:11.840> my<00:00:12.840> favorite<00:00:13.410> is<00:00:14.089> using

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
nutrients in them my favorite is using

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:15.890 
nutrients in them my favorite is using
silversides

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
silversides

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.240 
silversides
like<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.440> little<00:00:16.770> capsule<00:00:20.060> so<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.090> want<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.570> stuff

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
like a little capsule so I want to stuff

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.060 
like a little capsule so I want to stuff
extra<00:00:23.250> vitamins<00:00:23.730> into<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.090> cavity<00:00:24.619> do<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
extra vitamins into the cavity do so the

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.730 
extra vitamins into the cavity do so the
easiest<00:00:26.400> way<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.970> remove<00:00:27.930> what's<00:00:28.439> already

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
easiest way is to remove what's already

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:37.160 
easiest way is to remove what's already
in<00:00:29.099> there<00:00:31.189> you<00:00:34.700> know<00:00:35.700> what<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.540> like<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.050> use

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
in there you know what I like to use

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.780 
in there you know what I like to use
most<00:00:38.809> beta-glucan<00:00:40.010> lots<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.190> studies<00:00:41.579> online

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
most beta-glucan lots of studies online

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.779 
most beta-glucan lots of studies online
about<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.480> benefits<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.200> using<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.789> in

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
about the benefits of using this in

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.100 
about the benefits of using this in
relation<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.450> fish<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.550> also<00:00:47.550> use<00:00:48.090> formula<00:00:48.930> one

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
relation to fish I also use formula one

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.959 
relation to fish I also use formula one
marine<00:00:49.379> pellets<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.579> kind<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.910> keeps

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
marine pellets and that kind of keeps

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.360 
marine pellets and that kind of keeps
the<00:00:51.270> beta<00:00:51.510> glucan<00:00:52.110> within<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.920> cavity<00:00:53.340> so

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
the beta glucan within the cavity so

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.569 
the beta glucan within the cavity so
that<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.879> doesn't<00:00:54.270> fall<00:00:54.480> out<00:00:55.309> when<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.399> put

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
that it doesn't fall out when you put

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.400 
that it doesn't fall out when you put
the<00:00:56.699> fish<00:00:56.879> into<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.210> water<00:00:58.730> so<00:00:59.730> first<00:01:00.410> these

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
the fish into the water so first these

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.590 
the fish into the water so first these
are<00:01:01.620> little<00:01:01.800> those<00:01:02.550> little<00:01:02.609> spoons<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.270> come

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
are little those little spoons that come

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.039 
are little those little spoons that come
out<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.960> tetra<00:01:05.210> nitrate<00:01:06.210> test<00:01:06.479> kits<00:01:06.840> I've

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
out of the tetra nitrate test kits I've

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.899 
out of the tetra nitrate test kits I've
saved<00:01:07.439> them<00:01:07.650> over<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.040> air<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.430> have<00:01:08.640> quite

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
saved them over the air so I have quite

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.870 
saved them over the air so I have quite
a<00:01:09.030> few<00:01:09.770> so<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.830> kind<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.220> just<00:01:11.400> stuff<00:01:11.729> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
a few so you kind of just stuff the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.249 
a few so you kind of just stuff the
cavity<00:01:12.890> it's<00:01:13.890> some<00:01:14.040> Vedic<00:01:14.280> again<00:01:14.840> it's<00:01:15.840> really

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
cavity it's some Vedic again it's really

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.130 
cavity it's some Vedic again it's really
hard<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:17.100> overdose<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:17.880> stuff<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:18.900> really

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
hard to overdose this stuff so it really

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.800 
hard to overdose this stuff so it really
isn't<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.500> significant<00:01:20.130> worry<00:01:20.509> because<00:01:21.509> there

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
isn't a significant worry because there

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.520 
isn't a significant worry because there
is<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> lot<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.500> fillers<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.600> pure<00:01:24.600> stuff<00:01:25.020> on

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
is a lot of fillers the pure stuff on

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.630 
is a lot of fillers the pure stuff on
the<00:01:25.650> other<00:01:25.770> hand<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.159> have<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.369> be<00:01:26.490> more

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
the other hand you have to be more

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.660 
the other hand you have to be more
careful<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.180> but<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.570> stuff<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.670> godly

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
careful of but this stuff is godly

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.740 
careful of but this stuff is godly
expensive<00:01:31.700> so<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.729> won't<00:01:33.030> find<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.420> on<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
expensive so you won't find that on the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.060 
expensive so you won't find that on the
shelves<00:01:34.079> that's<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.790> special<00:01:35.790> purchase

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
into the cab a to hold a beta glucan and

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.340 
into the cab a to hold a beta glucan and
if<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.260> tastes<00:01:46.620> bad<00:01:46.800> which<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.640> don't<00:01:47.850> know<00:01:48.350> the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.360 
fish don't really even come in contact
with<00:01:51.660> the<00:01:51.780> beta<00:01:51.930> glucan<00:01:52.290> themselves<00:01:52.770> they

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
with the beta glucan themselves they

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.250 
with the beta glucan themselves they
just<00:01:53.580> get<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.820> silver<00:01:54.090> sides<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.540> these
