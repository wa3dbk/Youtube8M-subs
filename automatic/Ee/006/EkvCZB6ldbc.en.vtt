 internet is not just for browsing, see 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.630
 the state of social networks or see 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.570
 youtube videos thanks to your 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.640
 structure everything is connected and when 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.180
 we say everything we talk about practically 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.160
 all devices and places by 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.260
 so much to think of a world in which the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.750
 data transport is completely 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.779
 through the network and not through supports 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.320
 physical as disks cds dvds or 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.030
 usb memories is possible is more who 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.550
 they usually use their files in 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.370
 different places are already making use 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.149
 of the so-called cloud to the detriment of 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.430
 pendrive or physical discs currently 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.129
 services in the cloud or discs 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.890
 online storage can be counted to 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.680
 tens one of the most famous is 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.989
 dropbox but both apple and google or 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.510
 Microsoft want them to be their own 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.040
 platforms in the cloud those that reign in 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.120
 your systems 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.860
 the oldest of them is skydrive 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.440
 Microsoft launched it years ago but not 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.540
 had the expected success however with 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.460
 the presentation of windows 8 and in a 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.130
 moment in which apple has integrated there 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.440
 cloud in your systems to microsoft you will 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.440
 has happened to make sky drive be 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.200
 part of the new windows 8 and we os 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.070
 we have today how it works and what we can 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.070
 do with him 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.110
 skydrive is accessible from the browser 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.780
 from the metro app for windows 8 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.790
 that Microsoft has prepared from the 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.800
 file browser like folder 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.410
 storage and also from 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.979
 specific applications for windows 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.960
 phone years and android to get all 7 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.810
 gigas of free space offered 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.540
 skydrive nothing to do except 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.700
 have a hotmail account since the 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.940
 service is linked to the suite and windows 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.390
 live can also hire space 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.220
 extra although clear it is for payment but what 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.280
 that we are interested in sharing with you 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.970
 are the possibilities of skydrive in 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.980
 windows 8 since as we said microsoft 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.170
 has created an application with style 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.940
 meter that integrates the disk in the cloud and 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.940
 with the operating system 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.270
 in the metro interface there is an icon or 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.000
 direct access to skydrive from the 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.340
 we can access the folder system and 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.860
 platform files or what is it 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.170
 same view edit or create folders 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.300
 download locally files that 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.760
 we have uploads or also upload 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.580
 directly in new files in 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.830
 skydrive we can store all kinds of 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.800
 files from music to videos 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.680
 going through photos office documents or 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.570
 even several files let's say it's 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.510
 a disc without limitations because 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:03.320
 skydrive allows us to upload files from 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.570
 a size of up to 2 gigs but if you 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.540
 what we want is to use skydrive as 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.700
 one more unit in windows 8 then it's 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.400
 very useful to retake the aesthetics of windows 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.040
 traditional and manage files at the 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.560
 of explorer for it we go to 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.380
 classic desk we look for the folder 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.180
 skydrive in favorite area and we can 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.470
 see each folder every file that 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.420
 we have in the cloud 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.230
 just like any other file to 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.420
 local level 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.280
 said this if we want to copy a 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.560
 document or photo to the folder 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.360
 skydrive just have to act in the 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.450
 same way as when we move or 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.019
 we copy files between local folders 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.549
 that is, dragging and dropping or 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.330
 simply using the commands 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.330
 copy and paste 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.780
 also thanks to the variety of 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.000
 Microsoft's existing platforms also 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.400
 have created skydrive applications for 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.950
 ios and android what allows us 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.290
 manage or view the files in addition to 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.879
 able to upload the photos or videos that 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.879
 we have done with the device 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.910
 we have already seen what skydrive is used 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.430
 as an online storage disk 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.079
 but what Microsoft wants in 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.239
 windows 8 is that the applications 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.639
 allow to save or upload files 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:27.150
 housed in the form platform 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:29.669
 native or fit 10 is the first one they bring 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.260
 said integration but currently if 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.810
 We use any application in 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.389
 windows 8 we can choose the folder 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.570
 skydrive to open an asia file 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:41.610
 photo video or document work with him and 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.790
 re-save it in skydrive to 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.590
 ending this implies that we can 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.260
 work with our files in 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.570
 any place or equipment without need 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.150
 to wear it at all times 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.169
 remember that skydrive is a disk in 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.689
 Cloud 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.969
 as we see skydrive is a tool 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:03.879
 very useful to access our 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:06.460
 files and personal documents from 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:08.319
 any computer with internet but 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.479
 also if we do it from a PC or 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:12.610
 tablet with windows 8 accessing with 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.590
 our and from windows live 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.469
 all services associated with said 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.659
 account whether hotmail skydrive between 

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:21.610
 others will be instantly 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:24.669
 accessible in native applications 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.189
 of the system what is certainly a way 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:30.779
 to streamline and facilitate even more 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:30.779
 management of files in the cloud
