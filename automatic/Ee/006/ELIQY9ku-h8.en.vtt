00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
everything will work out just dandy if

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.460 
change something like the United States
of<00:02:53.940> America<00:02:54.300> like<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.750> it's<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.200> scary

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
of America like that it's a scary

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.940 
of America like that it's a scary
prospect<00:02:56.120> under<00:02:57.120> any<00:02:57.570> circumstance<00:02:58.230> however

is<00:02:59.520> there<00:03:00.390> possibly<00:03:01.140> some<00:03:01.950> conceivable

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
is there possibly some conceivable

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.260 
is there possibly some conceivable
scenario<00:03:03.180> where<00:03:04.700> rational<00:03:05.700> people<00:03:05.850> can

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
scenario where rational people can

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.120 
scenario where rational people can
support<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.780> idea<00:03:07.170> of<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.440> United<00:03:07.860> States<00:03:07.890> of

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
support the idea of the United States of

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.210 
support the idea of the United States of
America<00:03:08.520> breaking<00:03:08.820> up<00:03:08.940> I<00:03:09.090> say<00:03:09.330> absolutely<00:03:10.220> to

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
America breaking up I say absolutely to

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.310 
America breaking up I say absolutely to
shut<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.790> door<00:03:12.030> on<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.360> completely<00:03:12.960> for<00:03:13.170> all

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
shut the door on it completely for all

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.780 
shut the door on it completely for all
circumstances<00:03:14.010> when<00:03:14.280> we<00:03:14.370> don't<00:03:14.520> know<00:03:14.670> what

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
circumstances when we don't know what

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.310 
circumstances when we don't know what
possible<00:03:15.150> circumstances<00:03:15.780> can<00:03:15.930> happen<00:03:16.230> down

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
possible circumstances can happen down

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.690 
possible circumstances can happen down
the<00:03:16.470> road<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.830> me<00:03:16.950> that's<00:03:17.130> just<00:03:17.220> silly

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
the road to me that's just silly

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.470 
the road to me that's just silly
that's<00:03:18.150> just<00:03:18.360> dogmatism<00:03:18.960> so<00:03:20.240> to<00:03:21.240> give<00:03:21.390> an

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
that's just dogmatism so to give an

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.380 
that's just dogmatism so to give an
example<00:03:21.750> here<00:03:22.050> if<00:03:22.230> you<00:03:22.380> do<00:03:22.730> break<00:03:23.730> up<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:24.060> US

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
example here if you do break up the US

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.540 
example here if you do break up the US
and<00:03:24.600> you<00:03:24.660> do<00:03:24.840> it<00:03:24.990> right<00:03:25.250> maybe<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.400> would<00:03:26.520> make

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
and you do it right maybe it would make

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.600 
and you do it right maybe it would make
sense<00:03:26.940> so<00:03:27.240> for<00:03:27.390> example<00:03:28.220> you<00:03:29.220> could<00:03:29.430> break<00:03:29.580> it

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
sense so for example you could break it

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.880 
sense so for example you could break it
up<00:03:29.790> into<00:03:29.940> six<00:03:30.360> regions<00:03:30.600> because<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.260> US<00:03:31.530> isn't

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
up into six regions because the US isn't

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.390 
up into six regions because the US isn't
really<00:03:32.220> but<00:03:32.850> we're<00:03:33.090> not<00:03:33.240> really<00:03:33.890> in<00:03:34.890> terms<00:03:35.130> of

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
really but we're not really in terms of

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.910 
really but we're not really in terms of
culture<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.680> identity<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:39.920> psychological

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
culture and identity and psychological

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.410 
culture and identity and psychological
and<00:03:41.070> sociological<00:03:41.400> structure<00:03:42.150> we're<00:03:42.300> not

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
and sociological structure we're not

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.720 
and sociological structure we're not
really<00:03:42.840> one<00:03:43.170> country<00:03:43.650> we're<00:03:44.280> really<00:03:44.490> about

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
really one country we're really about

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.820 
really one country we're really about
six<00:03:45.270> different<00:03:45.480> countries<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:46.230> Northeast<00:03:46.650> is

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
six different countries the Northeast is

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.030 
six different countries the Northeast is
kind<00:03:47.070> of<00:03:47.160> its<00:03:47.280> own<00:03:47.400> thing<00:03:47.460> the<00:03:48.000> south<00:03:48.210> is

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
kind of its own thing the south is

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.040 
kind of its own thing the south is
obviously<00:03:50.040> its<00:03:50.190> own<00:03:50.340> thing<00:03:50.640> Texas<00:03:51.480> is<00:03:51.630> clearly

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
obviously its own thing Texas is clearly

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.170 
obviously its own thing Texas is clearly
its<00:03:52.380> own<00:03:52.530> thing<00:03:52.830> and<00:03:53.070> then<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:53.790> have<00:03:53.820> the

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
its own thing and then you have the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.730 
its own thing and then you have the
Midwest<00:03:54.600> is<00:03:54.780> its<00:03:54.930> own<00:03:55.110> thing<00:03:55.350> in<00:03:55.500> California

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
Midwest is its own thing in California

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.380 
Midwest is its own thing in California
is<00:03:56.310> its<00:03:56.460> own<00:03:56.610> thing<00:03:56.640> are<00:03:56.940> actually<00:03:57.210> two

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
is its own thing are actually two

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.910 
is its own thing are actually two
separate<00:03:57.720> things<00:03:57.930> because<00:03:58.200> northern<00:03:58.560> is<00:03:58.740> much

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
separate things because northern is much

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.520 
separate things because northern is much
more<00:03:59.130> conservative<00:03:59.690> than<00:04:00.690> southern<00:04:01.080> so<00:04:01.470> if

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
more conservative than southern so if

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.050 
more conservative than southern so if
you<00:04:01.620> were<00:04:01.710> to<00:04:01.800> break<00:04:01.980> up<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.340> u.s.<00:04:02.580> into<00:04:02.850> six

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
you were to break up the u.s. into six

represented depending on if Democrats or
Republicans<00:05:50.480> win<00:05:51.130> so<00:05:52.130> I'd<00:05:52.820> like<00:05:53.030> to<00:05:53.090> try<00:05:53.330> that

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:53.420 
Republicans win so I'd like to try that

and<00:05:53.900> look<00:05:54.710> at<00:05:54.830> all<00:05:54.950> seriousness<00:05:55.340> if<00:05:55.670> it<00:05:55.910> gets

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
and look at all seriousness if it gets

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.040 
and look at all seriousness if it gets
to<00:05:56.210> the<00:05:56.300> point<00:05:56.480> where<00:05:56.630> that's<00:05:56.840> not<00:05:56.990> possible

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
to the point where that's not possible

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.960 
to the point where that's not possible
for<00:05:57.680> whatever<00:05:57.890> reason<00:05:58.430> I<00:05:58.550> think<00:05:58.760> it<00:05:58.850> is

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
for whatever reason I think it is

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.310 
for whatever reason I think it is
possible<00:05:59.210> but<00:05:59.510> if<00:05:59.600> it<00:05:59.690> ever<00:05:59.780> got<00:05:59.960> to<00:06:00.110> the<00:06:00.200> point

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
possible but if it ever got to the point

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.500 
possible but if it ever got to the point
where<00:06:00.500> that's<00:06:00.650> not<00:06:00.800> possible<00:06:00.860> and<00:06:01.520> Congress

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
where that's not possible and Congress

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.840 
where that's not possible and Congress
for<00:06:02.690> example<00:06:02.920> continually<00:06:03.920> pulls<00:06:04.190> at<00:06:04.370> a<00:06:04.400> nine

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.340 
approval that's insane single digits

single<00:06:13.340> digits<00:06:13.700> okay<00:06:14.420> if<00:06:14.630> that's<00:06:14.900> the<00:06:15.110> case

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
single digits okay if that's the case

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.020 
single digits okay if that's the case
and<00:06:15.620> that<00:06:15.770> continues<00:06:16.220> for<00:06:16.430> a<00:06:16.460> decade<00:06:16.850> two
