00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.569
 already the dimensions of both products 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.819
 are absolutely identical 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.620
 rezaÃ¯ network hd except we went 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:11.929
 a 4.3-inch screen at four 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.590
 concepts we were just drawn and on the 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.970
 screen is drawn the screen made sure 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.130
 that they to small that is optimized by 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.820
 compared to the dimensions of the product and 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.260
 had we got we got after the raid and 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.890
 technology is always great 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.449
 amoled is vast we have 75 % more of 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.740
 pixels we had on heather in half 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.800
 races at this month when you look 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:37.730
 the two screens is enough it's enough 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.620
 bluffing and technology gorilla glass 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.469
 gorilla glass is less resistant to 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.570
 scratches to shocks and resistance and 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.489
 to maximize by the screen is also talk 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.620
 kevlar so luc hebert that allows 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.480
 to have a mobile more resistant and 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.739
 lighter also the only 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.840
 difference with the raider 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.760
 is that the kevlar the kid's motive 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.289
 art is different and on a pattern 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.059
 removed and we also made a product that 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.690
 is much more 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.190
 harmonious 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.010
 we have more uneven than we had on 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.990
 heather there the goal on thunderstorms and 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.960
 it was not about creating a fine product 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.250
 it was to create a product design but 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.020
 as good from a point of view 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.930
 battery we have a big battery on 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.950
 will see afterwards that's why the 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.119
 product I pay as crazy as the 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.280
 lands heather one is still on some 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.650
 very good performances since we are at 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.290

 Operators do we realize 4g truth 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.390
 because operator networks do not

 quick settings this little budget here and 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.190
 we also created a tutorial that 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.210
 is called month guide 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.500
 today 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.750
 that you find the time directly 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.910
 in the menu that actually goes to guide the

 customer so to customers who discovers a 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.849
 smartphone 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.099
 we will explain how it works 2 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:34.720
 how to answer a call to how 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:37.050
 create a world of applications him 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.330
 explain the wifi the gps 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.069
 we will take an example showed me 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.870
 how to ignore a phone call in 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:45.870
 train so here we will simulate a call 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.819
 since the swipe your finger by my 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:54.160
 life you learned to ignore a call

 crazy auction made well back home 

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:14.169
 recent applications and volume key 

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:15.279
 and you have full full of clapboard 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.649
 of course we can explain eye and 

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:18.849
 objectives and the 6 2 as the 

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:21.219
 said to guide the first 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:23.639
 smartphone users and 

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:25.539
 engage a woolen sweater from the liberators 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.339
 I mentioned earlier that 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.089
 motorola added on the interface 

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:30.099
 user 

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:32.559
 so the widgets the quick settings 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:36.059
 and the tutorial there is also a 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:38.529
 application called smart actions' 

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:41.499
 this is actually marc theisen it's 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:43.149
 simple it follows you daily on 

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:43.509
 allow you to automate all your 

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:47.799
 stock 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:50.199
 so you go I show you a 

00:05:47.799 --> 00:05:52.029
 example you have triggers that 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:54.519
 will allow you to have 

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:56.859
 trigger actions so localization 

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:59.559
 you say that you live at 10 street 

00:05:56.859 --> 00:06:00.699
 miollis in the 15th from the moment 

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:02.769
 where I am at 10 rue miollis so 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:04.389
 fifteenth this is what will happen my 

00:06:02.769 --> 00:06:06.639
 wifi will be activated because I am 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:10.959
 connect to my box masonry with on 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:12.939
 off tac tac you do when I'm at home 

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:15.129
 me you can put any

 from 20 hours 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:22.479
 me what will happen when it is useful 

00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:25.239
 as from midnight here is a midnight 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:27.050
 I sleep so data of energy savings 

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:29.369
 thoroughly and 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:34.409
 the time and level of the battery 

00:06:29.369 --> 00:06:37.379
 so if you have 10 % battery here 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:39.929
 accept them and a last point that 

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:42.419
 we are worth the idiots and we support ice 

00:06:39.929 --> 00:06:43.349
 cream the update and this crime it's 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:46.830

 actions according to your activities 

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:52.889

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:54.179
 agenda it will see that there you are at 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:56.610
 meetings you have an appointment at 

00:06:54.179 --> 00:06:58.589
 the doctor here and want to discover 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.909

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:07.830
 later and that's the prime objective of this 

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:09.569
 morning it was created to always win 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.279
 in battery is really the concern of 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:12.899
 motorola currently is to have a 

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:14.669
 lead acid battery possible 

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:15.539
 why are we maximizing and 4 the capacity 

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:17.339
 batteries could make a rule 

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:19.069
 home is going to pack up and your 

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:24.629

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:28.939
 added a location of the manual 

00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:28.939
 positions I do not worry 

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:34.560
 I finished so here is when I'm at 

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:37.120
