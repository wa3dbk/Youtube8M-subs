00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.319
 the great satisfaction that this 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.660
 program is that you know a 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.820
 a lot of people that maybe never 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.370
 they would have crossed in a corner or 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.400
 they would have heard someone sing or play 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.800
 instrument then some poem that 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.330
 write I give you that opportunity because 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.880
 that's how they pass me and they just finished 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.009
 present Argentine musicians 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.169
 that's how the two young people that I 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:32.540
 love being with them this afternoon 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:35.050
 drums are where in a club 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.240
 Even in Palermo if I did not go to London 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.430
 These are here as they sell it with 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.560
 style at this time because it seems that 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.020
 we are in london do not tell me between 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.030
 them what have this pop rock wave 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.280
 that I love I do not know how I just did it 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.920
 invent good they will come forward that they do not 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.090
 it's the kids, the families, we're saints 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.830
 buses 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:01.900
 it's called the band it's like this is a duo 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.900
 conformed by nicolÃ¡s yampa 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.070
 they are two guys that are 22 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.030
 good as how do you start so bussi 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.790
 what is it like 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.680
 well basically we are like friends who 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.479
 we had not met or brothers 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.030
 that had separated us in our 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.680
 planet we had some dads and then 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:34.200
 we came to this planet we separated 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:36.649
 I understand in this south video in a 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.649
 family 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:48.600
 online and good at that time that 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.330
 we met, I was seeing in 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.650
 london and he in wellington 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.650
 so also in england 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.890
 let's say the band started via mail 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.120
 like we started talking we told each other 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.300
 account we had many interests in 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.130
 common either beyond music 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.380
 we watched the same series movies or 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.300
 little pictures it was like we were holding hands 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:27.560
 and suddenly we realized that in addition 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:27.560
 to be the same music sensitivity 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.870
 alternative 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.950
 only he plays the guitar and 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.150
 drums 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.700
 everything we sing and do our 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.710
 bread version of all times 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.900
 although let's say in the studio suddenly 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.940
 you can hear an accordion a flute 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.360
 or a piano played with us if in 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.240
 live we are guitar drums two voices and 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.120
 an energy that good is difficult to translate 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:00.490
 on the disk but I think that what 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.600
 we make a music form both 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.740
 when you were in london that 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.810
 we are doing good I went to see 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.030
 contact with that culture of not so many 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.520
 years is also so much music history 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.410
 and of life and you had that opportunity that 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.560
 some decided between the ones you looked for 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.320
 I was a year I was living many things 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.180
 cute ugly all but I think binner 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.610
 you served much of what I am today 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.490
 outside this is to that lived experience 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.330
 perfect and yours new zealand like and 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.330
 also the same 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.459
 we want to play here of life 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.349
 and they had studied in schools 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.980
 traditional Argentine with eggs and 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:46.920
 take neighborhoods where 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:50.090
 northern area san fernando and so also 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.170
 neighbors as graphics 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.450
 perfectly and the theme of the music what 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.459
 vibrate from small is something that both 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.859
 they feel artists and musicians of guys 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.439
 and good for example that you program the 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:03.329
 purchase of the onces after having 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.560
 taken communion with the silver of the 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:08.370
 communion I went I bought myself a guitar 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.609
 electric without knowing how to play the guitar myself 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.609
 I wanted her 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.680
 is 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.100
 Y 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.729
 soldati 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.610
 it sings 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.470
 well it is said that with neither water nor 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.860
 air and it's done without Chinese we take everything 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:42.370
 the water but we're going to do nothing for the 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:50.230
 life for life life please already 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:51.940
 enjoy life during life that already 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.030
 we are enjoying more music from 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.030
 they 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:27.209
 and for example something
