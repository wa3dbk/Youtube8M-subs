00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 welcome to a new videos of today les 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.100
 I bring the unboxing of the ipod touch of 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.060
 fifth generation good this and potosÃ­ the 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.890
 It really cost me a lot of work 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.480
 get it there were very few in the 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.190
 store that I bought them good now just 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.450
 is distributing all over the world but 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.799
 Well this I bought it in yellow 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.089
 I really wanted it in blue or 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.650
 black I think they are the best colors 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.320
 of this good ipod this is the version of 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.740
 32 GB but there is still a version of 64 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.439
 gb this cost me 4 thousand 799 pesos here in 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.439
 mexico and the 64 gig version I think that 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.939
 it costs 6 thousand 499 good more or less for 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.470
 that they see the size of the box here I have 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.719
 a box of a quarter ipod touch 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.340
 generation as you see is practically 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.440
 equal the box only that this 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.390
 logically it is bigger and towards what 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.250
 long and higher too but 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.050
 it is practically the same cashier model 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.730
 that uses the same thing from a plastic 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.469
 transparent and good now we are going to 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.850
 proceed to open this ipod touch of 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.800
 fifth generation let's see what is it 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.800
 that brings all your box so let's start 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.879
 well the ipod touch is just fine 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.500
 packed in this way simply you 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.180
 remove the plastic that came here and 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.680
 we can lift this stage to take out 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.940
 our device here is my 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.589
 device that when the back 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.059
 it's yellow like I said and well 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.770
 opposite in the case of the 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.509
 colors less in the black and it's going to be 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.890
 white for everyone else and good 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:11.330
 let's put aside the ipod and go 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.409
 to see what else this box brings 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.479
 well here one simply says the 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.430
 classic legend of apple that is designed 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.770
 for apple in california and now we open 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.690
 this and what he throws at us is good this 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.460
 instructional package and those that eat 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.679
 idea by classic good first throws us 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.840
 what I did or what is the guide of 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:28.490
 Quick start in Spanish too and comes 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.080
 in English with here this quick so that 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.119
 see it is practically nothing 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.250
 important this and gives us the guarantee 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.020
 all those things and finally there are the 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.940
 classic that there are apple companies we 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.319
 come two included and here in the box 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.090
 let's see different things first thing 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:43.610
 what is going to get out is this what is the ipod 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.929
 touch loop that is correct with the 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.520
 that we can hang the ipod that what 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:48.170
 Personally I do not like both itself and them 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.759
 I will show and others about this 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.020
 loop good my first impression about 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.429
 of this club is that I thought it was 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.229
 like a plastic the truth that is not 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.179
 like a kind of leather to say it 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.920
 So right away, let's talk more deeply 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.670
 about this later we have the new 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.229
 connector 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.150
 it looks like it 's lighting the connection is 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.770
 much smaller than the connection 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.810
 previous are now seeing an image 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.340
 compared to the other connection the 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.569
 true that it is much much thinner and 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.610
 good is much more useful for us 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.900
 because on both sides we can 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.489
 connect is to say that we do not have to 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.900
 look for what is the right and what is the 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.700
 reverse and finally what comes in the 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.620
 box are the new hearing aids by a 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.910
 the skip woods and good these go post not 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.380
 is the full version that we see in 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.970
 store that already comes with the microphone is 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.769
 just the hearing aids here I'm going to 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.360
 retire so that more or less see them 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.950
 good according to support these hearing aids 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.569
 adjust depending on each ear the 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.280
 true they are good at least they look 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.959
 at first sight better than the previous ones 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.610
 I'll be using them and maybe I'll make them 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.290
 a video if you want and how do you 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.600
 I said it's just the whole cable comes 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.010
 without any type of microphone or control 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.970
 of volume so this is all that 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.100
 comes in the box and well let's 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.690
 proceed to see the ipod toch more closely 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.310
 or that the ipad touch is just fine 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.569
 in this base glass appointment and good 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.880
 has a quique sticker we are going to 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.920
 proceed to remove is removed from below 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.450
 or that is simply a sticker with 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.010
 the icons let's leave here aside 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.590
 and well once we have this already 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.900
 we can remove our device 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.940
 we just press here and good here 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.130
 is the ipod touch out the truth that 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.750
 it feels very very good it feels very 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.520
 light the truth that is super light 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.980
 here I have a fourth ipod touch 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.930
 generation so that more or less they see 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.190
 the size comparison is very very 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.600
 like the design to the truth that is 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.340
 practically the same section of the 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.720
 screen the front camera although it is of 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.910
 higher resolution since it is serious in 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.380
 720 is even smaller to the hole it 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.060
 get to see here something that I liked 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.680
 much is that it feels very light to the 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.240
 true that I am the ipod touch of 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.980
 fourth generation is super lightweight and is 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.690
 it's still lighter it seems that it does not have 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.100
 nothing in the hand a remote control of 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.510
 television maybe but good we're going to 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.710
 see this ipad more closely I'm going to 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.390
 bring a video compared to the 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.650
 fourth-generation ipad touch can 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.000
 leave in the comments the videos that 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.740
 want to see but well let's see a 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.330
 little of the design of this ipod touch like 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.560
 can see is a new screen of 4 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.270
 inches is still retina display 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.770
 but this one has better lighting 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.270
 that the previous one is going to be 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.500
 trying on different videos and here 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.900
 when is the new camera 5 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.940
 megapixels there are 6 that already records in 1080p 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.070
 it's the same as the iphone 4 but 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.000
 has the iphone 5 sensor and that's why 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.070
 is that it records in 1000 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.450
 ap has already flash the ipad touch the 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.310
 previous version did not have flash this 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.320
 little black square that you see here is the wifi 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.180
 according to this antenna will allow us to 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.800
 win much more wifi here simply 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.570
 is the apple apple here tells us 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.610
 ipod and this little ball that is here is for 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.110
 connect the ipad touch lucense what 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.459
 let's connect to make it work 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.730
 this we simply have to 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.440
 press and as you see there came out and 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.180
 we can just connect this 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.970
 here and it goes once it's there I guess 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.590
 that we press it little bit and well there 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.230
 it is assumed that the loop is already left and 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.120
 We can hang our device without 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.160
 no problem with is also that this 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.780
 I would not be using but good according to 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.580
 some experts said that this look 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.440
 integrated and to enter the market 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.850
 of digital cameras with this new ipod 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.410
 since your camera is very good 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.210
 resolution and well let's leave this 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.200
 look a little sideways now and then it's going to 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.820
 do now is that it will light by 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.320
 first time this ipod everything here good 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.090
 let's do all the startup setup 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.830
 that we can do without 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.960
 a computer and good this device 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.390
 you already have the a5 chip which is the same as 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.190
 has the iphone 4 is the iphone 5 has 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.180
 a chip a6 unfortunately not integrated 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.950
 and good at the bottom just 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.960
 in the headphone jack the 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.700
 usb connector the new lighting and the 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.770
 horn that apparently will be of 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.670
 higher quality 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.740
 previous and good here he learned the 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.850
 device we are going to configure what 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.410
 there are here here we go the adjustments 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.610
 we're just going to start 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.780
 use the ipad touch 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.240
 and as you can see here is the main menu 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.800
 here we can already use our ipod 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.600
 Toch to normal as you see there is already a 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.250
 new row of icons usually the 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.540
 previous devices that did not have the 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.850
 4 inch screen 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.590
 they just came with four rows of 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.000
 icons now comes one more and something new 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.230
 that integrated this ipod touch is that 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.610
 has Syria so that's what we're going to 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.600
 do let's try a bit of syria 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.010
 although all other functions 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.690
 logically we will cover them in a 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.040
 specific review what you are going to do 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.420
 now it is that we are going to simply try 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.420
 a little citi hello 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.970
 like this city 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:48.939
 and that's how siri works in the 

00:05:47.109 --> 00:05:50.559
 ipod touch tell me dear ones want to see 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:52.119
 about this pact we will cover 

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:53.769
 several at the end of this video are going to 

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:54.999
 find a menu and during these days 

00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:56.709
 I will be uploading your videos so that 

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:58.509
 see that menu and watch the videos that most 

00:05:56.709 --> 00:05:59.829
 like them I'm going to compare it with the ipod 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:01.419
 touch is going to be camera test and
