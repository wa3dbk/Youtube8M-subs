00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.570
 in this part we will learn how to go 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.010
 joining the reasons here I have these 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.830
 two tips 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:26.200
 ok if I'm going to continue working for 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:30.660
 this side I'm going to do two sides nothing 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:34.530
 more and in this I'm going to join 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.739
 and then it ended up on this side like here 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.500
 I have three events and let's start 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.480
 work in the same way we are going 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.760
 to paste one then we are going to paste the two 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.810
 but it is important that you see how 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.350
 I'm going to do it then 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:54.050
 I already have this half here was where 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:59.860
 join the thread I made a corner in the 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.860
 second corner I have the chain 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.140
 I have to make the chain of 5 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:09.960
 I'm just going to do 2 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:12.360
 I'm going to take my job in this corner 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.350
 and I'm going to 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.350
 slide 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.909
 two chains 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:30.100
 this tip I will continue working on 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.100
 my square that is not finished 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.000
 I'm going to join 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:46.810
 and I work the three high points without 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.810
 finish and close the three together 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.159
 low with the three chains in the arch of 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.159
 the previous round 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.250
 although I finished doing this part 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.810
 now I'm going to make 2 chains 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:13.600
 two 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:17.370
 like the bow that I have of this motive 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.370
 and I'm going to make the point 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.939
 two 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.939
 and I go back to the arch that is not finished 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.070
 there says the opinion 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.880
 again 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.670
 two chains 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.880
 in the next arch 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.840
 two chains 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.940
 to the arch 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.940
 where do I have to start climbing 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:57.730
 to make the group of three high points 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.730
 closed the three of us are going to do this 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:08.349
 2. 3 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.349
 I do the first one, I do the second one 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.550
 In the third 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.930
 and the irons 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.930
 I join with a point below 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:25.650
 to this group of 7 chains now here 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.550
 I have to do 5 chains I'm going to do 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.800
 only 2 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.569
 here I have the union of these three 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.349
 then we are going to 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.349
 slide 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.720
 and complete the two that I'm missing and 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:49.120
 I go back to work again 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.120
 this that I have not finished 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.960
 this union we are going to 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.099
 making groups of three high points 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.400
 I close the three chains 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.910
 two chains 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.500
 to this chain is pink 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.900
 slip 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.949
 2 chains 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.949
 to the white 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.990
 low point two chains 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.750
 to the pink one sliding two chains 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.370
 to the white 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.590
 low point 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:02.870
 three chainlets and the group 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.870
 of three unfinished high points 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.900
 I close 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:18.109
 to the group of seven chains 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:26.110
 now I'm going to join this corner 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.110
 I make the two chains 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:31.790
 in the group of the five that I have 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.480
 here on this point 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.480
 of smooth 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:42.400
 two chains and under again 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:46.470
 to the white 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.470
 to finish doing 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:54.540
 3 I'm missing 2 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:58.070
 3 close low 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.070
 with 3 m 1 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:06.510
 at the beginning of my pink color and here 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.510
 to 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.729
 and this is going to stay this way I already do what 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:16.729
 I lose then 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:20.569
 but so this is the way to do it 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:24.649
 look how nice it will be then 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:27.229
 so let's go joining these these 

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:29.509
 squares then I hope that they have 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:31.689
 liked and this is our tutorial of 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:31.689
 today
