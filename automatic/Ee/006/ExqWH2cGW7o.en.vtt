and that's to me fairly unethical now as
I<00:02:24.650> mentioned<00:02:24.980> they<00:02:25.070> also<00:02:25.190> sell<00:02:25.640> organic<00:02:26.150> food

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
I mentioned they also sell organic food

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.480 
I mentioned they also sell organic food
and<00:02:26.630> tend<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.900> promote<00:02:27.140> organic<00:02:27.680> food<00:02:28.040> over

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
and tend to promote organic food over

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.550 
and tend to promote organic food over
conventionally<00:02:29.450> grown<00:02:29.480> food<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:30.260> especially

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
conventionally grown food and especially

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.340 
conventionally grown food and especially
over<00:02:31.010> GMOs<00:02:31.460> here's<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.000> deal<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.810> definition

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
over GMOs here's the deal the definition

over GMOs here's the deal the definition

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.690 
of organic food is pretty nebulous there
is<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.230> chemistry<00:02:36.620> definition<00:02:37.340> which<00:02:37.490> means

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
is the chemistry definition which means

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.060 
is the chemistry definition which means

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
can get rid of them

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.850 
can get rid of them
with<00:03:34.850> running<00:03:35.239> water<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:35.660> a<00:03:35.750> faucet<00:03:36.260> I<00:03:36.440> know

aside all of that how do you decide

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.750

to farmers and how do you distinguish
which<00:04:25.550> those<00:04:25.790> are<00:04:26.060> to<00:04:26.570> me<00:04:26.720> it's<00:04:27.050> fairly

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
which those are to me it's fairly

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.490 
which those are to me it's fairly
difficult<00:04:27.710> and<00:04:28.660> it<00:04:29.660> doesn't<00:04:30.050> really<00:04:30.200> make<00:04:30.440> a

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
difficult and it doesn't really make a

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.320 
difficult and it doesn't really make a
difference<00:04:30.590> either<00:04:31.010> way<00:04:31.160> because<00:04:31.580> studies

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
difference either way because studies

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.900 
difference either way because studies
have<00:04:32.510> shown<00:04:32.780> that<00:04:33.190> typically<00:04:34.190> modified<00:04:34.550> foods

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
have shown that typically modified foods

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.540 
have shown that typically modified foods
are<00:04:34.970> perfectly<00:04:35.390> safe<00:04:35.600> so<00:04:36.370> doesn't<00:04:37.370> really

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
are perfectly safe so doesn't really

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.290 
are perfectly safe so doesn't really
matter<00:04:37.880> it's<00:04:38.750> also<00:04:39.020> been<00:04:39.380> shown<00:04:39.650> as<00:04:40.010> I<00:04:40.850> pointed

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
matter it's also been shown as I pointed

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.770 
matter it's also been shown as I pointed
out<00:04:41.390> in<00:04:41.450> my<00:04:41.630> other<00:04:41.960> video<00:04:42.230> that<00:04:43.390> organic<00:04:44.390> foods

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
out in my other video that organic foods

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.590 
out in my other video that organic foods
aren't<00:04:45.410> necessarily<00:04:46.370> more<00:04:46.910> nutritious<00:04:47.420> than

opposite I don't buy much but the
opposite<00:04:52.610> my<00:04:53.090> favorite<00:04:53.600> example<00:04:54.050> of<00:04:54.170> this<00:04:54.320> is

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
opposite my favorite example of this is

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.340 
opposite my favorite example of this is
great<00:04:54.860> nuts<00:04:55.130> that<00:04:56.000> to<00:04:56.570> me<00:04:56.720> was<00:04:56.870> really<00:04:57.020> funny

great nuts that to me was really funny

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.540 
great nuts that to me was really funny
how<00:04:57.560> there's<00:04:57.800> less<00:04:58.280> nutritional<00:04:59.090> value<00:04:59.450> for

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
how there's less nutritional value for

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.600 
how there's less nutritional value for
non-gmo<00:05:01.550> certified<00:05:01.900> great<00:05:02.900> nuts<00:05:03.230> then<00:05:03.980> the
