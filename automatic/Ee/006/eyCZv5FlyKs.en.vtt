00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello in this video I'm going to show you the 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.109
 game slot rising for our samsung 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.900
 galaxy is this is a scalextric game 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.550
 that is to say of car races that the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.920
 we're really going to love it because it's very 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.080
 entertaining and addictive the game is 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.180
 quite light weight only 2 megabytes 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.320
 and the download link you are going to have 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.689
 as always down here in the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.970
 description is free and you are 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.519
 in the google play store so we're going 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.539
 to see what its advantages are and we are going to 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.220
 prove it 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.439
 here we have to start as usual 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.540
 we do the configuration in which 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.390
 basically, we can modify the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.000
 music we can configure the controls 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.950
 and others but well we really 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.469
 what interests us is the game so 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.510
 let's give it to a player but also 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.420
 of this we have multiplayer options 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.579
 to connect with bluetooth very 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.860
 important and this game I've tried it 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.949
 I've tried this game mode and 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.239
 it really is great designed and also 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.090
 we have the garage where we can 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.550
 modify the cars we have with the 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.670
 let's run and we can change by 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.670
 example the color we can choose more 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.869
 aspects 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.460
 and basically we can choose the type of 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.350
 car that we want as you see we have 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.509
 between these three we could 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.000
 customize it to our liking but 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.009
 well let's go directly to give a 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.890
 player and here as you can see we went to the 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.170
 screen choose different modes of 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.810
 game as you see we have to start two 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.729
 lanes four lanes grand prix and 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.729
 editor and for the part above we have 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.250
 the difficulty of the game easy medium 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.170
 difficult these two game modes of 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.659
 they only vary in that instead of 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.420
 play two cars because they play four and in 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.970
 grand prix would be game modes 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.549
 much more complicated and that we have 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.069
 to go unlocking little by little but what 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.929
 really interesting is the editor and you 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:56.590
 I'm going to show you because like I said here 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:58.240
 I have not created any circuits and 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.149
 if I go over the options then I can 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.340
 create either two- lane circuits or 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.860
 well four or I can recover the 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.810
 last editor session or get more 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.090
 circuits from furniture 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.530
 that is, download them from the page 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.870
 web and I'll make a sample 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:19.080
 click on this button as you see 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:23.070
 start loading the web page 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.190
 and here we have access to download 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.380
 absolutely all circuits 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.800
 developed by people who are 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.230
 players of this game as you see 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:38.120
 we have a lot of them we are going to 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:41.090
 choose for example this same 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.950
 stigmas as you see charge I made the 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.480
 circuit added to your collection 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.540
 well we go back and as you see 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.549
 I already downloaded it because besides 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.830
 all this could create circuits and 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.360
 send them to the page or delete them 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.099
 Well then let's do a test 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.670
 let's create a circuit of two 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.500
 lanes 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.360
 As you can see we have different options 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.910
 to go placing our our 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.550
 lanes we can go configuring to 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.580
 our taste we can change the view to 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:15.270
 the perspective we have from above 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.690
 as you see or flush the track let's say 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.260
 expand or reduce it 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.420
 and well let's do a little test 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.730
 we changed 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:30.239
 the circuit we can see how to put 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.239
 different types of 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.750
 of clues let's say 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.750
 we can erase them 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:45.890
 we can even put that height 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:50.220
 as you see to surpass the we are going to 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:53.390
 make that example about we passed the track 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.390
 we continue straight 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.430
 we are going to twist 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.250
 we continue like this 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.250
 and once here we are going to give him to lower the 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.350
 level 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.720
 as you see everything quite customizable 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.790
 to create the circuit that we 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.220
 let's want in case we're wrong 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.709
 Well, we simply give you that 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.990
 button 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:28.220
 and we are well placed 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.220
 let's put it like that 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.189
 and we are going to try to close our 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:36.969
 good circuit as you see is 

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:38.810
 practically complicated to do 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:41.060
 practically impossible to do so 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.590
 quickly but good would be basically the 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.800
 option to create our circuits 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.509
 and play to our liking well 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.400
 let's play a circuit of those that 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:50.419
 they come predetermined for example of two 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.370
 lanes 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:56.270
 obviously configuring to our liking 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:58.509
 the difficulty of the lane we will choose 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.509
 for example 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.930
 this circuit and I will show you also 

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:07.240
 the next circuit was blocked 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.449
 well as you see here we are already we have already 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.889
 started the race and we have already started 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:17.439
 As you can see, we can change the first 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:19.960
 different cameras we have this in 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:22.860
 first person is from above 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.830
 totally and let's say more 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:29.680
 balanced we can also configure the 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.839
 let's say profile and here in the part of 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.129
 up we can see the good position 

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:35.860
 As you can see, I lost because it was 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:40.050
 displaying the game mode and now yes 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.050
 let's see it here the position and others 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.819
 and good here as you see result 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.710
 advertising because the game is 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:50.889
 free but good let's try 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:54.460
 win as you see the trick is to stop 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:56.700
 little bit in the curves for not 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.110
 get out 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.730
 but the truth is that it's a bit 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.860
 complicated to be recording and at the same time 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:04.080
 be playing but 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.610
 it is quite addictive this game about 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.620
 all because of the theme that we can go 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.610
 creating our circuits or we can 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:13.110
 make challenges with our friends 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.449
 only through through the 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:19.080
 bluetooth as you see here we can already 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:21.479
 even customize this in the bar 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.689
 acceleration let's say and the goal 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:27.840
 basically it 's accelerating on the straights and 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:31.500
 brake a bit in the curves obviously 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:34.840
 this circuit is quite simple but 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:38.440
 the rest of the circuit gets complicated 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:41.350
 let's see if I win this race in 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.180
 effect the good as you see here is going 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.210
 skipping the time of each race what 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.610
 that took to overcome each race 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.220
 and we can give you the next clue and 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.710
 As you knew, it was blocked because now 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.060
 finally the unlocked and it would be 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.849
 basically, we could go 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:01.750
 unlocking our tracks and playing 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:04.930
 somehow we say as of 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:07.750
 continuously go unlocking the in 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:10.300
 campaign mode let's say or we could play 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:14.560
 free the clues that we want creating 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:15.760
 You are loading the Internet can well 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.770
 how good you see this game is 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.170
 quite complete and quite addictive 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.120
 because the truth is not necessary either 

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:24.970
 have a pretty powerful phone to 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:27.160
 run it and especially that weighs very 

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:29.560
 little bit the game is free and we have 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.000
 a lot of options so I hope 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.400
 that you liked it and if you liked it 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.410
 do not forget to give a like to subscribe 

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.910
 here at the bottom to follow 

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:39.490
 receiving more videos like that 

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:42.250
 about games news tutorials 

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:45.810
 analysis and many other things more and we 

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.810
 we see in another video a greeting
