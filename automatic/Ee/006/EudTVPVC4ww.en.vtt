00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
our high plains prospectors here kind of

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.930 
our high plains prospectors here kind of
an<00:00:08.880> interesting<00:00:09.090> story<00:00:09.450> we<00:00:09.809> we<00:00:10.410> had<00:00:10.530> a

an interesting story we we had a

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.220 
an interesting story we we had a
customer<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.000> ours<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.270> client<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.750> ours<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:13.850> lady

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
customer of ours a client of ours a lady

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.060 
customer of ours a client of ours a lady
prospector<00:00:17.210> named<00:00:18.210> Jeannie<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:19.170> got<00:00:19.770> this

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
prospector named Jeannie that got this

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.210 
prospector named Jeannie that got this
material<00:00:20.670> right<00:00:21.210> here<00:00:21.679> which<00:00:22.679> started<00:00:23.099> as

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
material right here which started as

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.769 
material right here which started as
hard<00:00:23.429> rock<00:00:23.609> material<00:00:24.150> she<00:00:24.330> actually<00:00:24.480> has

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
hard rock material she actually has

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.410 
hard rock material she actually has
crushed<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.199> down<00:00:25.349> to<00:00:26.279> this<00:00:26.400> point<00:00:26.699> there<00:00:27.240> are

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
crushed it down to this point there are

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.679 
crushed it down to this point there are
some<00:00:27.630> really<00:00:27.869> interesting<00:00:28.099> specimens<00:00:29.099> in<00:00:29.279> it

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
some really interesting specimens in it

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.510 
some really interesting specimens in it
you<00:00:30.689> can<00:00:30.839> see<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.080> purple<00:00:31.349> there's<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.279> lot<00:00:32.430> of

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
you can see the purple there's a lot of

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.520 
you can see the purple there's a lot of
copper<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.060> here<00:00:33.240> as<00:00:33.330> we're<00:00:33.570> as<00:00:33.780> well<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.140> lot<00:00:34.410> of

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
copper in here as we're as well a lot of

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.910 
copper in here as we're as well a lot of
silver<00:00:35.840> but<00:00:36.840> apparently<00:00:37.260> there<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.530> some<00:00:37.770> gold

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
silver but apparently there is some gold

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.600 
silver but apparently there is some gold
take<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.460> material<00:00:38.940> down<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.329> classify<00:00:39.809> it

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
take this material down and classify it

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.600 
take this material down and classify it
we<00:00:41.610> have<00:00:41.930> five<00:00:42.930> players<00:00:43.199> here<00:00:43.649> I've<00:00:44.219> got<00:00:44.370> an<00:00:44.460> 8

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
we have five players here I've got an 8

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.150 
we have five players here I've got an 8
pin<00:00:44.899> and<00:00:45.899> then<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.079> think<00:00:46.260> what<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.500> like<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> 40

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
pin and then I think what is like a 40

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.310 
pin and then I think what is like a 40
match<00:00:47.370> maybe<00:00:47.730> we're<00:00:48.660> gonna<00:00:48.750> keep<00:00:48.960> all<00:00:49.140> this

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
match maybe we're gonna keep all this

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.049 
match maybe we're gonna keep all this
material<00:00:49.890> will<00:00:50.100> end<00:00:50.219> up<00:00:50.340> breaking<00:00:50.550> all<00:00:50.879> this

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
material will end up breaking all this

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.660 
material will end up breaking all this
up<00:00:51.329> eventually<00:00:52.100> but<00:00:53.100> for<00:00:53.160> now<00:00:53.399> we're<00:00:53.640> just

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
up eventually but for now we're just

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.889 
up eventually but for now we're just
trying<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.480> out<00:00:55.579> getting<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.640> ready<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.879> pan

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:01.910 

all<00:01:00.899> right<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.230> we're<00:01:01.320> gonna<00:01:01.410> take<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:01.680> heavy

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
all right so we're gonna take this heavy

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.950 
all right so we're gonna take this heavy
stuff<00:01:02.219> we're<00:01:02.820> actually<00:01:02.940> gonna<00:01:03.179> wash<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.719> and

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
stuff we're actually gonna wash this and

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.270 
stuff we're actually gonna wash this and
take<00:01:04.050> a<00:01:04.080> look<00:01:04.170> at<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.769> show<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:04.949> some<00:01:05.250> of

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
take a look at it and show you some of

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.440 
take a look at it and show you some of
the<00:01:05.370> material<00:01:05.790> here<00:01:05.940> in<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.090> second<00:01:08.150> here<00:01:11.240> and<00:01:12.240> I

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
the material here in a second here and I

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.170 
the material here in a second here and I
watch<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.900> pan<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.380> stuff<00:01:13.650> all<00:01:14.040> separately

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.270 

so<00:01:18.180> we'll<00:01:18.930> keep<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.200> together<00:01:19.409> pan<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.100> it's

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
so we'll keep it together pan it it's

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.850 
so we'll keep it together pan it it's
always<00:01:20.549> good<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.759> run<00:01:21.659> your<00:01:21.840> materials<00:01:22.530> of

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
always good to run your materials of

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.460 
always good to run your materials of
similar<00:01:23.579> sizes<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.450> we<00:01:24.990> know<00:01:25.079> that<00:01:25.110> we<00:01:25.320> got

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
similar sizes so we know that we got

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.740 
similar sizes so we know that we got
eight<00:01:25.710> there<00:01:25.950> were<00:01:26.040> less<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.570> think

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
eight there were less here and I think

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.569 
eight there were less here and I think
we<00:01:27.810> got<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> 40<00:01:28.320> mesh<00:01:28.500> below<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.369> we're

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
we got a 40 mesh below it that we're

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.270 
we got a 40 mesh below it that we're
putting<00:01:30.090> into<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.329> bucket<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.900> wolf

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
putting into this bucket the wolf

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.770 
putting into this bucket the wolf
probably<00:01:32.280> pan<00:01:32.490> out<00:01:32.729> or<00:01:32.759> maybe<00:01:35.329> these<00:01:36.329> camel

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
probably pan out or maybe these camel

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.330 
probably pan out or maybe these camel
classifiers<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:37.979> actually<00:01:38.310> I

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
classifiers that you can actually I

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.880 
classifiers that you can actually I
think<00:01:38.460> take<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.939> down<00:01:39.060> all<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.270> way<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.860> to<00:01:40.860> a

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
think take it down all the way to a to a

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.740 
think take it down all the way to a to a
60<00:01:41.310> mesh<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:41.850> we<00:01:41.970> might<00:01:42.149> run<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.450> through<00:01:42.540> those

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
60 mesh so we might run it through those

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.370 
60 mesh so we might run it through those
here<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.229> little<00:01:43.619> bit<00:01:44.659> okay<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:45.689> our<00:01:46.020> end<00:01:46.200> result

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
here a little bit okay so our end result

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.889 
here a little bit okay so our end result
is<00:01:46.829> we<00:01:47.579> have<00:01:47.729> all<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.030> material<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.570> won't

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
is we have all this material that won't

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.190 
is we have all this material that won't
go<00:01:49.170> through<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.469> 40<00:01:49.890> mesh<00:01:52.549> a<00:01:53.549> little<00:01:53.729> bit<00:01:53.820> later

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
go through a 40 mesh a little bit later

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.330 
go through a 40 mesh a little bit later
and<00:01:55.200> then<00:01:55.380> we<00:01:55.500> have<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.649> bunch<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.979> four<00:01:56.189> time

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
and then we have a bunch of four time

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.450 
and then we have a bunch of four time
ash<00:01:56.490> material<00:01:56.640> here<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.540> if<00:01:58.290> we<00:01:58.409> want<00:01:58.770> we<00:01:59.340> can

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
ash material here so if we want we can

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.090 
ash material here so if we want we can
go<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:00.439> classify<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.469> all<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.799> way<00:02:01.890> down<00:02:01.920> a

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
go and classify it all the way down a

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.389 
go and classify it all the way down a
little<00:02:02.280> further<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:03.829> do<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.860> little<00:02:05.009> test

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
little further so do a little test

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.279 
little further so do a little test
panning<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.000> see<00:02:06.299> if<00:02:06.360> we<00:02:06.420> find<00:02:06.630> any<00:02:06.810> gold<00:02:07.049> in

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
panning and see if we find any gold in

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.260 
panning and see if we find any gold in
this<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:08.030> go<00:02:09.030> from<00:02:09.180> there<00:02:09.330> okay<00:02:10.970> so<00:02:11.970> we<00:02:12.120> have

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
this and go from there okay so we have

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.900 
this and go from there okay so we have
our<00:02:12.530> our<00:02:13.530> pan<00:02:14.070> here<00:02:14.370> we're<00:02:14.520> just<00:02:14.550> gonna<00:02:14.700> do<00:02:14.880> a

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
our our pan here we're just gonna do a

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.030 
our our pan here we're just gonna do a

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.849 

I'm<00:02:48.359> gonna<00:02:48.510> see<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:48.810> lot<00:02:49.019> of<00:02:49.049> gold<00:02:49.349> there's

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
I'm gonna see a lot of gold there's

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:56.690 
I'm gonna see a lot of gold there's
maybe<00:02:50.310> some<00:02:50.670> tiny<00:02:51.120> flower<00:02:51.540> pieces<00:02:51.930> there<00:02:55.700> well

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
maybe some tiny flower pieces there well

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.039 
maybe some tiny flower pieces there well
I<00:02:56.730> say<00:02:57.000> we<00:02:57.030> run<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.359> rest<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.689> it<00:02:57.780> through

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
I say we run the rest of it through

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.030 
I say we run the rest of it through
something<00:02:58.859> they<00:02:58.980> could<00:02:59.159> get<00:02:59.340> through<00:02:59.519> it<00:03:01.040> all

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
something they could get through it all

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.530 
something they could get through it all
right<00:03:02.159> we<00:03:02.220> got<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.549> mountain<00:03:02.970> goat<00:03:03.120> trommel

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
right we got the mountain goat trommel

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.649 
right we got the mountain goat trommel
set<00:03:03.780> up<00:03:04.069> we<00:03:05.069> have<00:03:05.220> this<00:03:05.310> material<00:03:05.700> that<00:03:06.480> is

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
set up we have this material that is

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.720 
set up we have this material that is
from<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:07.230> think<00:03:07.709> Idaho<00:03:08.099> Hills<00:03:08.340> or<00:03:08.549> Idaho

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
from I think Idaho Hills or Idaho

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.020 
from I think Idaho Hills or Idaho
mountains<00:03:09.150> area<00:03:10.489> one<00:03:11.489> of<00:03:11.519> our<00:03:11.670> clients

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
mountains area one of our clients

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.690 
mountains area one of our clients
brought<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.359> us<00:03:12.389> she<00:03:12.870> crushed<00:03:13.170> down

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
brought to us she crushed down

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.190 
brought to us she crushed down
I<00:03:14.730> think<00:03:15.299> the<00:03:15.359> crush<00:03:15.569> stuffs<00:03:15.810> in<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:15.959> back<00:03:15.989> of

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
I think the crush stuffs in the back of

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.080 
I think the crush stuffs in the back of
my<00:03:16.290> pickup<00:03:16.470> we've<00:03:17.189> classified<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.760> down<00:03:17.879> into

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
my pickup we've classified it down into

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.460 
my pickup we've classified it down into
I<00:03:18.980> think<00:03:19.980> an<00:03:20.069> eight<00:03:20.310> inch<00:03:21.239> and<00:03:21.810> then<00:03:22.079> down<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.290> a

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
I think an eight inch and then down to a

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.339 
I think an eight inch and then down to a
forty<00:03:22.919> mesh<00:03:23.299> and<00:03:24.299> we're<00:03:24.959> gonna<00:03:25.079> run<00:03:25.230> it

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
forty mesh and we're gonna run it

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:26.750 
forty mesh and we're gonna run it
through<00:03:25.379> the<00:03:25.590> trommel<00:03:25.950> on<00:03:26.010> two<00:03:26.159> separate<00:03:26.519> sets

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
through the trommel on two separate sets

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.240 
through the trommel on two separate sets
and<00:03:27.540> we<00:03:27.750> were<00:03:27.840> gonna<00:03:27.989> give<00:03:28.950> her<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.069> little

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
and we were gonna give her a little

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.830 
and we were gonna give her a little
video<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:29.790> show<00:03:29.970> her<00:03:30.090> if<00:03:30.180> we<00:03:30.299> find<00:03:30.569> something

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
video and show her if we find something

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.289 
video and show her if we find something
hopefully<00:03:31.439> we<00:03:31.560> do<00:03:31.709> we're<00:03:32.400> not<00:03:32.760> using<00:03:33.030> the

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
hopefully we do we're not using the

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.360 
hopefully we do we're not using the
spiral<00:03:33.540> wheel<00:03:33.900> today<00:03:34.169> because<00:03:34.560> it's<00:03:34.769> there's

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
spiral wheel today because it's there's

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.369 
spiral wheel today because it's there's
so<00:03:35.430> little<00:03:35.879> material<00:03:36.299> you<00:03:37.169> know<00:03:37.260> we'd

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
so little material you know we'd

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.059 
so little material you know we'd
probably<00:03:37.530> have<00:03:37.909> 1/5<00:03:38.909> of<00:03:39.000> a<00:03:39.090> bucket<00:03:39.480> or<00:03:39.720> so<00:03:40.200> and

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
probably have 1/5 of a bucket or so and

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.559 
probably have 1/5 of a bucket or so and
so<00:03:41.639> we're<00:03:41.730> gonna<00:03:41.849> run<00:03:42.060> it<00:03:42.150> in<00:03:42.269> there's<00:03:42.510> a

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
so we're gonna run it in there's a

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.960 
so we're gonna run it in there's a
little<00:03:42.750> catch<00:03:42.900> tray<00:03:43.229> that<00:03:43.680> you<00:03:43.859> can<00:03:44.099> put<00:03:44.819> on

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
little catch tray that you can put on

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.640 
little catch tray that you can put on
instead<00:03:45.419> of<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.629> transfer<00:03:46.079> case<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.560> the

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
instead of the transfer case to the

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.619 
instead of the transfer case to the
spiral<00:03:47.069> will<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.549> then<00:03:47.819> we'll<00:03:48.419> take<00:03:48.599> that

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
spiral will and then we'll take that

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:50.809 
spiral will and then we'll take that
concentrated<00:03:49.440> material<00:03:49.530> we<00:03:50.459> should<00:03:50.639> be<00:03:50.729> the

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
concentrated material we should be the

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.259 
concentrated material we should be the
heavies<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:52.310> pan<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.340> out<00:03:53.549> see<00:03:54.000> if<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.090> find

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
heavies and pan it out see if you find

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.580 
heavies and pan it out see if you find
anything

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:11.990 

hooked<00:03:59.590> up<00:04:00.629> battery

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.750 

any<00:04:12.870> cereal

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.780 

she<00:04:16.910> did<00:04:17.060> a<00:04:17.090> really<00:04:17.150> good<00:04:17.450> job<00:04:17.510> brushing

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
she did a really good job brushing

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:42.330 
she did a really good job brushing
you<00:04:20.030> said<00:04:20.360> you<00:04:20.480> didn't

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.619 

we're<00:04:43.340> gonna<00:04:43.520> kind<00:04:43.759> of<00:04:43.789> take<00:04:43.939> our<00:04:44.120> time<00:04:44.300> let<00:04:44.599> it

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:44.629 
we're gonna kind of take our time let it

00:04:44.629 --> 00:05:12.120 
we're gonna kind of take our time let it
rock<00:04:44.930> watch<00:04:45.199> out<00:04:45.469> real<00:04:45.710> good

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.790 

so<00:05:12.730> that<00:05:12.880> was<00:05:13.030> all<00:05:13.240> the<00:05:13.270> fine<00:05:13.660> stuff<00:05:14.020> we'll<00:05:14.620> let

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
so that was all the fine stuff we'll let

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.880 
so that was all the fine stuff we'll let
it<00:05:14.920> wash<00:05:15.130> for<00:05:15.520> a<00:05:15.580> little<00:05:15.820> bit<00:05:16.650> we'll<00:05:17.650> probably

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
it wash for a little bit we'll probably

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.590 
it wash for a little bit we'll probably
take<00:05:18.340> it<00:05:18.520> out<00:05:18.670> and<00:05:18.820> pin<00:05:19.060> it

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
take it out and pin it

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.060 
take it out and pin it
and<00:05:20.600> we'll<00:05:21.260> run<00:05:21.440> this<00:05:21.590> through<00:05:22.090> separately

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
and we'll run this through separately

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.440 
and we'll run this through separately
alright<00:05:25.070> so<00:05:25.220> this<00:05:25.340> is<00:05:25.520> what<00:05:25.550> it<00:05:25.820> got<00:05:26.030> it<00:05:26.210> down

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
alright so this is what it got it down

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:32.110 
alright so this is what it got it down
to<00:05:28.750> just<00:05:29.750> a<00:05:30.490> tablespoon<00:05:31.490> of<00:05:31.550> material<00:05:32.030> and

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
to just a tablespoon of material and

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.030 
to just a tablespoon of material and

was like a fifth of a bucket maybe I
mean<00:06:23.810> down<00:06:24.020> to<00:06:24.050> a<00:06:24.430> tablespoon<00:06:25.430> of

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:32.389 
may be a total running time of maybe 10
