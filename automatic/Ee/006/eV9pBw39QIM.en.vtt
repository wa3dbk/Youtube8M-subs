00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.540
 to all of ddo 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:16.660
 attention for the final tally ten 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:27.640
 nine eight seven six five eighty three 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:31.140
 two a top to the vulcan tribute to 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.140
 the image of the take-off 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.520
 all parameters onboard are normal 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.670
 22 the tipping maneuver 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.950
 perfect takeoff at 49 seconds the 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.600
 launcher at the altitude of almost 7 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.420
 kilometers the dynamic pressure 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.200
 maximum is reached in one minute and 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.560
 nine seconds 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.130
 ariane 5 already exceeds 13 5 km 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.530
 altitude 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.170
 in two minutes the launcher is getting closer 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.960
 50 km altitude and in three minutes 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.580
 he will have lands 100 km and 100 km the 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.200
 symbolic limit the atmosphere since 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.450
 Beyond it is considered that it is empty 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.700
 spatial which then starts the thrust 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.679
 is dazzling 1,300 tons of thrust 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.780
 are propelling Ariane 5 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:37.810
 the two stages powder once lit 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.520
 does not go out everywhere 90% of the 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.690
 power of the launcher they are realized 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.789
 in French Guiana 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.710
 in the factories of regulus and euros 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.450
 propulsion and she is sucked down that 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.130
 is thirty meters tall it consumes 2 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.810
 tons of powder per second 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.700
 the 240 tons are therefore consuming in 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.789
 about two minutes they are identical 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.200
 their take-off mass about 278 he 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.090
 provides an average boost of over 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.649
 600 tons it was for the three 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.720
 adults are born friends this bazaar a 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.550
 space the elders all present them to 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.259
 run today is a thousand times the 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.879
 push or ariane 44 she I would have 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.739
 you do not rejuvenate then for the most 

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:10.239
 young people our comparison the height of the 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.420
 up and is equivalent to that of the little 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.670
 vega launcher is 31 m after exhaustion 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.709
 powder to two minutes near 30 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.410
 seconds after their ignition the eyes ap 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.849
 are separated from the launcher 60 km 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.629
 altitude to fall back into the ocean 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.580
 Atlantic 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.190
 in fact before it is totally 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.290
 empty their thrust will decrease and after 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.390
 detection of this decrease in acceleration 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.680
 the onboard computer decides to get 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.220
 rid of booster thrusters 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.569
 empty mass 38 tons each speed of 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.569
 nearly 2 km second 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.239
 here are the harper eyes are separated for 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.400
 avoid colliding thrusters 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.590
 empty are removed from the body of the launcher 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.390
 thanks to eight rocket delagne mans is 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.830
 so after the greens then take off 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.520
 now that Ariane 5 has moved away 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.200
 Guyanese coast 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.300
 we will focus our attention on 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.069
 the flight curve the ideal curve that is 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.900
 all the top right on our screens is 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.819
 calculated and you see the pointer 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.950
 who are moving that represents the flight 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.050
 real of Ariane there are exactly also 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.019
 indications of altitude and speed in 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.209
 bottom left you know the altitude 92 km 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.930
 and on the right you have the speed of 17 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.930
 km per second 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.140
 the headdress separates will separate into 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.860
 two under the action of two cords 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.319
 pyrotechnic 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.510
 the two halves headdress falls back into the 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.160
 empty as they are very light she 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.810
 beats a little like wings it's this 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.630
 which is called the breathing of the 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:45.780
 headdress 2.4 tons less on the 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:48.330
 launcher look at the pictures here 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.959
 the headdress 17 meters high 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.910
 made in Switzerland by ruag space 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.640
 sandwich structure ten years nor the bei in 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.230
 aluminum and carbon fiber designed for 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.180
 to minimize vibrations it's a 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.420
 extremely lightweight structure for its 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.420
 area
