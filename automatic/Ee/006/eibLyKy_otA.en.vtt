00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:03.820
 now let's talk about male fertility 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:04.890
 at this time 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:05.820
 different 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.370
 the reason for fertility website 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.839
 because one each having a scientist that we will define 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:12.629
 first of all the golgoth do not get lost 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:14.059
 then cause him allowed 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.059
 this launch of an insufficient number of spermatozoa 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:18.999
 normally 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:21.630
 the most hated man about 3 million sperm 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.579
 among the sperm elite 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.589
 and yet we consider that a person would not be fertile if ever 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:30.410
 this number is less than 10 million 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.660
 spermatozoa per milliliter 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.780
 that's why 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.030
 in this case toto spermatozoa there would be no possibility at all 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.710
 and compassion 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.380
 since we've seen worse a lot a lot lose sperm 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.150
 before he arrives 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.600
 then there is room for sperm 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.000
 in this case it's worse all the shots are allowed there to do this 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.320
 in that case 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.620
 why then 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.540
 an increase in production by the testicles 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.150
 in this case if the testicles do not work properly do not 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.490
 not produce 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.790
 sperm of 184 stem cells sertoli cells 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.450
 or 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.850
 well 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.960
 spermatozoa are well produced but can not manage to 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.080
 so read below 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.130
 that is to say that m 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.760
 early may cannon 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.140
 different maybe maybe more 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.330
 and in this case and that's what we saw in the second half is the 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.390
 principle 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.100
 and well I close everything and do not pass you must not lose 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.100
 and therefore the sperm does not contain sperm 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.130
 there is also stenosis allowed 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.300
 in this case it is a defect of motility 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.760
 of mobility on spermatozoa 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.970
 theoretically in this case where their way at least 50% 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.780
 sperm that are kept mobile at least 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.539
 this is the year this rate is less than 50% 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:53.430
 well 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.400
 in the field will be able to move properly later louis bubble they 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.260
 can not vote against 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.710
 we continue now with many other faults that the workshop gratos 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.870
 this permit 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.630
 and the land that ends is not because according to him moves mass 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.279
 because he is poorly trained 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:13.039
 the agreement announced a rate full of german weapons raising sperm 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:16.039
 so you 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.869
 many sperm in a normal case his talent 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:23.829
 however, the minimum percentage of normal spermatozoa infuriates 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:25.679
 which is normal 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:27.389
 at the same time 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:29.939
 between 15 and 50% 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.399
 I rarely arnold 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:35.709
 who has no concern for objectivity course - 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.709
 because at 50% of his sperm 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:43.249
 and 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.239
 spermatozoa from montpellier 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.249
 the end of the license to crack the word of bad ballot 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:54.090
 but as for all 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.989
 - and finally color block in germany 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.260
 obviously if no anomaly it is not fit after how many others 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:02.089
 among them 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:05.540
 the anomalies games and taste it is polite also have a problem this 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.049
 times of functioning and not only of form 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.269
 about old not too much in Ghana it's a substance in session not 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:12.159
 know what 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:13.490
 are substances that are in the water 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.490
 at the end of the head of the spermatozoon 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.100
 this end is called the acrosome 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.100
 he favors and this is the console is able to punch in the back 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.370
 we saw the reasons 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.250
 2 captivity what are the solutions now to this affair 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.689
 title 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.939
 the first of them is called the pipette 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:37.369
 the girl and in vitro fertilization 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:40.709
 and embryo transfer 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.739
 that's how they unfold 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.689
 first of all 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:48.669
 in small car both the text on the right and the immigration 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:52.379
 alcohol drug first illustration small heap 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.679
 we will take oocytes 

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:59.429
 during dessureault submitted graphical cost imitation so let's talk 

00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:02.479
 directly in 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:05.069
 others 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.269
 this is the first step 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:07.449
 second step 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:10.449
 we will be asked for a spouse 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.029
 to provide sperm 

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:15.099
 and to blacken 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:17.370
 the second is above all that of the spouse 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.749
 p site 

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:22.779
 the stock market 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:25.430
 the next step is to mix 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.470
 sperm with logo soon 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.719
 in a test tube 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:33.189
 which is going to encourage the meeting 

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:35.479
 sperm ovum 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:38.199
 fertilization has pleased many small in vitro that is said to 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:39.379
 outdoors 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:42.580
 the body goes into a test tube here 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.580
 and for this this relationship with god 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.490
 there the bridge is constant that the embryo was developing 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:52.419
 this embryo for displeasing them 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.199
 and reintegrating him 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:57.310
 inside the uterus when one can find a stadium of three 

00:04:57.309 --> 00:04:58.300
 people 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.550
 when is it necessary to fertilize 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.050
 and 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.550
 there are no other worries so yes we will be able to fix to dongo can be 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.169
 Besides, we count of course we go to develop 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.270
 so that's what I said especially the private reserve the 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.719
 sperm from English to the goal 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:22.830
 for her an in vitro fertilization is said to be outside the human body 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.599
 and we would still have obtained embryos in which we inform that their 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:26.639
 reports 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.120
 several embryos 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.120
 so as to favor to be certain that at least 

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:37.089
 the 150 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.400
 then another solution 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.589
 it's not enough to win it 

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:44.639
 what's the matter of letting the artificial stimulation after the 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:45.620
 terrible 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.520
 in the case 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.189
 the cdc with sperm of the spouse 

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:52.330
 or when we are in the case of women wishing to have a child 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.520
 a seal we meet them totally sterile 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.389
 well there is possibility of having an artificial assimilation 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:03.409
 always inside the womb 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:05.289
 but this time with the sperm of a donor 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:07.029
 that's what we're looking for and matte 

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:09.089
 with a cannula it contains 

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:10.460
 spermatozoa 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.279
 one develops one deposits one's spermatozoa 

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:16.719
 in the Russian soil generally during the occupation period 

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:18.240
 in a way 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.680
 there was a lot of sperm 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.360
 and etisalat spray ramp 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.669
 to the newsletter to persist this time inside 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:29.669
 of the uterus and more precisely certainly 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.779
 that is to say third over 3% this rank 

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:35.409
 too low beauvue 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:37.050
 after ovulation 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.919
 many have obligation 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:42.169
 in the first volume 2 spouse's street one remains in the uterus of the woman 

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:46.020
 finally 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.080
 the other possible technique is it 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.759
 this is the state of mind that corresponds to the sperm injection intras 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:53.229
 cytoplasmic 

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:55.139
 in this case, it goes further 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:58.210
 that is, their mother usually 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.289
 worries about the EU members 

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:05.139
 and the quality of the spermatozoa and in this case there to be sure that the 

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:07.069
 sperm meets the draw 

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:07.910
 and then we go 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.099
 quite simply 

00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:10.129
 introduce 

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:13.199
 the bpa of the group of the least spermatozoa head 

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.119
 in the cytoplasm of the un 

00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:17.159
 in the training takes place 

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:20.159
 and sometimes that fertilization and burning 

00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:23.749
 we will be reimplanted in the maternal uterus 

00:07:24.899 --> 00:07:26.319
 conclusion 

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:29.270
 help 

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.400
 a little further 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.039
 glory make it a summary 

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:35.370
 Proxy proficiency makes it possible to satisfy ungrouped in one 

00:07:35.369 --> 00:07:37.080
 desire for a child 

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.229
 however some drifts 

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:41.659
 and that's what's important to remember 

00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:44.259
 it is that certain drifts could lead to ethical problems 

00:07:44.259 --> 00:07:45.899
 For example 

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:49.319
 well during a preimplantation diagnosis 

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:52.499
 you will find on young people you are interested 

00:07:52.499 --> 00:07:55.369
 and therefore only selected embryos 

00:07:55.369 --> 00:07:57.309
 that we are ready is implanted 

00:07:57.309 --> 00:07:58.669
 with the fn 

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:01.279
 that were previously selected for you kids are 

00:08:01.279 --> 00:08:02.639
 smashed the sentry box it takes
