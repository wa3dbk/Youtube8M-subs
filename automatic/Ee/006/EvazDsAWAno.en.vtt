00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.069
 Yes Yes 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.839
 I'm wilton Vargas from technet and ccoo 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.570
 puntocom and this is a proband trying 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:13.000
 Samsung Galaxy S 6 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.000
 specifically the regular model is not 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.850
 the model made and this time we're going 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.999
 to know thoroughly the matter of the 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:25.269
 battery or stack in this new model here 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:28.480
 I have this phone and like you 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:30.489
 they can see the same now does not have 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.900
 one with the plastic backside that 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.570
 It was removable and allowed to have 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.510
 access to the battery or battery and that's not 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.460
 so the battery is totally sealed 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.199
 is within the team and one of the 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.500
 things that samsung has been saying is 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.579
 that how they have achieved 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.590
 integral other functions that I'm going to 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.090
 explain within moments, since the 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.460
 matter after a battery is 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.670
 removable is not necessary the first thing is 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.859
 that to make a team so thin the 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.679
 issue of the battery being removable 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:02.379
 simply because it could not be possible not 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:04.750
 it is possible according to samsung to make a team 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.130
 as thin as this one and that the battery 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.409
 be removable 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.659
 is that samsung has now integrated what 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.340
 it's called wireless charging which is the 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.490
 capacity that you may want to load or 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.350
 is to recharge the battery I must say by 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.210
 means of a wireless system there is no 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.470
 connecting cables but of course 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.960
 it has a microusb connector anyway 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.509
 in the bottom to be able to perform 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.679
 this process of loading it apart from this 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:33.649
 another one of the things that motivated samsung to 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:34.939
 not to not integrate what can be 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.880
 remove the battery is the fact that 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.729
 now that battery or that pile can be 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.939
 charged in just 10 minutes and that you 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:47.390
 allow then to have charge for four 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.380
 hours and this we can also present it 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.619
 or explain it in the following way 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:55.549
 four hours of regular use two hours 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:59.630
 to watch video or take or record video and 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:02.630
 is this capacity because obviously it 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.970
 expands if you use a shape or form 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.890
 to charge it on the battery so 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.440
 regulate this what you want to say is that 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.120
 if you only give 10 minutes of charge 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.129
 will give you 4 hours of duration 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.480
 if you leave the complete cycle then 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.549
 you are going to have a phone with a charge 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.110
 well practically for the whole day or 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.150
 at least that mentions samsung will 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.519
 to prove it later on there 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.099
 we are seeing the new screen of 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.840
 information on the state of the battery or 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.239
 the battery that well in a clear way 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.909
 in a way is very clean gives you the 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:36.180
 information on how much how much charge 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:38.040
 is now for example 79% level of 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.230
 load then you will have a duration of 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.680
 practically almost 8 hours 7 hours 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.480
 and 54 minutes and if you activate the other two 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.940
 operating modes like power 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.739
 mobile service and ultra power we follow 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.810
 Well, now that capacity 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.269
 I must say duration of operation of the 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.160
 phone for stretches dramatically 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.489
 in the case of ultra power mod that you 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.459
 allows to operate it for 18 hours 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:06.000
 in summary you have as justification 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.579
 so that samsung has not continued then 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.859
 the tradition of a removable battery or 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:13.829
 removable battery the fact that one the 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:15.989
 phone is very thin 2 that integrates 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.340
 wireless charging or the ability to 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.830
 download it 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.160
 and the battery wirelessly that 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.290
 Incidentally it is compatible with the 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.269
 load standards that are 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.599
 available today 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.680
 Peter 0 well that now with these 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.769
 new modes of operation 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.230
 certainly the ability of the team to 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:41.819
 keep running for longer is 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:44.069
 a reality and well this will have to see 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.860
 Once the product or the equipment is 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.590
 on the street if indeed this is going to be 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.239
 so for technical dotcom in the camera 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.220
 james link wilton vargas with the new 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.220
 galaxy s 6 from samsung
