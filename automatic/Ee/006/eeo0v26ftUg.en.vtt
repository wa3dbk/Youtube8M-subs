00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
the new season I went through one by one

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.810 
the new season I went through one by one

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
in each comment I tried picking at least

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.510 
in each comment I tried picking at least
one<00:00:15.120> player<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.839> know<00:00:16.199> someone<00:00:16.500> wanted<00:00:16.800> 97

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
one player I know someone wanted 97

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.939 
one player I know someone wanted 97
Andre<00:00:17.940> Johnson<00:00:18.240> while<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.750> wouldn't<00:00:19.080> get<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.320> 96

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
Andre Johnson while I wouldn't get to 96

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.130 
Andre Johnson while I wouldn't get to 96
because<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.340> 97<00:00:21.090> he<00:00:21.630> was<00:00:21.720> going<00:00:21.930> for<00:00:22.080> a

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
because the 97 he was going for a

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.009 
because the 97 he was going for a
hundred<00:00:22.590> ninety<00:00:22.740> one<00:00:22.920> thousand<00:00:23.490> coins<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.119> he

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
hundred ninety one thousand coins and he

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.420 
hundred ninety one thousand coins and he
was<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.199> only<00:00:25.230> one<00:00:25.500> up<00:00:25.680> there<00:00:25.859> for<00:00:26.039> about<00:00:26.220> two

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
was the only one up there for about two

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.490 
was the only one up there for about two
days<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:26.939> didn't<00:00:27.269> know<00:00:27.330> what<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.630> do<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:28.019> went

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
days so I didn't know what to do I went

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.769 
days so I didn't know what to do I went
with<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.710> 96<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.490> hope<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.880> works<00:00:30.150> there's

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
with the 96 I hope that works there's

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.359 
with the 96 I hope that works there's
only<00:00:30.929> about<00:00:31.080> four<00:00:31.439> or<00:00:31.560> five<00:00:31.740> people<00:00:32.130> that

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
only about four or five people that

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.190 
only about four or five people that
really<00:00:32.700> didn't<00:00:33.030> get<00:00:33.149> one<00:00:33.360> player<00:00:33.660> they<00:00:33.870> voted

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
really didn't get one player they voted

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.020 
really didn't get one player they voted
for<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.920> that's<00:00:35.070> because<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.460> are<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.880> only

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
for and that's because you are you only

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.700 
for and that's because you are you only
commented<00:00:36.480> like<00:00:36.630> one<00:00:36.809> or<00:00:36.930> two<00:00:36.989> players<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.649> I

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
commented like one or two players and I

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.950 
commented like one or two players and I
already<00:00:37.829> had<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.280> position<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.510> really

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
already had that position so I really

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.049 
already had that position so I really
wanted<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.260> use<00:00:40.320> two<00:00:40.680> player<00:00:40.950> or<00:00:41.219> someone<00:00:41.940> else

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
wanted to use two player or someone else

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.850 
wanted to use two player or someone else
