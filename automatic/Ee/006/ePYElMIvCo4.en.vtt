 Video appreciation 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.940
 Action demonstration 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:06.760
 Hello everyone, today we have to teach the "reverse round" of the upright bell. This action is very important for the upright bell base action. 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.940
 Learning is not difficult, but it is very effective! 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.520
 Slow motion demonstration 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:30.620
 This action is very eager for the players of "Pei Bell". For the "fixed axis" player, although not difficult, but need a strong ring speed! 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.740
 Basic work 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:49.940
 Basic skill 1: The upright bell is very straight! If there is a little embarrassment, the turnover rate will be very high! 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:02:04.860
 Basic Skill 2: Plane "reverse round" 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.260
 Decomposition teaching 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.780
 The first step: stop the bell 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:20.040
 The first step is to learn to stop the bell on the right hand side first. 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.140
 1. After the bell is shipped, unzip it to the left and block it back. 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.600
 2. After the bell reaches the right, the palm of the right hand is facing up, and the stick head is facing outward. 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.340
 3. Put the bell between our stick and the rope, try to stop for two to three seconds. 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.460
 4. Come back to speed up 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.100
 After this action is over, then move on to the next stage. 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.060
 The second step is to let go 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.220
 Next, let go! 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:04.640
 1. The previous paragraphs are the same. 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.880
 2. Let go of the part, push the bell to the right and hit the stick. 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:16.420
 3. Key points: the stick head is facing backwards, the stick tail is facing forward, and the home is released backwards. (After letting go, the bell will fly out with the stick) 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.560
 4. Don't be too strong, the speed is moderate. 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.720
 5. When I come back, because the line is long, some key points should be noted. 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:41.520
 The curved left hand should be extended straight and the club head should point to the outermost part. The bell will be close to itself and it will be better. 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.800
 6. After receiving it, don't rush to ring the bell. 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.780
 7. Wait until the bell and the body are stable, then start accelerating again. 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.680
 This action is almost complete! congratulations! 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.120
 Common mistakes 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.120
 Common mistake 1: Stick out flying! 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.300
 Reason: At first, the stick was not touched, and the stick was let go. 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:21.460
 important! It must be noted that if the standard is not put, it is very easy to fly out and it will become very dangerous! 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:27.040
 Common mistake 2: You will feel that "the bell is far away from me, I can't catch it every time!" 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:34.860
 Reason 1: The left hand did not straighten out, and the club head did not point to the outermost. 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.320
 Reason 2: The line is really too long, it will be easier to use a shorter line. 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.380
 Ok! Come on! 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.700
 Extended action 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.200
 Extension Action 1: Another Way to Ring 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:05:04.460
 After receiving it, the bell will get back. After bringing it back, go to the next lap and untie it. 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:12.460
 Stretch action 2: Tied to your feet and lie down to untie 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.740
 Ok, this class is here! I wish you all the best to practice the bells and leave the class! 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.500
 Thanks for watching
