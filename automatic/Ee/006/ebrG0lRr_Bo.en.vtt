alright now we got it trimmed down we're
going<00:01:26.260> to<00:01:26.320> go<00:01:26.440> over<00:01:26.470> this<00:01:26.680> machine<00:01:27.010> here<00:01:27.190> I'm

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
going to go over this machine here I'm

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.090 
going to go over this machine here I'm
going<00:01:27.370> to<00:01:27.430> show<00:01:27.490> you<00:01:27.580> how<00:01:27.700> to<00:01:27.760> turn<00:01:27.940> it<00:01:27.970> on<00:01:28.150> and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
going to show you how to turn it on and

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:44.190 
going to show you how to turn it on and
hook<00:01:30.100> everything<00:01:30.340> up

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.570 

yeah<00:01:45.200> actually<00:01:45.530> quite<00:01:45.920> right<00:01:46.160> where<00:01:46.310> you<00:01:46.400> are

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
yeah actually quite right where you are

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.810 
yeah actually quite right where you are
right<00:01:46.760> there<00:01:47.080> because<00:01:48.080> that<00:01:48.670> mainly<00:01:49.670> where

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
right there because that mainly where

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.810 
right there because that mainly where
everything<00:01:50.090> is<00:01:50.920> alright<00:01:51.920> there's<00:01:52.580> a<00:01:52.640> switch

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
everything is alright there's a switch

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.070 
everything is alright there's a switch
on<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.060> side<00:01:53.240> you<00:01:53.420> just<00:01:53.450> want<00:01:53.600> to<00:01:53.720> turn<00:01:53.870> it<00:01:53.990> on

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
on the side you just want to turn it on

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:01.320 
on the side you just want to turn it on
it's<00:01:54.860> easy<00:01:55.570> take<00:01:56.570> your<00:01:56.750> hose<00:01:58.480> plug<00:01:59.480> up<00:01:59.660> in<00:01:59.810> here

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
it's easy take your hose plug up in here

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.190 
it's easy take your hose plug up in here
so<00:02:02.330> it<00:02:02.420> gets<00:02:02.570> pressure<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:03.800> that<00:02:03.950> arm<00:02:04.130> should

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
so it gets pressure and that arm should

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:23.140 
so it gets pressure and that arm should
turn<00:02:06.200> off<00:02:06.350> as<00:02:06.650> soon<00:02:06.830> as<00:02:06.920> we<00:02:07.010> get<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.250> air<00:02:07.370> on

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:30.979 

all<00:02:23.689> right<00:02:23.780> Val<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:23.989> ready

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.860 

flip<00:02:31.530> this<00:02:31.650> over<00:02:33.469> just<00:02:34.469> roll<00:02:34.709> it<00:02:34.829> up<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.870> just

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
flip this over just roll it up you just

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.250 
flip this over just roll it up you just
stand<00:02:37.079> on<00:02:37.170> like<00:02:37.620> writer<00:02:37.890> work<00:02:38.099> next<00:02:38.549> to<00:02:38.609> her

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
stand on like writer work next to her

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.050 
stand on like writer work next to her
feet<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.379> first<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:41.430> usually<00:02:41.700> takes<00:02:41.879> two

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
feet it first and usually takes two

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.140 
feet it first and usually takes two
people<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.329> do<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:42.829> I<00:02:43.829> could<00:02:44.760> probably<00:02:44.790> do<00:02:45.060> it

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
people to do this I could probably do it

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.410 
people to do this I could probably do it
myself<00:02:45.180> but<00:02:45.510> just<00:02:46.230> for<00:02:46.379> safety<00:02:46.890> these<00:02:47.579> two

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.179 

line<00:02:51.420> this<00:02:51.569> up<00:02:51.780> in<00:02:51.930> here<00:02:53.030> folds<00:02:54.030> around<00:02:55.189> might

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
line this up in here folds around might

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.990 
line this up in here folds around might
be<00:02:56.310> difficult<00:02:56.489> to<00:02:56.700> see<00:02:56.790> that<00:02:57.120> it<00:02:58.849> folds<00:02:59.849> right

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
be difficult to see that it folds right

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.309 
be difficult to see that it folds right
through<00:03:00.269> this<00:03:00.329> little<00:03:00.599> groove<00:03:01.079> right<00:03:01.109> here

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
through this little groove right here

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.039 
through this little groove right here
and<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:01.620> just<00:03:01.650> press<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.450> put<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.569> into

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
and you just press it and put it into

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.640 
and you just press it and put it into
this<00:03:04.169> wheel<00:03:05.750> at<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.810> black<00:03:07.019> button<00:03:07.349> that<00:03:07.470> hook

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
this wheel at a black button that hook

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:18.620 
this wheel at a black button that hook
puts<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.040> down

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.860 

there's<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.290> petal<00:03:19.620> that<00:03:19.710> feeds<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.130> through<00:03:20.870> so

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
there's a petal that feeds it through so

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.510 
there's a petal that feeds it through so
now<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.020> it's<00:03:22.230> down<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.620> wheel<00:03:22.770> is<00:03:22.980> pinching

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
now that it's down the wheel is pinching

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.580 
now that it's down the wheel is pinching
this<00:03:23.670> side<00:03:24.450> here<00:03:24.720> I'm<00:03:25.200> going<00:03:25.320> to<00:03:25.380> hit<00:03:25.500> the

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
this side here I'm going to hit the

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
this side here I'm going to hit the
pedal<00:03:25.860> and<00:03:25.950> it's<00:03:26.070> going<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.250> feed<00:03:26.460> it<00:03:26.580> through

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
pedal and it's going to feed it through

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.820 
pedal and it's going to feed it through
and<00:03:27.240> as<00:03:27.360> it<00:03:27.510> feeds<00:03:27.690> it<00:03:27.870> through<00:03:28.080> it<00:03:28.230> basically

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
and as it feeds it through it basically

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:51.580 
and as it feeds it through it basically
burns<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:29.460> together<00:03:29.730> so<00:03:30.860> show<00:03:31.860> you<00:03:31.920> real<00:03:32.100> quick

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.260 

see<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:52.680> just<00:03:52.770> takes<00:03:53.010> it<00:03:53.190> melt<00:03:53.760> melts<00:03:54.180> it

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
see it just takes it melt melts it

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.660 
see it just takes it melt melts it
together<00:03:54.569> so<00:03:55.200> now<00:03:55.440> that<00:03:55.500> that<00:03:55.980> excess<00:03:56.459> of

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
together so now that that excess of

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.720 
together so now that that excess of
we're<00:03:57.080> holding<00:03:58.080> back<00:03:58.290> right<00:03:58.530> here<00:03:58.800> is<00:03:59.489> now

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
we're holding back right here is now

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.809 
we're holding back right here is now
just<00:03:59.970> straight<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:00.989> print<00:04:01.550> now<00:04:02.550> we<00:04:02.610> do<00:04:02.730> the

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
just straight to the print now we do the

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:11.699 
just straight to the print now we do the
other<00:04:02.940> side

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.460

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
and we'll do this to all four sides then

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.920 
and we'll do this to all four sides then
we'll<00:04:30.180> take<00:04:30.300> it<00:04:30.330> over<00:04:30.539> there<00:04:30.720> and<00:04:30.810> put
