00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:21.919
 I propose this time to me 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.599
 follow to discover the secrets of 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.820
 manufacture of one of the flagship products 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.679
 from the catalog thiriez the salmon heart 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.079
 smoked and for that we came to 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:32.689
 heart of Burgundy where was created there 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:35.030
 at 34 this business by sir 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.590
 raymond a former crazy star chef of 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.300
 smoked salmon today he is supported 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.280
 by his youngest son who is waiting for us 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:46.490
 to go behind the scenes of salmon 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.750
 smoked to order a kid there this is the 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.060
 very first school of the 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.190
 transformation of the path we would do it 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.530
 fly but yes it's the stage of 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.150
 threading it consists of separating the two 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.610
 nets and remove the central ridge 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.710
 all come movie if not all 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.870
 we receive them live from norway and 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.129
 so the peculiarity is 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.830
 we have a very strict specifications 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.359
 strict on the growth of our salmon 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.429
 are the real slow growth 

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:12.229
 so that is to say that our name a 

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:15.700
 profession in the open sea they are high 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.700
 for 18 to 24 months 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.490
 and so after that we're on the stage of 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.450
 trimming one also that's done 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.549
 manually 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.479
 we remove the bank of greece during the hall 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.420
 the bank of greece 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.100
 ventral for after having a net where he 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.780
 there is no more pace his teeth do not 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.820
 produces no arrested focus of 5 steve 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.500
 to draw on we pass the nets in a 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.920
 tunnel wash and only rinse to 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.600
 the clear water 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:46.960
 before salting then the 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.300
 do we take the salmon have the skin 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.509
 in the dry salt and also that are put 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.670
 on this carpet and rollers did yesterday 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.100
 a rain of the one that goes suddenly 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.899
 dog side aisles that will go the side 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.990
 flesh homogeneously higher 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.940
 salat at low temperature a goal the 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.490
 greases are frozen so the penetration 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.810
 of salt to this fact tourism years which better 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.519
 which is much better and it is this 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.680
 that we are looking for that is why 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.530
 we salmon our room temperature 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.420
 quite low ie at zero + 2 we 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.620
 the goal is to have a very good product 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.540
 very little salty ie 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:25.329
 around 2 2% at which the fish 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.130
 been sealed then dessel and I imagine 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.290
 quite then the rooms to the water 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.430
 clear and then let the product 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.890
 quiet for a dozen hours 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.959
 so here after we go smoking how much 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.120
 of smoking time then the time of 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.350
 smoking is between 7 and 9 hours 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.470
 very low temperature 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.200
 that is, we smoke up to 25 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.680
 25 degrees 26 degrees not the only 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.480
 past 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.950
 so you do not cook the fish and 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.630
 so as not to spoil the classels 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.220
 question that interests the consumer 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.500
 also it is to know with which 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.609
 wood species one smokes the only one or to 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.959
 listen to the simplest I will you 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.319
 show segments will make smoke 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.040
 years and brick 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.849
 but me art is a bit of a wizard 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.569
 so then it's here 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.319
 go ahead it's on your right it's the 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.450
 magic machine 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.870
 that's exactly where we have our 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.870
 position 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.379
 years so that opens the bronchi 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.319
 then these two on exclusively from 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:22.930
 to be have the art hydrate to 70% and to 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.280
 which we incorporate oils 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.810
 natural essentials 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.810
 it's a little bit the bouquet garni 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.110
 and therefore every 8 minutes the insured 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.060
 renew so she is barely 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.560
 consume compliant and already from the a9 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.560
 so she does not address the product 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.560
 then and a final final state at the level 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.180
 of products what is called a heart 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.890
 of net of this world it's only 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.090
 in the back part of the products are 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.430
 in fact it's the most noble piece 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.069
 of the net quite so already the 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.819
 first thing we will proceed to the most 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.110
 loaded it just consists of 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:04.980
 separate the net in two at level 2 on 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.080
 arm muscle like that we have balls 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.019
 why spent many years of 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.380
 form two practices and training there 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.580
 we go caliber and our net hearts is 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.440
 usually it's always done 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.100
 the hand is a product that has never 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.530
 the same form 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.320
 so these are steps that have never 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.729
 mechanized hop we'll put it in 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.720
 salmon cubes keep because that 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.720
 you're going to do it at home 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:35.520
 I can go go ahead I took the 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:38.639
 bigger what strikes me is 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.169
 balance between salt but not too much 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.290
 smoke but not too much I have to say like 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:46.340
 it's really up and we're safe 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.340
 I will go vote go ahead
