00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.190
 hello montroi friends of welcome to 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:19.279
 this first view video of the motorcycle that 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.950
 in its 2014 version we had the 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.439
 opportunity to visit the event of 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.029
 motorola here in santiago de chile and 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.490
 well we wanted to share some of 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.710
 our first impressions about 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.440
 this new team as you can see 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.020
 It is actually somewhat of a team 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.090
 larger than we had seen in the 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.510
 previous version made its screen 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.879
 now grows 5 inches its rear camera 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.300
 it has also been improved to 8 megapixels 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:50.449
 and its 2 megapixel front camera as well 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:54.109
 that we meet when also with 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:56.840
 a computer that has android 4.4 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:59.539
 kitkat and with updates by 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.480
 course for android has when this one 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:05.390
 is available in general terms 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.790
 time we had the team we could see 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.160
 that actually has a very good 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.620
 quality of construction for who we 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.270
 like even a little better than what 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.530
 we had seen in the engine that of the year 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.840
 past we can also see what 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.659
 effectively has a very design 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.840
 similar to what we had seen the engine 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.180
 police original small box the truth is 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.290
 that does not feel bigger than the 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.950
 previous equipment its front screen of 5 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.229
 inches the truth is that it looks really good 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.830
 resolution hd the truth is that quite 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.560
 well also of course we can see 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.700
 that in general terms the team 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.820
 it worked quite pretty well and the 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.810
 difference of course from the equipment of the 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.110
 last year 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.490
 of course here we have a 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.610
 processor that has been the truth 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:05.000
 updated versus the version of the year 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.640
 past and of course that also looks 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.100
 in the fluidity of the operating system the 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.140
 it's true that he's doing very well and in 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.870
 Sometimes we forgot that we 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.780
 We found a team of 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.530
 the truth is that quite well in that 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.930
 set aside the motorola team its camera 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.480
 8 megapixel rear produces 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.269
 photographs of very good quality one of 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.819
 the main heels of achilles of the 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.769
 last year's version so the camera 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.709
 The truth is that the 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.920
 interface is the typical one that we found 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.950
 with pure android the truth that we have 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.690
 a some additional options but in 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.110
 general terms a 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.450
 camera version pretty easy to 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.780
 use so in general terms 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:00.250
 yes what you expected from team 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.950
 it was a good camera does not disappoint 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.360
 with time I had the possibility to 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.360
 to prove it the truth is that I liked it 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.790
 very much his performance of course in 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.370
 the full analysis let's see a little 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.710
 more how does this device behave 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.220
 so I hope you liked this 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.590
 first view of the motorola motokey and 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.400
 we hope very soon to have the complete 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.400
 analysis
