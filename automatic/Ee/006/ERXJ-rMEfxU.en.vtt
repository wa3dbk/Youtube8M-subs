00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
chopper gunner I'm definitely gonna have

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.460

to<00:04:42.580> look<00:04:42.729> into<00:04:42.970> changing<00:04:43.510> out<00:04:43.660> my<00:04:44.229> killstreaks

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
to look into changing out my killstreaks

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.529 
to look into changing out my killstreaks
as<00:04:45.190> you<00:04:45.310> can<00:04:45.460> see<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:46.000> other<00:04:46.150> guys<00:04:46.360> I've

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
as you can see the other guys I've

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:47.879 
as you can see the other guys I've
actually<00:04:46.660> had<00:04:46.930> enough<00:04:47.169> of<00:04:47.289> this<00:04:47.440> too

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
actually had enough of this too

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.460 
actually had enough of this too
and<00:04:48.010> so<00:04:48.880> we<00:04:49.000> had<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.270> hosts<00:04:49.479> bail<00:04:50.050> out<00:04:50.260> of<00:04:50.289> the

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
and so we had the hosts bail out of the

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.590 
and so we had the hosts bail out of the
game<00:04:50.710> I<00:04:51.010> guess<00:04:51.310> is<00:04:51.729> to<00:04:51.789> say<00:04:52.000> when<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.240> going

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
game I guess is to say when the going

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.379 
game I guess is to say when the going
gets<00:04:52.750> tough<00:04:53.110> the<00:04:53.470> tough<00:04:53.620> get<00:04:54.280> going<00:04:54.310> and<00:04:54.910> pull

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
gets tough the tough get going and pull

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.170 
gets tough the tough get going and pull
out<00:04:55.510> of<00:04:55.539> the<00:04:55.720> match<00:04:56.070> so<00:04:57.070> while<00:04:57.760> we<00:04:57.970> watched

out of the match so while we watched

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.510
