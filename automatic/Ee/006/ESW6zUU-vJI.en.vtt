 soup filled with parmesan cheese 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.420
 grated cheese and we can also use the 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.710
 provolone any of the two you 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.619
 choose to use the parmesan provolone medium 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.460
 liter of milk and a box of 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.740
 milk 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.790
 these are our ingredients that we 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.220
 let's use 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.770
 we'll put to boil two 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.820
 liter of water for us to cook 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.810
 eggplant 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.810
 We are going to cut the eggplant into slices. 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:39.250
 so we cut the two eggplants in 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.290
 layers like this 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.390
 now we'll put them in the water 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.509
 hot for cooking 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:51.009
 we'll put half a tablespoon of 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:54.070
 salt in the water because I let go the bitter 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.259
 reach her and now we're putting 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:01.060
 the eggplant slices they a 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:04.030
 cook as the water is already boiling 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.860
 We are going to sing and cook for 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.920
 15 minutes of play 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.930
 We're going to try that fucking fairy. 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.820
 there the vacuum helping to cook faster 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.739
 said to spend the five minutes that our 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:22.769
 eggplants are cooking 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:26.350
 we attack the fire we have to cover 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:28.269
 to be able to cook well that's how you 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.120
 must have noticed is in very slices 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:34.060
 it's fine, it 's you, now we're going 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:38.500
 remove them and put them in the corridors 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.690
 are cooked the slices of eggplant 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.450
 We'll let it cool down. 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.590
 environment for us to continue our 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.310
 recipe 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.980
 and now we're going to make the bechamel sauce 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.530
 in a pan on low heat 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:03:00.489
 we'll put the margarine or 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:03.570
 butter or margarine is melted 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.620
 we put the wheat flour 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.280
 piece surplus 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.829
 We're not praying in this prayer. 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.549
 part here now we get the flow 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:20.049
 whisk 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:22.200
 We are cooking, yes, cooking. 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.489
 wheat flour 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.040
 We'll know she's on the point. 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.890
 The less she releases from the corners of the 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.480
 pan 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.430
 she is already even dropping the 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.700
 corners of the pan 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.720
 So we're throwing hot milk at 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.720
 few to avoid embarrassment 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:53.160
 we are putting gradually and always 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:58.140
 messing with I went and put all the milk 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:00.750
 is half full of milk 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.560
 now we're going to put our nutmeg 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.050
 grated 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.810
 You can buy grated nutmeg but 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.680
 I'll get there in time I got more 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.680
 fresh is more delicious 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.250
 only that because even if not a 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.510
 I like very strong 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.310
 now we'll put the grated cheese 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.590
 We're going to be stirring here for some. 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:29.550
 three minutes to melt the cheese 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:32.690
 always on low heat to avoid burning 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.690
 there it is already boiling 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:42.380
 we do not pay the liner out of the fire we 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.970
 we put the cream 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:48.120
 you can store this sauce in the 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.950
 refrigerator for three days and can freeze 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.220
 for three months 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.620
 you put a little pot capped this 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.720
 sauce can be used either in recipe of the 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.720
 sweet as salty 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.479
 We're moving well until we're in 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.150
 ambient temperature because the 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:09.270
 the risk of asking you to join us 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.950
 The preferred form of glass is the 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.740
 We will look fine 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:17.010
 Meanwhile we'll turn the oven on 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.710
 average temperature 180 degrees for me is 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:23.550
 I feel now that we ride the way 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:26.640
 we'll put the betina layer 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:29.700
 let's form the background of the shape 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.950
 now we'll put pieces 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.620
 silver of marcelo 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:37.710
 now we form a layer of fez 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:40.979
 together or made a ceiling 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:44.490
 we form a layer of ham 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:47.240
 now let's put another layer of 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.240
 eggplant 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:55.480
 now we'll put on top of the 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:06:02.110
 layer of eggplant the sauce that we 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:09.639
 we made and sauce bechamel we spread 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:15.220
 well now over the bechamel sauce we 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:17.830
 Let's put the pinch of oregano to 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:21.360
 coverage of our law we will use 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:25.510
 grated cheese at will 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:28.570
 our fund is already preheated then 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:31.930
 we are going to take our revenue by 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:34.150
 only 20 minutes because the adhesion 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.700
 it is already cooked 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.169
 then 20 minutes is the time to melt 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.060
 the cheese 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:43.479
 It looks like it was beautiful lasagna 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:46.419

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:55.060
