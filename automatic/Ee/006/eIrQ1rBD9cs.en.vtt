 in this video tutorial we are going to 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:13.190
 teach yo 13013 0t and friends 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:16.190
 and go up like draw marches in a 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.390
 very easy notebook they simply have 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.390
 have a skill 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.769
 have a notebook at hand 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.859
 so 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.079
 so that 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:36.670
 have to have a turkey is like that 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:39.670
 let's draw the balls in this way 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.199
 If you distinguish it, let's draw 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.350
 then let's make it a way 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:47.680
 curved up and we're going to 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.680
 to draw 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.220
 reach to see then we are 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.220
 drawing a big head 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:03.970
 and another ball looked 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:07.230
 and so the grinding wheel is left 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.230
 will be here 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:16.470
 the 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.470
 now yes then they will make you happy 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.040
 so if you want to put something better 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.240
 they are going to put a line in the middle and 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.240
 pulling better 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:39.160
 here is your good red march this 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:42.570
 was everything or if you want we can make a 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.570
 letter for much better 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:50.930
 and await the moment achieved I will do 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.930
 a lead head court 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.870

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.470
 avoid the cadista 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:13.240
 they looked at it then it follows the form 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.910
