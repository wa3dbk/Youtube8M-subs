00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.750
 hello to all and lease no case I hope 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.130
 that you're fine 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.350
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.330
 new information video on gta 5 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.720
 online the robberies so that go 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.010
 arrive 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.750
 just now I made you a 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.849
 little explanation video about how 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.470
 is going to unfold these robberies there in 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.449
 this video we will see the location 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.099
 robberies is also very important 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.650
 what are we going to rob it 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.820
 still a pretty important thing so 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.410
 here we go first look 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.890
 this first image that rockstar has us 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.570
 balance 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.730
 so we end up in a room in 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.710
 the apartment with leicester with a 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.690
 table behind we can see 5 post-it 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.000
 post it bag that will teach us the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.739
 location of robberies so watch 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.260
 here we have four who are a little 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.180
 center and the center of the city and the and 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.640
 a fifth a little higher up near the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.079
 trevor desert so the sixth is 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.820
 still unknown at the moment but you 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.899
 go see the hypothesis later that 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.210
 I will offer you is still 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.250
 pretty explicit enough 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.600
 so here it is gone look after I 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.030
 will show you a second crime that 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.470
 is right here so this screen has been drawn 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.810
 of the trailer and the sweat table you 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.970
 can see a little 2 and a little king 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.860
 and next door prison break 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.260
 so we will be able to target prisons 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.700
 thing that is still a little out 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.990
 common song do not wait for to 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.640
 rob prisons we were expected 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.810
 to banks what will be possible too 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.369
 do not worry we'll be able to 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.490
 rob banks but there will also be 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.470
 of the prisons to brac and so I'm 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.790
 asks how they organized his note 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.049
 look if we have the little image there 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.390
 also who can confirm us what I 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.350
 tell me a try to take a bus in 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.390
 hostage maybe to try to 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.820
 retrieve a teammate who were 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.869
 imprisoned or something like that 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.920
 so then here we will talk about a 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.200
 second what is I look at you 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.150
 the record always the same from the trailer 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.549
 and this time we will talk about banking 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.009
 this cop at bank of the western has way 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.840
 so a first bank to turn is 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.299
 here a second audience to huawei and one 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.890
 just see writes delpero so like a 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.600
 other localization so in all that will do 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.890
 four banks for the moment two 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.390
 banks and two jails to brac y 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.549
 look at a little similar picture that is going 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.350
 with and who was rocked by rockstar 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.840
 so there for the moment we miss him 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.489
 two banks to turn or two 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.140
 places to steer so I'm going to you 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.820
 propose this one so the big bank 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.170
 that everyone knows and I think 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.120
 it's already sure we will be able to 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.070
 stare since rockstar like to 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.660
 to swing images where we see 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.680
 people in the bank in dashes of the 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.870
 turn on vote look at the crossed out picture 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.010
 and so for now for me this 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.469
 robbery the this bank 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.670
 we're going to rob her and I 've got one 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:32.219
 can see also so on the plane or 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.510
 sent to the beginning of the video leicester 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:36.640
 just nothing a little post-it to this 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.170
 place so from the intersection here 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.700
 look, I'll give it to you 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.590
 little post-it number three for me 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.120
 it's this lake bank and right here the 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.849
 gran the largest bank in the city 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.099
 and then we have a place 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.659
 secret pointed out that we did not see 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.280
 the leicester plant and there attention I 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:52.480
 will show you a small picture and 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.579
 you'll tell me ah yeah that's 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.439
 possible so look I offer you 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.689
 a boat steering so look 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.319
 the time we can see a team of guys 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:01.540
 in jet ski 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.859
 a helicopter approaching the boat 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.939
 never saw the boat I do not think 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.829
 we can buy a boat too 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:08.379
 big so for me it will surely be 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.239
 will say a place two robberies the boat 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.250
 will only be there for the show of 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.099
 robbery and so that also explains a 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.780
 little the just this liner in gta and 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.969
 So here we come to 7 at the end of 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.500
 this little explanation video you in 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:21.400
 comments do not hesitate to tell me 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.000
 everything you think of these 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.889
 explanations 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.750
 of course this is not official it did 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:27.189
 not announced but it's small 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.720
 little research that was done 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:30.430
 in the trailer and that could be 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.239
 observed and frankly I find that 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.889
 it really makes sense 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.780
 and so that's me I'll leave you 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.889
 on these images tell you all good game 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.889
 and keeps everyone
