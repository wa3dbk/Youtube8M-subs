the duck duck that I bought off of
Amazon<00:00:09.389> for<00:00:10.370> $25<00:00:11.370> but<00:00:12.150> that<00:00:12.330> was<00:00:12.509> with<00:00:12.690> free

Amazon for $25 but that was with free

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.020 
Amazon for $25 but that was with free
shipping<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:13.889> might<00:00:14.070> cost<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.700> little

and I hear the French Foreign Legion had
used<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:24.119> in<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:25.199> past<00:00:25.470> it's<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.400> very<00:00:26.609> thin

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939

knife<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:33.620> can<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:35.100> think<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.610> can<00:00:35.760> tell<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.180> it

knife I can I think you can tell that it

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.770 
knife I can I think you can tell that it
doesn't<00:00:36.660> have<00:00:36.809> our<00:00:36.960> lock<00:00:37.170> on<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:39.170> has<00:00:40.170> a

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
doesn't have our lock on it it's has a

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.190 
doesn't have our lock on it it's has a
easy<00:00:42.780> opening<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:44.420> it's<00:00:45.420> stiff<00:00:45.690> enough<00:00:45.719> where

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
easy opening and it's stiff enough where

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.590 
easy opening and it's stiff enough where
it<00:00:46.289> will<00:00:46.530> not<00:00:46.710> close<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.610> unless<00:00:48.090> more

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
it will not close on you unless more

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.400 
it will not close on you unless more
force<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.230> used<00:00:50.420> so<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.750> knife<00:00:51.930> what<00:00:52.260> I

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
force is used so this knife what I

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.010 
force is used so this knife what I
wouldn't<00:00:52.710> suggest<00:00:53.039> beginners<00:00:53.940> use<00:00:54.300> because

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
wouldn't suggest beginners use because

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.529 
wouldn't suggest beginners use because
you<00:00:55.170> have<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.500> make<00:00:55.770> sure<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.699> have

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
you have to make sure that you have

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.510 
you have to make sure that you have
safety<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.170> mind<00:00:58.469> when<00:00:58.800> you're<00:00:58.920> closing<00:00:59.219> the

knife keep your fingers from the handle
from<00:01:03.449> inside<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.229> area<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:06.780> knife<00:01:07.680> was<00:01:08.250> not

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
from inside this area the knife was not

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.480 
from inside this area the knife was not
sharp<00:01:08.939> when<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.530> when<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.650> arrived<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.130> my<00:01:11.280> house

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
sharp when I when it arrived to my house

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.810 
sharp when I when it arrived to my house
definitely<00:01:12.420> not<00:01:12.810> shaving<00:01:13.350> sharp<00:01:13.790> so<00:01:14.790> I

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
definitely not shaving sharp so I

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.840 
definitely not shaving sharp so I
sharpened<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.479> up<00:01:15.600> myself<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.460> it's<00:01:17.460> pretty

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
sharpened it up myself and it's pretty

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:39.290 
sharpened it up myself and it's pretty
sharp<00:01:18.090> now<00:01:18.299> let's<00:01:18.840> see

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.040 

where<00:01:40.300> we<00:01:40.420> go<00:01:41.280> an<00:01:42.280> advantage<00:01:43.150> of<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.600> carbon

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
where we go an advantage of the carbon

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.900 
where we go an advantage of the carbon
steel<00:01:44.290> blade<00:01:44.590> of<00:01:44.830> the<00:01:44.950> duck<00:01:45.130> duck<00:01:45.370> is<00:01:45.550> that<00:01:45.790> you

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
steel blade of the duck duck is that you

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.840 
steel blade of the duck duck is that you
can<00:01:46.060> use<00:01:46.210> it<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.600> create<00:01:47.350> fire<00:01:48.010> with<00:01:48.340> this<00:01:48.550> fire

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
can use it to create fire with this fire

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.550 
can use it to create fire with this fire
steel<00:01:49.180> but<00:01:49.750> you<00:01:49.870> don't<00:01:50.050> want<00:01:50.170> to<00:01:50.260> use<00:01:50.380> the

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
steel but you don't want to use the

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.550 
steel but you don't want to use the
blade<00:01:51.340> portion<00:01:51.940> you<00:01:52.840> want<00:01:52.930> to<00:01:53.050> use<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.320> back

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
blade portion you want to use the back

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.860 
blade portion you want to use the back
and<00:01:53.980> to<00:01:54.700> do<00:01:54.850> that<00:01:55.000> you'll<00:01:55.210> have<00:01:55.240> to<00:01:55.420> close<00:01:55.660> the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
and to do that you'll have to close the

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.110 
and to do that you'll have to close the
duct<00:01:56.080> up<00:01:56.260> because<00:01:56.590> as<00:01:56.770> we<00:01:56.920> discussed<00:01:57.790> it<00:01:57.940> has

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
duct up because as we discussed it has

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.500 
duct up because as we discussed it has
no<00:01:58.330> lock<00:01:58.830> so<00:01:59.830> you'll<00:02:00.550> have<00:02:00.670> to<00:02:00.850> do<00:02:01.000> that

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
no lock so you'll have to do that

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.530 
no lock so you'll have to do that
oh<00:02:02.130> let's<00:02:03.130> see<00:02:05.670> we'll<00:02:06.670> put<00:02:06.940> tests<00:02:07.300> on<00:02:07.420> the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
oh let's see we'll put tests on the

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.650 
oh let's see we'll put tests on the
background<00:02:08.140> just<00:02:08.350> to<00:02:08.560> keep<00:02:08.740> it<00:02:08.920> from<00:02:12.120> okay<00:02:13.120> no

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
background just to keep it from okay no

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.140 
background just to keep it from okay no
hidden<00:02:13.959> meaning<00:02:14.320> here<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:15.550> let's<00:02:15.760> see<00:02:15.940> if<00:02:16.030> it

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
hidden meaning here so let's see if it

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:26.130 
hidden meaning here so let's see if it
works<00:02:16.440> that's<00:02:23.400> yeah<00:02:24.690> so<00:02:25.690> that's<00:02:25.870> an<00:02:25.990> advantage

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
works that's yeah so that's an advantage

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.230 
works that's yeah so that's an advantage
of<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.740> carbon<00:02:27.070> steel<00:02:27.190> blade<00:02:27.520> I<00:02:27.550> think<00:02:27.970> you<00:02:28.060> can

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
of a carbon steel blade I think you can

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.790 
of a carbon steel blade I think you can
still<00:02:29.520> use<00:02:30.520> a<00:02:31.050> stainless<00:02:32.050> steel<00:02:32.080> blade<00:02:32.440> to

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
still use a stainless steel blade to

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.060 
still use a stainless steel blade to
create<00:02:33.160> spark<00:02:33.580> but<00:02:34.300> it's<00:02:35.290> easier<00:02:35.680> I<00:02:35.769> believe

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
create spark but it's easier I believe

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.780 
create spark but it's easier I believe
with<00:02:36.250> carbon<00:02:37.180> steel<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:38.560> duck<00:02:38.769> ducks<00:02:39.040> edges

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
with carbon steel the duck ducks edges

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.620 
with carbon steel the duck ducks edges
are<00:02:39.940> sharp<00:02:39.970> on<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:42.130> spine<00:02:42.519> so<00:02:42.910> works

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
are sharp on the the spine so works

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.240 
are sharp on the the spine so works
great<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:46.410> disadvantage<00:02:47.410> of<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.830> duck<00:02:48.010> duck

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
great the disadvantage of the duck duck

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.040 
great the disadvantage of the duck duck
is<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.870> price<00:02:50.140> for<00:02:50.680> me<00:02:50.860> it's<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.310> price<00:02:51.550> I

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
is the price for me it's the price I

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.400 
is the price for me it's the price I
