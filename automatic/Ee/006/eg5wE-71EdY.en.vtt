teleporting to different locations on
the<00:00:04.529> map<00:00:04.620> is<00:00:05.069> not<00:00:05.100> overly<00:00:05.580> complicated<00:00:06.120> I'm

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
the map is not overly complicated I'm

mob in game now we're going to have a
look<00:00:13.679> at<00:00:13.799> teleporting<00:00:14.460> through<00:00:14.670> z<00:00:14.940> axes<00:00:15.360> and

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
look at teleporting through z axes and

also to different locations on the same
z<00:00:17.789> axis<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.869> it's<00:00:19.020> not<00:00:19.140> very<00:00:19.170> complicated<00:00:19.650> so

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
z axis and it's not very complicated so

will automatically inherit those

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.080 
will automatically inherit those
features<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.219> verb<00:00:56.460> i'm<00:00:56.670> going<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.879> call

map<00:01:50.250> are<00:01:50.790> dim<00:01:51.829> just<00:01:52.829> there<00:01:54.079> now<00:01:55.079> if<00:01:55.439> i<00:01:55.560> run<00:01:55.770> now

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
map are dim just there now if i run now

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.039 
map are dim just there now if i run now
if<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.610> talk<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.939> him<00:01:57.060> here<00:01:57.240> you'll<00:01:57.390> see<00:01:57.479> what

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
already at location 1 1 on the map

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.440 
already at location 1 1 on the map
however<00:02:02.070> from<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.430> side<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.969> then<00:02:03.149> i<00:02:03.240> talked

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
however from this side and then i talked

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.289 
however from this side and then i talked
to<00:02:03.600> him<00:02:03.719> oh<00:02:03.979> I'll<00:02:04.979> go<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.310> other<00:02:05.369> side<00:02:05.640> ok

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
to him oh I'll go to the other side ok

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.540 
to him oh I'll go to the other side ok
so<00:02:06.360> that's<00:02:06.750> we're<00:02:07.680> actually<00:02:07.799> tell<00:02:08.099> apart<00:02:08.369> in

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
so that's we're actually tell apart in

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.839 
so that's we're actually tell apart in
let's<00:02:09.119> make<00:02:09.300> sure<00:02:09.330> we<00:02:09.660> tell<00:02:09.810> apart<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.110> bit<00:02:10.259> ma

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
let's make sure we tell apart a bit ma

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.250 
let's make sure we tell apart a bit ma
will<00:02:11.849> change<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.270> locations<00:02:12.840> where<00:02:12.959> we<00:02:13.020> tell

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
will change the locations where we tell

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.559 
will change the locations where we tell
apart

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
apart

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:20.009 
apart
thing<00:02:13.689> too<00:02:15.900> let's<00:02:16.900> have<00:02:16.989> a<00:02:17.079> look<00:02:17.579> mobs<00:02:19.019> let's

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
thing too let's have a look mobs let's

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.550 
thing too let's have a look mobs let's
change<00:02:20.200> it<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:20.349> 10<00:02:21.239> compile<00:02:22.239> and<00:02:22.450> run<00:02:22.560> knife

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
change it to 10 compile and run knife

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.190 
change it to 10 compile and run knife
let's<00:02:23.859> click<00:02:24.280> on<00:02:24.400> talk<00:02:24.639> boom<00:02:25.299> I've<00:02:25.659> moved<00:02:25.930> over

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
let's click on talk boom I've moved over

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.720 
let's click on talk boom I've moved over
here<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.590> I'm<00:02:26.859> in<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.069> water<00:02:27.219> which<00:02:27.519> was<00:02:27.700> a

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
here and I'm in the water which was a

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.770 
here and I'm in the water which was a
bad<00:02:27.969> mistake<00:02:28.120> so<00:02:29.019> let's<00:02:29.170> change<00:02:29.349> it<00:02:29.439> to<00:02:29.530> eight

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
bad mistake so let's change it to eight

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.059 
bad mistake so let's change it to eight
compile<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:31.989> run<00:02:32.879> command<00:02:34.379> move<00:02:35.379> it<00:02:35.620> very

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
compile and run command move it very

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.490 
compile and run command move it very
good<00:02:36.280> I<00:02:36.370> was<00:02:36.519> safe<00:02:36.760> there<00:02:37.139> we<00:02:38.139> could<00:02:38.349> if<00:02:38.469> we

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
good I was safe there we could if we

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.589 
good I was safe there we could if we
wanted<00:02:38.790> make<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:40.030> so<00:02:40.269> that<00:02:40.389> we<00:02:40.510> actually

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
wanted make it so that we actually

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.030 
wanted make it so that we actually
change<00:02:41.139> it<00:02:41.409> to<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:42.989> location<00:02:43.989> of<00:02:44.049> slc<00:02:44.560> just<00:02:44.919> by

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
change it to the location of slc just by

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.839 
change it to the location of slc just by
going<00:02:45.219> use<00:02:45.849> alok<00:02:46.780> lock<00:02:47.349> equals<00:02:48.099> slc<00:02:48.519> dat<00:02:48.700> what

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
going use alok lock equals slc dat what

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.699 
going use alok lock equals slc dat what
and<00:02:49.090> therefore<00:02:49.569> compile<00:02:49.959> and<00:02:50.139> run<00:02:50.169> that<00:02:50.439> I

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
and therefore compile and run that I

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.360 
and therefore compile and run that I
talk<00:02:51.489> to<00:02:51.669> him<00:02:51.760> I'll<00:02:52.659> actually<00:02:52.889> move<00:02:53.889> on<00:02:54.069> to<00:02:54.189> top

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
talk to him I'll actually move on to top

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.129 
talk to him I'll actually move on to top
of<00:02:54.519> him<00:02:54.699> and<00:02:54.879> if<00:02:55.299> it<00:02:55.389> was<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.540> bigger<00:02:55.750> distance

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
of him and if it was a bigger distance

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:59.759 
of him and if it was a bigger distance
i'd<00:02:56.290> move<00:02:56.500> directly<00:02:57.250> on<00:02:57.489> top<00:02:57.699> of<00:02:57.879> him<00:02:58.769> so

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
i'd move directly on top of him so

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.640 
i'd move directly on top of him so
that's<00:02:59.980> how<00:03:00.069> you<00:03:00.250> can<00:03:00.459> really<00:03:00.639> do<00:03:01.439> telly<00:03:02.439> party

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
that's how you can really do telly party

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.189 
that's how you can really do telly party
now<00:03:03.250> different<00:03:03.849> z-axis<00:03:04.359> is<00:03:04.389> dead<00:03:04.810> easy<00:03:04.840> all

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:05.199 
now different z-axis is dead easy all

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:06.990 
now different z-axis is dead easy all
you<00:03:05.230> do<00:03:05.469> is<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:05.769> use<00:03:06.129> the<00:03:06.280> locate<00:03:06.669> and<00:03:06.879> then

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
you do is you use the locate and then

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.580 
you do is you use the locate and then
you<00:03:07.299> change<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.659> last<00:03:07.840> variable<00:03:08.199> which<00:03:08.560> is

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
you change the last variable which is

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.069 
you change the last variable which is
the<00:03:08.799> z<00:03:08.949> axis<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.400> a<00:03:09.459> different<00:03:09.819> data<00:03:10.389> this<00:03:10.629> is<00:03:10.959> a

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
the z axis to a different data this is a

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.709 
the z axis to a different data this is a
second<00:03:11.620> z<00:03:11.739> axes<00:03:12.099> so<00:03:12.669> I<00:03:12.699> talking<00:03:13.239> to<00:03:13.329> two<00:03:13.510> and

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:13.719 
second z axes so I talking to two and

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:15.270 
second z axes so I talking to two and
I'm<00:03:13.870> on<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.049> second<00:03:14.379> z<00:03:14.469> axes<00:03:14.829> and<00:03:15.010> it's<00:03:15.129> as

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
I'm on the second z axes and it's as

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.879 
I'm on the second z axes and it's as
simple<00:03:15.459> as<00:03:15.790> that<00:03:15.870> so<00:03:16.870> that's<00:03:17.019> really<00:03:17.260> how<00:03:17.650> easy

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
simple as that so that's really how easy

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.219 
simple as that so that's really how easy
is<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:18.250> tell<00:03:18.579> apart<00:03:18.699> between<00:03:19.060> different<00:03:19.689> z

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:20.229 
is to tell apart between different z

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:22.979 
is to tell apart between different z
axes<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:20.889> different<00:03:21.220> locations<00:03:21.879> on<00:03:22.209> a<00:03:22.870> map

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
axes and different locations on a map

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.239 
axes and different locations on a map
and<00:03:23.919> there's<00:03:24.340> nothing<00:03:24.430> really<00:03:24.759> more<00:03:24.939> to<00:03:25.120> it
