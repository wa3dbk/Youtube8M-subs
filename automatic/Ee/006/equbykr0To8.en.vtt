00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.880
 to make a hexagonal tile 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.920
 crocheted 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.920
 we need wool or cotton crochet hooks 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.779
 a knit tail with a pretty eye 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.050
 large enough to allow the passage of the 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.939
 wool thread scissors the crochet must 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.279
 be chosen of the same number 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.279
 reported on the yarn package 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.570
 to start we must realize a 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.870
 small noose with the thread in which it goes 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.210
 inserted the crochet hook then wrap the 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.980
 thread around the crochet hook and pull it 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.410
 through the ring made in 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.629
 priority 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.120
 we repeat the operation six times in 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.690
 way to make a chain with 6 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.690
 ring 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.070
 then we close the chain by inserting the 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.320
 first ring and passing the thread 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.320
 through the first and last ring 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.039
 we have to perform low points 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:37.310
 taking the chain and the inside 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.579
 advanced thread at the beginning we insert 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.170
 the crochet hook inside the chain 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:44.869
 we hook the thread and carry the 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.000
 outside then we wrap the thread 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.909
 around the crochet and let's pass it 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.860
 inside the two rings 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:55.390
 this is the low point we have to 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.390
 repeat it 12 times 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.899
 we insert the crochet hook in the first point 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.750
 low of the base round and execute a 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:11.000
 low point as explained earlier in the 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.489
 second low point of the base lap 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.989
 we perform two low points and continue 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.180
 until the end 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.840
 alternating a single point with one 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.840
 pair of pilots 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.210
 the second round is run as the first one 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.940
 lap but alternating two single points to 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:40.120
 a couple of points continue until 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.250
 at the end of the lap for the following laps 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.890
 we will have to continue with the low point 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.080
 increasing with each lap and single points 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.950
 that precede the couple more in the 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.010
 same point 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.440
 so for example on the third lap we will have 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.230
 three single points and a pair for everything 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.239
 the fourth round lap four singles 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.980
 that of a couple and so on for the 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.980
 number of turns you want 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.090
 in this tile is composed of 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.099
 five laps when we finish the last one 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.129
 around we cut the thread and we do it 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:20.670
 pass in the last chain pulling in 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:22.889
 so as to form a knot we leave the thread 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:27.180
 quite long because it will then serve for 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:38.969
 join the tiles to the others here is the 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:40.769
 tile finished at this point 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:43.109
 whatever the project we need 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.049
 to realize it is necessary to unite the 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:48.719
 tiles we insert the thread into the lake from 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.239
 knit we have the reverse tiles 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:53.489
 backhand and sew doing 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.010
 pass the thread through more rings 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.379
 external 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.599
 if you want the seam to be seen 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.599
 you will have to lay the tiles straight 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:05.240
 against straight at the end of the year we give 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:09.850
 without worrying about the film bank 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.850
 will be resumed and striking seams 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.060
 then 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.360
 this is a baby blanket 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.120
 made by alternating colors in each 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.490
 single tile once finished 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.560
 the union of the parts or with returned the 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.870
 all with a low point border 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.430
 note that for the shape of the tiles 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:02.200
 also the bordeaux is shaped 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.150
 this is another blanket this time 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.070
 without on board with the tile 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.320
 hexagonal can also be made 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.320
 of bags or sacred items 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.000
 keep in mind that crochet works 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.110
 is a bit more rigid than the 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.110
 knitting made with knitting needles
