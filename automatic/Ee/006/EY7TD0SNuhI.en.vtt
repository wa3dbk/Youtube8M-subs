now<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:57.960> already<00:01:58.439> all<00:01:58.679> we<00:01:58.799> have<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.100> do<00:01:59.250> is

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
now this is already all we have to do is

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.459 
now this is already all we have to do is
assemble<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.240> dish<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.689> it's<00:02:00.899> very<00:02:01.200> very

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
simple so we're going to pop our

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.320

ingredients<00:02:03.960> into<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.890> two<00:02:05.429> liter<00:02:05.700> casserole

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
ingredients into a two liter casserole

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.460 
ingredients into a two liter casserole
to<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.599> we're<00:02:10.050> going<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.500> add<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:11.190> can<00:02:11.879> of

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
to that we're going to add a can of

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.350 
to that we're going to add a can of
tomatoes<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:13.860> we're<00:02:14.340> not<00:02:14.489> draining<00:02:14.879> it<00:02:15.120> all

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
tomatoes and we're not draining it all

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.990 
tomatoes and we're not draining it all
the<00:02:15.750> juice<00:02:15.989> goes<00:02:16.349> in<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.610> reason<00:02:17.970> for

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
the juice goes in and the reason for

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.330 
the juice goes in and the reason for
that<00:02:18.209> is<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.780> we<00:02:19.290> have<00:02:19.500> passed<00:02:19.799> it<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.160> cook

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
that is that we have passed it to cook

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.320 
that is that we have passed it to cook
in<00:02:20.519> here<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:20.910> that<00:02:21.060> extra<00:02:21.480> liquid<00:02:21.959> is<00:02:22.500> needed

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
in here so that extra liquid is needed

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.750 
in here so that extra liquid is needed
so<00:02:24.330> mix<00:02:24.599> that<00:02:24.840> in<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:26.129> that<00:02:26.310> we're<00:02:26.549> going

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760
