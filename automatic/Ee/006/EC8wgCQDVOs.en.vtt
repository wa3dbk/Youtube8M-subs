just introducing you to this trick and

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.440 
just introducing you to this trick and
using<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:13.950> quite<00:00:14.070> an<00:00:14.309> easy<00:00:14.490> example<00:00:14.700> so<00:00:15.330> the

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
using it quite an easy example so the

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.880 
using it quite an easy example so the
links<00:00:15.839> right<00:00:16.020> here<00:00:16.260> if<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.440> haven't<00:00:16.710> seen

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
that one in this one we're going to

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.689 
that one in this one we're going to
start<00:00:18.869> dealing<00:00:19.500> with<00:00:19.859> things<00:00:20.520> like

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
start dealing with things like

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.070 
start dealing with things like
remainders<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.390> how<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.570> deal<00:00:21.840> with<00:00:21.869> those

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
remainders and how you deal with those

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.150 
remainders and how you deal with those
in<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.380> next<00:00:22.619> one<00:00:22.740> we're<00:00:22.830> going<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:22.980> actually

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
in the next one we're going to actually

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.820 
in the next one we're going to actually
go<00:00:23.400> into<00:00:23.550> bigger<00:00:23.850> numbers<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:24.750> here<00:00:25.260> we<00:00:25.380> go<00:00:25.560> I

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
go into bigger numbers so here we go I

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.560 
go into bigger numbers so here we go I
recommend<00:00:26.609> if<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:26.820> haven't<00:00:27.000> seen<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.359> first

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
recommend if you haven't seen that first

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.060 
recommend if you haven't seen that first
video<00:00:27.720> go<00:00:28.170> back<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.529> have<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.680> look<00:00:28.859> but<00:00:29.010> it

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
video go back and have a look but it

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.099 
video go back and have a look but it
might<00:00:29.279> be<00:00:29.429> hard<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.609> pick<00:00:29.880> up<00:00:30.060> off<00:00:30.210> what<00:00:30.960> we're

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
might be hard to pick up off what we're

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.790 
might be hard to pick up off what we're
doing<00:00:31.349> right<00:00:31.560> now

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
doing right now

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.290 
doing right now
so<00:00:32.160> this<00:00:32.340> one's<00:00:32.520> going<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.759> end<00:00:32.940> up<00:00:33.059> with<00:00:33.239> a

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
so this one's going to end up with a

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.049 
so this one's going to end up with a
remainder<00:00:33.540> okay<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.410> say<00:00:35.399> we<00:00:35.610> get<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.820> number

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
remainder okay so say we get a number

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.590 
remainder okay so say we get a number
like<00:00:36.710> better<00:00:37.710> get<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> pen<00:00:38.219> going<00:00:38.520> here<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.030> we

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
like better get a pen going here and we

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.930 
like better get a pen going here and we
start<00:00:39.899> with<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> number<00:00:40.320> such<00:00:41.010> as<00:00:41.870> let's<00:00:42.870> say

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
start with a number such as let's say

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.639 
start with a number such as let's say
120<00:00:46.820> 1031<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.090> we<00:00:48.510> divide<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.170> number<00:00:49.230> by

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
120 1031 and we divide this number by

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.580 
120 1031 and we divide this number by
nine<00:00:50.610> okay<00:00:51.510> we<00:00:51.809> can<00:00:51.960> tell<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.260> number<00:00:52.530> is

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
nine okay we can tell this number is

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.660 
nine okay we can tell this number is
going<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.770> have<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> remainder<00:00:53.250> because

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
going to have a remainder because

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.760 
going to have a remainder because
funnily<00:00:54.510> enough<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.840> can<00:00:54.989> tell<00:00:55.199> these<00:00:55.350> digits

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
funnily enough you can tell these digits

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.500 
funnily enough you can tell these digits
here<00:00:56.100> don't<00:00:56.640> add<00:00:56.879> up<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.180> number<00:00:57.480> that's

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
here don't add up to a number that's

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.720 
here don't add up to a number that's
divisible<00:00:57.690> by<00:00:58.140> nine<00:00:58.469> okay<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.010> might<00:00:59.489> be<00:00:59.609> able

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
divisible by nine okay you might be able

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.000 
divisible by nine okay you might be able
to<00:00:59.820> notice<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.180> 1<00:01:00.329> plus<00:01:00.600> 2<00:01:00.809> plus<00:01:01.079> 1<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.320> 4<00:01:01.680> plus

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
to notice that 1 plus 2 plus 1 is 4 plus

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.500 
to notice that 1 plus 2 plus 1 is 4 plus
3<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.579> 7<00:01:04.070> plus<00:01:05.070> 1<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.400> 8<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.030> there's<00:01:06.240> actually

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
3 is 7 plus 1 is 8 so there's actually

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.030 
3 is 7 plus 1 is 8 so there's actually
going<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.750> probably<00:01:06.930> be<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> remainder<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.650> 8<00:01:07.860> I

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
going to probably be a remainder of 8 I

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.370 
going to probably be a remainder of 8 I
can<00:01:08.070> tell<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.549> right<00:01:08.610> now<00:01:09.320> okay<00:01:10.320> so

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
can tell you that right now okay so

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.830 
can tell you that right now okay so
let's<00:01:10.650> get<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.159> our<00:01:11.430> answer<00:01:11.729> going<00:01:12.270> right

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
let's get this our answer going right

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.810 
let's get this our answer going right
now<00:01:13.110> all<00:01:13.350> right<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:13.830> first<00:01:14.159> off<00:01:14.430> what<00:01:14.580> we<00:01:14.670> did

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
now all right so first off what we did

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.370 
now all right so first off what we did
is<00:01:14.970> we<00:01:15.000> put<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.420> number<00:01:15.720> down<00:01:15.869> here<00:01:15.900> this

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
is we put this number down here this

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.870 
is we put this number down here this
this<00:01:16.710> number<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.189> remember<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.729> very

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
this number is you remember the very

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.520 
this number is you remember the very
first<00:01:18.000> number<00:01:18.509> becomes<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.930> first<00:01:19.170> part<00:01:19.409> of

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
first number becomes the first part of

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.649 
first number becomes the first part of
our<00:01:19.619> answer<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.460> one<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.909> first<00:01:21.330> part

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
our answer so this one is the first part

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.050 
our answer so this one is the first part
of<00:01:21.750> our<00:01:21.840> answer<00:01:21.900> then<00:01:22.500> we<00:01:22.650> add<00:01:22.860> 2<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.880> get<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
of our answer then we add 2 to get the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.260 
of our answer then we add 2 to get the
next<00:01:24.299> part<00:01:24.509> 3<00:01:25.049> we<00:01:25.860> add<00:01:26.009> 1<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.610> get<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.030> next

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
next part 3 we add 1 to get the next

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.870 
next part 3 we add 1 to get the next
part<00:01:27.450> 4<00:01:27.900> we<00:01:28.619> had<00:01:28.740> nothing<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.400> get<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.670> next

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
part 4 we had nothing to get the next

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.420 
part 4 we had nothing to get the next
part<00:01:30.150> which<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.390> also<00:01:30.840> 4<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.380> then<00:01:31.680> we<00:01:31.770> add<00:01:31.950> 3

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
part which is also 4 and then we add 3

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.819 
part which is also 4 and then we add 3
to<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.939> next<00:01:33.210> part<00:01:33.420> which<00:01:33.869> gives<00:01:34.350> us<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.590> next

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
to the next part which gives us the next

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.200 
to the next part which gives us the next
part<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.070> our<00:01:35.220> answer<00:01:35.369> which<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.610> 7<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.119> this

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
part of our answer which is 7 and this

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.569 
part of our answer which is 7 and this
very<00:01:36.720> last<00:01:37.470> number<00:01:37.860> we<00:01:38.100> do<00:01:38.250> something

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
very last number we do something

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.730 
very last number we do something
different<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:39.509> add<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.960> but<00:01:40.439> we<00:01:40.560> don't

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
different we add it but we don't

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.080 
different we add it but we don't
actually<00:01:40.860> add<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.460> answer<00:01:41.729> here<00:01:41.939> we're

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
actually add it to the answer here we're

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.760 
actually add it to the answer here we're
going<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.240> then<00:01:42.720> add<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.380> then<00:01:43.470> divide<00:01:43.740> it

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
going to then add it and then divide it

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.980 
going to then add it and then divide it
by<00:01:43.890> 9<00:01:44.070> I'll<00:01:44.250> show<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.520> what<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.729> mean<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.149> 7<00:01:45.810> plus

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
by 9 I'll show you what I mean so 7 plus

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.420 
by 9 I'll show you what I mean so 7 plus
1<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.500> 8<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:47.700> we<00:01:47.759> divide<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.540> number<00:01:48.600> by<00:01:48.990> 9<00:01:49.979> 8

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
1 is 8 and we divide this number by 9 8

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.760 
1 is 8 and we divide this number by 9 8
divided<00:01:51.090> by<00:01:51.119> 9<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.479> can't<00:01:51.869> do<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.649> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
divided by 9 you can't do so the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.940 
divided by 9 you can't do so the
remainder<00:01:53.329> becomes<00:01:54.329> an<00:01:54.600> 8<00:01:55.200> we'll<00:01:55.680> put<00:01:55.860> that

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
remainder becomes an 8 we'll put that

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.840 
remainder becomes an 8 we'll put that
down<00:01:56.159> as<00:01:56.369> remainder<00:01:56.909> 8<00:01:57.619> ok<00:01:58.619> hey<00:01:59.549> that's<00:01:59.729> pretty

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
down as remainder 8 ok hey that's pretty

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.069 
down as remainder 8 ok hey that's pretty
easy<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.240> told<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.750> was<00:02:00.869> going<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.020> be

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
easy I told you was going to be

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.609 
easy I told you was going to be
remainder<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.649> 8<00:02:01.829> as<00:02:01.979> well<00:02:02.130> all<00:02:02.460> right

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
remainder of 8 as well all right

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.719 
remainder of 8 as well all right
hopefully<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.860> do<00:02:04.950> really<00:02:05.189> really<00:02:05.340> well<00:02:05.490> with

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
hopefully you do really really well with

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.819 
hopefully you do really really well with
that<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.689> next<00:02:06.719> video<00:02:07.170> we're<00:02:07.500> going<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.680> go

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
that in the next video we're going to go

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.619 
that in the next video we're going to go
into<00:02:07.950> some<00:02:08.160> some<00:02:08.700> bigger<00:02:08.970> numbers<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.509> know

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
into some some bigger numbers you know

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.690 
into some some bigger numbers you know
some<00:02:09.869> some<00:02:10.200> much<00:02:10.890> bigger<00:02:11.069> numbers<00:02:11.459> where<00:02:11.610> you

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
some some much bigger numbers where you

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.840 
some some much bigger numbers where you
are<00:02:11.849> going<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.060> have<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.239> carry<00:02:12.510> the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
are going to have to carry the

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.910 
are going to have to carry the
little<00:02:13.090> thing<00:02:13.240> across<00:02:13.600> okay<00:02:13.990> it's<00:02:14.650> not<00:02:14.770> always

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
little thing across okay it's not always

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.920 
little thing across okay it's not always
as<00:02:15.190> easy<00:02:15.340> as<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:16.150> lot<00:02:16.360> of<00:02:16.390> people<00:02:16.690> put<00:02:16.840> the

as easy as a lot of people put the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.480 
as easy as a lot of people put the
examples<00:02:17.350> always<00:02:17.680> on<00:02:17.830> YouTube<00:02:18.220> where<00:02:18.370> they're

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
examples always on YouTube where they're

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.400 
examples always on YouTube where they're
always<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:19.000> ones<00:02:19.030> which<00:02:19.420> work<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:20.140> easily

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410
