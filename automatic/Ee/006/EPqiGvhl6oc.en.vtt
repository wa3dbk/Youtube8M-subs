00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
go I have a system in there so most of

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.520 
go I have a system in there so most of
all<00:01:35.859> heavy<00:01:36.420> not<00:01:37.420> they<00:01:37.600> had<00:01:37.750> to<00:01:37.899> go<00:01:38.609> and<00:01:39.609> here's

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
all heavy not they had to go and here's

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.039 
all heavy not they had to go and here's
one<00:01:41.530> side<00:01:41.829> it<00:01:42.130> has<00:01:42.250> a<00:01:42.759> lot<00:01:43.119> of<00:01:43.149> ventilation

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
one side it has a lot of ventilation

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:51.179 
one side it has a lot of ventilation
here<00:01:44.409> and<00:01:44.619> then<00:01:48.929> there's<00:01:49.929> other<00:01:50.200> side<00:01:50.500> it

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
here and then there's other side it

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:56.010 
here and then there's other side it
comes<00:01:51.759> with<00:01:51.880> a<00:01:51.969> 250<00:01:52.810> watt<00:01:54.659> small<00:01:55.659> form-factor

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
comes with a 250 watt small form-factor

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:08.150 
power supply and has one expansion slot
right<00:02:00.969> here

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.530 

and<00:02:08.430> then<00:02:09.740> another<00:02:10.740> side<00:02:11.460> has<00:02:11.820> good

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
and then another side has good

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.990 
and then another side has good
ventilation<00:02:13.250> jumped<00:02:14.250> in<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.460> case<00:02:14.610> I'll

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.850 

screwed<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.150> may<00:02:18.390> be<00:02:18.450> easier<00:02:18.690> for<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.140> video

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:29.570 

at<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.070> inside<00:02:23.450> looks<00:02:24.450> really<00:02:24.660> nice<00:02:25.250> I<00:02:28.580> said

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
at the inside looks really nice I said

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.400 
at the inside looks really nice I said
earlier<00:02:29.730> take<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.300> mini<00:02:30.480> ITX<00:02:30.750> motherboard

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
earlier take the mini ITX motherboard

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:40.040 
earlier take the mini ITX motherboard
and<00:02:35.150> share<00:02:36.150> whitens<00:02:36.480> guys<00:02:37.790> so<00:02:38.790> here's<00:02:39.270> one<00:02:39.720> and

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
and share whitens guys so here's one and

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.910 
and share whitens guys so here's one and
two<00:02:40.470> point<00:02:40.710> five<00:02:40.800> millimeter<00:02:42.530> bay<00:02:43.530> for<00:02:43.770> the

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
two point five millimeter bay for the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.470 
two point five millimeter bay for the
hard<00:02:44.130> drive<00:02:44.570> internal<00:02:45.570> hon<00:02:45.780> wrap<00:02:46.020> and<00:02:46.410> then

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
hard drive internal hon wrap and then

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.170 
hard drive internal hon wrap and then
that<00:02:48.480> there's<00:02:48.870> another<00:02:49.370> simplest<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.670> so<00:02:51.000> let

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
that there's another simplest and so let

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:58.090 
that there's another simplest and so let
me<00:02:51.270> show<00:02:51.510> you<00:02:52.910> move<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.030> all<00:02:54.150> right<00:02:54.240> here<00:02:56.450> we<00:02:57.450> go

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
me show you move it all right here we go

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.700 
me show you move it all right here we go
so<00:02:59.100> there's<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.520> little<00:03:00.260> spot<00:03:01.260> right<00:03:01.320> here<00:03:01.560> for

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
so there's a little spot right here for

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:08.630 
so there's a little spot right here for
another<00:03:03.680> full<00:03:04.680> size<00:03:04.920> 2.5<00:03:05.760> HR<00:03:06.180> drive<00:03:07.520> but<00:03:08.520> the

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
another full size 2.5 HR drive but the

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.890 
another full size 2.5 HR drive but the
good<00:03:08.820> thing<00:03:08.850> about<00:03:09.030> this<00:03:11.209> about<00:03:12.209> this<00:03:12.390> case<00:03:12.870> is

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
good thing about this about this case is

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.590 
good thing about this about this case is
it's<00:03:13.260> really<00:03:13.530> small<00:03:14.480> extremist<00:03:15.480> malish<00:03:15.870> and

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
it's really small extremist malish and
