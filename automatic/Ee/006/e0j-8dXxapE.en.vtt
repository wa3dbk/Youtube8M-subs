hello<00:00:00.870> my<00:00:01.199> name<00:00:01.380> is<00:00:01.500> Laurel<00:00:01.829> melon<00:00:02.190> and

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
hello my name is Laurel melon and

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.030 
hello my name is Laurel melon and
welcome<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:03.090> emotional<00:00:03.629> brain<00:00:03.840> training<00:00:04.170> this

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
welcome to emotional brain training this

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.670 
welcome to emotional brain training this
method<00:00:05.460> offers<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:06.029> scientific<00:00:06.839> solution<00:00:07.170> to

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
method offers a scientific solution to

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.430 
method offers a scientific solution to
stress<00:00:08.040> because<00:00:08.820> what<00:00:09.210> it<00:00:09.360> does<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:09.780> train<00:00:10.200> the

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
stress because what it does is train the

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.089 
stress because what it does is train the
brain<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:11.309> process<00:00:11.490> stress<00:00:12.150> optimally<00:00:13.099> the

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
brain to process stress optimally the

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.070 
brain to process stress optimally the
rationale<00:00:14.639> for<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.269> most<00:00:15.540> problems

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
rationale for that is that most problems

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.470 
rationale for that is that most problems
are<00:00:16.289> due<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.010> brain<00:00:17.310> being<00:00:17.820> stuck<00:00:18.240> in

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
are due to the brain being stuck in

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.800 
are due to the brain being stuck in
stress<00:00:19.699> in<00:00:20.699> order<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.150> figure<00:00:21.300> out<00:00:21.539> how<00:00:21.779> to

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
stress in order to figure out how to

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.650 
stress in order to figure out how to
process<00:00:22.199> stress<00:00:22.980> optimally<00:00:23.670> we<00:00:24.150> have<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.480> look

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
process stress optimally we have to look

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.410 
process stress optimally we have to look
at<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.869> functioning<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.680> brain<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:26.640> turns

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
at the functioning of the brain it turns

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.080 
at the functioning of the brain it turns
out<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.930> as<00:00:28.080> stress<00:00:28.710> increases<00:00:29.429> the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
out that it as stress increases the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.170 
out that it as stress increases the
dominant<00:00:30.689> brain<00:00:31.320> area<00:00:31.740> changes<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.969> area

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
dominant brain area changes the area

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.440 
dominant brain area changes the area

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
that's in charge as a consequence we

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.950 
that's in charge as a consequence we
need<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.630> different<00:00:37.110> process<00:00:37.739> for<00:00:38.730> each

assign<00:00:44.760> numbers<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.360> these<00:00:45.809> brain<00:00:46.320> States<00:00:46.800> and

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
assign numbers to these brain States and

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.850 
assign numbers to these brain States and
there<00:00:47.430> are<00:00:47.550> five<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.820> them<00:00:48.320> brain<00:00:49.320> state<00:00:49.590> one

from that particular level of stress
back<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> state<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.549> well-being<00:01:33.470> so<00:01:34.470> most<00:01:34.920> of

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
back to a state of well-being so most of

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.280 
back to a state of well-being so most of
us<00:01:35.189> begin<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.820> our<00:01:35.970> brain<00:01:36.270> has<00:01:36.750> gotten<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
us begin and our brain has gotten in the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.980 
us begin and our brain has gotten in the
habit<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.710> being<00:01:38.310> in<00:01:38.549> stress<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.750> brain

habit of being in stress the brain

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.859 
habit of being in stress the brain
determines<00:01:40.350> what<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.369> normal<00:01:42.000> which<00:01:42.420> might<00:01:42.689> be

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
determines what is normal which might be

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.289 
determines what is normal which might be
being<00:01:43.140> stressed<00:01:43.530> out<00:01:43.770> or<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.549> little<00:01:44.939> stressed

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
being stressed out or a little stressed

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.840 
being stressed out or a little stressed
and<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:46.200> begins<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.649> defend<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.520> creates

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
and it begins to defend that it creates

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.270 
and it begins to defend that it creates
a<00:01:47.970> self<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.509> set<00:01:48.810> point<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.100> brain

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
a self a set point so that the brain

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.670 
a self a set point so that the brain
likes<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.820> stay<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.329> state<00:01:51.680> the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
likes to stay in that state the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.429 
likes to stay in that state the
emotional<00:01:53.189> brain<00:01:53.299> only<00:01:54.299> changes<00:01:55.290> with

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
emotional brain only changes with

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.730 
emotional brain only changes with
repeated<00:01:56.009> experience<00:01:56.700> not<00:01:57.000> by<00:01:57.180> insight<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.619> it

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
repeated experience not by insight so it

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.700 
repeated experience not by insight so it
needs<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.100> experience<00:01:59.899> moments<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:01.079> feeling

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
needs to experience moments of feeling

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.819 
needs to experience moments of feeling
good<00:02:02.070> or<00:02:02.340> great<00:02:02.750> to<00:02:03.750> begin<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.229> change<00:02:04.560> that

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
good or great to begin to change that

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.609 
good or great to begin to change that
setpoint<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:06.329> most<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.719> us<00:02:06.840> start<00:02:07.140> when<00:02:07.409> we're

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
setpoint so most of us start when we're

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.589 
setpoint so most of us start when we're
wired<00:02:07.950> somewhere<00:02:08.520> between<00:02:08.640> three<00:02:09.149> four<00:02:09.420> or

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
wired somewhere between three four or

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.990 
wired somewhere between three four or
five<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:10.590> that's<00:02:11.400> our<00:02:11.580> norm<00:02:11.879> and

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
five and that's our norm and

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.300 
five and that's our norm and
we<00:02:13.090> just<00:02:13.300> start<00:02:13.570> and<00:02:13.900> during<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:14.830> day<00:02:14.980> we

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
we just start and during the day we

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.820 
we just start and during the day we
check<00:02:15.580> in<00:02:15.760> figure<00:02:16.540> out<00:02:16.690> your<00:02:16.870> number<00:02:17.020> and<00:02:17.680> you

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
check in figure out your number and you

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.040 
check in figure out your number and you
use<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.250> tool<00:02:18.460> the<00:02:19.120> corresponds<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.870> that

becomes more favorable how do you
retrain<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.190> emotional<00:02:51.850> brain<00:02:52.060> well<00:02:52.840> we<00:02:52.959> know
