00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.840
 and in parallel it was investing money 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.510
 in several companies that were going 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.309
 interesting one of those that invest is 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.640
 I explain it because it has a lot of interest and 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.369
 has a lot to do with the twitterers and 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.710
 with the geeks that we are from the world of 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.830
 This investing in a company 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.530
 had gogo dot com is a company of 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.270
 sale of show tickets basically in 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.520
 london second-hand 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.100
 the 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.840
 the american government discovered does 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.060
 a few years that the sale of tickets 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.040
 around stadiums or theaters or 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.000
 cinema is second-hand was very high 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.130
 when the demand exceeded the supply and 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.020
 then in these transactions there was no 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.870
 a tax payment for the margin neither 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.410
 there was a iva payment with which it was a 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.100
 good government fraud this to usa 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.040
 immediately regulated it as it regulates everything and 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.200
 got a whopping 1500 million 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.780
 of dollars just for having regulated this 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.000
 and put it basically via websites that was 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.250
 how this was sold with companies like 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.160
 for example ticketmaster which is the one 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.170
 more to know these you viagogo 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.420
 puntocom is a direct competition from 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.280
 ticketmaster good but there were gogÃ³s 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.979
 basically works in london the 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.790
 we ride with some American friends and 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.370
 english 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.670
 and I am the only Latino who left me 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.590
 get in 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.900
 we enter this company that is very 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.480
 all right 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.560
 and I'll tell you the anecdote that now in 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.570
 the concerts of michael jackson 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.760
 we were one of the companies that 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:48.810
 I was selling more of these tickets online 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:52.500
 what happened michael jackson died and 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.690
 then I thought surely, the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.720
 company will have gone bankrupt because these 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.970
 tickets purchases you pay you sell them 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.600
 and good that was what was our 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.220
 surprise is that people did not return the 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.190
 ticket wanted to keep the ticket as 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.500
 I remember with which these things that 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.480
 neither in a business plan would you put in 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.750
 your life that are emotional things that 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.100
 they are not rational things because he made 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.020
 the company will not go bankrupt 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.550
 on the contrary that it will win all the money 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.510
 from the entrance that people did not want to 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.510
 it returned to be money
