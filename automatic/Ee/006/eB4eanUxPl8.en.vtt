pretty<00:02:24.420> much<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.540> same<00:02:24.870> but<00:02:25.110> so<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.860> just

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
pretty much the same but so I just

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.740 
pretty much the same but so I just
prefer<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.459> pattern<00:02:26.849> one<00:02:27.060> if<00:02:27.269> it<00:02:27.390> was<00:02:27.510> some

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
prefer the pattern one if it was some

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.900 
prefer the pattern one if it was some
more<00:02:28.410> comfortable<00:02:29.040> for<00:02:29.099> me<00:02:29.280> what<00:02:29.670> I'm<00:02:29.819> we
