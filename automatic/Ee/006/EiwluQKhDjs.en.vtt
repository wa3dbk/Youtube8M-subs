00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
to happen when they get closer to these

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.240 
to happen when they get closer to these
mushrooms<00:01:16.200> but<00:01:16.409> we'll<00:01:17.310> see<00:01:18.920> they're<00:01:19.920> doing

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
mushrooms but we'll see they're doing

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.030

okay<00:01:21.979> can<00:01:22.979> see<00:01:23.220> there<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.960> larger<00:01:24.960> one<00:01:25.140> folks

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
okay can see there that larger one folks

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.020 
okay can see there that larger one folks
it<00:01:26.280> yeah<00:01:27.470> well<00:01:28.470> part<00:01:28.830> theres<00:01:29.040> gotta<00:01:29.310> add<00:01:29.640> shape

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
it yeah well part theres gotta add shape

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.580 
it yeah well part theres gotta add shape
it's<00:01:30.330> like<00:01:30.509> pulling<00:01:30.810> apart<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.320> think<00:01:31.470> it's

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
it's like pulling apart I think it's

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.899 
it's like pulling apart I think it's
going<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.740> separate<00:01:32.190> the<00:01:32.340> same<00:01:32.520> way<00:01:32.700> this

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
going to separate the same way this

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.510 
going to separate the same way this
little<00:01:33.680> glue<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.860> do<00:01:34.979> if<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.250> can<00:01:35.340> see<00:01:35.490> it

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
little glue and do if you can see it

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.730 
little glue and do if you can see it
there<00:01:35.640> just<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.840> left<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.500> little

round<00:01:37.979> spot<00:01:38.310> that's<00:01:39.149> totally<00:01:39.390> separated<00:01:40.050> so

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
round spot that's totally separated so

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.770 
round spot that's totally separated so
see<00:01:42.390> what<00:01:42.509> happens<00:01:45.289> got<00:01:46.289> this<00:01:46.800> here<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:47.520> a

explosion i guess you could say of
coraline<00:06:48.640> algae<00:06:48.760> growth<00:06:49.150> if<00:06:49.960> you<00:06:50.770> look<00:06:51.130> at
