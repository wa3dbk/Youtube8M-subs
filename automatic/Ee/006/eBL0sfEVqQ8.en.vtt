00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
about some of the scalability aspects

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.200 
about some of the scalability aspects
associated<00:01:51.409> with<00:01:51.829> this<00:01:51.920> project<00:01:52.100> but<00:01:53.090> that

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
associated with this project but that

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.219 
associated with this project but that
certainly<00:01:53.450> was<00:01:53.750> one<00:01:53.899> of<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.049> more

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
was really kind of a whole lot of fun

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.520 
was really kind of a whole lot of fun
it's<00:01:59.299> really<00:01:59.390> this<00:01:59.810> camera<00:02:00.140> right<00:02:00.229> here<00:02:00.289> a

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
it's really this camera right here a

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.889 
it's really this camera right here a
will<00:02:01.009> do<00:02:01.159> streaming<00:02:01.399> video<00:02:01.820> it<00:02:02.479> actually<00:02:02.630> does

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
will do streaming video it actually does

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.920

plug into an x 10 control module it
looks<00:02:57.500> something<00:02:57.650> like<00:02:57.860> this<00:02:58.930> then<00:02:59.930> there<00:03:00.230> are

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
looks something like this then there are

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.559 
looks something like this then there are
scattered<00:03:00.950> throughout<00:03:00.980> my<00:03:01.340> house<00:03:01.579> x10

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
scattered throughout my house x10

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.600 
scattered throughout my house x10
wireless<00:03:03.049> receivers<00:03:03.620> look<00:03:04.250> something<00:03:04.579> like

wireless receivers look something like

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.300 
wireless receivers look something like
this<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:05.180> then<00:03:05.810> one<00:03:06.110> can<00:03:06.319> use<00:03:06.530> this<00:03:06.769> x10

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
this and then one can use this x10

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.030 
this and then one can use this x10
transmitter<00:03:07.879> to<00:03:08.420> send<00:03:08.780> a<00:03:08.989> signal<00:03:09.230> which<00:03:09.890> is

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
transmitter to send a signal which is

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.430 
transmitter to send a signal which is
received<00:03:10.430> by<00:03:10.549> the<00:03:10.640> wireless<00:03:11.480> receiver<00:03:11.810> which

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
received by the wireless receiver which

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.900 
received by the wireless receiver which
is<00:03:12.620> then<00:03:12.769> sent<00:03:13.040> through<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.459> house<00:03:13.610> wiring

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
is then sent through the house wiring

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.960 
is then sent through the house wiring
and<00:03:14.569> voila<00:03:15.019> we<00:03:15.260> have<00:03:15.410> Christmas<00:03:15.769> lights<00:03:15.980> on<00:03:16.160> by
