00:00:02.971 --> 00:00:05.130
 We promise everyone here, 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.180
 that these people did not die in vain. 

00:00:09.823 --> 00:00:11.763
 That this country, created by God, 

00:00:11.763 --> 00:00:14.222
 she will be born free again. 

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:18.721
 That the government of the people, elected by the people, ruling for the people, 

00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:20.712
 never disappears on Earth. 

00:00:25.468 --> 00:00:29.081
 You can't tell people to vote for the abolition of slavery, 

00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:33.549
 if we cannot promise them to negotiate peace. 

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:36.599
 Either the abolition of slavery or peace. You can't have both. 

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:39.651
 How many thousands died during your reign? 

00:00:39.651 --> 00:00:41.518
 Congress can never claim to be equal, 

00:00:41.518 --> 00:00:44.248
 which God created unequal! 

00:00:44.248 --> 00:00:46.896
 Leave the Constitution as it is! 

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:50.328
 Now we are presenting ourselves to the whole world 

00:00:50.328 --> 00:00:53.636
 and in our hands we have the dignity of mankind! 

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:56.502
 Blood was spilled to get this moment! 

00:00:56.502 --> 00:00:59.182
 Now, now, now! 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.973
 Abraham Lincoln asked us to help him 

00:01:06.973 --> 00:01:09.210
 in his quest to end slavery. 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.829
 The people have never loved anyone so much. 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:14.686
 Don't let that power get lost. 

00:01:14.686 --> 00:01:17.996
 His fight is for the United States of America. 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.357
 FILM STEVENA SPIELBERGA 

00:01:23.827 --> 00:01:25.618
 Do you think we choose when we're born, 

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:28.409
 or do we adapt to the time we live in? 

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:30.655
 I don't know how I do 

00:01:31.236 --> 00:01:32.319
 but you might. 

00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:35.017
 DANIEL DAY-LEWIS ACADEMY AWARD WINNER 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.382
 WINNER OF SALLY FIELD ACADEMY AWARDS 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:41.355
 TOMMY LEE JONES AWARD AWARD WINNER 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.384
 This will be true for coming ages, 

00:01:48.172 --> 00:01:51.707
 not only for the millions living now, 

00:01:51.707 --> 00:01:55.629
 but also for the millions that are yet to be born. 

00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:00.453
 Shouldn't we stop the bleeding? 

00:02:03.173 --> 00:02:05.595
