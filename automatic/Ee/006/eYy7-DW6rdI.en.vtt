so what is so amazing about the RBS Six
Nations<00:00:11.910> well<00:00:12.910> I<00:00:12.940> think<00:00:13.060> that<00:00:13.360> first<00:00:13.540> is

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:13.780 
Nations well I think that first is

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.859 
Nations well I think that first is
important<00:00:14.590> because<00:00:14.770> it's<00:00:15.190> the<00:00:16.119> championship

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:16.869 
important because it's the championship

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.650 
important because it's the championship
of<00:00:17.050> all<00:00:17.650> the<00:00:18.220> European<00:00:18.339> teams<00:00:18.910> we<00:00:19.390> have<00:00:19.509> been

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
of all the European teams we have been

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.890 
of all the European teams we have been
raised<00:00:19.929> watching<00:00:20.529> the<00:00:21.519> TV<00:00:21.759> and<00:00:21.939> staring<00:00:22.749> at

raised watching the TV and staring at

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.980 
raised watching the TV and staring at
the<00:00:23.470> under<00:00:24.160> Spears<00:00:24.460> so<00:00:25.150> first<00:00:25.449> it's<00:00:25.599> a<00:00:25.689> chance

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
the under Spears so first it's a chance

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.679 
the under Spears so first it's a chance
to<00:00:26.230> do<00:00:26.589> two<00:00:26.800> plates<00:00:27.099> or<00:00:27.400> there's<00:00:28.029> not<00:00:28.240> nothing

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
to do two plates or there's not nothing

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.109 
to do two plates or there's not nothing

geotag<00:00:59.680> is<00:01:00.070> you<00:01:00.640> know<00:01:00.700> is<00:01:01.000> that<00:01:01.210> something

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
geotag is you know is that something

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.450 
geotag is you know is that something
you'd<00:01:01.570> still<00:01:01.780> like<00:01:01.900> to<00:01:01.960> try<00:01:02.170> doing<00:01:02.470> yeah<00:01:03.280> which

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
you'd still like to try doing yeah which

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.190 
you'd still like to try doing yeah which
is<00:01:03.490> really<00:01:03.940> really<00:01:06.329> because<00:01:07.329> it<00:01:07.509> helps<00:01:07.780> in<00:01:07.899> in

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
is really really because it helps in in

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.130 
is really really because it helps in in
the<00:01:08.320> contacts<00:01:08.999> maybe<00:01:09.999> after<00:01:10.390> I<00:01:10.450> will<00:01:10.869> do<00:01:10.990> it

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
the contacts maybe after I will do it

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.340 
the contacts maybe after I will do it
but<00:01:11.289> I<00:01:12.070> think<00:01:12.759> it's<00:01:12.880> really<00:01:13.149> nice<00:01:13.299> port<00:01:13.600> for

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
but I think it's really nice port for

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.499 
but I think it's really nice port for
different<00:01:14.740> of<00:01:14.859> rugby<00:01:15.130> but<00:01:15.460> it's<00:01:15.819> still

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
different of rugby but it's still

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.620 
different of rugby but it's still
