00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
toothpick and then I'm gonna start here

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.030 
toothpick and then I'm gonna start here
and<00:01:42.390> then<00:01:42.720> should<00:01:42.930> make<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.079> heart<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:43.530> go

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
and then should make a heart you just go

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.359 
and then should make a heart you just go
all<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.520> way<00:01:44.549> down<00:01:44.909> like<00:01:45.439> that<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.740> that's
