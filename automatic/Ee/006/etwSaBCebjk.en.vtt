 Acer farmer than this lg guy 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.329
 # I thought there would be one 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.330
 This is 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.870
 twenty four 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:13.100
 It is exactly 23.8 inches by I have become 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:17.740
 acer's was 23 inches but 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.740
 Well it is both a non-glare 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.780
 api ps 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.340
 Though it is liquid crystal, this is a 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:31.720
 With a guy called ah ips 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:36.930
 It means that the transmissivity is higher than normal ips 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.930
 It did not look like a piece that won't hit that much 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.170
 The Tteyuu was easy to see that 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.210
 Maximum point and a 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.300
 It is less than 0.8 11 days, but 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.140
 Because one screen is a little big 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.860
 I think it's okay 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.780
 It was a difference of about 100 yen in monetary amount, but 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.710
 Huh 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.710

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:29.860
 An ordinary 21.5 years old 10 years old recent one is called wild grass 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:33.450
 Pretty sharp even in non-glare 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.450
 I I'm falling well deprives 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:44.129
 Glare screen and almost one 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:46.340
 The black sister who came at the spe center was also pretty good about the sharpness that does not change 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.340
 Ne 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.920
 I thought it was non-glare, though 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.580
 It was good with the left 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:01.940
 And here is the lg logo 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.940
 The whole venue does not look a bit at 8 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.840
 I feel like a woman 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.859

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:36.040
 It is inserted out of the audio and video signal with hdmi 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.240
 It seems like you can use the earphone here 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.980
 Here 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:45.600

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.440
 A little 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.750
 Carbon fiber 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.860
 Puffy mesh 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.860
 It has become a pattern 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:18.209
 Well it was written at a price com comment but this 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.950
 If this is a normal protective tape it does not keep peeled off to this as soon as possible 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:25.540
 Something changed 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:27.950

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.610

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.559
 Other enemy generals are also villages 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.559
 It looks like I bought a house 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.830
 You know something also can not install or install that useless 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.390
 There is no cd

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:12.639
 Income

 It is a relationship such as support Temporarily guarantee 3 years 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:20.639
 I think that I can use it with great confidence because it is a guarantee 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.639
 One is 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:27.160
 And setup universe 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.700
 It is written that an easy setup has come out 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:34.310
 It is a setup guide 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:36.470
 Nde I think just put why Ashiku saw 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.560
 It is net 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.400
 Part 2 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.260
 Four 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.620
 You're foot 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.620
 Follow 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.700
 It is a part of the real face of Taisan 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:55.510
 This is a 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:06:01.449
 peach 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:05.620
 Without conspicuous anti-ne This wound is there you'll ne hairline processing I face 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:10.990
 It is also a fingerprint rather than a guy with a shiny shiny 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:16.210
 This is to this is fairly even in the screen size of the It is good not aim 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:21.520
 I feel that the size is a little smaller 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:25.350
 If qualifications will think whether not it a certain stability than the ellipse 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:29.050
 Yes I can not say so much complaining because I am proud to be in Nagase 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:32.560
 It has such accessories 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:37.470
 And this is an ac adapter 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.470
 ac adapter and mug 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:45.849
 It looks like a power cable , so this is a d-sub cable 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:51.120
 evi's cable is only 1 dmi 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:56.100

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:58.889
 I'm honest I thought I was waiting but I still 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:02.289
 More than 21.5 

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:04.750
 It is quite big if you make a mistake 

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:08.860
 It looks horizontal 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:14.560
 It feels like I saw it, but the thickness will be around a bit 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:18.740
 It is pretty thin, but I think I can see When asked to compared this about and the finger 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:20.729
 It is whether or not there Stevenage centimeter 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:25.720
 In winter 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:29.560
 It is a frame. 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:31.820
 I I say it today heinous narrow frame 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.350
 Already say 

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.420
 barely 

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.610
 of 

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:42.400

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:46.990
 Throat This But even after all 2 centimeters less than about is I'm there or Hey Do Thickness 

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:50.360
 During Well even two suck guy of only no children around Miri 

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:54.580
 I think the image range is about the same as mine 

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:57.520
 Well, it only shows about the same 

00:07:54.580 --> 00:08:00.870
 And on Nisei using 

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.870
