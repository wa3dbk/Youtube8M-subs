game now focus and let's do this hey
shut<00:05:28.570> up

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:32.480 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.600 

the<00:05:33.480> Dragons<00:05:33.990> right<00:05:34.230> I<00:05:34.560> need<00:05:34.920> to<00:05:35.010> focus<00:05:35.220> if<00:05:35.490> we

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
the Dragons right I need to focus if we

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.420 
the Dragons right I need to focus if we
want<00:05:35.790> to<00:05:35.820> win<00:05:36.000> this<00:05:36.060> and<00:05:36.450> we<00:05:36.840> have<00:05:37.110> to<00:05:37.290> win

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.190 

so<00:05:42.430> the<00:05:42.700> great<00:05:42.970> soul<00:05:43.300> was<00:05:43.540> having<00:05:43.870> a<00:05:43.930> hard<00:05:44.140> time

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
so the great soul was having a hard time

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.050 
so the great soul was having a hard time
adjusting<00:05:44.500> to<00:05:44.920> our<00:05:44.950> new<00:05:45.040> battle<00:05:45.520> technique<00:05:45.880> I

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
adjusting to our new battle technique I

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.270 
adjusting to our new battle technique I
guess<00:05:46.420> she<00:05:46.600> isn't<00:05:46.750> so<00:05:46.990> great<00:05:47.200> after<00:05:47.470> all<00:05:47.620> is

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
guess she isn't so great after all is

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.100 
guess she isn't so great after all is
this<00:05:48.520> half-baked<00:05:49.060> attack<00:05:49.420> really<00:05:49.810> the<00:05:49.930> best

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
this half-baked attack really the best

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.290 
this half-baked attack really the best
thing<00:05:50.380> you<00:05:50.500> could<00:05:50.680> come<00:05:50.830> up<00:05:50.980> with

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
thing you could come up with

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.700 
thing you could come up with
disappointing<00:05:52.300> oh<00:05:52.450> I'm<00:05:52.720> mortified<00:05:53.140> you'd<00:05:53.530> say

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
disappointing oh I'm mortified you'd say

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.830 
disappointing oh I'm mortified you'd say
that<00:05:53.740> the<00:05:54.490> chain<00:05:54.790> duel<00:05:55.060> is<00:05:55.150> a<00:05:55.240> respected

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
that the chain duel is a respected

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.780 
that the chain duel is a respected
technique<00:05:56.260> it<00:05:56.650> levels<00:05:57.010> the<00:05:57.040> playing<00:05:57.130> field<00:05:57.640> so

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:57.790 
technique it levels the playing field so

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.220 
technique it levels the playing field so
the<00:05:57.910> shadow<00:05:58.150> will<00:05:58.360> their<00:05:58.540> skill<00:05:58.930> is<00:05:59.080> what

00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.230 
the shadow will their skill is what

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.380 
the shadow will their skill is what
counts<00:05:59.410> not<00:05:59.950> just<00:06:00.160> brute<00:06:00.340> strength<00:06:00.490> but<00:06:01.270> if

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 
counts not just brute strength but if

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:15.959 
counts not just brute strength but if
you<00:06:01.450> think<00:06:01.690> you<00:06:01.780> can't<00:06:01.990> handle<00:06:02.080> it

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:15.969 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:18.209 

the<00:06:16.449> carry-ons<00:06:16.929> chain<00:06:17.319> is<00:06:17.499> the<00:06:17.529> perfect<00:06:18.009> blame

00:06:18.209 --> 00:06:18.219 
the carry-ons chain is the perfect blame

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:21.449 
the carry-ons chain is the perfect blame
not<00:06:18.789> too<00:06:18.999> long<00:06:19.209> not<00:06:19.539> too<00:06:20.110> short<00:06:20.139> either<00:06:20.679> so<00:06:21.249> no

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:21.459 
not too long not too short either so no

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:23.219 
not too long not too short either so no
shadow<00:06:21.819> is<00:06:22.029> better<00:06:22.209> suited<00:06:22.479> to<00:06:22.689> a<00:06:22.719> chain<00:06:23.019> do

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:23.229 
shadow is better suited to a chain do

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:25.769 
shadow is better suited to a chain do
your<00:06:23.949> small<00:06:24.339> mind<00:06:24.369> won't<00:06:25.059> understand<00:06:25.689> this

00:06:25.769 --> 00:06:25.779 
your small mind won't understand this

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:27.929 
your small mind won't understand this
but<00:06:26.439> there's<00:06:26.679> a<00:06:26.739> beauty<00:06:27.219> to<00:06:27.339> decay<00:06:27.669> Leon's

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:27.939 
but there's a beauty to decay Leon's

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:30.089 
but there's a beauty to decay Leon's
efficiency<00:06:28.599> just<00:06:29.139> like<00:06:29.319> his<00:06:29.469> chain<00:06:29.769> his

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:30.099 
efficiency just like his chain his

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:31.769 
efficiency just like his chain his
technique<00:06:30.279> squanders<00:06:30.879> nothing<00:06:31.269> he<00:06:31.599> is

00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:31.779 
technique squanders nothing he is

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:33.119 
technique squanders nothing he is
perfect

strong<00:07:01.400> I<00:07:01.730> can<00:07:02.210> imagine<00:07:02.300> the<00:07:02.720> great<00:07:02.900> fight

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.170 
strong I can imagine the great fight

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:04.960 
strong I can imagine the great fight
we'd<00:07:03.380> have<00:07:03.620> trading<00:07:04.250> cool<00:07:04.400> attacks<00:07:04.730> all<00:07:04.910> day

we'd have trading cool attacks all day
long<00:07:05.300> and<00:07:05.900> I<00:07:06.440> bet<00:07:06.650> that<00:07:06.710> by<00:07:06.980> the<00:07:07.040> end<00:07:07.160> of<00:07:07.400> it

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 
long and I bet that by the end of it

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.400 
long and I bet that by the end of it
both<00:07:07.910> of<00:07:08.090> us<00:07:08.180> would<00:07:08.360> barely<00:07:08.630> be<00:07:08.780> able<00:07:08.870> to<00:07:09.170> stand

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:09.410 
both of us would barely be able to stand

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.380 
both of us would barely be able to stand
up<00:07:09.680> it<00:07:09.980> would<00:07:10.220> be<00:07:10.370> the<00:07:10.400> battle<00:07:10.940> of<00:07:11.030> the<00:07:11.180> century
