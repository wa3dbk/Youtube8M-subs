00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 still in this world of sportsmanship see 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.880
 the test that sheila singing did with the new 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.019
 audi r8 v10 plus and know where the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.019
 racetrack interlagos 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:34.900
 is already in brazil super sportive audi r8 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.750
 coupe v10 plus best known as car 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.270
 iron man is this the same icon 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.180
 of shane black's movie arrives in the version 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.269
 push more dynamic and more powerful than 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.000
 his brother is eight babies thanks to 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:52.199
 several improvements including a new 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.690
 tronic seven-speed gearbox 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.449
 the new compact transmission of double 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.239
 clutch has the function of control of 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:05.950
 exit that offers a great attraction in the 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:09.479
 engine start 1.2 tfsi of 10 valves 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:13.360
 which develops 550 horsepower 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:17.380
 this torpedo on wheels accelerates from 0 to 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:21.820
 100 kilometers per hour in only 3.5 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.830
 seconds and has a maximum speed of 317 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.560
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.789
 so to test it the best place is 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.979
 an autodrome 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:31.509
 and that's why audi took us to 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.700
 interlagos 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.729
 we are on interlagos to feel and 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.440
 test in practice and safely 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:44.220
 as it is a new engine plus of the r8 v10 of 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.220
 550 horsepower 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:07.909
 the proposal of the German automaker were 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.180
 acceleration exercises from 0 to 100 in 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:14.000
 a distance of 500 meters insulated and 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:18.050
 braking at last a car that accelerates well 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.300
 should also be efficient on the 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.580
 sensation of accelerating and braking this 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.090
 super-sport that was really 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.530
 incredible testament to its total comfort and 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.620
 safety 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.519
 You and we always talk about power. 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.830
 zero so launch control is control of 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:40.640
 These things all started a car that 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.890
 was born for the race even though it is the r8 and 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.080
 which was made a version for the street with 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.510
 comfort and luxury needed to be 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.730
 and we're talking about these 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.280
 numbers and a lot of people have not yet 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.380
 experiences of what this number is like 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.620
 so the idea was like we already see 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.330
 doing since 2010 show you the 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.120
 What is it that the car has again which ones are 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:06.079
 the differences and allow you 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.480
 pass these dynamic tests and walk 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:12.290
 or accelerate from 0 to 100 kilometers per 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:15.200
 time in the shortest possible time to walk from 0 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.739
 at 200 kilometers per hour something like that 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.570
 is the ninth best time possible to brake 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.700
 100 to zero kilometers per hour 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.250
 making the greatest force of fred is 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.920
 impossible in the 30 meter car I 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.420
 It took me to brake at 100 a purple hour. 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.850
 little space 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.400
 so the car really has the safety 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.440
 how much is spoken abroad 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.160
 the changes were in detail that 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.370
 guarantee more style to the sport between 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.299
 the door sills and the cover of the 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.819
 carbon fiber rearview mirror 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:53.060
 decorative friezes bright lighting 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:56.000
 in the engine compartment and leaves the blade 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.160
 new carbon fiber headlights 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.710
 led series 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.130
 Illustrators includes an innovative 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:05.680
 dynamic flashing system that shows the 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.300
 indication of change of address by 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.790
 middle of a sequence of dots 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.160
 bright inside 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.860
 the supersport became even more 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.130
 refined with fiber 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.920
 carbon and aluminum details and ceiling 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.060
 molded in leather with regard to the 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.240
 equipment 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.790
 the list is quite extensive anyway not 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.620
 could be different for a car from 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.620
 more than half a million reais
