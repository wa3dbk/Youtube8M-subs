00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
you think the design process of an

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.499 
you think the design process of an
interactive<00:00:13.170> building<00:00:14.009> or<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.250> publicly<00:00:15.120> very

you could say that one of the things
that<00:00:24.740> what<00:00:25.740> one<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.369> things<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:27.180> we<00:00:28.369> sort

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
that what one of the things that we sort

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.820

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
wants to be seen and not just sit behind

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.080 
wants to be seen and not just sit behind
his<00:01:25.020> clothes<00:01:25.320> walls<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:26.400> he<00:01:26.549> wanted<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.850> be<00:01:27.060> a

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
his clothes walls so he wanted to be a

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.780 
his clothes walls so he wanted to be a
part<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.720> public<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.350> there<00:01:29.070> he<00:01:29.549> wanted

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
part of the public and there he wanted

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.240 
part of the public and there he wanted
to<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:30.090> his<00:01:30.119> dinner<00:01:30.570> or<00:01:30.960> his<00:01:31.200> lunch<00:01:31.530> together

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
to have his dinner or his lunch together

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.690 
to have his dinner or his lunch together
with<00:01:32.700> his<00:01:32.909> citizens<00:01:33.420> at<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.229> ground<00:01:34.470> floor<00:01:34.700> so

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
with his citizens at the ground floor so

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.999 
with his citizens at the ground floor so
I<00:01:35.729> think<00:01:35.850> it's<00:01:36.090> like<00:01:36.509> maybe<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.320> more<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.799> a

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
I think it's like maybe it's more of a

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.330 
I think it's like maybe it's more of a
change<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.729> sort<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.680> traditional<00:01:40.680> sense<00:01:41.100> of

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
change in sort of a traditional sense of

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.289 
change in sort of a traditional sense of
what<00:01:41.579> we<00:01:41.729> know<00:01:41.909> as<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.380> public<00:01:43.380> or<00:01:43.979> a

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
what we know as a public or a

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:50.190 
what we know as a public or a
governmental<00:01:45.299> building

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.780 

what<00:01:51.200> do<00:01:51.320> you<00:01:51.380> think<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.800> impact<00:01:52.250> of<00:01:52.400> this<00:01:52.580> new

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
what do you think the impact of this new

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.070 
what do you think the impact of this new
building<00:01:53.240> will<00:01:53.270> have<00:01:53.600> on<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.960> city<00:01:55.060> I<00:01:56.080> think

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
building will have on the city I think

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.250 
building will have on the city I think
we<00:01:57.230> we<00:01:57.800> hope<00:01:58.070> very<00:01:58.100> much<00:01:58.430> that<00:01:58.610> this<00:01:59.260> building

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
we we hope very much that this building

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.240 
we we hope very much that this building
will<00:02:00.590> sort<00:02:00.950> of<00:02:01.040> become<00:02:01.400> this<00:02:02.260> attractor<00:02:03.260> or

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.570 
will sort of become this attractor or
this<00:02:06.010> instigator<00:02:07.010> to<00:02:07.490> to<00:02:08.090> sort<00:02:08.480> of<00:02:08.630> a<00:02:09.580> the

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
this instigator to to sort of a the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.340 
this instigator to to sort of a the
neighborhood<00:02:11.030> itself<00:02:11.360> at<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.660> moment<00:02:12.050> it's<00:02:12.170> a

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
neighborhood itself at the moment it's a

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.260

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.890 
of the areas around is still like very
in<00:02:21.440> very<00:02:21.890> poor<00:02:22.130> conditions<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:23.270> we<00:02:23.720> hope

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
in very poor conditions and and we hope

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.750 
in very poor conditions and and we hope
that<00:02:23.930> that<00:02:24.590> that<00:02:24.950> building<00:02:25.370> this<00:02:25.490> building

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
that that that building this building

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.600 
that that that building this building
would<00:02:26.570> would<00:02:27.260> have<00:02:27.470> an<00:02:27.620> effect<00:02:27.770> on<00:02:28.130> a<00:02:28.280> lot<00:02:28.460> of

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
would would have an effect on a lot of

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.970 
would would have an effect on a lot of
the<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:29.510> neighboring<00:02:29.960> buildings<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.770> and

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
the the neighboring buildings and and

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.700 
the the neighboring buildings and and
raised<00:02:31.460> the<00:02:32.090> whole<00:02:32.300> quality<00:02:32.840> level<00:02:33.200> of<00:02:33.410> the

raised the whole quality level of the

raised the whole quality level of the
