00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
80s for your highs tomorrow we're

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.689 
80s for your highs tomorrow we're
looking<00:00:25.140> live<00:00:25.320> outside<00:00:25.529> our<00:00:25.980> Mount<00:00:26.490> Wilson

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
looking live outside our Mount Wilson

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.089 
looking live outside our Mount Wilson
camera<00:00:27.449> we<00:00:27.570> do<00:00:27.720> have<00:00:27.930> some<00:00:28.080> clouds<00:00:28.349> rolling<00:00:28.980> in

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
camera we do have some clouds rolling in

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.160 
camera we do have some clouds rolling in
mainly<00:00:29.519> along<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.029> coast<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.689> low<00:00:30.869> clouds

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
mainly along the coast of the low clouds

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.020 
mainly along the coast of the low clouds
and<00:00:31.320> fog<00:00:31.529> could<00:00:32.189> produce<00:00:32.399> some<00:00:32.759> low

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
and fog could produce some low

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.180 
and fog could produce some low
visibility<00:00:33.809> along<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.350> coast<00:00:34.590> by<00:00:34.800> tomorrow

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
visibility along the coast by tomorrow

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.830 
visibility along the coast by tomorrow
morning<00:00:35.250> won't<00:00:35.730> take<00:00:35.969> long<00:00:36.149> for<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.510> burn

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
morning won't take long for that to burn

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.290 
morning won't take long for that to burn
off<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.290> fact<00:00:37.500> today<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.579> had<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.879> low<00:00:39.000> clouds

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
off in fact today we had the low clouds

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.600 
off in fact today we had the low clouds
and<00:00:39.420> fog<00:00:39.600> what<00:00:39.809> we<00:00:39.930> still<00:00:40.230> made<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.610> 73

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
and fog what we still made it to 73

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.450 
and fog what we still made it to 73
degrees<00:00:41.660> downtown<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.829> above<00:00:44.100> normal

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
degrees downtown so that is above normal

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.310 
degrees downtown so that is above normal
downtown<00:00:45.149> could<00:00:45.360> be<00:00:45.450> close<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.840> 80<00:00:46.079> degrees

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
downtown could be close to 80 degrees

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.290 
downtown could be close to 80 degrees
for<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.100> high<00:00:47.219> tomorrow<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:47.969> it's<00:00:48.120> going<00:00:48.210> to

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
for the high tomorrow so it's going to

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.569 
for the high tomorrow so it's going to
be<00:00:48.390> very<00:00:48.420> nice<00:00:49.050> out<00:00:49.320> there<00:00:49.579> temperatures

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
down into the 30s like we have been

down into the 30s like we have been
we're<00:00:56.760> down<00:00:56.910> into<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> 50s<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.469> 60s<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.190> the

moving<00:01:07.530> through<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.770> area<00:01:08.040> we've<00:01:08.280> got<00:01:08.400> a

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
moving through the area we've got a

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.800 
moving through the area we've got a
ridge<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.760> high<00:01:08.909> pressure<00:01:08.939> but<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:09.510> called<00:01:09.720> a

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
ridge of high pressure but it's called a

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.380 
ridge of high pressure but it's called a
dirty<00:01:09.990> ridge<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.500> high<00:01:10.619> pressure<00:01:10.650> usually<00:01:11.390> we

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
dirty ridge of high pressure usually we

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.910 
dirty ridge of high pressure usually we
have<00:01:12.420> high<00:01:12.659> pressure<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:13.229> place<00:01:13.260> we've<00:01:13.740> got

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
have high pressure in place we've got

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.670 
have high pressure in place we've got
nice<00:01:14.220> clear<00:01:14.700> skies<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:16.259> Ridge<00:01:16.530> is

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
nice clear skies but this Ridge is

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.560 
nice clear skies but this Ridge is
bringing<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.220> few<00:01:17.549> clouds<00:01:17.759> into<00:01:18.119> our<00:01:18.330> area

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
bringing in a few clouds into our area

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.539 
bringing in a few clouds into our area
so<00:01:18.810> that's<00:01:18.990> why<00:01:19.229> we<00:01:19.500> won't<00:01:19.650> see<00:01:19.950> perfectly

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
so that's why we won't see perfectly

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.160 
so that's why we won't see perfectly
clear<00:01:20.909> skies<00:01:21.210> by<00:01:21.450> tomorrow<00:01:21.780> afternoon<00:01:22.020> but

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
clear skies by tomorrow afternoon but

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.990 
clear skies by tomorrow afternoon but
we'll<00:01:22.470> still<00:01:22.619> see<00:01:22.950> plenty<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.340> sunshine<00:01:23.430> like

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
we'll still see plenty of sunshine like

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.060 
we'll still see plenty of sunshine like
we<00:01:24.150> did<00:01:24.330> today<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.320> will<00:01:25.470> help<00:01:25.619> warm<00:01:25.890> up

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
we did today and that will help warm up

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.399 
we did today and that will help warm up
our<00:01:26.189> temperatures<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:27.390> Ridge<00:01:27.750> will<00:01:27.990> slowly

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
our temperatures this Ridge will slowly

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.679 
our temperatures this Ridge will slowly
start<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.950> break<00:01:29.250> down<00:01:29.280> by<00:01:29.790> about<00:01:30.030> sunday<00:01:30.540> it's

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
start to break down by about sunday it's

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.810 
start to break down by about sunday it's
going<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.930> start<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.170> flatten<00:01:31.560> out<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.610> what

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
going to start to flatten out and what

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.429 
going to start to flatten out and what
