00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:12.559
 friends today I would like to make a video 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:17.300
 about where to start 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:20.430
 work is better to begin beginner getting up 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.570
 many sprayed someone gives a bill on 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.250
 promotion someone is trying to find 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.910
 maximum odds put on it 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.990
 . 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.730
 all this makes no sense i assure you 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.370
 you just have your money 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.120
 lose if you do not want them 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.489
 let's start with the fact that it is better 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.730
 always start this highlight to start 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.190
 the bank you want to use 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.320
 specifically for the table straight took in 100 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.600
 thousand rubles 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.829
 the second step is already this which 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.059
 the service you take advantage of 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:00.390
 I advise everyone not to start with promotion 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.420
 bills the most important accent is a classic 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.210
 these are sports predictions and you need to start 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.780
 just the same with him to put specifically on 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.540
 forecasts and distribute the bank so 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.290
 way that you have enough bet that is 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:22.110
 five maximum 10 percent on the order rate 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:26.340
 the most you secure yourself not 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.000
 lose the bank in the quickest way that you 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.520
 set 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.270
 a large percentage played a large percentage 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.270
 from the game bank 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:40.130
 also need of course to decide on 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.520
 copier copper must provide 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.560
 reliable statistics 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.340
 the bare numbers that we see often on 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:53.450
 competitor sites as bare numbers for 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.380
 month are brought but not backed by 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.479
 no urine is given 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.960
 events kisam forecasts generally no 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.710
 nothing on our resource must be 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.050
 am.ru 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:11.170
 on the two main types of forecasts 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:14.840
 statistics are presented in the form of two tables 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.690
 these are two kinds of forecasts as much as possible 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.350
 maximum trust and second kind 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.970
 predictions this high confidence is two 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.280
 major forecast for which we 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.330
 focused attention that is it 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:33.650
 the most passable forecasts combining 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.510
 yourself with value for money for 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.790
 for each of them is on the main page 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.530
 site statistics 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.850
 in view of which commands were given on 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:48.829
 what teams put no outcomes 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:51.230
 stared at the forecast here it is 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:55.390
 it is necessary to take everything into account 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.859
 I repeat it is necessary from forecasts when you are already 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.770
 increased their bank due to a forecast 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:01.930
 daily rates continue 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.290
 and stable work on them then 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.150
 can go and somehow 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.730
 diversify your bets it is possible 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.490
 spend already on promotion highlight 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.610
 some means for a tote and so 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:19.150
 further but still have your accent not 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:22.300
 quick earnings there accompanied 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.440
 at greater risk it is better to single out the bank and 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:31.120
 put it on a daily basis 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:33.300
 these are the main points all thank you all 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.300
 kind
