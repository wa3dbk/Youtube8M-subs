00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
dollar somewhere in there but I might

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:25.529 
dollar somewhere in there but I might
have<00:00:24.350> the<00:00:24.500> whole<00:00:24.650> thing<00:00:24.680> hard<00:00:25.100> plumbed<00:00:25.340> in

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539 
have the whole thing hard plumbed in

going<00:00:28.190> to<00:00:28.220> have<00:00:28.340> to<00:00:28.430> fix<00:00:28.640> that<00:00:29.770> but<00:00:30.770> this<00:00:31.010> is

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
going to have to fix that but this is

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.959 
going to have to fix that but this is
basically<00:00:31.580> like<00:00:31.699> a<00:00:32.469> vacuum<00:00:33.469> line<00:00:33.949> for<00:00:34.399> not

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
basically like a vacuum line for not

basically like a vacuum line for not
using<00:00:35.329> the<00:00:35.449> skimmer<00:00:35.690> take<00:00:36.649> a<00:00:36.679> little<00:00:36.859> bit<00:00:36.949> of

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
using the skimmer take a little bit of

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.469 
using the skimmer take a little bit of
suction<00:00:37.249> off<00:00:37.489> the<00:00:37.609> skimmer<00:00:37.850> because<00:00:38.179> I<00:00:38.420> do

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:38.479 
suction off the skimmer because I do

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:44.619 
suction off the skimmer because I do
have<00:00:38.780> a<00:00:39.100> very<00:00:40.100> large<00:00:40.280> pump<00:00:41.350> but<00:00:43.269> it's<00:00:44.269> all<00:00:44.389> hard

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
have a very large pump but it's all hard

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.599 
have a very large pump but it's all hard
plumbed<00:00:44.899> now<00:00:45.199> except<00:00:45.620> for<00:00:45.649> from<00:00:46.129> the<00:00:46.280> pump<00:00:46.519> to

00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:46.609 
plumbed now except for from the pump to

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:50.439 
plumbed now except for from the pump to
the<00:00:46.729> filter<00:00:47.120> and<00:00:48.639> this<00:00:49.639> is<00:00:49.850> the<00:00:49.999> return<00:00:50.389> line

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
the filter and this is the return line

the filter and this is the return line
and<00:00:51.069> I<00:00:52.069> have<00:00:52.280> added<00:00:52.519> a<00:00:52.879> sprinkler

I haven't drilled the holes in yet so
that<00:00:57.459> will<00:00:58.459> be<00:00:58.579> next<00:00:58.850> and<00:00:59.449> the<00:01:00.350> valve<00:01:00.589> is<00:01:00.829> just

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:01.069 
that will be next and the valve is just

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:03.430 
that will be next and the valve is just
right<00:01:01.249> here<00:01:01.459> to<00:01:01.780> easily<00:01:02.780> control<00:01:03.079> it<00:01:03.319> from

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
right here to easily control it from

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.310 
right here to easily control it from
inside<00:01:03.799> the<00:01:03.889> pool<00:01:04.330> but<00:01:05.330> this<00:01:05.570> is<00:01:05.720> the<00:01:05.930> main

which is now at the bottom which I
dropped<00:01:50.270> but<00:01:51.110> I<00:01:51.140> line<00:01:51.620> that<00:01:51.770> up<00:01:51.830> on<00:01:52.010> the<00:01:52.100> top<00:01:52.159> to

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
dropped but I line that up on the top to

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.149 
dropped but I line that up on the top to
make<00:01:53.090> sure<00:01:53.330> that<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:54.590> skimmer<00:01:54.890> would<00:01:55.040> be

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
make sure that the skimmer would be

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.910 
make sure that the skimmer would be
level<00:01:55.430> when<00:01:55.550> I<00:01:55.580> installed<00:01:56.200> after<00:01:57.200> that<00:01:57.350> I<00:01:57.650> put

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
level when I installed after that I put

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.760 
level when I installed after that I put
the<00:01:58.130> gasket<00:01:58.670> in<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.090> plate<00:01:59.300> here<00:01:59.630> and<00:01:59.810> just

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
brought over the main skimmer body

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.160 
brought over the main skimmer body

line down there and I am ready to cut
the<00:02:32.370> liner<00:02:32.670> in<00:02:32.849> here<00:02:32.880> but<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.630> forgot<00:02:33.959> my<00:02:34.019> take

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
the liner in here but I forgot my take

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.580

my<00:02:35.099> razor<00:02:35.250> blade<00:02:35.610> into<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.910> pool<00:02:36.120> with<00:02:36.300> me<00:02:36.590> so

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
my razor blade into the pool with me so

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.089 
my razor blade into the pool with me so
that's<00:02:38.130> what<00:02:38.280> I'll<00:02:38.340> be<00:02:38.459> doing<00:02:38.580> next<00:02:39.319> but<00:02:40.319> that

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
that's what I'll be doing next but that

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.880 
that's what I'll be doing next but that
this<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.400> basically<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:42.090> very<00:02:42.390> brief<00:02:42.690> video<00:02:43.049> to

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
this is basically a very brief video to

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.699 
this is basically a very brief video to
kind<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.280> go<00:02:44.489> over<00:02:44.840> some<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.019> steps<00:02:46.319> that

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
kind of go over some of the steps that

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.180 
kind of go over some of the steps that
you<00:02:46.980> should<00:02:47.099> do<00:02:47.720> because<00:02:48.720> if<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:49.500> install<00:02:50.010> it

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
you should do because if you install it

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.069 
you should do because if you install it
before<00:02:50.280> filling<00:02:50.730> up<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:50.910> pool<00:02:51.180> what<00:02:51.989> will

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
before filling up the pool what will

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.400 
before filling up the pool what will
happen<00:02:52.440> is<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.709> liner<00:02:52.890> will<00:02:53.160> stretch<00:02:53.610> and

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
happen is the liner will stretch and

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.390 
happen is the liner will stretch and
your<00:02:55.410> skimmer<00:02:55.709> will<00:02:55.920> just<00:02:56.160> totally<00:02:56.959> come<00:02:57.959> out

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
your skimmer will just totally come out

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.470 
your skimmer will just totally come out
so<00:02:59.400> that's<00:02:59.519> why<00:02:59.670> you<00:02:59.790> want<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.030> make<00:03:00.150> sure<00:03:00.209> the

so that's why you want to make sure the

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.930 
so that's why you want to make sure the
liners<00:03:00.780> stretch<00:03:01.079> out<00:03:01.319> all<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.590> way<00:03:01.680> with<00:03:02.610> pool

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
liners stretch out all the way with pool

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.520
