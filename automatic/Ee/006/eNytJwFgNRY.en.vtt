00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:14.070 
heavy a little bit of a of a grass
pattern

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.760 

and<00:05:15.080> another<00:05:15.740> one<00:05:16.040> just<00:05:16.700> going<00:05:16.970> to<00:05:17.030> give<00:05:17.210> it<00:05:17.240> a

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770
