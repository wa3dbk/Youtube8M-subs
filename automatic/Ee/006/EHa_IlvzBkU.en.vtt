00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
think the biggest positive is that we

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.749 
think the biggest positive is that we
got<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.250> clean<00:00:08.490> sheet<00:00:08.700> which<00:00:08.970> was<00:00:09.240> as<00:00:09.570> been<00:00:09.929> a

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:10.759 
got a clean sheet which was as been a

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.910 
got a clean sheet which was as been a
it's<00:00:11.759> been<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:11.969> talking<00:00:12.330> point<00:00:12.450> for<00:00:12.570> us<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:13.080> think

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
it's been a talking point for us I think

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.010 
it's been a talking point for us I think
it's<00:00:14.070> officially<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.549> first<00:00:14.759> one<00:00:15.089> so<00:00:15.660> that

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
it's officially the first one so that

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.029 
it's officially the first one so that
was<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.440> was<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:17.010> huge<00:00:17.430> plus<00:00:17.670> for<00:00:17.730> us<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.000> think

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
was that was a huge plus for us I think

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.320 
was that was a huge plus for us I think
there<00:00:20.039> was<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.160> lot<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.520> positives<00:00:21.029> out<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.270> the

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
there was a lot of positives out of the

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.240 
there was a lot of positives out of the
game<00:00:21.480> obviously<00:00:21.689> goals<00:00:22.380> we<00:00:22.650> scored<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.070> stuff

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
game obviously goals we scored and stuff

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.849 
game obviously goals we scored and stuff
like<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.400> but<00:00:23.760> i<00:00:23.970> think<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.630> proved<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.199> we

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
like that but i think it proved that we

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.320 
like that but i think it proved that we
still<00:00:26.039> got<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.220> little<00:00:26.340> few<00:00:26.699> things<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.119> tweak

the plan while we add our full squad

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.290 
the plan while we add our full squad
together<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.010> then<00:00:56.160> when<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.850> international

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
together and then when the international

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.670

players<00:00:57.480> went<00:00:57.690> away<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.870> was<00:00:58.079> always<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.469> plan

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
players went away it was always the plan

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.279 
players went away it was always the plan
that<00:00:58.980> we<00:00:59.039> were<00:00:59.250> going<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.460> play<00:01:00.120> some<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.230> the

reason<00:01:28.799> we<00:01:29.040> signed<00:01:29.310> her<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.579> she's<00:01:29.790> so

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970

flexible<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:31.290> she<00:01:31.560> proved<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:31.920> tonight<00:01:32.070> I

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
flexible and she proved that tonight I

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.469 
flexible and she proved that tonight I
thought<00:01:32.430> she<00:01:32.579> did<00:01:32.610> well<00:01:32.939> down<00:01:33.150> there<00:01:33.299> on<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
thought she did well down there on the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.789 
thought she did well down there on the
left-hand<00:01:33.840> side<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.140> thought<00:01:34.439> she<00:01:34.650> was<00:01:34.770> a

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
left-hand side I thought she was a

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.760 
left-hand side I thought she was a
threat<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:36.240> other<00:01:36.360> rookie<00:01:36.780> Megan<00:01:37.350> Brigman

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
threat the other rookie Megan Brigman

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.219 
threat the other rookie Megan Brigman
started<00:01:38.159> as<00:01:38.280> well<00:01:38.430> would<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.700> see<00:01:38.820> from<00:01:38.939> her

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
started as well would you see from her

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.340 
started as well would you see from her
pace<00:01:40.229> power<00:01:41.630> exactly<00:01:42.630> what<00:01:42.720> you'd<00:01:42.869> expect<00:01:42.899> off

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
pace power exactly what you'd expect off

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.550 
pace power exactly what you'd expect off
a<00:01:43.409> UNC<00:01:43.860> kid<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.430> she<00:01:45.119> she<00:01:45.689> plays<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.960> position

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
a UNC kid and she she plays a position

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.050 
a UNC kid and she she plays a position
really<00:01:46.829> well<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.159> terms<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.520> how<00:01:47.640> we<00:01:47.670> want<00:01:48.030> to

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
really well in terms of how we want to

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.359 
really well in terms of how we want to
play<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.360> game<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.799> I<00:01:49.799> thought<00:01:49.950> she<00:01:50.159> grew

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
play the game and I thought she grew

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.039 
play the game and I thought she grew
into<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.729> game<00:01:50.880> gradually<00:01:51.360> more<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.689> more<00:01:51.930> as

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
into the game gradually more and more as

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.840 
into the game gradually more and more as
the<00:01:52.110> play<00:01:52.259> went<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.710> think<00:01:53.280> we'd<00:01:53.369> go<00:01:53.579> down

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
the play went on I think we'd go down

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.190 
the play went on I think we'd go down
every<00:01:54.090> player<00:01:54.299> on<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.509> roster<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.990> played

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
every player on the roster that played

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.929 
every player on the roster that played
tonight<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.619> did<00:01:55.770> something<00:01:55.979> positive<00:01:56.579> but

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
tonight and did something positive but

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.660 
tonight and did something positive but
someone<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.689> stuck<00:01:57.899> out<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.290> Bev<00:01:58.619> goble<00:01:59.070> what

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
else would expect to think about

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.170 
else would expect to think about
shooting<00:02:17.590> from<00:02:17.770> and<00:02:18.070> then<00:02:18.550> I<00:02:18.580> think<00:02:18.850> on<00:02:18.970> one<00:02:19.120> of

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
shooting from and then I think on one of

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.700 
shooting from and then I think on one of
the<00:02:19.240> goals<00:02:19.420> you<00:02:19.480> saw<00:02:19.720> her<00:02:19.870> intricacy<00:02:20.470> and<00:02:20.500> then

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
the goals you saw her intricacy and then

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.080 
the goals you saw her intricacy and then
around<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:21.010> box<00:02:21.220> to<00:02:21.370> set<00:02:21.550> someone<00:02:21.730> else<00:02:21.940> to

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
around the box to set someone else to

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.450 
around the box to set someone else to
score<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:22.600> I<00:02:23.020> think<00:02:23.800> this<00:02:23.860> is<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:24.070> big<00:02:24.250> year<00:02:24.400> for
