00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.289 
grip straightaway felt difficult yeah
definitely<00:02:34.430> gripping<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:34.909> certainly<00:02:35.209> off

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
definitely gripping and certainly off

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.479 
definitely gripping and certainly off
the<00:02:35.450> starter<00:02:35.989> you<00:02:36.500> could<00:02:36.680> feel<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:36.920> kick<00:02:37.280> down

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
the starter you could feel it kick down

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.610 
the starter you could feel it kick down
there<00:02:37.730> with<00:02:38.629> you<00:02:38.720> is<00:02:38.870> definitely<00:02:39.049> quicker<00:02:39.439> for

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
there with you is definitely quicker for

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
me so get this surface is as smooth as

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.830 
me so get this surface is as smooth as
ice<00:02:45.500> to<00:02:46.250> raise<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.700> stakes<00:02:46.970> we've<00:02:47.299> activated

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
ice to raise the stakes we've activated

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.589

a<00:02:48.109> sprinkler<00:02:48.590> system<00:02:48.980> on<00:02:49.069> top<00:02:49.280> of<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:49.549> all<00:02:49.760> got

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
a sprinkler system on top of it all got

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:51.970 
a sprinkler system on top of it all got
sprinklers<00:02:51.049> ready<00:02:51.230> yep

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
sprinklers ready yep

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.530 
sprinklers ready yep
make<00:02:52.310> it<00:02:52.459> even<00:02:52.670> more<00:02:52.700> interesting<00:02:53.299> for<00:02:53.480> you

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
make it even more interesting for you

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.349 
make it even more interesting for you
right<00:02:54.220> just<00:02:55.220> imagine<00:02:55.670> that<00:02:55.700> you're<00:02:55.909> a<00:02:55.940> really

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
right just imagine that you're a really

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.990 
right just imagine that you're a really
really<00:02:56.389> icy<00:02:56.750> rollin<00:02:57.260> here<00:02:57.549> that's<00:02:58.549> it<00:02:58.760> and

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
really icy rollin here that's it and

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.619 
really icy rollin here that's it and
release<00:02:59.269> the<00:02:59.389> Britta

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.580 

straight<00:03:02.629> away<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:02.840> got<00:03:03.049> crypt

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
straight away you got crypt

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.170 
straight away you got crypt
I<00:03:03.620> thought<00:03:04.129> would<00:03:04.370> be<00:03:04.489> spinning<00:03:04.730> everywhere

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
I thought would be spinning everywhere

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.030 
I thought would be spinning everywhere
and<00:03:05.329> it's<00:03:05.569> not<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:06.319> the<00:03:06.379> max<00:03:06.560> you've<00:03:06.709> given<00:03:06.950> it

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
and it's not and the max you've given it

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.649 
and it's not and the max you've given it
quite<00:03:07.220> a<00:03:07.250> bit<00:03:07.340> of<00:03:07.549> revs<00:03:07.730> off<00:03:07.879> for<00:03:08.000> life<00:03:08.150> yeah

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:08.659 
quite a bit of revs off for life yeah

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.539 
quite a bit of revs off for life yeah
yeah<00:03:08.690> wait<00:03:09.290> slowly<00:03:09.590> it's<00:03:10.340> all<00:03:10.430> about

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
yeah wait slowly it's all about

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.280 
yeah wait slowly it's all about
harnessing<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.239> Quattro's<00:03:11.720> yeah<00:03:11.959> but<00:03:12.170> all

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
harnessing the Quattro's yeah but all

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.930 
harnessing the Quattro's yeah but all
all<00:03:12.620> that<00:03:12.859> power<00:03:13.069> going<00:03:13.220> through<00:03:13.459> four

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
all that power going through four

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.180 
all that power going through four
separate<00:03:14.329> wheels<00:03:14.540> all<00:03:15.379> the<00:03:15.560> time<00:03:15.799> it's

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
separate wheels all the time it's

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.680 
separate wheels all the time it's
changing<00:03:16.669> the<00:03:16.760> grip<00:03:16.910> it's<00:03:17.299> changing<00:03:17.599> the

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
changing the grip it's changing the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.390 
changing the grip it's changing the
drive<00:03:17.900> to<00:03:18.079> different<00:03:18.410> wheels<00:03:18.620> doesn't<00:03:19.310> happen

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400

percent it's unbelievable so I'm trying
to<00:04:20.739> lose<00:04:20.950> it<00:04:21.130> here<00:04:21.280> now<00:04:21.459> go<00:04:21.640> let<00:04:21.850> it<00:04:21.970> ride<00:04:22.240> I'm

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
to lose it here now go let it ride I'm

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.300 
to lose it here now go let it ride I'm
steering<00:04:22.810> quite<00:04:23.140> hard<00:04:23.380> to<00:04:23.500> try<00:04:23.710> not<00:04:23.890> to<00:04:24.010> spin

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
steering quite hard to try not to spin

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.190 
steering quite hard to try not to spin
and<00:04:24.460> it's<00:04:24.580> just<00:04:24.790> finding<00:04:25.090> grip<00:04:25.510> the<00:04:26.020> wheels

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
and it's just finding grip the wheels

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.870 
and it's just finding grip the wheels
actually<00:04:26.380> breaking<00:04:26.770> when<00:04:27.340> you<00:04:27.430> push<00:04:27.640> it<00:04:27.790> on
