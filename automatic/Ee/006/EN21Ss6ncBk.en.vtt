00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
high amounts for example has very high

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.410 
high amounts for example has very high
amounts<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.740> zinc<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.160> magnesium<00:00:20.300> just<00:00:21.300> like

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
amounts of zinc and magnesium just like

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.759 
amounts of zinc and magnesium just like
we're<00:00:21.539> talking<00:00:21.660> about<00:00:21.869> iodine<00:00:22.199> zinc<00:00:22.560> and

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
we're talking about iodine zinc and

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.620 
we're talking about iodine zinc and
magnesium<00:00:22.890> are<00:00:23.279> two<00:00:23.640> things<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.060> we<00:00:24.300> just

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
magnesium are two things that we just

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.689 
magnesium are two things that we just
aren't<00:00:25.140> getting<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.680> our<00:00:25.769> diet<00:00:25.830> not<00:00:26.460> getting

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
aren't getting in our diet not getting

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.130 
aren't getting in our diet not getting
near<00:00:26.939> nearly<00:00:27.330> enough<00:00:27.510> up<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.869> they're<00:00:27.960> two

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
near nearly enough up and they're two

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.320 
near nearly enough up and they're two
very<00:00:28.380> critical<00:00:28.769> minerals<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:29.789> pumpkin<00:00:30.150> seeds
