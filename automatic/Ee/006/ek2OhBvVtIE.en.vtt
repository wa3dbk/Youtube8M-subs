I<00:00:23.010> ordered<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.550> in<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.939> believe<00:00:24.510> there<00:00:24.720> are

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
I ordered it in I believe there are

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.290 
I ordered it in I believe there are
different<00:00:24.960> colors<00:00:25.680> but<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.730> get<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.939> case

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
different colors but you get the case

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.509 
different colors but you get the case
here<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.779> actually<00:00:27.900> came<00:00:28.349> just<00:00:28.680> like<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:29.220> so

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
here it actually came just like this so

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.669 
here it actually came just like this so
you<00:00:30.029> snap<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.630> off<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.410> little

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
you snap this off and this is a little

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.560 
you snap this off and this is a little
bit<00:00:31.800> different<00:00:32.160> than<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.340> iphone<00:00:32.820> version<00:00:32.850> as

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
bit different than the iphone version as

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.770 
bit different than the iphone version as
it's<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.559> design<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.760> actual<00:00:36.180> Samsung

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
it's the design of the actual Samsung

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.979 
it's the design of the actual Samsung
Galaxy<00:00:37.350> Nexus<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:38.489> drives<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.329> way<00:00:39.570> it

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
Galaxy Nexus that drives the way it

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.200 
Galaxy Nexus that drives the way it
looks<00:00:40.320> let's<00:00:41.100> get<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.489> off<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.700> there<00:00:41.879> and

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
looks let's get that off of there and

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.450 
looks let's get that off of there and
discard<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.290> it's<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.530> belt<00:00:43.800> clip<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.309> only

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
discard it so it's a belt clip it only

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.790 
discard it so it's a belt clip it only
goes<00:00:44.640> one<00:00:44.700> way<00:00:45.030> which<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.539> vertical<00:00:46.289> unlike

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
goes one way which is vertical unlike

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.220 
goes one way which is vertical unlike
the<00:00:47.039> iphone<00:00:47.070> case<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.360> horizontal<00:00:49.020> or

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
the iphone case that is horizontal or

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.970 
the iphone case that is horizontal or
vertical<00:00:49.579> so<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:51.030> one<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.570> tall<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.920> i

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
vertical so this one is so tall that i

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.709 
vertical so this one is so tall that i
believe<00:00:53.250> they<00:00:53.399> make<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.699> only<00:00:53.879> vertical<00:00:54.480> for<00:00:54.690> a

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
believe they make it only vertical for a

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.810 
believe they make it only vertical for a
reason<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.320> snaps<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.370> but<00:00:56.550> let's<00:00:56.699> go

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
reason it snaps like that but let's go

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.479 
reason it snaps like that but let's go
ahead<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.120> put<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.899> Samsung<00:00:58.410> Galaxy

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
ahead and put it on the Samsung Galaxy

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.189 
ahead and put it on the Samsung Galaxy
Nexus<00:00:59.489> here<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.059> have<00:01:00.359> it's<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.170 
through and get it on the sides first
the<00:01:50.220> top<00:01:50.430> as<00:01:50.759> well<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:51.899> snaps<00:01:52.200> together

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
the top as well and just snaps together

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.639 
the top as well and just snaps together
and<00:01:54.180> once<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.509> snap<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.869> together<00:01:55.170> you're

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
and once you snap it together you're

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.380 
and once you snap it together you're
ready<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.189> was<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:57.000> was<00:01:57.030> pretty<00:01:57.299> easy

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390

ready and was that that was pretty easy
so<00:01:57.930> there's<00:01:58.110> nothing<00:01:58.259> not<00:01:59.219> snapped<00:01:59.610> together

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
so there's nothing not snapped together

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.630 
so there's nothing not snapped together
it's<00:02:00.360> ready<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.780> go<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.350> then<00:02:02.130> once<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.490> get

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
it's ready to go and then once you get

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.480 
it's ready to go and then once you get
that<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.030> take<00:02:03.270> your<00:02:03.740> rubberized<00:02:04.740> piece<00:02:05.159> here

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
that you take your rubberized piece here

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.940 
that you take your rubberized piece here
and<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:06.060> put<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.420> into<00:02:06.810> place<00:02:07.110> it's<00:02:07.740> pretty

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
and you put it into place it's pretty

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.529 
and you put it into place it's pretty
easy<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.399> figure<00:02:08.429> out<00:02:08.789> which<00:02:08.940> end<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.330> which

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
easy to figure out which end is which

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.020 
easy to figure out which end is which
because<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.140> bottom<00:02:10.470> end<00:02:10.619> has<00:02:10.860> some<00:02:11.580> partial

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
because the bottom end has some partial

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.880 
because the bottom end has some partial
cutouts<00:02:12.420> for

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
cutouts for

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.100 
cutouts for
at<00:02:12.950> both<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.490> ear<00:02:13.760> front<00:02:14.480> of<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.600> microphones

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
at both the ear front of the microphones

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.070 
at both the ear front of the microphones
as<00:02:15.350> well<00:02:15.590> as<00:02:15.770> the<00:02:16.010> charging<00:02:16.670> piece<00:02:17.090> pull<00:02:17.900> this

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
as well as the charging piece pull this

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.110 
as well as the charging piece pull this
over<00:02:18.410> yeah<00:02:18.950> do<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.280> little<00:02:19.520> bit<00:02:19.700> of<00:02:19.730> massaging

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
over yeah do a little bit of massaging

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.530

not all the way in so i will tell you be
careful<00:03:15.050> when<00:03:15.350> you're<00:03:15.440> putting<00:03:15.500> this<00:03:15.860> in

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
careful when you're putting this in

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.729 
careful when you're putting this in
because<00:03:16.640> until<00:03:17.030> you<00:03:17.180> hear<00:03:17.630> that<00:03:17.810> click<00:03:18.290> or<00:03:18.560> you

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
because until you hear that click or you

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.060 
because until you hear that click or you
click<00:03:19.070> it<00:03:19.250> in<00:03:19.720> it's<00:03:20.720> not<00:03:20.959> in<00:03:21.140> place<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:21.829> it<00:03:21.920> can

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
click it in it's not in place and it can

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.770 
click it in it's not in place and it can
fall<00:03:22.310> out<00:03:22.340> so<00:03:22.670> that's<00:03:22.760> what<00:03:22.970> happened<00:03:23.269> I<00:03:23.420> got

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
fall out so that's what happened I got

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.750 
fall out so that's what happened I got
in<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:23.959> car<00:03:24.200> got<00:03:25.010> out<00:03:25.040> of<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.370> car<00:03:25.549> and<00:03:25.670> the

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
in the car got out of the car and the

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.390 
in the car got out of the car and the
phone<00:03:25.940> went<00:03:26.090> flying<00:03:26.570> out<00:03:26.780> of<00:03:26.840> my<00:03:27.079> case<00:03:28.040> onto

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
phone went flying out of my case onto

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.940 
phone went flying out of my case onto
the<00:03:28.640> ground<00:03:29.049> but<00:03:30.049> there<00:03:30.140> was<00:03:30.230> no<00:03:30.350> damage<00:03:30.590> to<00:03:30.799> it

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
the ground but there was no damage to it

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.949 
the ground but there was no damage to it
because<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.579> case<00:03:31.790> obviously<00:03:32.209> is

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
because the case obviously is

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.810 
because the case obviously is
indestructible<00:03:33.530> or<00:03:33.980> pretty<00:03:34.640> much

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
indestructible or pretty much

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.850 
indestructible or pretty much
indestructible<00:03:35.090> nothing's<00:03:36.019> indestructible

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
indestructible nothing's indestructible

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.340 
indestructible nothing's indestructible
but<00:03:37.760> fairly<00:03:38.180> indestructible<00:03:38.959> that's<00:03:39.170> why

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
but fairly indestructible that's why

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.729 
but fairly indestructible that's why
