to be able to do this and then I hop on
to<00:03:15.620> them<00:03:15.830> and<00:03:15.950> then<00:03:16.070> I<00:03:16.160> feed<00:03:16.370> them<00:03:16.400> a<00:03:16.670> blaze

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
to them and then I feed them a blaze

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.400 
to them and then I feed them a blaze
blaze<00:03:18.920> powder<00:03:19.190> so<00:03:20.060> this<00:03:20.239> is<00:03:20.270> by<00:03:20.690> a<00:03:20.720> Killa<00:03:21.230> you

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
blaze powder so this is by a Killa you

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.960 
blaze powder so this is by a Killa you
can<00:03:21.590> get<00:03:21.739> this<00:03:21.890> by<00:03:22.070> killing<00:03:22.459> blaze<00:03:22.700> if<00:03:22.910> you

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
can get this by killing blaze if you

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.150 
can get this by killing blaze if you
don't<00:03:23.120> know<00:03:23.239> and<00:03:23.510> if<00:03:24.290> I<00:03:24.440> just<00:03:24.650> right-click<00:03:25.040> on

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
don't know and if I just right-click on

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.860 
don't know and if I just right-click on
him<00:03:25.340> as<00:03:25.459> you<00:03:25.700> can<00:03:25.850> see<00:03:26.030> he<00:03:26.270> starts<00:03:26.570> spitting

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
him as you can see he starts spitting

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.840 
him as you can see he starts spitting
out<00:03:27.080> fire<00:03:27.670> 45<00:03:28.670> seconds<00:03:29.330> now<00:03:30.260> one<00:03:30.800> blaze<00:03:31.610> powder

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
out fire 45 seconds now one blaze powder

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.020 
out fire 45 seconds now one blaze powder
is<00:03:32.090> equivalent<00:03:32.630> to<00:03:32.690> five<00:03:32.989> seconds<00:03:33.670> so<00:03:34.670> if<00:03:34.910> I

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
is equivalent to five seconds so if I

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.060 
is equivalent to five seconds so if I
feed<00:03:35.270> him<00:03:35.390> too<00:03:35.630> I'm<00:03:35.900> not<00:03:36.170> sure<00:03:36.230> if<00:03:36.530> I<00:03:36.709> think

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
feed him too I'm not sure if I think

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.070 
feed him too I'm not sure if I think
