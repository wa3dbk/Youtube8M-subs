00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.689
 hello today I'll teach you to 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.840
 make a pareo for the beach super easy 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:24.689
 and quick the materials that we're going to 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.630
 need are gaza cloth or chiffon 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.710
 This can be smooth or stamped according to your 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.539
 preference 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.910
 we are going to need a meter and 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.220
 medium depending on the length we want 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.199
 our our pareo we are going to measure of 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.480
 the part here from the bust to the 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:43.739
 long we want 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.720
 we're going to need a room of fabric that 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.120
 you found this can be any 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.770
 grease cloth and any type of fabric that 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.110
 you want that is for the part of 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.239
 our braces may well be from the 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.250
 same fabric if it's from the same fabric there is 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.180
 than adding a quarter more fabric to 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.180
 our braces 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:12.219
 The first thing we are going to do is 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.070
 match our tea you have to leave the 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:16.899
 couple both ends if they are not 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.090
 the couple we cut a piece and 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.399
 let's have it so we can stay 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.030
 good couple now let's double the 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:24.030
 half fabric 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.440
 we're going to fold it in half 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.560
 and from one of the corners 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.540
 let's get a half sun 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.710
 well we have to fold our fabric the 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.020
 half now what we're going to do is 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.869
 give him an oval triangle this is for 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.939
 that we have the side in the taste 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.270
 let's remove it here from below to 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.250
 up from 15 to 20 I what 18 is 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.630
 measure will depend on what emerged 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.740
 that you want the part of the 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.610
 bust 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.229
 from 15 to 20 is enough and what we are going 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.270
 to go do be careful because the 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:07.869
 Chiffon does not move much and we measure 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.869
 all the contour 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.730
 and now if you cut 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:27.000
 with all 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.610
 this is what will be left for us 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.160
 in our taste now what are we going to 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.210
 do 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.210
 is to take him 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.450
 we are going to remove these shores from 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.560
 our fabric 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.560
 now only 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.130
 and if they want, they can leave it even 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.140
 we are completely square in the 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.580
 bottom part or they can give you a 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.810
 small vintage cross so that we do not 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:00.080
 left 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:05.180
 we grab our two ends like what 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:08.069
 we did with our with our pareo and 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.989
 what we are going to do is corner 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.920
 we make a triangle and the only thing 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.920
 let's do is double it 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:21.130
 The measurement of the length of the brace must be 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.390
 measure it in our shoulder contour 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.930
 and that would be the measure that 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.930
 we need 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:34.780
 let's cut, let's stay 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.780
 2 centimeters 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.300
 if they want they can pins so they do not 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.870
 they are moving, they can leave it like this 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.870
 12 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.500
 The first thing we are going to do is 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.330
 our splinter around the contour 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.750
 both the top part and the part 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.190
 below you can do the mini hover or 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.410
 with the small fileteadora 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.620
 we can also zig zag him the most 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.260
 small with the small stitch also or 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.909
 may well happen over and double 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.310
 this will already be depending on the 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:19.500
 machine that has this will be in all the 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.620
 outline then except for the 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.600
 blade that we take out 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.910
 to the half circle that we took in 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.480
 our corners now if what we're going 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.390
 to do is to put our 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.150
 our good we are going to have the outline 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.940
 of the measurement of the arm to emerge here 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.550
 and put our 10 that we get what 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.170
 let's do is pass a seam to 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.340
 a centimeter away with our 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.340
 large stitch steps 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.640
 no no no 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:09.870
 let's pull one of the edges only 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.190
 and we will suffer so that it is us 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.880
 green 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:17.550
 then at 14 centimeters or more 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.430
 depending on the extent that this 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.270
 it should be 12 to 16 centimeters 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.270
 depending on 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.110
 well now let's paste our 10 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.289
 for this you have to have the measure of 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.520
 our contour and shoulder arm and 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.099
 what we are going to do is double our 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.169
 half view and close it and in the other 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:44.300
 half this is going to be half where the 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.669
 we are going to stick in the part where we emerged 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.479
 the measure of suicide must keep us 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:52.009
 of 12 16 centimeters or so 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:54.259
 The more I bust the measure, the more 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:56.390
 bigger and now what we will do 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:59.450
 is to put it in the middle 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:01.160
 and we're going to stick it on top 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.680
 I leave the link for those who do not know 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.110
 avenge the good 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.150
 and if it is very complicated to put a 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.430
 10 what you can put a ribbon 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.530
 let's set a bar what we're going to 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.750
 to do is to pass the work here and we are going to 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:16.330
 put a ribbon around the contour 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:19.660
 we close our bar and simply what 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.639
 we paste in the part above that is a 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.160
 easiest way I recommend you better 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:25.539
 the 10's looks better but it's done to you 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.169
 very complicated with the ribbon is 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:28.169
 perfect too 

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.919
 we were ready our 10 now there 

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.480
 to check that the two are of the same 

00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:43.680
 measure 

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:45.900
 this already and you have to plant it well 

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:48.449
 that is how the thread with which 

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.490
 we have to pull the good 

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:52.949
 this is all if they liked the video of the 

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:57.139
 like comment and share I am jasmine 

00:07:52.949 --> 00:07:57.139
 gastÃ©lum and see you in the next video
