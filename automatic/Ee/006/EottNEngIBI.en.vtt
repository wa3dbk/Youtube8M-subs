00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.179 
people consider it stop okay one all in
actually<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.659> when<00:01:19.259> there<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.680> no<00:01:19.860> recovery

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
actually is is when there is no recovery

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.390 
actually is is when there is no recovery
afterwards<00:01:20.729> when<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.869> game<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.290> not<00:01:22.770> going<00:01:23.220> to

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
afterwards when the game is not going to

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.310 
afterwards when the game is not going to
go<00:01:23.549> on<00:01:23.729> for<00:01:24.030> longer<00:01:24.210> than<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.840> if<00:01:25.200> it

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
go on for longer than that and if it

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.219 
go on for longer than that and if it
does<00:01:25.530> then<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:26.670> probably<00:01:27.119> isn't<00:01:27.390> an<00:01:27.600> all-in<00:01:27.930> I

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
does then it probably isn't an all-in I

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.440 
does then it probably isn't an all-in I
mean<00:01:28.650> like<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.829> Ken<00:01:29.220> but<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.640> odds<00:01:29.790> are<00:01:30.000> really

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
mean like a Ken but the odds are really

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.480 
mean like a Ken but the odds are really
really<00:01:30.600> rare<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.049> by<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.829> way<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.250> way<00:01:32.340> this

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
really rare and by the way the way this

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.160 
really rare and by the way the way this
works<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.090> send<00:01:33.270> another<00:01:33.329> st<00:01:33.720> meal<00:01:33.869> at

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
works is you send another st meal at

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.840 
works is you send another st meal at
essentially<00:01:34.710> fault<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.280> make<00:01:35.610> another

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
essentially fault and make another

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.270 
essentially fault and make another
barracks<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.479> middle<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.780> map<00:01:36.960> and

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
barracks in the middle of the map and

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.050 
barracks in the middle of the map and
another<00:01:38.280> thing<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.549> have<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.729> do<00:01:38.850> with<00:01:38.970> this

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
another thing you have to do with this

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.429 
another thing you have to do with this
build<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.750> have<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.960> make<00:01:40.110> sure<00:01:40.140> your

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
build is you have to make sure your

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.380 
build is you have to make sure your
marine<00:01:40.680> denies<00:01:41.070> their<00:01:41.430> sekella<00:01:41.880> scout

marine denies their sekella scout

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.020 
marine denies their sekella scout
because<00:01:42.659> if<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.899> doesn't<00:01:43.229> then<00:01:43.820> if<00:01:44.820> they're

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
because if it doesn't then if they're

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.280 
because if it doesn't then if they're
good<00:01:45.299> they'll<00:01:45.540> be<00:01:45.630> able<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.780> read<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.200> you

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
good they'll be able to read that you

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.270 
good they'll be able to read that you
don't<00:01:46.409> have<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.560> gas<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.070> might<00:01:47.189> be

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
don't have a gas and you might be

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.920 
don't have a gas and you might be
clashing<00:01:47.520> almost<00:01:47.970> portals<00:01:48.299> birds<00:01:48.570> even<00:01:48.659> if<00:01:48.840> I

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
clashing almost portals birds even if I

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:49.969 
clashing almost portals birds even if I
was<00:01:49.110> playing<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.470> would<00:01:49.590> think<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.860> a

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
was playing I would think that a

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.859 
was playing I would think that a
producer<00:01:50.340> on<00:01:50.880> thur<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.149> going<00:01:51.329> 4-1<00:01:51.750> record

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
producer on thur is going 4-1 record

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.960 
producer on thur is going 4-1 record
spent<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.920> even<00:01:53.189> if<00:01:53.280> they<00:01:53.369> occur<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.880> know

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
spent so even if they occur to you know

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.639 
spent so even if they occur to you know
its<00:01:54.090> toll<00:01:54.240> not<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.509> bad<00:01:54.689> by<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.409> way<00:01:55.530> this

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
its toll not that bad by the way this

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.010 
its toll not that bad by the way this
builds<00:01:55.920> beaten<00:01:56.189> me<00:01:56.369> several<00:01:56.759> times<00:01:57.020> mainly

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
builds beaten me several times mainly

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.749 
builds beaten me several times mainly
because<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.409> like<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.590> go<00:01:58.770> one<00:01:59.310> bear<00:01:59.490> accent

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
because I like to go one bear accent

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.270 
because I like to go one bear accent
expand<00:02:00.180> quite<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.600> bit

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
expand quite a bit

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.980 
expand quite a bit
one<00:02:01.400> gateway<00:02:01.580> into<00:02:01.850> expand<00:02:02.150> and<00:02:02.780> so<00:02:02.840> that's

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
one gateway into expand and so that's

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.630 
one gateway into expand and so that's
why<00:02:03.140> I<00:02:03.170> let's<00:02:03.380> do<00:02:03.470> it<00:02:03.560> this<00:02:04.340> is<00:02:04.460> since<00:02:04.610> you

see<00:02:40.700> it<00:02:40.730> at<00:02:40.970> all<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:42.459> this<00:02:43.459> build<00:02:43.670> works<00:02:43.970> like

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
see it at all and this build works like

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.759 
see it at all and this build works like
even<00:02:44.510> Grandmaster<00:02:45.110> that<00:02:45.260> will<00:02:45.380> believe<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.680> or

even Grandmaster that will believe it or
not<00:02:45.890> um<00:02:46.160> it<00:02:46.760> might<00:02:46.970> not<00:02:47.120> work<00:02:47.180> when<00:02:47.420> I'm<00:02:47.510> doing

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
not um it might not work when I'm doing

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.910 
not um it might not work when I'm doing
good<00:02:47.810> because<00:02:48.019> people<00:02:48.290> have<00:02:48.440> better<00:02:48.590> micro

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
good because people have better micro

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.150 
good because people have better micro
than<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:49.130> other<00:02:49.280> characters<00:02:49.540> but<00:02:50.620> if<00:02:51.620> your

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
than the other characters but if your

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.740 
than the other characters but if your
returns<00:02:52.430> are<00:02:52.610> in<00:02:52.640> Grand<00:02:53.060> Master's<00:02:53.420> I<00:02:53.540> think

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
returns are in Grand Master's I think

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:54.880 
returns are in Grand Master's I think
this<00:02:53.840> will<00:02:53.930> definitely<00:02:54.110> work<00:02:54.319> and<00:02:54.590> again<00:02:54.769> as

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
this will definitely work and again as

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.140 
this will definitely work and again as
