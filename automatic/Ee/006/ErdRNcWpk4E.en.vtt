may<00:00:56.460> be<00:00:56.520> more<00:00:56.879> severe<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.329> seriousness

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
may be more severe in seriousness

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.290 
may be more severe in seriousness
serious<00:00:59.219> than<00:00:59.460> we<00:00:59.609> would<00:00:59.760> expect<00:00:59.879> yeah<00:01:00.270> I

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
serious than we would expect yeah I

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.840 
serious than we would expect yeah I
think<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.989> that's<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.350> really<00:01:01.859> true<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.550> a

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
think that that's it really true I in a

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.240 
think that that's it really true I in a
way<00:01:03.000> Mars<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.690> almost<00:01:04.199> like<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.710> mosquito

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
way Mars is almost like the mosquito

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.300 
way Mars is almost like the mosquito
lightweight<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.110> Pluto<00:01:07.530> in

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
lightweight and and the Pluto in

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.490 
lightweight and and the Pluto in
Capricorn<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:09.420> almost<00:01:09.659> like<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.990> elephant

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
Capricorn is almost like the elephant

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.700 
Capricorn is almost like the elephant
it's<00:01:10.680> not<00:01:10.799> it's<00:01:11.760> like<00:01:12.000> Mars<00:01:12.750> can<00:01:13.049> tire<00:01:13.350> itself

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
it's not it's like Mars can tire itself

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.870 
it's not it's like Mars can tire itself
out<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:15.090> know<00:01:15.180> trying<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.840> move<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:17.250> elephant

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
out you know trying to move the elephant

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.899 
out you know trying to move the elephant
the<00:01:18.000> elephant<00:01:18.030> off<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:19.080> center<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.700> yet

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
the elephant off of center and and yet

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.120 
the elephant off of center and and yet
what's<00:01:21.390> really<00:01:21.810> interesting<00:01:22.110> here<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.860> that

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
what's really interesting here is that

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.330 
what's really interesting here is that
the<00:01:23.759> Virgo<00:01:24.450> moon<00:01:24.750> becomes<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.560> key<00:01:25.830> player<00:01:26.159> in

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
the Virgo moon becomes a key player in

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.300 
the Virgo moon becomes a key player in
this<00:01:26.610> because<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.479> Virgo<00:01:27.869> moon<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.829> once

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
this because the Virgo moon it once

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.179 
this because the Virgo moon it once
wants<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.119> do<00:01:30.390> what's<00:01:30.659> right<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.229> once<00:01:31.590> it's

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
wants to do what's right it once it's

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.580 
wants to do what's right it once it's
exacting<00:01:33.030> there's<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.420> there's<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.960> piece<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.290> it

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
exacting there's a there's a piece of it

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.969 
exacting there's a there's a piece of it
that<00:01:34.770> wants<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.159> get<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.549> right<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.060> yet<00:01:36.979> it's

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
that wants to get it right and yet it's

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.069 
that wants to get it right and yet it's
at<00:01:38.220> odds<00:01:38.520> with<00:01:38.850> everything<00:01:39.479> that's<00:01:39.630> going<00:01:39.780> on

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
at odds with everything that's going on

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.410 
at odds with everything that's going on
its<00:01:40.439> analysis<00:01:41.430> won't<00:01:41.670> get<00:01:41.850> us<00:01:41.970> through<00:01:42.240> this

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
its analysis won't get us through this

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.469 
its analysis won't get us through this
well<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.530> paradox<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.460> Virgo<00:01:44.790> moon<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.240> is

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
well the paradox of the Virgo moon is is

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.260 
well the paradox of the Virgo moon is is
that<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.990> can<00:01:46.259> be<00:01:46.530> analytical<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.460> narrow<00:01:47.909> in

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
that it can be analytical and narrow in

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.630 
that it can be analytical and narrow in
them<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.780> more<00:01:48.990> narrow<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:49.740> are<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.460> more

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
them the more narrow we are the more

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.880 
them the more narrow we are the more
irritated<00:01:51.329> were<00:01:51.450> likely<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.960> be<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.680> other

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
irritated were likely to be the other

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.310 
irritated were likely to be the other
side<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.729> Virgo<00:01:54.090> moon<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:54.600> immutable<00:01:54.990> or

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
side of the Virgo moon it's immutable or

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.109 
side of the Virgo moon it's immutable or
adaptable<00:01:55.950> earth<00:01:56.159> sign<00:01:56.520> which<00:01:56.729> means<00:01:56.969> it

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
adaptable earth sign which means it

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.090 
adaptable earth sign which means it
wants<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.630> be<00:01:57.659> practical<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.439> get<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.890> best

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
wants to be practical and get the best

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.280 
wants to be practical and get the best
results<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.969> can<00:02:00.240> even<00:02:00.659> under<00:02:01.140> in

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
results that it can even under in

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.499 
results that it can even under in
perfect<00:02:01.770> conditions<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.549> think<00:02:03.030> if<00:02:03.149> we<00:02:03.299> can

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
perfect conditions I think if we can

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.630 
perfect conditions I think if we can
find<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:04.170> little<00:02:04.439> bit<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.740> flexibility

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
find a little bit of that flexibility

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.730 
find a little bit of that flexibility
that<00:02:06.240> will<00:02:06.450> help<00:02:06.630> us<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.990> avoid<00:02:07.110> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
that will help us to avoid the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.100 
that will help us to avoid the
undesirable<00:02:08.729> consequences<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.780> we've<00:02:09.959> been

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
undesirable consequences that we've been

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.770 
undesirable consequences that we've been
talking<00:02:10.170> about<00:02:10.679> I'm<00:02:11.400> Jeff<00:02:11.700> shower<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.209> I'm
