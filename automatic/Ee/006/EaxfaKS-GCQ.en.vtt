00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.140
 Tank wagon is the name of wikipedia 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.510
 Are railway freight cars with an over 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.340
 several closed containers to the 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.590
 transport of liquids and gases 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.030
 be used 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.530
 Depending on the use, they will be in one 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.780
 particular tank or litter container 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.700
 equipped and dependent on 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.200
 loading weight as freight wagon with two 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.970
 sluggish or with two axes 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.230
 built 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.860
 the loading volume is depending on 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.330
 Version 20 to 120 cubic meters of 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.220
 interior of the boiler for liquid 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.350
 Transport is the name of the game 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.940
 always with vertically welded 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.420
 Sheet steel divided by mass 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.800
 Movements of the load good to diminish 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.000
 Tank wagons for the transport of gases are 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.800
 through a sunshade sheet metal before 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.200
 protected from direct sunlight 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.920
 Most of them are unloaded and unloaded by the 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.480
 floor from operable facilities 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.220
 rÃ¼ttgers tank wagons are in europe with 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.290
 an approximately 30 centimeters high 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.420
 moral longitudinal stripes 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.760
 enclosing the boiler at half height 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.709
 transferred to the markets in modern day 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.390
 That's the role model, among other things 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.010
 a car is because of his 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.290
 sun protection sheet metal for transport 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.700
 suitable for gases would be the role models 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.980
 the other two liquids 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.690
 transport 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.239
 common to all is the orange 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.890
 longitudinal stripes also have all the cars 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.480
 Replicas of fittings at the 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.370
 bottom which means that theirs 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.019
 loading and unloading models from below 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.850
 become 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:53.920
 The manufacturing condition is okay if you can 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.920
 disregards the restless running of a wheel 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.790
 the imprint is typical 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.380
 flawless 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.390
 according to merkel , the operating state 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.780
 In this French we dare five 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.660
 again 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.660
 That's the time from 1990 to 2006
