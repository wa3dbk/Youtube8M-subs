00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
holding it it's more like you're having

that<00:04:09.150> that<00:04:09.390> seems<00:04:09.690> totally<00:04:09.989> wasted<00:04:10.890> when<00:04:11.100> you

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
that that seems totally wasted when you

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.610 
that that seems totally wasted when you
have<00:04:11.459> to<00:04:11.700> wedge<00:04:12.000> his<00:04:12.239> entire<00:04:12.660> hand<00:04:13.019> into<00:04:13.500> the

moving<00:04:16.769> this<00:04:16.919> far<00:04:17.250> forwards<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.180> then<00:04:19.049> moves

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
moving this far forwards and then moves

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.779 
moving this far forwards and then moves
this<00:04:19.890> far<00:04:20.340> back<00:04:20.940> at<00:04:21.419> the<00:04:21.840> waist<00:04:22.140> there's

pieces that are glued on has upper leg

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.659 
pieces that are glued on has upper leg
rotation<00:04:31.750> then<00:04:32.169> there's<00:04:32.590> a<00:04:32.770> double-jointed

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
rotation then there's a double-jointed

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.839 
rotation then there's a double-jointed
knee<00:04:34.330> then<00:04:35.020> at<00:04:35.199> the<00:04:35.349> ankles<00:04:36.039> hinge<00:04:36.340> moving

knee then at the ankles hinge moving
backwards<00:04:37.360> and<00:04:37.509> forwards<00:04:38.080> all<00:04:38.289> be<00:04:38.500> inhibited

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
backwards and forwards all be inhibited

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.670 
backwards and forwards all be inhibited
again<00:04:39.550> by<00:04:39.759> an<00:04:39.909> armored<00:04:40.330> piece<00:04:40.599> on<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:41.020> foot<00:04:41.349> a

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
again by an armored piece on the foot a

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.670 
again by an armored piece on the foot a
slight<00:04:42.310> angle<00:04:42.729> pivot<00:04:43.150> and<00:04:43.360> toe<00:04:43.680> articulation
