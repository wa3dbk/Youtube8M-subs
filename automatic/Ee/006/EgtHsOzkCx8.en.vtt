episode like I think they probably
explained<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.320> think<00:02:55.800> they<00:02:55.890> did<00:02:56.220> but<00:02:56.400> I

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
explained it I think they did but I

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.670 
explained it I think they did but I

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.460 
think that this training will probably
take<00:03:52.800> around<00:03:53.580> like<00:03:53.910> maybe<00:03:54.180> three<00:03:55.019> to<00:03:55.170> four

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
take around like maybe three to four

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.280 
take around like maybe three to four
episodes<00:03:56.040> at<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.220> very<00:03:56.670> least<00:03:56.940> for<00:03:57.930> him<00:03:58.110> to
