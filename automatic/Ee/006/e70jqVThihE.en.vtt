let's<00:02:15.100> see<00:02:15.910> what<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.240> really<00:02:16.480> is<00:02:17.940> all<00:02:18.940> right

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
let's see what it really is all right

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.880 
let's see what it really is all right
that's<00:02:19.390> about<00:02:19.720> a

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:30.309 

cutting<00:02:22.760> surface<00:02:23.210> is<00:02:25.150> about<00:02:26.150> three

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.390 

three<00:02:31.069> and<00:02:31.189> eight<00:02:31.370> three<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.150> eight<00:02:32.359> inch

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
three and eight three and eight inch

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.970 
three and eight three and eight inch
inches<00:02:34.400> three<00:02:34.819> inches<00:02:35.260> in<00:02:36.260> an<00:02:36.469> eight<00:02:38.739> so<00:02:39.739> yeah

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
inches three inches in an eight so yeah

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.110 
inches three inches in an eight so yeah

if you want to include the flipper I

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.259 
if you want to include the flipper I
guess<00:02:41.329> that's<00:02:41.510> right<00:02:41.689> a<00:02:41.719> half<00:02:41.930> but<00:02:42.709> still<00:02:43.239> 3<00:02:44.239> &amp;

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
guess that's right a half but still 3 &amp;

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.229 
guess that's right a half but still 3 &amp;
eights<00:02:44.659> inch<00:02:44.959> cutting<00:02:45.590> surface<00:02:46.010> vs<00:02:46.909> the<00:02:47.060> blur
