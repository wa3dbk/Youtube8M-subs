00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
definitely different something like this

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.040 
definitely different something like this
and<00:02:37.490> I<00:02:37.520> have<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.700> definitely<00:02:38.180> take<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.600> toilet

and<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:40.190> sake<00:02:40.459> out<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:40.940> lay<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.209> rest<00:02:42.490> so

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
and the sake out to lay the rest so

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.550 
and the sake out to lay the rest so
might<00:02:43.730> as<00:02:43.790> well<00:02:43.850> start<00:02:44.300> doing<00:02:44.540> that<00:02:44.720> all<00:02:45.350> right

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
might as well start doing that all right

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.130 
might as well start doing that all right
with<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:46.070> sink<00:02:46.459> and<00:02:46.670> toilet<00:02:46.850> out<00:02:47.209> I<00:02:47.240> can<00:02:47.810> clean

that<00:03:22.670> actually<00:03:23.060> broke<00:03:24.100> but<00:03:25.100> it<00:03:25.130> broke<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:27.640> was

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
that actually broke but it broke and was

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.630 
that actually broke but it broke and was
perfect<00:03:29.030> for<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.239> plants<00:03:29.600> here<00:03:30.340> this<00:03:31.340> is<00:03:31.519> the

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
perfect for the plants here this is the

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.559 
perfect for the plants here this is the
other<00:03:31.820> piece

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
other piece

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.300 
other piece
I'm<00:03:34.409> gonna<00:03:34.590> have<00:03:34.799> to<00:03:35.069> sort<00:03:35.549> of<00:03:36.739> get<00:03:37.739> it<00:03:37.859> to<00:03:38.010> fit

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
I'm gonna have to sort of get it to fit

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.759 
I'm gonna have to sort of get it to fit
right<00:03:38.549> here<00:03:38.810> now<00:03:39.810> they<00:03:39.959> don't<00:03:40.109> recommend

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
right here now they don't recommend

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.720 
right here now they don't recommend
using<00:03:41.579> tell<00:03:42.030> snips<00:03:42.390> on<00:03:42.569> the<00:03:42.659> slate<00:03:42.959> and<00:03:43.730> the

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
using tell snips on the slate and the

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.610 
using tell snips on the slate and the
sense<00:03:44.969> that<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.209> voids<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.840> warranty

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
sense that it voids the warranty

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.390 
sense that it voids the warranty
so<00:03:47.659> I've<00:03:48.659> already<00:03:48.900> broken<00:03:49.290> so<00:03:49.739> why<00:03:49.890> not<00:03:50.069> try

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
so I've already broken so why not try

00:03:50.400 --> 00:04:15.500 
so I've already broken so why not try
right<00:04:01.069> guess<00:04:02.069> what<00:04:12.169> how<00:04:13.169> about<00:04:13.409> that<00:04:14.150> it<00:04:15.150> fits

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
right guess what how about that it fits

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.330 
right guess what how about that it fits
and<00:04:16.410> it<00:04:16.530> doesn't<00:04:16.829> really<00:04:16.919> make<00:04:17.130> any

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
and it doesn't really make any

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.890 
and it doesn't really make any
difference<00:04:17.370> because<00:04:18.060> it's<00:04:18.299> going<00:04:18.599> underneath

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
difference because it's going underneath

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.439 
difference because it's going underneath
the<00:04:19.079> toilet<00:04:19.320> anyways<00:04:19.829> we<00:04:20.370> all<00:04:20.519> broke<00:04:21.120> in<00:04:21.299> any

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
the toilet anyways we all broke in any

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.870 
the toilet anyways we all broke in any
way<00:04:21.630> that<00:04:21.810> it<00:04:21.870> wants<00:04:22.079> to<00:04:22.139> be<00:04:22.340> this<00:04:23.340> is<00:04:23.550> a<00:04:23.639> piece

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
way that it wants to be this is a piece

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.760 
way that it wants to be this is a piece
that<00:04:23.910> I<00:04:24.120> actually<00:04:24.300> did<00:04:24.690> not<00:04:24.930> like<00:04:25.169> it<00:04:25.380> did<00:04:25.560> not

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770
