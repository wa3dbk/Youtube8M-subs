I think the biggest thing is your staff

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.350 
I think the biggest thing is your staff
and<00:01:20.509> how<00:01:21.110> you<00:01:21.170> operate<00:01:21.710> as<00:01:22.070> a<00:01:22.100> coach<00:01:22.460> how<00:01:23.149> your

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
the kids I think that's the biggest

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.069 
the kids I think that's the biggest
thing<00:02:12.560> them<00:02:12.950> trusting<00:02:13.599> what<00:02:14.599> you're<00:02:14.810> teaching

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:15.079 
thing them trusting what you're teaching

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.860 
thing them trusting what you're teaching
and<00:02:15.829> just<00:02:16.459> showing<00:02:16.940> them<00:02:16.970> that<00:02:17.390> you<00:02:17.840> know

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
and just showing them that you know

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.900 
and just showing them that you know
pretty<00:02:18.799> much<00:02:18.920> know<00:02:19.250> what<00:02:19.430> you're<00:02:19.579> talking

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
pretty much know what you're talking

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.000 
pretty much know what you're talking
about<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.150> little<00:02:20.390> bit<00:02:20.569> about<00:02:20.780> basketball<00:02:21.109> but

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
about a little bit about basketball but

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.460 
about a little bit about basketball but
just<00:02:22.640> getting<00:02:22.880> a<00:02:23.030> feel<00:02:23.239> for<00:02:23.299> them<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:23.989> you

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
just getting a feel for them and you

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.039 
just getting a feel for them and you
know<00:02:24.590> as<00:02:24.859> they<00:02:25.400> develop<00:02:25.640> as<00:02:26.120> a<00:02:26.150> player<00:02:26.450> I<00:02:26.569> think

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
know as they develop as a player I think

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:28.930 
know as they develop as a player I think
the<00:02:27.170> relationship<00:02:27.319> will<00:02:28.069> continue<00:02:28.100> to<00:02:28.700> build

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
the relationship will continue to build

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.990 
the relationship will continue to build
and<00:02:29.209> I<00:02:30.049> think<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.530> biggest<00:02:30.709> thing<00:02:30.980> is<00:02:31.430> them

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
and I think the biggest thing is them

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.809 
and I think the biggest thing is them
building<00:02:32.480> trust<00:02:32.810> in<00:02:33.019> what<00:02:33.230> you're<00:02:33.410> teaching

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
building trust in what you're teaching

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.520 
building trust in what you're teaching
and<00:02:34.819> trying<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.299> help<00:02:35.480> them<00:02:35.600> through<00:02:36.049> you<00:02:36.410> know

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
and trying to help them through you know

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.370 
and trying to help them through you know
good<00:02:37.100> times<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.700> bad<00:02:37.790> because<00:02:38.450> I<00:02:38.660> think<00:02:38.959> in

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
good times and bad because I think in

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.039 
good times and bad because I think in
the<00:02:39.530> game<00:02:39.709> of<00:02:39.889> basketball<00:02:40.180> every<00:02:41.180> game<00:02:41.420> every

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
the game of basketball every game every

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.780 
the game of basketball every game every
practice<00:02:42.560> is<00:02:42.709> not<00:02:42.739> going<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.100> be<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.310> good<00:02:43.579> one

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
practice is not going to be a good one

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.360 
practice is not going to be a good one
and<00:02:43.940> just<00:02:44.209> how<00:02:44.600> you<00:02:44.660> respond<00:02:45.319> from<00:02:45.650> you<00:02:46.250> know

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
and just how you respond from you know

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.490 
and just how you respond from you know
that<00:02:46.639> practice<00:02:47.180> or<00:02:47.359> that<00:02:47.510> bad<00:02:47.720> game<00:02:48.049> that<00:02:48.350> you

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
that practice or that bad game that you

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.009 
that practice or that bad game that you
may<00:02:48.680> have<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:49.250> having<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.209> coaches<00:02:50.690> in<00:02:50.870> your

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
may have and having a coaches in your

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.289 
may have and having a coaches in your
corner<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:52.250> trying<00:02:52.639> to<00:02:52.760> continuing<00:02:53.269> to

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
corner and trying to continuing to

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:54.660 
corner and trying to continuing to
develop<00:02:53.480> them

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
develop them

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.410 
develop them
I<00:02:55.680> think<00:02:56.680> just<00:02:56.980> a<00:02:57.099> commitment<00:02:57.760> that<00:02:57.819> the

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
I think just a commitment that the

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.300 
I think just a commitment that the
university<00:02:59.080> is<00:02:59.110> put<00:02:59.590> as<00:02:59.800> far<00:03:00.040> as<00:03:00.160> the

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
university is put as far as the

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.970 
university is put as far as the
facilities<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.390> being<00:03:01.810> able<00:03:01.959> to<00:03:02.290> generate<00:03:02.739> a

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
facilities and being able to generate a

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.790 
facilities and being able to generate a
lot<00:03:03.430> of<00:03:03.459> excitement<00:03:03.940> around<00:03:04.239> that<00:03:04.720> and<00:03:05.530> then

brings<00:03:21.850> energy<00:03:22.120> into<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.140> program<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:23.680> I

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
think that the biggest thing has been

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.540 
think that the biggest thing has been
how<00:03:27.850> coach<00:03:28.209> miles<00:03:28.510> has<00:03:28.900> been<00:03:29.140> able<00:03:29.319> to<00:03:29.709> connect

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
how coach miles has been able to connect

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.449 
how coach miles has been able to connect

with the fans he does a great job with
that<00:03:33.519> there's<00:03:34.390> a<00:03:34.510> lot<00:03:34.660> of<00:03:34.720> excitement<00:03:35.230> around

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
that there's a lot of excitement around

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.220 
that there's a lot of excitement around
the<00:03:35.860> basket<00:03:36.069> basketball<00:03:36.910> and<00:03:37.150> what<00:03:37.989> Coach

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.449 
miles even did in this first year and
now<00:03:40.720> moving<00:03:41.049> forward<00:03:41.650> hopefully<00:03:41.860> we<00:03:42.280> can

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
now moving forward hopefully we can
