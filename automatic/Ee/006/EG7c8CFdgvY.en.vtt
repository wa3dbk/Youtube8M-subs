00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.040
 very good to all welcome to this 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.290
 new big video photo 5 in which os 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.330
 I bring the analysis of the new dlc that goes 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.820
 to leave generally not only the new dlc 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.890
 that would be the one of the high life update but 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.900
 also of the updates that are 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.980
 they will include throughout the spring of 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.029
 We all wanted to comment on the 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.650
 news because you already know that 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.449
 news I put on my twitter according to 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.529
 they leave or for those who do not for the 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.500
 do not know that I have twitter there 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.670
 Then I'll leave it there and remind you that I 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.929
 follow if you want to be aware of 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.340
 all the news but the video 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:35.199
 I wanted to dedicate rather to make a 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.280
 analysis more than anything focusing on the 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.530
 points you have not mentioned 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.970
 practically nobody but before video 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.530
 you have asked is that you have not 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.930
 real and you like it with nothing but 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.159
 add we start first I 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.780
 I would like to mention that the week that 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:48.670
 and this week is coming in now 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.619
 this Monday during this week we are going to 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.229
 have the update of the creator of 

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:55.180
 capture items this means 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:56.799
 which of course the creator is delayed 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.570
 of missions that we would have already not 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:00.159
 they had mentioned a long time ago 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.080
 months that a creator was going to include us 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:03.879
 of missions because this is not delayed 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.110
 is going to arrive in spring we hope that 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.580
 yes it comes in summer but I do not either 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.530
 I believe it, I think that in summer they will 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.600
 other things so for me that's going to 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.350
 go to fall to realize that as soon as 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.299
 take us out that we go 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.560
 the possibility of creating in missions that 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:16.210
 the missions is a I believe that the most 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.799
 important of all not only missions but 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.150
 that we can also create blows 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.680
 but let's in any case it would be what 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.290
 first we would have if they do not have more 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.790
 analysis that to mention that because good 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.020
 well I do not know to analyze a lot of all 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.970
 We hope that with this new 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.250
 creator of catch missions will 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.630
 put more interesting items of the 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.680
 that we are seeing so far because yes 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.990
 It is true that at the beginning we saw 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.729
 incredible games very novel but 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.920
 already like that you can not innovate 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.600
 So much so that he is leaving to play 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.880
 both the personalized games and it 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.159
 is starting to lose a bit of those 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.659
 desire to create games are now created 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.190
 less than ever so let's hope that 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.110
 with this new update for the 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.819
 creator come back to relive all that by 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.280
 course another important point 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:55.810
 maybe the one that more of all this that we 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.850
 would announce rockstar for spring 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.110
 would be the blows to the banks and is that 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.940
 they tell us that it will come as 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.369
 as of late logically on 20 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.799
 June would be the last day of spring and 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.840
 it is absolutely unlikely that it is that 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.420
 day it is probably over May 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.160
 when this new one is released 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.540
 update this new dlc that already 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.250
 we will come waiting from the exit of the 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.540
 game that is already late by itself 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.969
 but good 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.530
 at the end they already tell us that the date to 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:21.579
 cap on what we're going to have with what 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.530
 which we do not have to worry about 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:26.230
 too much but really the strong point 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.150
 of this of these updates 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.519
 this news given us rockstar is 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.989
 in the explanation of high life or high 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.640
 life food day in which they included 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.310
 the vehicles that we had mentioned 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.379
 days ago on this channel would be the dew 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.849
 waltz massacred that we can see well a 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.980
 small modification made with photoshop 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.239
 to see some colors and one more 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.739
 novel yet but that also 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.980
 we would have would be the drawbacks mentioned and 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.689
 environment that is brutal is super sports 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.040
 and of course new ones are the fairies that 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:52.900
 tells us there would be a third vehicle 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.730
 although we are not mentioned what it is but 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.799
 surely it's lennox handley 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.450
 that it was the third filtering vehicle that 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.489
 there was something else on this list that has not 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.260
 mentioned a lot of people and that commented 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.090
 a few days ago with my partner object 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.889
 invaders is that we also to vicente and 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.299
 are going to include new apartments we 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:08.889
 olives of the news the timeshare 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.720
 they gave us but they also told us 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.579
 they will give the possibility to buy 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.139
 new apartments that was his filtering 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.819
 some time ago what would they be but good 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.489
 well they will make rockstar confirm us 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.379
 that yes they are going to launch other of the 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.630
 novelties that we would have would be the rifle 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.940
 bull book based on the header 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.620
 5 a quite powerful rifle actually 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.570
 we would be included new clothes in him 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.980
 include the trust estate which is a 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.360
 new bike that we do not have any kind of 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.670
 information because it would also be new 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.530
 in the saga of course the long awaited 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.930
 that would be the timeshare the ability 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.240
 to have up to two different houses two 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.560
 apartments each with its garage 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.200
 ten squares with which we could 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.580
 have up to 20 cars stored are we 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.990
 includes the status feature 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.290
 mental to know if our players 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.430
 they are killers or they are going to leave us 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.870
 quiet in starting and also 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.390
 would add new lists of items 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.190
 missions in death games racing 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.140
 in general, I suppose they include us 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.490
 a little bit of every other thing that is 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.830
 had set some people but that 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.900
 it really is not true is that the photo 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.390
 that appears in the cars we would see so much 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.040
 the pegasus around to the right in red 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.560
 on the left we would see the dew waltz 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.750
 slaughtered and just back we see a car a 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.760
 mysterious car that since they tell us 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.410
 that there are three cars that include us 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.420
 it could be perfectly is the 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.520
 third car if we approach is a 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.950
 off-road could be correctly 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.480
 LanÃºs Hanley is not really about 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.980
 lanÃºs hanley but it's about lobby 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.570
 and I paint a car that is already in the 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.139
 fire with which this does not correspond to the 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.550
 tc 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.050
 car that is not included at the moment 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.909
 to be a surprise and we have to wait 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.800
 to the release of the update for 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:37.539
 whether it is actually the law or hand 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.159
 another one also warns us that 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.259
 it's going to include someone else's this high 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:44.169
 life and state some features 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:46.449
 new ones will leave some clichÃ©s will 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.729
 will add more money some kind of 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:50.770
 items insignificant things 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.779
 although it will also include a new 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.159
 way to careers we would have the 

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:56.259
 gta racing we would have the charges 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:58.120
 normal the rally races but it 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:00.039
 would include the new mode where without 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.960
 contact and this module that you are going to do is 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.879
 that practically then we can go through 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.979
 the rest of the competitors' cars 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:08.319
 we imagine that we are competing two 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.879
 people, you can not hit him 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:11.590
 you will cross it is practically for 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:13.719
 avoid all that madness that is sometimes 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.370
 because a lot of people try to play 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:17.289
 destroy the other not to not win the 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.300
 another instead of to win you try that 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.430
 he loses the other one because this new one is 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.099
 way I would avoid that because a lot of people who 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.599
 gets pissed off when they hit him on a wheel and 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:26.830
 it's true that good once in a while 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.449
 may have thank you but other times 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.310
 because it becomes a little heavy that 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:32.889
 are giving all the time to take you 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.409
 the road and this new way it is 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:37.479
 mostly focused on those people who do not 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:39.069
 what happens to that would also add the 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:40.749
 feature that we could call 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:42.819
 to the leicester to ask the police to 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:44.709
 do not bother them for a while something useful 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:46.330
 although to do that kind of thing I 

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:48.039
 I think it's already in individual mode and 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.419
 we can do whatever we want and 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:50.830
 do the trick of removing the level of 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:52.419
 search but good in any case 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.339
 well, it can also become final 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:55.839
 misfortunes and delays what would be the 

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:57.669
 creator of emissions that I mentioned 

00:05:55.839 --> 00:06:00.369
 before it was delayed also the dlc of the 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:02.159
 campaign expanding this story and 

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:04.269
 He was also delayed the right to 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:06.339
 murders and between the flight school 

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:07.809
 in surely they are thrown along 

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:09.309
 summer or like that of 100 the creator of 

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:10.959
 missions throughout autumn 

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:12.550
 still do not know so we're going to have 

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:14.169
 what to expect to know last and 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.659
 as a novelty that I wanted to add to my 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:18.550
 videos is a photo a photo that you make 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:21.069
 you in gta with the snap matic 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.719
 or the camera of the game and make a 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:24.069
 photo can already be an artistic photo of 

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:26.439
 a landscape can be yours 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:28.300
 falling from an accident that you have seen 

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:30.249
 something interesting something that can 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.099
 interesting if you give me my twitter at 

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:34.389

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:39.789

00:06:37.179 --> 00:06:41.050

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:41.680
 I know how it's going to be and maybe it's just 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.660
 sharply 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.940

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.500
