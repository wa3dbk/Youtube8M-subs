00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.879
 the spots on the skin that are cause for 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.160
 concern for men and women who 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.690

 the member spots of society 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.369
 Colombian dermatology and what does 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.380
 part of the medical association of the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.480
 andes' doctor angelic dominguez there 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.430
 many people who suffer from spots in 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.849
 the skin what kind of spots there are 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.320
 There are two big types of spots 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.719
 some generated by the sun by the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.480
 the passage of time and others generated 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.180
 by hormones contraceptives the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.590
 that get worse with pregnancy then 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.809
 each one has a type of treatment 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.510
 different and what are the treatments 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.090
 for each kind of good stain the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.579
 spots that are by the passage of time and 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.620
 by the sun we usually focus on 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.870
 treatments that generate exfoliation 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.030
 superficial skin replacement of the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.039
 cells that are stained then 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.680
 we use chemical peels for example 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.420
 we use the combination with laser and 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.040
 this works very well on the other hand 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.360
 there are spots very societies of 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.450
 the hormones that require 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.100
 and much more special because they are so much 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.690
 more difficult to remove angelic doctor 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.580
 domínguez habanos that to improve the 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.980
 aspect of the spots you have to tell 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.870
 with a specialized team for those who 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.120
 you have this technology tell us a 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.370
 little more of that but the most important 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.680
 when we have a stain is to advise us 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.390
 of a specialist dermatologist a 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.950
 person who can guide us about the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.930
 type of stain we have and the solution 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.210
 that we can have not all the spots 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.460
 they work in the same way not all 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.110
 the spots respond equally well to 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.150
 all the treatments then it is 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.950
 important to determine what type of stain 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.140
 the origin of that stain and power 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.670
 establish the treatment that we are going to 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.950
 use we have at our disposal 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.420
 Various dermocosmetic procedures 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.650
 several laser procedures that are going 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.330
 to help give solution to our 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.640
 patients is important that's why 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.840
 establish what type of stain you have and 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.740
 what treatment option can we 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.990
 offer it 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.310
 very good doctor and this treatment for 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.610
 the spots can be applied to any 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.740
 body area really if we have to 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.940
 establish what type of stain has 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.830
 because not all treatments 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.450
 they work in all the same spots 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.430
 but we can try for example spots 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.020
 in the armpits spots on the groin 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.570
 marches on the neck 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.980
 like list and that so uncomfortable doctor 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.080
 there are many people that at this moment 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.330
 surely they are seeing us from their 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.790
 houses from their jobs that have been 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.260
 looking for a solution to their spots and 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.030
 they could not have a result 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.100
 satisfactory can be eliminated 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.470
 any type of spots what is the 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.170
 message to them the most important thing is 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.490
 consult a dermatologist 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.930

 has and can offer several 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.170
 treatment options as I say no 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.820
 all the spots respond equally to 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.650
 all the treatments then it is 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.900
 important to customize the treatment 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.760
