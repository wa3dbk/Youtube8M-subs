at the end of time tunnel when you die

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.140 
at the end of time tunnel when you die
is<00:02:46.710> it<00:02:46.980> mean<00:02:47.130> you're<00:02:47.250> coming<00:02:47.460> out<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:47.790> another

is it mean you're coming out of another
vagina<00:02:48.630> so<00:02:49.500> I'm<00:02:49.620> guessing<00:02:49.800> that<00:02:49.950> same<00:02:50.340> like

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
vagina so I'm guessing that same like

vagina so I'm guessing that same like
when<00:02:50.910> you're<00:02:51.030> coming<00:02:51.330> like<00:02:51.540> when<00:02:51.660> you're

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
when you're coming like when you're

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.110 
when you're coming like when you're
dying<00:02:52.020> you're<00:02:52.650> seeing<00:02:52.920> light<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.790> can<00:02:53.970> be<00:02:54.030> the

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
dying you're seeing light it can be the

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.640 
dying you're seeing light it can be the
same<00:02:54.270> as<00:02:54.480> coming<00:02:54.840> out<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.020> a<00:02:55.080> vagina<00:02:55.200> and

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
same as coming out of a vagina and

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.370 
same as coming out of a vagina and
seeing<00:02:55.860> light<00:02:56.010> but<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.280> first<00:02:56.490> time<00:02:56.730> i<00:02:57.380> don't
