00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
as a core M processing power from Intel

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.850 
as a core M processing power from Intel
so<00:01:57.600> it's<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.810> fully<00:01:58.020> functional<00:01:58.530> notebook

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
so it's a fully functional notebook

know some of the some of the features
inside<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.590> mentioned<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.890> core<00:02:05.040> temp

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
inside you mentioned the core temp

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.940 
inside you mentioned the core temp
processor<00:02:05.579> but<00:02:05.820> what<00:02:06.299> about<00:02:06.619> storage<00:02:07.619> RAM

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
processor but what about storage RAM

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.540 
processor but what about storage RAM
things<00:02:08.369> I

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
things I

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.450 
things I
at<00:02:09.200> storage<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.410> RAM<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.770> depends<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
at storage and RAM it depends on the

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.710 
at storage and RAM it depends on the
configuration<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.150> all<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.450> things<00:02:12.570> you'd

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
expect in a notebook you can get on the

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.520 
expect in a notebook you can get on the
on<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:15.000> x2<00:02:15.300> ten<00:02:15.480> eleven<00:02:15.780> series<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:16.410> this

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
on the x2 ten eleven series so this

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.380 
on the x2 ten eleven series so this
really<00:02:16.710> is<00:02:16.860> like<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.190> true<00:02:17.490> business<00:02:18.210> class

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
wireless technology it expect and we've

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.180 
wireless technology it expect and we've
got<00:02:45.990> a<00:02:46.020> couple<00:02:46.230> different<00:02:46.470> configurations

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
got a couple different configurations

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.800 
got a couple different configurations
here<00:02:47.280> but<00:02:47.490> what<00:02:47.760> does<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.120> battery<00:02:48.300> life<00:02:48.600> look

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
here but what does the battery life look

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.050 
here but what does the battery life look
like<00:02:48.960> the<00:02:49.650> all-day<00:02:50.190> battery<00:02:50.460> life<00:02:50.700> so<00:02:50.940> you're

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
like the all-day battery life so you're

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.900 
like the all-day battery life so you're
gonna<00:02:51.150> get<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:52.220> full<00:02:53.220> day<00:02:53.400> out<00:02:53.550> of<00:02:53.580> this<00:02:53.730> without
