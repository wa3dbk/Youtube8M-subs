the<00:03:04.680> only<00:03:05.010> answer<00:03:05.400> I<00:03:05.459> can<00:03:05.670> give<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:05.970> is<00:03:06.150> that

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
the only answer I can give you is that

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.900 
the only answer I can give you is that
when<00:03:07.770> an<00:03:07.860> oil<00:03:08.010> town<00:03:08.370> turret<00:03:08.760> were

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
when an oil town turret were

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.610 
when an oil town turret were
manufacturing<00:03:09.569> company<00:03:10.020> and<00:03:10.200> we<00:03:10.290> are<00:03:10.319> still

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
manufacturing company and we are still

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.410 
manufacturing company and we are still
in<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:10.920> infancy<00:03:11.250> stages

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
in the infancy stages

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.050 
in the infancy stages
and<00:03:12.780> five<00:03:12.990> years<00:03:13.230> ago<00:03:13.500> was<00:03:13.770> right<00:03:14.040> with<00:03:15.030> a

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
and five years ago was right with a

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.090 
and five years ago was right with a
couple<00:03:15.390> broken<00:03:15.720> Reinders<00:03:16.200> doing<00:03:16.860> everything

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
couple broken Reinders doing everything

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.190 
couple broken Reinders doing everything
by<00:03:17.370> hand

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
by hand

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.640 
by hand
and<00:03:18.440> now<00:03:18.680> we<00:03:18.740> have<00:03:19.069> approximately<00:03:20.000> 20

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
and now we have approximately 20

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.030 
and now we have approximately 20
and<00:03:21.579> that<00:03:21.700> made<00:03:21.909> amazing<00:03:22.900> strides<00:03:23.170> to<00:03:23.890> have<00:03:24.010> a

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
and that made amazing strides to have a

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.670 
and that made amazing strides to have a
warrior<00:03:24.430> in<00:03:24.610> machine

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
warrior in machine

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.620 
warrior in machine
things<00:03:26.010> that<00:03:26.280> I<00:03:26.489> still<00:03:27.090> shook<00:03:27.329> my<00:03:27.480> head

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.030 

so<00:03:30.200> things<00:03:31.070> we've<00:03:31.280> done<00:03:31.430> together<00:03:31.610> we<00:03:31.970> are<00:03:32.000> now

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
so things we've done together we are now

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.570 
so things we've done together we are now
at

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
at

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.250 
at
our<00:03:35.120> productivity

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
our productivity

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.119 
our productivity
but<00:03:36.799> that<00:03:37.580> love<00:03:37.790> are<00:03:37.970> nice<00:03:38.150> so<00:03:38.689> much<00:03:38.900> that<00:03:39.650> the

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
orders coming in

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.120 
orders coming in
much<00:03:42.510> more<00:03:42.750> quickly<00:03:42.990> than<00:03:43.170> we<00:03:43.380> can<00:03:43.470> debug<00:03:43.890> at

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
much more quickly than we can debug at

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.230 
much more quickly than we can debug at
this<00:03:44.370> point

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.240 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.350
