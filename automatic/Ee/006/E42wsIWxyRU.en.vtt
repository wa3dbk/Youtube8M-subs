past them the actors that I know when
they<00:01:51.640> watched<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.060> film<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.359> first<00:01:52.600> time<00:01:52.840> all

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079

they watched the film the first time all
they<00:01:53.380> say<00:01:53.619> is<00:01:53.649> where's<00:01:54.399> that<00:01:54.549> where's<00:01:54.759> that

they say is where's that where's that

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.730 
they say is where's that where's that
great<00:01:55.149> bit<00:01:55.329> that<00:01:55.539> I<00:01:55.659> did<00:01:56.020> what<00:01:56.200> happened<00:01:56.560> to

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
great bit that I did what happened to

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.620 
great bit that I did what happened to
that<00:01:56.889> bit<00:01:57.159> essentially<00:01:57.819> do<00:01:58.030> you<00:01:58.119> notice<00:01:58.299> lots

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
that bit essentially do you notice lots

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.709 
that bit essentially do you notice lots
of<00:01:58.749> bits<00:01:58.929> that<00:01:59.109> are<00:01:59.289> gone<00:02:00.039> you<00:02:01.030> do<00:02:01.210> you<00:02:01.539> I<00:02:01.569> mean

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719 
of bits that are gone you do you I mean

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:04.440 
of bits that are gone you do you I mean
you<00:02:02.079> do<00:02:02.619> so<00:02:02.770> sit<00:02:02.950> like<00:02:03.069> oh<00:02:03.310> my<00:02:03.880> god<00:02:04.060> where<00:02:04.270> did<00:02:04.359> I

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
you do so sit like oh my god where did I

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.330 
you do so sit like oh my god where did I
go<00:02:04.689> where<00:02:05.049> is<00:02:05.170> it<00:02:05.380> it's<00:02:05.770> not<00:02:05.950> there<00:02:06.130> anymore

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
go where is it it's not there anymore

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.340 
go where is it it's not there anymore
but<00:02:06.520> you<00:02:06.850> know<00:02:06.969> I<00:02:07.270> think<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.659> fourth<00:02:07.899> one<00:02:08.110> has

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
but you know I think the fourth one has

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.139 
but you know I think the fourth one has
such<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:08.619> huge<00:02:09.099> sort<00:02:09.369> of<00:02:09.399> plot<00:02:09.670> you<00:02:10.060> know

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
such a huge sort of plot you know

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.300 
such a huge sort of plot you know
there's<00:02:10.420> enough<00:02:10.690> for<00:02:10.929> three<00:02:11.530> films<00:02:11.890> in<00:02:11.950> itself

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
there's enough for three films in itself

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.820 
there's enough for three films in itself
just<00:02:12.760> purely<00:02:13.000> in<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.420> one

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
just purely in the one

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.640 
just purely in the one
we<00:02:13.950> have<00:02:14.070> made<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.460> they<00:02:14.580> have<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.970> be<00:02:15.650> Lisa

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
we have made that they have to be Lisa

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.160 
we have made that they have to be Lisa
and<00:02:16.950> what<00:02:17.370> gets<00:02:17.520> cut<00:02:17.790> but<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.090> do<00:02:18.150> think<00:02:18.420> you

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
and what gets cut but I do think you

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.870 
and what gets cut but I do think you
know<00:02:19.260> they've<00:02:19.410> chosen<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.430> best<00:02:20.610> bits

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
know they've chosen the the best bits

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.690 
know they've chosen the the best bits
and<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:22.290> bits<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.680> really<00:02:22.890> intervene<00:02:23.100> when

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
and the bits that really intervene when

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.580 
and the bits that really intervene when
I<00:02:23.730> was<00:02:23.880> rewatching<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.720> was<00:02:25.140> sort<00:02:25.320> of<00:02:25.350> going

I was rewatching it I was sort of going

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.020 
I was rewatching it I was sort of going

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
you'd get to a certain scene and I was

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.670 
you'd get to a certain scene and I was
reminded<00:02:27.780> of<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.960> scene<00:02:28.110> that<00:02:28.140> was<00:02:28.320> coming<00:02:28.590> up

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680

along you know you have to walk down a

something exciting is gonna happen
suppose<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.740> mix<00:02:59.070> okay<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.670> healthy<00:03:00.330> mix<00:03:00.540> of

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
suppose a mix okay a healthy mix of

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.390 
suppose a mix okay a healthy mix of
those<00:03:00.900> that's<00:03:01.200> good<00:03:01.440> if<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:01.950> have<00:03:02.070> too<00:03:02.250> many

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
those that's good if you have too many

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.850 
those that's good if you have too many
of<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.700> days<00:03:03.020> when<00:03:04.020> you're<00:03:04.350> just<00:03:04.530> doing

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
of the days when you're just doing

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.140 
of the days when you're just doing
nothing<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.280> sort<00:03:05.490> of<00:03:05.550> just<00:03:05.730> walking<00:03:05.910> on

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
nothing and sort of just walking on

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.740 
nothing and sort of just walking on
corridors

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
corridors

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.870 
corridors
if<00:03:06.990> it's<00:03:07.170> too<00:03:07.320> much<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:07.530> that<00:03:07.800> then<00:03:08.430> you<00:03:08.700> sort

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
if it's too much of that then you sort

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.250 
if it's too much of that then you sort
of<00:03:09.000> then<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:09.270> get<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.600> a<00:03:09.630> big<00:03:09.810> scene<00:03:10.020> and<00:03:10.140> you

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
of then you get to a big scene and you

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.960 
of then you get to a big scene and you
go<00:03:10.350> I<00:03:10.530> don't<00:03:11.220> know<00:03:11.280> what<00:03:11.400> to<00:03:11.490> do<00:03:11.610> now

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
go I don't know what to do now

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.820 
go I don't know what to do now
you<00:03:12.420> should<00:03:12.630> possibly<00:03:13.020> get<00:03:13.320> a<00:03:13.350> bit<00:03:13.530> complacent

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
you should possibly get a bit complacent

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.820 
you should possibly get a bit complacent
but<00:03:14.580> I<00:03:14.640> mean<00:03:14.850> so<00:03:14.970> a<00:03:15.000> nice<00:03:15.209> mix<00:03:15.540> of<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.870> two<00:03:16.500> is

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
but I mean so a nice mix of the two is

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.070 
but I mean so a nice mix of the two is
is<00:03:17.070> quite<00:03:17.310> good<00:03:17.490> do<00:03:18.330> you<00:03:18.420> how<00:03:18.630> much<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:18.870> the

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
is quite good do you how much of the

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.110 
is quite good do you how much of the
special<00:03:19.440> effects<00:03:19.739> of<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.250> final<00:03:20.670> result<00:03:21.000> do

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120

a<00:04:20.340> huge<00:04:20.880> moment<00:04:21.209> in<00:04:21.590> comparison<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.650> whole

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
a huge moment in comparison the whole

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.070 
a huge moment in comparison the whole
four<00:04:23.190> four<00:04:23.669> films<00:04:24.060> have<00:04:24.210> been<00:04:24.300> made<00:04:24.509> sort<00:04:25.050> of
