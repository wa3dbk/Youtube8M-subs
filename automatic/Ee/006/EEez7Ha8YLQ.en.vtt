 Hello everyone, this time we will analyze 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.540
 Prokhorovka map in the mode of such defense 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.140
 and also remind our universal 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.670
 setup 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:14.120
 these are two bulldogs 2 out of 3 50100 and 1390 and 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.800
 ru 251 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.630
 the card is very small and too 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.730
 embossed so if you take center 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.720
 maps then we appear immediately very 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.300

 50100 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.430
 immediately tightened on the center closer to the railway. 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.340
 our ru 251 takes this position 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.870
 from here there is an overview of the entire map and here 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.219
 he can shoot at tanks which 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.579
 could be exposed in the center 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.789
 our 1390 makes such a circle to us 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.860
 will show where opponents are leaving 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:50.100
 our two bulldogs go like this 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.010
 way the village now we have a very 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.500

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.510

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.799
 continue playing first base if 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.040
 the enemy goes to the village 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.890
 then we need to drive en 251 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.030

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.010
 our two iS-3s take these positions here 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.079
