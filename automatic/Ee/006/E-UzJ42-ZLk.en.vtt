00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello friends with you day with name hen 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.089
 about four weeks ago I 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.490
 voiced you your goal to reach 6 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.460
 percent body fat at that stage 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.440
 I was 10 and 2 tenths of a percent I 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.940
 was telling the release of super food like me 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.859
 feeding on aiming for this goal 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.779
 releases super fitness we all the time 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.000
 talking about training and I trained 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.789
 of the schemes that I share with you so 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.410
 here are four weeks ended i can 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.199
 tell you what happened 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.300
 It turned out firstly the percentage of fat now 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.610
 seven and a half that is not 6 like me 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.149
 planned really so fast 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.100
 4 weeks 4 percent not clean in 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.840
 The first course to enter the rhythm was very 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.579
 difficult that is, you understand something 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.590
 the number of violations that has accumulated 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.510
 food they have all the quality 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.820
 psychological relief in the same way 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.710
 they are and I have these disorders very much 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.680
 Much you think that you are in general 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.590
 keep discipline but one violation 2 3 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.059
 4 and a lot of them during the day I removed 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.750
 most but some violations 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.400
 left after the first two weeks 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.740
 instead of ten percent was 9 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.510
 I realized that no such pace 6 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.700
 percent over the next two weeks 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.560
 but simply out of the question and then 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.479
 almost stopped violating 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.610
 maybe one kind of violation in 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.380
 during the day it was allowed but in general I am 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.720
 time remained below 200 grams 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.909
 carbohydrates per day and at around 200 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.750
 220 grams of protein what happened is you 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.240
 see now 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.850
 weight 100 kilograms exactly 70 half 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.829
 percent subcutaneous fat I started with 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.770
 ten two percent subcutaneous fat 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.840
 without 100 45 I trained on average 6 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.729
 once a week sometimes it worked twice 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.460
 per day but very rarely that is so i would 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.229
 said that from six days a week twice 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.960
 a day I trained maybe two three 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.030
 times this is not something that these two hours 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.520
 in the morning 2 hours in the evening it can be 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.590
 half an hour once and there half an hour 2 1 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.140
 that is , a total of more than two 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.509
 hours a day I did not do this 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.990
 take into account and cardio load and village wars 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.990
 huge 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.330
 What about nutrition as I said proteins 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.280
 there were 200 220 grams maximum 230 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.180
 probably at least one hundred and sixty 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.210
 one hundred seventy 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.300
 Carbohydrates I've been higher for two weeks 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.700
 200 grams no cardio at all 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.320
 it was about 20-30 minutes a day 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.320
 well that's all the result
