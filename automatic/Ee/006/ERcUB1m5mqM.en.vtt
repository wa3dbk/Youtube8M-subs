00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.630 

originally<00:01:04.750> New<00:01:04.989> River<00:01:05.170> mining<00:01:05.740> and<00:01:06.100> I<00:01:06.430> made

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
originally New River mining and I made

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.070 
originally New River mining and I made
it<00:01:06.760> into<00:01:07.060> Hudson<00:01:07.450> cool<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:09.220> it's<00:01:09.580> also<00:01:10.510> Walters

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
it into Hudson cool so it's also Walters

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.469 
it into Hudson cool so it's also Walters
kit<00:01:11.320> but<00:01:11.440> this<00:01:11.650> was<00:01:11.830> really<00:01:12.580> hard<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.150> find

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
kit but this was really hard to find

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.760 
kit but this was really hard to find
like<00:01:13.870> I<00:01:14.020> took<00:01:14.320> me<00:01:14.710> days<00:01:15.400> to<00:01:15.460> find<00:01:16.030> this<00:01:16.470> days<00:01:17.470> on

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
like I took me days to find this days on

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.090 
like I took me days to find this days on
the<00:01:17.890> internet<00:01:18.250> two<00:01:18.370> days<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.930> it's<00:01:20.920> really

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
the internet two days so it's really

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.030 
the internet two days so it's really
hard<00:01:21.340> to<00:01:21.430> find<00:01:22.500> then<00:01:23.500> next<00:01:24.160> we<00:01:24.460> have<00:01:24.869> walthers

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
hard to find then next we have walthers

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.640 
hard to find then next we have walthers
merchants<00:01:27.040> row<00:01:27.100> three<00:01:29.580> and<00:01:31.080> then<00:01:32.080> next<00:01:32.350> to
