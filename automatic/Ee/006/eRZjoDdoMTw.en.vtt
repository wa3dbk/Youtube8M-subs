00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.540
 save everything in the dispatcher itself are 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.320
 Doctor wise we are here today with a new one 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:15.020
 video dedicated to nba gk 15 we are 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.219
 continuing the career with mei gm se 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.320
 in the play offs 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.660
 we are in the first round racer conference 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.690
 with our detroit pistons they are 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.860
 facing the cleveland cavs and we are in 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.400
 race 3 and race 3 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.830
 after the absolute debacle of race 2 after 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.029
 a race1 that is decided with the shot 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.309
 at the end of lebron james 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.559
 back home and we are already back to the 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.780
 wall because losing would mean going 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.710
 under 3 0 and win four in a row 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.560
 which is quite impossible therefore 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.690
 I would say race 3 fundamental for the series e 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.430
 this race3 doesn't start very well because 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.680
 gallinari that my wing anyway 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.320
 small owner has had problems 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.180
 physical so I could only deploy it 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.890
 a few minutes because you know vi 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.329
 they say the player can play but if 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.579
 play the injured cards too much 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.280
 so don't risk too much 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.680
 I put it in reduced time I did 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.900
 play other players gave more 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.909
 minutes to green with two pops etc. 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.979
 etc. here maybe low quintets for 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.930
 try to embarrass the cubs 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.120
 that above all with irving they are me 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.430
 doing your ass enough anyway 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.750
 let's talk about the real playoffs we saw 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.190
 in prediction last week then 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.530
 you know everything has changed especially 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.780
 west because in the west it was a case in 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.960
 absurd in the east good or bad were similar to 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.900
 the ones we talk about those that 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.510
 we spoke last week and today 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.250
 the first and trans of competitions was played 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.080
 because anyway all went 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.430
 races with at least one match in 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.720
 how historic this video is 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.330
 then Monday 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.250
 let's start with those on Saturday with one 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.350
 challenge between willer and rappers concludes 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.990
 over time not a beautiful game 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.030
 I must say I then saw the highlights 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.180
 I didn't know there was a free trial 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.340
 of league because in any case not one 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.310
 great game to say the raptors and 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.810
 in the overtime they scored 4 points and there 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.180
 they have all scored in the last 30 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.350
 seconds if I'm not mistaken then not one 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.329
 great game 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.250
 maybe the rappers a little bit of 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:12.980
 inexperience compared to paul pierce that 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.569
 was if not the decisive player for 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.030
 race one of the wizards so yes 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.709
 take the field factor now tender 2 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.599
 it is already decisive 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.599
 I expect toronto's reaction then 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.459
 I would not be surprised to see maybe a 1 to 1 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.319
 the game I saw on Saturday instead 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.390
 night was the one between and warriors 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.020
 pelican ring between carrie against 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.750
 anthony davis a strange match of mine 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.160
 opinion the warriors have gone a little 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.959
 drawn because they sometimes attacked 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.780
 really well other times have made one 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.030
 series of gruesome davis attacks 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.430
 he started off a little bad for the pelicans 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.379
 surely the inexperience paid then 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.190
 in the last quarter he set up on his own 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:54.709
 in moments he could not tell to win 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.220
 however, the game has reported 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.349
 under the pelicans because they were less than 15 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.319
 also they have been and have come to less 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.239
 4 so a good game but what harry 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.250
 and his newspapers are stronger as 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.800
 can expect everyone I believe the 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.790
 series is quite marked on tracks 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.530
 of 4 to 0 4 to 1 I do not believe that the pelikan 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.440
 serious scene win or even two races 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.360
 however, you never know how interesting you started 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.790
 instead it was the one between bulls and barks 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.030
 especially since he returned from rick ross 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.590
 he also went a little in the 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.620
 first quarter very well also in the third 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.790
 fourth the others a little less though 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.239
 the important thing is that it returned to mine 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.489
 opinion the bulls win 100 between 91 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.890
 in my opinion also here the series i 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.800
 bookmarks can win at most one 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.780
 bar two games but i think the chicago 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.280
 will manage to pass quietly one 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.739
 balanced race was that between 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.360
 mavericks and rockets despite the least 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.340
 10 and final 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.010
 I don't know dallas is not that of the year 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.760
 last but did not play one 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.189
 great game there was parsons 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.980
 quite half service if you don't say if 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:06.220
 not less montelli did not pull much 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.019
 good of the good game for good hauer 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.700
 game for james harden good matches 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.950
 also for terry and brewer who have it 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.829
 resolved them a little surprising no one 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.039
 he was waiting for them and instead the beauty of 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.539
 basketball that can solve anyone 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.130
 going to Sunday races there are 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:24.010
 climbed cavaliers 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.139
 even here I don't believe that the celtics 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.479
 can win more than one match against 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.130
 cleveland 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:33.760
 also here as we have seen before 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:36.340
 attack a few at random sometimes because a 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.470
 boston sometimes attacked really well 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.389
 other times very badly attached 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:45.639
 he lost an obscene thing on his own 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:47.229
 other games that unfortunately I have not seen 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.580
 seen only the highlights 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.740
 I can report the victory of 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.130
 atlanta against the nets also here me 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.199
 looks like a fairly closed forecast 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.300
 but maybe in it a race in brooklyn 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:00.039
 the two manage to take to the cause 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.229
 instead there were more complicated races 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:04.080
 clear victory of the grizzlies between the 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:08.710
 blazer this year I expected that 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:11.650
 net because the only quarter in which he has 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.630
 won the blazers and the last 24 14 but the 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.150
 game was already over because i 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:19.120
 grizzlies were clearly ahead then 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.639
 I would say that lead in this race 1 is not 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.610
 practically entered the memphis field 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:27.190
 therefore I have an excellent victory 1 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.169
 0 and we close with a half surprise 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.479
 we can say why I did n't expect it 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.460
 that the clippers left so strong 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:35.349
 against the spurs in fact won the 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.419
 first 107 92 quite then 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:38.949
 clearly this can go 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:41.830
 I'm already at race 7 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:43.419
 curious to see race 2 who will tell us 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:48.190
 much of the series because I don't know if 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:50.889
 spurs if they went under 2 0 they would have 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.750
 the strength to react not only if I have it 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:56.650
 said in Italian correct I believe not 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:59.800
 however the signal that one then races two 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:02.560
 booze are already very important tonight 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.940
 bucks warriors pelicans do not believe there 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.650
 they will be special surprises however 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.960
 tell me a little bit how you saw this 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:11.880
 first round of nba if you have seen 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.880
 we will see each other soon
