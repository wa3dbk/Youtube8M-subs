the subject now the front is going to be

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.800 
the subject now the front is going to be
need<00:03:21.640> to<00:03:21.670> be<00:03:21.790> filled<00:03:22.090> in<00:03:22.209> a<00:03:22.330> little<00:03:22.510> bit<00:03:22.630> so<00:03:22.780> I

the orbits ring flash is going to be

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.530 
the orbits ring flash is going to be
used<00:03:26.560> to<00:03:26.800> sort<00:03:26.980> of<00:03:27.100> defines<00:03:27.580> the<00:03:28.120> heart<00:03:28.360> the

used to sort of defines the heart the

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.660 
used to sort of defines the heart the
harder<00:03:28.840> shadows<00:03:29.230> just<00:03:29.260> a<00:03:29.500> little<00:03:29.709> bit<00:03:29.860> the

harder shadows just a little bit the
code<00:03:30.910> is<00:03:30.940> very<00:03:31.180> reflective<00:03:31.540> so<00:03:32.110> you<00:03:32.170> get<00:03:32.350> very

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
code is very reflective so you get very

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.330 
code is very reflective so you get very
nice<00:03:32.830> shadows<00:03:33.340> from<00:03:33.489> it<00:03:34.739> all<00:03:35.739> right<00:03:35.950> now<00:03:36.280> we

this<00:04:05.019> brings<00:04:05.380> out<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.459> definition<00:04:06.970> of

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
this brings out the the definition of

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.930 
this brings out the the definition of
the<00:04:07.450> lettering<00:04:07.780> of<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:08.019> shirt<00:04:08.320> but<00:04:08.590> also<00:04:09.010> know

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
the lettering of the shirt but also know

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.990 
the lettering of the shirt but also know
the<00:04:10.180> hardness<00:04:10.690> of<00:04:10.930> the<00:04:11.110> of<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.560> jacket<00:04:12.010> then<00:04:12.880> i

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
the hardness of the of the jacket then i

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.820 
the hardness of the of the jacket then i
do<00:04:13.150> a<00:04:13.300> black-and-white<00:04:13.780> layer<00:04:14.140> and<00:04:14.410> i<00:04:14.650> do<00:04:14.709> a

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
do a black-and-white layer and i do a

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.420 
do a black-and-white layer and i do a
multiply<00:04:15.370> blending<00:04:15.850> mode<00:04:16.000> on<00:04:16.150> this<00:04:16.359> because

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
multiply blending mode on this because

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.039 
multiply blending mode on this because
when<00:04:18.430> you<00:04:18.970> create<00:04:19.209> a<00:04:19.239> black-and-white<00:04:19.690> layer

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
when you create a black-and-white layer

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.260 
when you create a black-and-white layer
you<00:04:20.560> give<00:04:20.739> yourself<00:04:20.890> a<00:04:21.190> lot<00:04:21.340> of<00:04:21.430> latitude<00:04:21.640> to

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
you give yourself a lot of latitude to

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.390 
you give yourself a lot of latitude to
manipulate<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:23.050> shadows<00:04:23.440> of<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:23.800> image<00:04:24.039> and

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
manipulate the shadows of the image and

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.610 
manipulate the shadows of the image and
especially<00:04:24.729> in<00:04:24.970> an<00:04:25.060> image<00:04:25.390> like<00:04:25.510> this<00:04:25.690> where<00:04:26.590> i

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
especially in an image like this where i

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.820 
especially in an image like this where i
shot<00:04:27.070> it<00:04:27.100> too

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
shot it too

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.200 
shot it too
hard<00:04:28.129> shadows<00:04:29.439> if<00:04:30.439> you<00:04:31.129> see<00:04:31.280> if<00:04:31.400> I<00:04:31.520> go<00:04:31.699> between

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
hard shadows if you see if I go between

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.300 
hard shadows if you see if I go between
a<00:04:32.240> normal<00:04:32.539> color<00:04:33.020> layer<00:04:33.319> or<00:04:33.560> back<00:04:34.039> to<00:04:34.220> the

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
a normal color layer or back to the

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.999 
a normal color layer or back to the
multiply<00:04:34.759> and<00:04:35.060> then<00:04:35.599> add<00:04:35.870> a<00:04:35.900> few<00:04:36.229> levels<00:04:36.620> and

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:37.009 
multiply and then add a few levels and

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.189 
multiply and then add a few levels and
curves<00:04:37.069> adjustments<00:04:37.969> I'm<00:04:38.210> really<00:04:38.780> able<00:04:39.020> to

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
curves adjustments I'm really able to

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.559 
curves adjustments I'm really able to
darken<00:04:40.159> the<00:04:40.310> parts<00:04:40.580> of<00:04:40.639> the<00:04:40.759> images<00:04:41.060> I<00:04:41.240> want<00:04:41.449> to

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:41.569 
darken the parts of the images I want to

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:43.600 
darken the parts of the images I want to
darken<00:04:41.780> but<00:04:42.650> then<00:04:42.770> keep<00:04:43.039> the<00:04:43.069> other<00:04:43.280> parts

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
darken but then keep the other parts

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.830 
darken but then keep the other parts
lighter<00:04:43.909> I'll<00:04:44.840> then<00:04:45.050> add<00:04:45.289> a<00:04:45.319> texture<00:04:45.979> layer

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
lighter I'll then add a texture layer

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.119 
lighter I'll then add a texture layer
I'll<00:04:47.840> just<00:04:48.020> show<00:04:48.259> you<00:04:48.289> if<00:04:48.620> we<00:04:48.740> go<00:04:48.889> through<00:04:49.069> a

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:49.129 
I'll just show you if we go through a

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:50.649 
I'll just show you if we go through a
few<00:04:49.310> different<00:04:49.370> blending<00:04:49.849> modes<00:04:50.090> like<00:04:50.360> an

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:50.659 
few different blending modes like an

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:53.230 
few different blending modes like an
overlay<00:04:51.110> or<00:04:51.139> a<00:04:51.379> soft<00:04:51.680> light<00:04:52.009> you<00:04:52.819> can<00:04:53.000> really

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
overlay or a soft light you can really

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.830 
overlay or a soft light you can really
change<00:04:53.539> the<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:54.319> color<00:04:55.240> which<00:04:56.240> this<00:04:56.419> texture

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
change the the color which this texture

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.040 
change the the color which this texture
is<00:04:56.900> imparting<00:04:57.439> onto<00:04:57.919> your<00:04:58.039> subject<00:04:58.580> and

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
is imparting onto your subject and

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.499 
is imparting onto your subject and
generally<00:05:00.050> i'm<00:05:00.379> going<00:05:00.620> to<00:05:01.090> write<00:05:02.090> this<00:05:02.330> is

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:02.509 
generally i'm going to write this is

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:03.700 
generally i'm going to write this is
obviously<00:05:02.690> not<00:05:02.990> working<00:05:03.139> because<00:05:03.500> you're

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
obviously not working because you're

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.700 
obviously not working because you're
completely<00:05:04.569> overshadowing<00:05:05.569> the<00:05:05.659> ninja<00:05:06.530> and

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
completely overshadowing the ninja and

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.980 
completely overshadowing the ninja and
what<00:05:07.669> you<00:05:07.789> what<00:05:08.150> i<00:05:08.180> generally<00:05:08.569> end<00:05:08.690> up<00:05:08.780> doing

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
what you what i generally end up doing

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.839 
what you what i generally end up doing
is<00:05:09.050> doing<00:05:09.409> a<00:05:09.650> soft<00:05:09.919> light<00:05:10.159> or<00:05:10.370> an<00:05:10.460> overlay

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:10.849 
is doing a soft light or an overlay

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:14.110 
is doing a soft light or an overlay
blending<00:05:11.270> mode<00:05:11.620> which<00:05:12.620> allows<00:05:13.129> the<00:05:13.699> texture

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
blending mode which allows the texture

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.800 
blending mode which allows the texture
to<00:05:14.300> really<00:05:15.250> meld<00:05:16.250> with<00:05:16.729> the<00:05:17.120> background<00:05:17.599> and

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
to really meld with the background and

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.959 
to really meld with the background and
with<00:05:17.960> the<00:05:18.110> subject<00:05:18.560> in<00:05:19.099> this<00:05:19.190> case<00:05:19.400> i<00:05:19.460> use<00:05:19.699> to

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:19.969 
with the subject in this case i use to

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:22.809 
with the subject in this case i use to
touch<00:05:20.180> her<00:05:20.360> layers<00:05:21.129> you<00:05:22.129> can<00:05:22.159> see<00:05:22.430> this<00:05:22.580> one<00:05:22.729> is

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:22.819 
touch her layers you can see this one is

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:24.969 
touch her layers you can see this one is
a<00:05:22.879> very<00:05:23.029> hard<00:05:23.300> concrete<00:05:23.810> layer<00:05:24.020> but<00:05:24.440> if<00:05:24.740> you

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
a very hard concrete layer but if you

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:28.480 
a very hard concrete layer but if you
blend<00:05:25.219> it<00:05:25.400> correctly<00:05:26.919> where<00:05:27.919> it's<00:05:28.189> just<00:05:28.279> a

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
blend it correctly where it's just a

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.899 
blend it correctly where it's just a
subtle<00:05:28.729> addition<00:05:29.180> to<00:05:29.300> the<00:05:29.389> image<00:05:29.830> and<00:05:30.909> there's

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:31.909 
subtle addition to the image and there's

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:35.230 
subtle addition to the image and there's
really<00:05:32.060> no<00:05:33.610> formula<00:05:34.610> to<00:05:34.639> doing<00:05:34.969> it<00:05:35.060> this<00:05:35.180> way

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
really no formula to doing it this way

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.749 
really no formula to doing it this way
it's<00:05:36.139> just<00:05:36.349> you<00:05:36.710> do<00:05:36.889> what<00:05:37.069> you<00:05:37.190> like<00:05:37.400> and<00:05:37.699> what

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 
it's just you do what you like and what

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:39.939 
it's just you do what you like and what
I<00:05:38.419> like<00:05:38.629> to<00:05:38.779> do<00:05:38.900> is<00:05:39.020> to<00:05:39.139> add<00:05:39.259> a<00:05:39.289> final<00:05:39.770> color

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:39.949 
I like to do is to add a final color

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:42.219 
I like to do is to add a final color
layer<00:05:40.219> at<00:05:40.340> the<00:05:40.460> end<00:05:40.610> to<00:05:41.330> sort<00:05:41.569> of<00:05:41.629> define<00:05:42.020> the

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
layer at the end to sort of define the

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:45.040 
layer at the end to sort of define the
overall<00:05:42.560> mood<00:05:43.219> of<00:05:43.610> whatever<00:05:44.389> it<00:05:44.539> was<00:05:44.690> I<00:05:44.900> was

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
overall mood of whatever it was I was

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.200 
overall mood of whatever it was I was
trying<00:05:45.259> to<00:05:45.289> convey<00:05:45.620> when<00:05:45.830> I<00:05:46.150> thought<00:05:47.150> about

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
trying to convey when I thought about

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.420 
trying to convey when I thought about
this<00:05:47.569> in<00:05:47.690> my<00:05:47.779> head<00:05:47.990> that's<00:05:48.979> pretty<00:05:49.129> much<00:05:49.279> all

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
this in my head that's pretty much all

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.980 
this in my head that's pretty much all
I'm<00:05:49.550> going<00:05:49.669> to<00:05:49.729> do<00:05:49.879> for<00:05:50.120> the<00:05:50.240> the

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
I'm going to do for the the

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.860 
I'm going to do for the the
photoshopping<00:05:51.620> of<00:05:51.830> this<00:05:51.979> image<00:05:52.250> well<00:05:53.000> then<00:05:53.449> go

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
photoshopping of this image well then go

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.209 
photoshopping of this image well then go
back<00:05:54.020> to<00:05:54.430> adobe<00:05:55.430> lightroom<00:05:55.639> and<00:05:57.009> now<00:05:58.009> that<00:05:58.190> I

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:00.100 
back to adobe lightroom and now that I
have<00:05:58.370> this<00:05:58.520> final<00:05:58.969> post<00:05:59.240> processed<00:05:59.690> image<00:05:59.990> in

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
have this final post processed image in
