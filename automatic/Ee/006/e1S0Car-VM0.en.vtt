team so we'll see how this plays out it
might<00:00:13.110> be<00:00:13.260> pretty<00:00:13.410> interesting<00:00:13.920> so<00:00:14.070> I'm<00:00:14.130> going

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
might be pretty interesting so I'm going

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.530 
might be pretty interesting so I'm going
to<00:00:14.310> lead<00:00:14.460> off<00:00:14.550> with<00:00:14.670> Alakazam<00:00:15.120> because<00:00:15.450> I

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
to lead off with Alakazam because I

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.819 
to lead off with Alakazam because I
figured<00:00:15.600> if<00:00:15.930> he<00:00:16.049> leads<00:00:16.230> off<00:00:16.320> with<00:00:16.350> nine<00:00:16.590> tails

00:00:16.819 --> 00:00:16.829 
figured if he leads off with nine tails

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:18.890 
figured if he leads off with nine tails
I<00:00:16.949> can<00:00:17.099> hit<00:00:17.189> it<00:00:17.339> pretty<00:00:17.579> hard<00:00:17.759> and<00:00:18.119> even<00:00:18.660> if<00:00:18.869> he

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
I can hit it pretty hard and even if he

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.179 
I can hit it pretty hard and even if he
leaves<00:00:19.079> with<00:00:19.199> me<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.439> chava<00:00:19.619> can<00:00:19.800> probably

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
leaves with me and chava can probably

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.249 
leaves with me and chava can probably
hit<00:00:20.310> too<00:00:20.519> but<00:00:20.669> then<00:00:20.759> I<00:00:20.849> realized<00:00:21.210> man<00:00:21.990> Chou<00:00:22.199> is

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:22.259

probably<00:01:00.430> all<00:01:01.430> honestly<00:01:02.180> the<00:01:02.390> least<00:01:02.690> valuable

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
probably all honestly the least valuable

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.389 
probably all honestly the least valuable
member<00:01:03.410> of<00:01:03.440> my<00:01:03.620> team<00:01:03.649> at<00:01:03.980> this<00:01:04.100> point<00:01:04.309> because

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
member of my team at this point because

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.430 
member of my team at this point because
he<00:01:04.610> has<00:01:04.699> a<00:01:04.759> son<00:01:05.030> team<00:01:05.300> and<00:01:05.509> a<00:01:05.869> lot<00:01:06.050> of<00:01:06.080> things<00:01:06.320> he

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
he has a son team and a lot of things he

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.580 
he has a son team and a lot of things he
has<00:01:06.649> are<00:01:06.970> faster<00:01:07.970> than<00:01:08.119> SWANA<00:01:08.420> and<00:01:08.690> even

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
has are faster than SWANA and even

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.779 
has are faster than SWANA and even
though<00:01:09.680> i<00:01:09.710> have<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:09.920> super<00:01:10.160> effective<00:01:10.399> surf

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:10.789 
though i have the super effective surf

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:13.029 
though i have the super effective surf
in<00:01:11.539> the<00:01:11.600> Sun<00:01:11.960> it's<00:01:12.050> going<00:01:12.200> to<00:01:12.259> be<00:01:12.380> weakened<00:01:12.800> so

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:13.039 
in the Sun it's going to be weakened so

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.010 
in the Sun it's going to be weakened so
so<00:01:13.610> on<00:01:13.729> is<00:01:13.850> really<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:14.330> least<00:01:14.690> valuable

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
so on is really the least valuable

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.400 
so on is really the least valuable
member<00:01:15.289> like<00:01:15.440> I<00:01:15.530> said<00:01:15.970> so<00:01:16.970> he<00:01:17.060> does<00:01:17.210> go<00:01:17.330> into

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
member like I said so he does go into

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.359 
member like I said so he does go into
Charizard<00:01:18.410> here<00:01:18.710> and<00:01:18.830> I<00:01:18.860> do<00:01:18.920> pull<00:01:19.160> that<00:01:19.280> double

Charizard here and I do pull that double

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:20.830 
Charizard here and I do pull that double

and<00:01:22.729> even<00:01:23.000> if<00:01:23.090> he<00:01:23.119> did<00:01:23.180> Gover<00:01:23.570> solar<00:01:23.810> beam<00:01:24.020> or

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
and even if he did Gover solar beam or

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.180 
and even if he did Gover solar beam or
something<00:01:24.410> I<00:01:24.500> would<00:01:24.619> be<00:01:24.710> able<00:01:24.770> to<00:01:24.860> take<00:01:25.070> it

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
something I would be able to take it

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.760 
something I would be able to take it
very<00:01:25.340> very<00:01:25.520> nicely<00:01:25.910> but<00:01:26.899> he<00:01:27.080> makes<00:01:27.590> a<00:01:27.649> nice

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
very very nicely but he makes a nice

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.260 
very very nicely but he makes a nice
play<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:28.160> I<00:01:28.190> think<00:01:28.520> predicts<00:01:28.850> he<00:01:28.970> tried<00:01:29.180> to

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
play and I think predicts he tried to

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.550 
play and I think predicts he tried to
come<00:01:29.420> in<00:01:29.570> so<00:01:29.690> he<00:01:29.780> switches<00:01:29.990> in<00:01:30.170> his<00:01:30.289> charizard

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
come in so he switches in his charizard

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.830 
come in so he switches in his charizard
who<00:01:30.950> is<00:01:31.070> gonna<00:01:31.190> have<00:01:31.369> speed<00:01:31.610> me<00:01:31.759> and<00:01:31.940> he<00:01:32.750> has

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
who is gonna have speed me and he has

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.260 
who is gonna have speed me and he has
life<00:01:33.080> orb<00:01:33.349> and<00:01:33.619> in<00:01:33.800> the<00:01:33.950> Sun<00:01:34.220> he<00:01:34.849> gets<00:01:35.030> solar

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
life orb and in the Sun he gets solar

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.669 
life orb and in the Sun he gets solar
power<00:01:35.509> boost<00:01:35.750> which<00:01:35.899> is<00:01:36.020> essentially<00:01:36.500> running

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
power boost which is essentially running

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.320 
power boost which is essentially running
choice<00:01:36.979> specs<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:37.520> life<00:01:37.700> orb<00:01:37.910> in<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.119> same

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
choice specs and life orb in the same

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.719 
choice specs and life orb in the same
exact<00:01:38.690> set<00:01:39.020> so<00:01:39.619> that<00:01:39.649> is<00:01:39.860> really<00:01:40.220> gonna<00:01:40.340> hurt<00:01:40.580> I

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
exact set so that is really gonna hurt I

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.339 
exact set so that is really gonna hurt I
was<00:01:40.849> hoping<00:01:41.119> maybe<00:01:41.240> I<00:01:41.390> could<00:01:41.450> live<00:01:41.810> that<00:01:41.990> focus

00:01:42.339 --> 00:01:42.349 
was hoping maybe I could live that focus

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:44.230 
was hoping maybe I could live that focus
blast<00:01:42.500> or<00:01:42.770> maybe<00:01:43.039> even<00:01:43.160> he<00:01:43.550> didn't<00:01:43.700> maybe<00:01:44.030> that

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
blast or maybe even he didn't maybe that

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.449 
blast or maybe even he didn't maybe that
he'd<00:01:44.390> miss<00:01:44.660> which<00:01:45.259> is<00:01:45.380> more<00:01:45.590> likely<00:01:45.800> but

00:01:46.449 --> 00:01:46.459 
he'd miss which is more likely but

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:47.680 
he'd miss which is more likely but
obviously<00:01:46.819> that<00:01:46.970> does<00:01:47.090> not<00:01:47.240> happen<00:01:47.420> i<00:01:47.660> don't

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
obviously that does not happen i don't

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.240 
obviously that does not happen i don't

leech<00:02:05.250> ours<00:02:05.430> out<00:02:05.580> in<00:02:05.610> maybe<00:02:05.970> he<00:02:06.120> thought<00:02:06.330> he

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
leech ours out in maybe he thought he

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
leech ours out in maybe he thought he
could<00:02:06.930> live<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.229> hit<00:02:07.440> or<00:02:07.560> something<00:02:07.710> but

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
could live a hit or something but

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.680 
could live a hit or something but
obviously<00:02:08.340> that's<00:02:08.520> not<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.759> case<00:02:08.940> he<00:02:09.479> sends

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
obviously that's not the case he sends

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.050 
obviously that's not the case he sends
in<00:02:09.750> heat<00:02:09.929> Ronaldo<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.500> take<00:02:10.830> my<00:02:11.009> hit's<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.459> I

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
in heat Ronaldo to take my hit's and I

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.330 
in heat Ronaldo to take my hit's and I
do<00:02:12.120> go<00:02:12.330> for<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.510> focus<00:02:12.720> blast<00:02:13.020> um<00:02:13.380> luckily<00:02:14.280> I

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
do go for the focus blast um luckily I

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.100 
do go for the focus blast um luckily I
do<00:02:14.459> not<00:02:14.700> miss<00:02:14.970> there<00:02:15.209> and<00:02:15.390> because<00:02:15.990> i'm

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
do not miss there and because i'm

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.880 
do not miss there and because i'm
running<00:02:16.500> life<00:02:17.430> orb<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.060> max<00:02:19.020> attack<00:02:19.380> modest

that<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:20.820> f<00:02:21.060> definitely<00:02:21.870> going<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.170> kill<00:02:22.320> his

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
that is f definitely going to kill his

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.540 
that is f definitely going to kill his
Heatran<00:02:22.740> so<00:02:22.860> it's<00:02:22.980> like<00:02:23.100> kind<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.370> like<00:02:23.430> the

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
Heatran so it's like kind of like the

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.310 
Heatran so it's like kind of like the
same<00:02:23.730> scenario<00:02:24.180> as<00:02:24.240> my<00:02:24.450> key<00:02:24.630> trend<00:02:24.840> if<00:02:25.050> they

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
same scenario as my key trend if they

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.410 
same scenario as my key trend if they
both<00:02:25.500> got<00:02:25.650> killed<00:02:25.890> by<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.040> focus<00:02:26.430> blast<00:02:26.580> from<00:02:27.300> a

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
both got killed by a focus blast from a

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.660 
both got killed by a focus blast from a
very<00:02:27.600> powerful<00:02:27.780> threat<00:02:28.250> so<00:02:29.250> here's<00:02:29.489> what

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
very powerful threat so here's what

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.949 
very powerful threat so here's what
sends<00:02:29.970> in<00:02:30.030> cresselia<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.540> I'm<00:02:30.600> thinking<00:02:30.780> oh

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
sends in cresselia and I'm thinking oh

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.920 
sends in cresselia and I'm thinking oh
cool<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.440> have<00:02:31.560> guard<00:02:31.860> split<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.910> can<00:02:33.300> average

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
cool I have guard split I can average

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.140 
cool I have guard split I can average
our<00:02:34.560> defenses<00:02:35.250> together<00:02:35.550> so<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:35.760> I'll<00:02:36.000> be<00:02:36.120> a

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
our defenses together so that I'll be a

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.180 
our defenses together so that I'll be a
lot<00:02:36.360> more<00:02:36.420> bulky<00:02:36.900> than<00:02:37.050> him<00:02:37.260> or<00:02:37.770> will<00:02:38.040> be<00:02:38.100> the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
lot more bulky than him or will be the

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.710 
lot more bulky than him or will be the
equally<00:02:38.550> as<00:02:38.790> bulky<00:02:39.150> but<00:02:39.270> I'll<00:02:39.360> be<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.510> lot<00:02:39.690> more

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
equally as bulky but I'll be a lot more

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.199 
equally as bulky but I'll be a lot more
bulky<00:02:40.110> than<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.350> am<00:02:40.680> right<00:02:40.739> now<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.459> he'll<00:02:42.030> be<00:02:42.180> a

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
bulky than I am right now and he'll be a

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.570 
bulky than I am right now and he'll be a
lot<00:02:42.390> less<00:02:42.570> bulky<00:02:42.930> than<00:02:42.959> he<00:02:43.200> is<00:02:43.260> right<00:02:43.290> now<00:02:43.580> so

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
lot less bulky than he is right now so

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.830 
lot less bulky than he is right now so
I'm<00:02:44.670> thinking<00:02:44.940> okay<00:02:45.030> now<00:02:45.270> I<00:02:45.300> can<00:02:45.510> kill<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:45.780> off

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
I'm thinking okay now I can kill it off

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.960 
I'm thinking okay now I can kill it off

does<00:02:48.120> reveal<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:48.480> have<00:02:48.600> a<00:02:49.040> thunder<00:02:50.040> wave<00:02:50.160> and

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
does reveal to have a thunder wave and

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.530 
does reveal to have a thunder wave and
he's<00:02:50.459> gonna<00:02:50.580> paralyze<00:02:50.910> me<00:02:51.150> which<00:02:51.239> is<00:02:51.330> really

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
life orb recoil and that's going to

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.679 
life orb recoil and that's going to
definitely<00:03:30.260> definitely<00:03:30.859> be<00:03:31.340> enough<00:03:31.689> forces

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:32.689 
definitely definitely be enough forces

be<00:04:05.840> honest<00:04:06.229> in<00:04:06.349> the<00:04:06.440> long<00:04:06.620> run<00:04:06.650> that<00:04:06.979> really

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
be honest in the long run that really

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.640 
be honest in the long run that really
didn't<00:04:07.609> matter<00:04:07.699> too<00:04:08.060> much<00:04:08.090> because<00:04:08.840> even<00:04:09.530> if

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
didn't matter too much because even if

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.710 
didn't matter too much because even if
he<00:04:09.769> would<00:04:09.949> have<00:04:10.099> burned<00:04:10.459> hitman<00:04:11.120> sorry

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
he would have burned hitman sorry

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.319 
he would have burned hitman sorry
medicham<00:04:12.650> or<00:04:13.310> even<00:04:13.669> killed<00:04:13.879> me<00:04:13.970> with<00:04:14.060> a<00:04:14.120> fire

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
medicham or even killed me with a fire

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.810 
medicham or even killed me with a fire
blast<00:04:14.629> I<00:04:14.840> I<00:04:15.199> could<00:04:15.500> have<00:04:15.590> dealt<00:04:15.799> with<00:04:15.949> his<00:04:16.190> with

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
blast I I could have dealt with his with

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.599 
blast I I could have dealt with his with
his<00:04:16.940> nine<00:04:17.120> tails<00:04:17.470> pretty<00:04:18.470> affect<00:04:18.949> efficiently

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
his nine tails pretty affect efficiently

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.069 
his nine tails pretty affect efficiently
because<00:04:19.669> i<00:04:19.820> still<00:04:20.060> had<00:04:20.180> dragon<00:04:20.510> I<00:04:20.750> still<00:04:20.989> have

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
because i still had dragon I still have

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.960 
because i still had dragon I still have
dragon<00:04:21.380> at<00:04:21.530> this<00:04:21.620> point<00:04:21.829> and<00:04:21.979> I<00:04:22.550> do<00:04:22.610> still<00:04:22.909> have

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
dragon at this point and I do still have

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.010 
dragon at this point and I do still have
says<00:04:23.270> or<00:04:23.389> who<00:04:23.510> could<00:04:23.659> deal<00:04:23.810> with<00:04:23.900> his

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
says or who could deal with his

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.689 
says or who could deal with his
cresselia<00:04:24.440> so<00:04:24.620> obviously<00:04:25.159> in<00:04:25.400> the<00:04:25.490> long<00:04:25.669> run

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699 
cresselia so obviously in the long run

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.790 
cresselia so obviously in the long run
it<00:04:25.970> didn't<00:04:26.210> matter<00:04:26.360> it<00:04:26.930> only<00:04:27.139> shortened<00:04:27.620> my

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
it didn't matter it only shortened my

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.499 
it didn't matter it only shortened my
chance<00:04:28.250> of<00:04:28.460> winning<00:04:28.789> so<00:04:29.090> that's<00:04:29.270> gonna<00:04:29.389> be

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:29.509 
chance of winning so that's gonna be

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:31.029 
chance of winning so that's gonna be
good<00:04:29.630> for<00:04:29.840> me<00:04:29.930> at<00:04:30.289> this<00:04:30.409> point<00:04:30.590> I<00:04:30.740> feel<00:04:30.770> very

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 
good for me at this point I feel very

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:32.350 
good for me at this point I feel very
confident<00:04:31.490> that<00:04:31.580> I<00:04:31.669> have<00:04:31.820> won<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.060> match<00:04:32.210> so

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
confident that I have won the match so

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.570 
confident that I have won the match so
I'm<00:04:32.419> gonna<00:04:32.539> keep<00:04:32.720> spamming<00:04:33.289> high<00:04:33.590> jump<00:04:33.889> kick

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
I'm gonna keep spamming high jump kick

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.010 
I'm gonna keep spamming high jump kick
because<00:04:35.000> it<00:04:35.120> is<00:04:35.210> the<00:04:35.300> most<00:04:35.330> powerful<00:04:35.659> move<00:04:35.930> I

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
because it is the most powerful move I

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.230 
because it is the most powerful move I
have<00:04:36.229> and<00:04:36.949> he<00:04:37.189> does<00:04:37.310> set<00:04:37.490> up<00:04:37.580> a<00:04:37.639> reflect<00:04:38.090> which

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
have and he does set up a reflect which

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.420 
have and he does set up a reflect which
is<00:04:38.330> going<00:04:38.449> to<00:04:38.509> be<00:04:38.720> minam<00:04:39.500> minimizing<00:04:40.310> the

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
is going to be minam minimizing the

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.999 
is going to be minam minimizing the
damage<00:04:40.639> i'm<00:04:41.000> doing<00:04:41.330> to<00:04:41.449> him<00:04:41.599> and<00:04:41.930> I'm<00:04:42.620> at<00:04:42.889> this

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:43.009 
damage i'm doing to him and I'm at this

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:44.200 
damage i'm doing to him and I'm at this
point<00:04:43.189> I'm<00:04:43.340> just<00:04:43.370> hoping<00:04:43.520> he's<00:04:43.819> gonna<00:04:43.909> kill<00:04:44.180> me

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
point I'm just hoping he's gonna kill me

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.279 
point I'm just hoping he's gonna kill me
off<00:04:44.389> so<00:04:44.509> I<00:04:44.569> could<00:04:44.629> switch<00:04:44.810> is<00:04:44.960> something<00:04:45.199> like

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
off so I could switch is something like

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.050 
off so I could switch is something like
scissor<00:04:45.620> or<00:04:45.710> Dragonette<00:04:46.219> the<00:04:46.580> reason<00:04:46.819> I<00:04:46.879> don't

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
scissor or Dragonette the reason I don't

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.429 
scissor or Dragonette the reason I don't
switch<00:04:47.210> those<00:04:47.419> either<00:04:47.719> of<00:04:47.990> those<00:04:48.080> two<00:04:48.289> things

00:04:48.429 --> 00:04:48.439 
switch those either of those two things

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:50.529 
switch those either of those two things
in<00:04:48.620> right<00:04:48.800> now<00:04:49.039> is<00:04:49.280> because<00:04:49.460> I<00:04:49.879> don't<00:04:50.330> want<00:04:50.389> to

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
in right now is because I don't want to

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:53.110 
in right now is because I don't want to
switch<00:04:50.750> in<00:04:50.930> on<00:04:51.139> a<00:04:51.169> thunder<00:04:52.069> wave<00:04:52.189> and<00:04:52.520> or<00:04:52.879> ice

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.749 
switch in on a thunder wave and or ice
beam<00:04:53.389> especially<00:04:53.840> with<00:04:53.960> dragonite<00:04:54.349> so<00:04:55.280> you

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:55.759 
beam especially with dragonite so you

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:57.189 
beam especially with dragonite so you
know<00:04:55.849> it<00:04:56.150> to<00:04:56.330> have<00:04:56.449> a<00:04:56.479> chance<00:04:56.750> of<00:04:56.870> winning<00:04:56.930> I

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:00.469 
bait him to kill me so that I could

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:01.959 
bait him to kill me so that I could
switch<00:05:00.710> something<00:05:01.009> and<00:05:01.129> safely<00:05:01.490> and<00:05:01.759> pretty

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
bait

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.870 
bait
and<00:05:11.139> as<00:05:11.440> you<00:05:11.590> see<00:05:11.770> he's<00:05:11.979> not<00:05:12.160> taking<00:05:12.460> well<00:05:12.729> he's

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
and as you see he's not taking well he's

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.370 
and as you see he's not taking well he's
he<00:05:13.330> is<00:05:13.360> essentially<00:05:13.930> taking<00:05:14.169> the<00:05:14.259> bait

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
he is essentially taking the bait

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.810 
he is essentially taking the bait
because<00:05:14.500> he<00:05:14.740> is<00:05:14.830> spamming<00:05:15.100> ice<00:05:15.340> cream<00:05:15.550> on<00:05:15.699> me

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
because he is spamming ice cream on me

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.450 
because he is spamming ice cream on me
but<00:05:16.270> it's<00:05:16.389> not<00:05:16.449> doing<00:05:16.720> a<00:05:16.810> lot<00:05:16.960> at<00:05:17.139> all<00:05:17.259> and<00:05:17.470> high

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
but it's not doing a lot at all and high

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.890 
but it's not doing a lot at all and high
jump<00:05:18.669> kicks<00:05:18.820> not<00:05:19.000> doing<00:05:19.150> a<00:05:19.210> lot<00:05:19.300> to<00:05:19.479> him<00:05:19.660> so

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
jump kicks not doing a lot to him so

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.680 
jump kicks not doing a lot to him so
it's<00:05:20.050> kind<00:05:20.229> of<00:05:20.259> like<00:05:20.320> a<00:05:20.699> mini<00:05:21.699> war<00:05:22.030> of<00:05:22.360> seeing

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
it's kind of like a mini war of seeing

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.210 
it's kind of like a mini war of seeing
who<00:05:22.900> will<00:05:23.080> die<00:05:23.259> first<00:05:23.289> and<00:05:23.830> I'm<00:05:23.979> kind<00:05:24.190> of

who will die first and I'm kind of

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.969
