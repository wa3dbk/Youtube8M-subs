clock<00:02:54.810> that<00:02:55.810> you<00:02:56.050> see<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:57.250> explosion<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.180> the

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
clock that you see the explosion and the

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.210 
clock that you see the explosion and the
other<00:02:58.360> objects<00:02:58.870> interacting<00:02:59.560> as<00:02:59.710> a<00:02:59.740> result<00:03:00.130> of

other objects interacting as a result of

that explosion automatic animation stuff
does<00:03:03.730> not<00:03:04.000> really<00:03:04.510> nearly<00:03:05.260> as<00:03:05.680> as<00:03:06.070> crew

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820

delight<00:03:07.330> I<00:03:07.630> think<00:03:08.200> we<00:03:08.380> can<00:03:08.500> figure<00:03:08.710> out<00:03:08.830> how<00:03:08.980> to

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
delight I think we can figure out how to

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.570 
delight I think we can figure out how to
calculate<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.520> physics<00:03:10.830> look<00:03:11.830> at<00:03:11.950> Alex<00:03:12.250> how

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
calculate the physics look at Alex how

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.460 
calculate the physics look at Alex how
it<00:03:12.730> moves<00:03:12.970> along<00:03:13.090> it<00:03:13.450> dust<00:03:13.690> kicks<00:03:13.990> up<00:03:14.170> and<00:03:14.380> then

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
it moves along it dust kicks up and then

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.530 
it moves along it dust kicks up and then
V<00:03:14.950> and<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.430> mist<00:03:15.640> kind<00:03:15.880> of<00:03:16.000> your<00:03:16.120> push<00:03:16.360> away

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540

all<00:03:17.470> that<00:03:17.530> interaction

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.789 

and<00:03:30.329> then<00:03:30.480> same<00:03:30.719> thing<00:03:30.750> with<00:03:31.079> this<00:03:31.200> last<00:03:31.469> seen

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799

the<00:03:32.370> cloth<00:03:32.670> that<00:03:32.939> you<00:03:33.120> see<00:03:33.299> up<00:03:33.329> on<00:03:33.569> the<00:03:33.719> walls

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
the cloth that you see up on the walls
