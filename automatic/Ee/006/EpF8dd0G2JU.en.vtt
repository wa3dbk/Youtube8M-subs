00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.820
 The people here is playing Jacob 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.410
 something arose 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:17.179
 Today I give you really good 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.179
 Backstage info is sony and me 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.820
 we have a lot in common 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:30.630
 Actually, we are always in a good mood 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:33.150
 happy and we are not against 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.800
 all a big head always chilled 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:39.629
 on it and so then we are too 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.930
 sporty and nice and yes and the 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.120
 I think the biggest differences are 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:48.120
 that he's a big bad guy 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.120
 has past and I now rather 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.280
 not so and that he just boxing properly 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.600
 a lot and passionate and I stand 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.600
 so football and 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.840
 jo 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:10.500
 falls just a very cool guy and I 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.500
 think on all cases 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.860
 Of course I have mega before 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.440
 set fischers looks and looks 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.120
 now, of course, continue 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.440
 and when I first saw myself 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.200
 I just thought you had that 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.270
 bad is really bad too 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.130
 but I am satisfied with it 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.240
 what I do and see, of course 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.920
 always mistakes 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.080
 but still think well come 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.680
 easy but I'm generally already 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.680
 satisfied 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.170
 I can not say that because we 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:49.340
 we all really understand each other 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:52.540
 really good and more so to turn on 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.180
 It is usually funniest with lukas 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.310
 tommy plays because it works out right 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.490
 and we also have really cool scenes 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.490

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.530

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.810

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.700
 generally the funniest are always the 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:37.700
 scenes with tommy so where i go with lukas 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:42.409

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.530

 Beautiful sleepy the scene 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:32.239
 I still know that but otherwise 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.769
 I'm not embarrassed because of the 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.510
 take not bad if we do 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.440
