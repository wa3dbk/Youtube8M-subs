00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:16.199
 project of Sirius attacked yes know 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:18.270
 I'll tell you to choose affiliation 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.760
 and we can remove it if that 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.670
 galactic empire was already before 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.880
 20,000 years has been established and 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.849
 a huge democracy is against that 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.840
 the imperium of the macd is eric ruled 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:37.649
 So the zmp imperator is here right now 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:43.610
 it just teeth also broke lord wied 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:47.129
 called we can play you guess 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:50.600
 we give you the sith imperium one point 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.989
 for those who guessed it 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.660
 The comments received many points so 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:00.510
 We see the class to be chosen 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.079
 yes, what class do we play now 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.079
 agent 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.200
 the warrior 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.170
 or ex bosses tor 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.150
 the movie is power 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.280
 everybody knows her in the head 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.620
 this is an agent of the sniper and 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.000
 sabotage 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.140
 and the warrior 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.140
 neither for example 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:35.370
 a song for that is a credit or 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.630
 should have thought 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.220
 There are two more points to give 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.220
 namely species 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.060
 and it is 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.030
 right man 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.760
 the last point is also official 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:10.319
 we take you 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:12.450
 because similar so four points 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.989
 let's see who the most points for 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.989
 you had 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.140
 here it is 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.290
 that's exactly what I do 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.290
 have to start again 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.730
 the 1 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.750
 here 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.750
 head to the 1 0 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.830
 that's exactly what you're familiar with 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.020
 Eye color blue 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.440
 it is not like me then take 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.440
 we will 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.110
 Also we have not 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.110
 we take couples 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.239
 helsa resourceful by swtor 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.050
 Yes 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.440
 nope 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.440
 not my type 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.410
 his side need to be new 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.409
 OK 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.140
 the hair darker 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.370
 because she's something else 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.120
 we take the color 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.409
 measure 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.409
 until the darker skin color 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.080
 so topic 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.210
 really neutral 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.180
 where I like it 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.920
 and 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.549
 a point still for the name 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.549
 can guess 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:21.910
 as r 107 is my character in the inn 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.230
 more so 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.230
 that should work 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.130
 just a little bit scared 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:35.270
 about that and that would have to 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:50.120
 I would say 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.120
 that was it first with the
