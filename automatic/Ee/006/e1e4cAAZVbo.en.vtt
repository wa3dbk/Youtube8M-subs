00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.200
 jordana who I do a big dedication 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.450
 thanks to you 5 guys for being here 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.620
 we played together I'm not a good 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.110
 part of the day of the evening we have 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.630
 do a lot of good little parts 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.160
 a lot of little gameplay so it was 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.410
 very cool and then that's me I can 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.600
 propose a few more videos because 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.970
 yeah I can not really really 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.730
 to go out of the gameplay and then there 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.010
 frankly right now I admit that 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.240
 I have a lot of success but I 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.580
 do not know I made a little break 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.260
 because I left on gta during 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.150
 a week and a half yeah a week 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.650
 a week and a half and then there my 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.730
 back on colas frankly that's the 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.680
 good to take a break 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.540
 I feel like I play better I know 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.400
 not this for you tell me for those who 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.409
 did that have for those who are 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.030
 gone on gta because ben here it is 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.039
 is out it's in the game so that's it 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.689
 everyone plays and here is it 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:21.850
 a killiie we go back to hide it and I 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:28.479
 stopped talking because you 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:32.439
 have heard game and clinics 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.119
 but here I configured the console 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.939
 so that I can save the 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.460
 voice so I corrected me will be more tv 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:41.950
 in the village to capture the see 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.649
 the same time they are playing there is there 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.929
 so even so member of matilda oxides 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.369
 who was good to talk so about the game 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:49.929
 and I thought it was in my helmet 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.280
 and I said to myself but wait but 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.389
 how he can not even go in fact 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.749
 I just realized that it will be 

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:54.310
 the part 

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:55.630
 so here I realize that I am 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.249
 a little bit of the best so here 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.409
 you also say you fucking but he is 

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:00.700
 how's it done so here's the 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.889
 little voices that get along and in a 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.530
 time and well it's because there are 

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:08.649
 little ones are moments when it breaks out 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.369
 either his sauce said the positions of 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.200
 enemies etc 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.940
 but here I had forgotten this little 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.210
 detail so that's it anyway I think 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.990
 that soon game 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.190
 and still always registered but 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.080
 see live because so that's 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.970
 do not record his own voice his 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.170
 records that voice of others so 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.330
 I will find the way to 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.100
 record my voice at the same time 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.470
 way to really put all 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.290
 the reactions when they are really 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.450
 epic that tonight additions or 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.940
 cool reactions i 'll be able to wanted 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.990
 put as and when and here it is 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.690
 as gameplay as 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.250
 I had done on the video with big nor 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.900
 by the big ones or crazy that for those who 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.770
 have not read frankly I have I you 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.320
 recommend going to see it is a 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.820
 nice little video well sharp 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.590
 gameplay but it was a way 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.970
 humorous so here is the mode that wants 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.500
 earn millions so that's for those 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.980
 who did not see go see it worth it 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.440
 a deviation 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.930
 by the way we arrive soon at the end of 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.820
 the first half I accelerated all 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.830
 the moments when ben there was no 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.810
 really action very good actions 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.030
 and you'll see there then we're going to 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.100
 to do in antoine daniel mode for those 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.880
 which you like, you will enjoy then 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.090
 Warning 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.520
 did you see did you live to kill the enemy there at 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.230
 kill the enemy no you have not seen it you have 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:23.140
 not seen the elder but bastian yade 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.140
 he is there the half bah yes ah you have you 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.250
 if you hit a little bar to do that 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.230
 because what because the enemy I 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.560
 I had not seen it at all and that I 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.850
 said it reminded me of the 2 2 video 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.230
 antoine daniel with a few nights 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.180
 frankly I typed a bar 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.180
 So here it was, but it made me laugh 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.800
 oh that's it i 'm going to offer for that 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.470
 I'm going to continue because it's not going 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.180
 do it what I wanted you to do 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.250
 tell other play you're talking about 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:58.100
 I was a little bit 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:04:01.310
 frankly for me excuse me that he 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.080
 must yeah so gt gt has frankly 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.910
 for me it's the game 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.920
 it's the game of the year it's the game of 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.420
 future years frankly it's yesterday there 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.690
 is among them right now it's a 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:15.860
 kill this game this is me I was almost 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.150
 90% finish here I have provided tourism 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.040
 the story and most of three small 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.350
 bullshit to do so here I go 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.920
 try to do that and then to the passage 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:27.800
 also I have a new series that is going 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.000
 to arrive very soon so it's 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.950
 what's this series and it's a series that 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.490
 going to be on gta it's not your let's play 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.330
 or or dmm not even delusions because 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.910
 I know there are a lot of people 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.830
 who do like gala attic and here they are 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.830
 do a lot better than me because that's it 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.880
 they have they have wine as it looks 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.560
 not there cat my horizons 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.360
 they have like that here they know delirium 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.680
 is all the time continuously and that's it 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.580
 well they do better than me and here I am 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.560
 do not want to do it like that but I 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.210
 do you want to do a little series when 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.670
 even humorous but it's really 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.620
 you're going to see how hard it is to go 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.780
 2-3 minutes I was shooting three minutes 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.420
 still no name 3 and that's 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.370
 really a series like we wait for part 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.600
 to the brief match but cm as I do 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.460
 how can I explain to you his 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.040
 wholesale ranks of small dialogues of 20 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.870
 seconds with multiple characters 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.880
 it's basically little jokes but 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.380
 frankly that's it I think it 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.970
 will please you finally I hope it's ok 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.730
 please I do not want to go ahead nicloux 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:22.100
 this is me it makes me happy 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.720
 turn so hopefully that's okay 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.880
 please also 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.850
 and then there is also a brief 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.500
 preparation time and I think I 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.060
 will try to make it very 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.330
 so soon you will not have what is 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.190
 scenario it is it is written again 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.850
 because yes because I had three 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.590
 scenarios described second pc here is same 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.290
 video gameplay I had plenty of 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.720
 things and I had a big worry 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.300
 here with my pc and suddenly I lost 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.860
 all all my gameplay all my 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.450
 Meme it brief scenarios there were 3 that is 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.800
 wrote had more than the tours and 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.020
 that's all I did not do 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.020
 backup somewhere else than on my pc and the 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.430
 well, that made me clearly disgusted 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.249
 because here I was going to go out a 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.839
 short this week and that low 

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:07.089
 na I can not because I could 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:09.039
 scenarios here I have recovered in 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:10.929
 thoroughly this week this is precisely 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:14.139
 and then so here I am writing a 

00:06:10.929 --> 00:06:17.499
 scenario entirely that will happen so 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:19.899
 built if a good week I think a 

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:21.549
 who would hang around here but know that 

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:24.519
 here I had planned between and who 

00:06:21.549 --> 00:06:26.589
 unfortunately down could not have not 

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:28.959
 could succeed because that is the concern of the 

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:29.829
 PC hard drives but that's ben voilà 

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:30.279
 what did I want to tell you 

00:06:29.829 --> 00:06:33.129
 else 

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:35.499
 for next May top 5 top 10 I think 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:37.779
 that it will be either a night sniper he 

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:38.589
 did it be a special c4 why because 

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:40.329
 that I'm starting to have a lot of 

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:42.669
 click in these three categories 

00:06:40.329 --> 00:06:45.519
 so here I think it will be on this 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:46.929
 theme there the next ones like them 

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:48.489
 next top 10 top 5 that will arrive 

00:06:46.929 --> 00:06:50.829
 in any case do not hesitate to send them 

00:06:48.489 --> 00:06:53.139
 as I say I wanted I wanted 

00:06:50.829 --> 00:06:54.369
 I classify them all as usual in 

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:55.239
 a little folder and then when I have 

00:06:54.369 --> 00:06:57.039
 enough in a category 

00:06:55.239 --> 00:07:00.009
 I make you the establishment in passing 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:01.809
 Well here is the usual beba 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:04.070
 do not hesitate to come follow me on 

00:07:01.809 --> 00:07:05.990
 facebook on twitter on 

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:08.000
 we are more than 300 on twitter even if 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.290
 down is very little compared to 8000 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.490
 we're on youtube so here we go 

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.690
 do not hesitate to come and follow me 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.100

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.660
 discuss with you to learn from you 

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.980
 know and then at the end of power 

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.540
 add I see together a few 

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.160
 parties it's good fun 

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.130
 here is the part I finish it on a 

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:24.980
 58.2 I made 17 invincible I have
