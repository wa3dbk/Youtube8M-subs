u.s. is a passenger side headlight this
thing<00:00:20.449> was<00:00:21.449> really<00:00:21.750> hard<00:00:21.930> for<00:00:22.050> me<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.260> figure

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
thing was really hard for me to figure

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.900 
thing was really hard for me to figure
out<00:00:23.180> but<00:00:24.180> it's<00:00:24.359> very<00:00:24.480> simple<00:00:25.400> just<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.580> couldn't

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
out but it's very simple just I couldn't

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.759 
out but it's very simple just I couldn't
find<00:00:27.060> anything<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.599> told<00:00:28.199> me<00:00:28.320> how<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.410> do<00:00:28.650> it

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
find anything that told me how to do it

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.819 
find anything that told me how to do it
now<00:00:29.300> there's<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.390> green<00:00:30.750> base<00:00:33.469> there's<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.559> black

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
now there's a green base there's a black

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.990 
now there's a green base there's a black
connector<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.489> slides<00:00:35.820> over<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:38.550> when

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
connector that slides over it and when

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.709 
connector that slides over it and when
you<00:00:39.090> get<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:40.700> thing<00:00:41.700> lined<00:00:41.969> up<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.390> just<00:00:42.480> goes

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
you get the thing lined up it just goes

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.569 
you get the thing lined up it just goes
right<00:00:42.960> on<00:00:43.170> right<00:00:43.559> off<00:00:43.770> but<00:00:46.129> with<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.280> lined

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
right on right off but with that lined

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.350 
right on right off but with that lined
up<00:00:47.760> that's<00:00:48.059> kind<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.390> difficult<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:53.360> just

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
up that's kind of difficult so I just

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.029 
up that's kind of difficult so I just
wanted<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.690> show<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.680> they'll<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:55.890> a

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
wanted to show you so they'll have a

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:06.500 
wanted to show you so they'll have a
totally<00:00:56.489> dial<00:00:56.699> in<00:00:56.940> here<00:01:04.909> this<00:01:05.909> gray<00:01:06.299> connector

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
totally dial in here this gray connector

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.490 
totally dial in here this gray connector
is<00:01:07.189> slides<00:01:08.189> up<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.640> down<00:01:10.430> somebody<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
is slides up and down somebody on the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.230 
is slides up and down somebody on the
internet<00:01:13.500> thought<00:01:13.950> it's<00:01:14.130> turned<00:01:14.729> what<00:01:15.119> it

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
internet thought it's turned what it

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.450 
internet thought it's turned what it
doesn't<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:15.780> slides<00:01:16.250> anyway<00:01:17.250> um<00:01:19.310> not<00:01:20.310> at

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
doesn't it just slides anyway um not at

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.550 
doesn't it just slides anyway um not at
all<00:01:20.580> self-evident<00:01:21.330> until<00:01:21.659> it's<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:22.200> see<00:01:22.409> them

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
all self-evident until it's you see them

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:33.649 
all self-evident until it's you see them
apart<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:24.350> they're<00:01:25.970> sorry<00:01:26.970> bad<00:01:27.630> video<00:01:32.570> so<00:01:33.570> you

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
apart so they're sorry bad video so you

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:43.760 
apart so they're sorry bad video so you
can<00:01:33.810> see<00:01:33.960> how<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.409> sliding<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.130> off

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.540 

not<00:01:44.770> too<00:01:44.980> smoothly<00:01:45.340> on<00:01:45.700> this<00:01:45.910> carbon<00:01:47.010> and<00:01:48.010> then

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
not too smoothly on this carbon and then

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.780 
not too smoothly on this carbon and then
that<00:01:48.730> gray<00:01:49.450> thing<00:01:49.480> just<00:01:50.490> pushes<00:01:51.490> straight

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
that gray thing just pushes straight

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.140 
that gray thing just pushes straight
down<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:55.240> get<00:01:55.390> it<00:01:55.540> apart<00:01:56.400> just<00:01:57.400> use<00:01:57.670> a<00:01:57.700> small

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
down so to get it apart just use a small

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.690 
down so to get it apart just use a small
screwdriver<00:01:59.280> probably<00:02:00.280> don't<00:02:00.430> even<00:02:00.610> need

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
screwdriver probably don't even need

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:13.230 
screwdriver probably don't even need
that<00:02:01.590> come<00:02:02.590> in<00:02:05.670> under<00:02:06.670> this<00:02:07.470> gray<00:02:08.470> thing<00:02:12.240> right

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
that come in under this gray thing right

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.020 
that come in under this gray thing right
on<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.450> top<00:02:13.690> just<00:02:14.400> pull<00:02:15.400> it<00:02:15.520> up<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.670> then<00:02:15.940> you

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
on the top just pull it up and then you

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.340 
on the top just pull it up and then you
can<00:02:16.210> see<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.450> whole<00:02:16.600> character<00:02:16.840> just<00:02:17.080> pops

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
can see the whole character just pops

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:24.270 
can see the whole character just pops
loose<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:23.110> when<00:02:23.260> it's<00:02:23.440> back<00:02:23.620> together<00:02:23.830> then

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
loose and when it's back together then

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.840 
loose and when it's back together then
just<00:02:24.700> snap<00:02:24.970> this<00:02:25.150> thing<00:02:25.210> back<00:02:25.600> down
