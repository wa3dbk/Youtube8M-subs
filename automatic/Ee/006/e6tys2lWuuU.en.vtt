involve others in solving disputes is

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.140 
involve others in solving disputes is
simply<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.859> desire<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.160> keep<00:00:23.490> family<00:00:23.850> trouble

inside<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.600> family<00:00:24.810> well<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:26.010> know<00:00:26.130> it's

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
inside the family well you know it's

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.550 
inside the family well you know it's
certainly<00:00:26.849> it's<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.390> sentence<00:00:28.140> but<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.320> doesn't

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
certainly it's a sentence but it doesn't

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.259 
certainly it's a sentence but it doesn't
really<00:00:28.680> show<00:00:29.010> what's<00:00:29.250> gonna<00:00:29.490> come<00:00:29.760> later<00:00:30.060> so

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
really show what's gonna come later so

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.910 
really show what's gonna come later so
it's<00:00:30.630> not<00:00:30.720> really<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.990> great<00:00:31.199> topic<00:00:31.560> sentence

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
it's not really a great topic sentence

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.799 
it's not really a great topic sentence
there<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:32.669> this<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:32.850> what<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.120> changed<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.630> to

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
there so this is what we changed it to

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.200 
there so this is what we changed it to
the<00:00:34.320> first<00:00:34.590> barrier<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.190> justice<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:36.180> a

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
the first barrier to justice is that a

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.250 
the first barrier to justice is that a
significant<00:00:36.719> proportion<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.200> population

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
significant proportion of the population

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.139 
significant proportion of the population
is<00:00:37.860> reluctant<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.340> involve<00:00:38.550> others<00:00:38.910> when<00:00:39.059> they

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
is reluctant to involve others when they

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.420 
is reluctant to involve others when they
face<00:00:39.360> conflict<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.379> that's<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.739> much<00:00:41.040> clearer

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
face conflict so that's a much clearer

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.670 
face conflict so that's a much clearer
topic<00:00:41.879> sentence<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.510> as<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.530> can<00:00:43.620> see

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
topic sentence and as you can see

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.740 
topic sentence and as you can see
there's<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.250> fact<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.059> first<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.450> fact

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
there's the fact in the first the fact

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.200 
there's the fact in the first the fact
follow<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.230> lot<00:00:46.530> easier<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.520> first<00:00:47.789> barrage

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
follow a lot easier the first barrage

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.790 
follow a lot easier the first barrage
justice<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.469> quarter

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
justice is this and a quarter

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.189 
justice is this and a quarter
respondents<00:00:50.309> said<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.840> forty<00:00:51.840> percent<00:00:51.960> of

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
respondents said that forty percent of

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.529 
respondents said that forty percent of
respondents<00:00:52.379> agreed<00:00:52.949> etc<00:00:53.699> etc<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.090> it's<00:00:54.329> much

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
respondents agreed etc etc so it's much

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.000 
respondents agreed etc etc so it's much
clearer<00:00:54.960> just<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.710> draw<00:00:55.890> your<00:00:55.949> attention

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
clearer just to draw your attention

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.810 
clearer just to draw your attention
something<00:00:56.430> else

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
something else

we asked people whether they should

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.220 
we asked people whether they should
involve<00:00:59.789> an<00:00:59.969> external<00:01:00.390> Authority<00:01:00.809> in<00:01:01.050> the

need<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.570> know<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.840> results<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.770> when<00:01:07.890> we

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
need to know the results so when we

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.039 
need to know the results so when we
change<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.640> we<00:01:08.850> got<00:01:09.030> rid<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.510> asked

change that we got rid of the we asked
and<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:10.590> presented<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.250> fact<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.850> quarter<00:01:12.630> of

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
and just presented the fact a quarter of

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.600 
and just presented the fact a quarter of
respondents<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.590> Kazakhstan<00:01:14.130> said<00:01:14.369> then

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610

Kyrgyzstan said that forty percent in

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.190 
Kyrgyzstan said that forty percent in
Tajikistan<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:18.090> they<00:01:18.210> would<00:01:18.360> not<00:01:18.540> involve<00:01:18.960> an

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
Tajikistan so they would not involve an

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
bricks and mortar of how we get to our

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.969 
bricks and mortar of how we get to our
facts<00:01:30.180> rather<00:01:30.540> than<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.869> beautiful<00:01:31.560> building

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
facts rather than the beautiful building

facts rather than the beautiful building
that<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.490> our<00:01:32.670> argument<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:33.420> should<00:01:33.570> avoid

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
that is our argument and we should avoid

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.249 
that is our argument and we should avoid
that<00:01:34.100> so<00:01:35.100> just<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.670> prove<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.689> the
