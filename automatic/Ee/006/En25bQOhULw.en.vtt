00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
and as I think as well is that all the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.370 
and as I think as well is that all the
items<00:02:01.469> /<00:02:01.680> all<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.219> weapons<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.880> set<00:02:03.119> are

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
items / all the weapons in the set are

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.780 
items / all the weapons in the set are
perfectly<00:02:04.380> teamed<00:02:04.710> with<00:02:04.860> each<00:02:05.159> other<00:02:05.460> other

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
perfectly teamed with each other other

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.469 
perfectly teamed with each other other
that<00:02:06.659> means<00:02:06.899> it's<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.170> really<00:02:07.500> nice<00:02:07.680> set<00:02:08.039> and

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
that means it's a really nice set and

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.729 
that means it's a really nice set and
yeah<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.509> just<00:02:09.750> really<00:02:09.989> love<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.530> by<00:02:10.679> the

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
way I will blind in a picture of the

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:14.280 
way I will blind in a picture of the
attributes<00:02:13.830> as<00:02:13.980> well

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
attributes as well

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.830 
attributes as well
every<00:02:15.069> time<00:02:15.280> I<00:02:15.340> tell<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:16.329> attributes

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
every time I tell you the attributes

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.809 
every time I tell you the attributes
other<00:02:17.530> thing<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:18.040> need<00:02:18.189> to<00:02:18.219> tell<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.459> as<00:02:18.640> well

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
other thing I need to tell you as well

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.179 
other thing I need to tell you as well
is<00:02:19.090> that<00:02:19.439> there<00:02:20.439> are<00:02:20.469> a<00:02:20.650> lot<00:02:20.890> of<00:02:20.920> weapons

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
is that there are a lot of weapons

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:22.890 
is that there are a lot of weapons
actually<00:02:21.730> in<00:02:21.819> the<00:02:21.879> workshop<00:02:22.359> and<00:02:22.569> most<00:02:22.750> of

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
actually in the workshop and most of

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.319 
actually in the workshop and most of
them<00:02:22.989> don't<00:02:23.290> have<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.859> reskin<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:24.579> download<00:02:25.060> so

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
them don't have a reskin to download so

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.720 
them don't have a reskin to download so
i<00:02:25.540> will<00:02:25.959> only<00:02:26.170> take<00:02:26.469> these<00:02:26.799> that<00:02:27.010> have<00:02:27.040> risking

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
i will only take these that have risking

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.490 
i will only take these that have risking
to<00:02:27.969> download<00:02:28.390> and<00:02:28.540> that<00:02:28.659> are<00:02:28.870> cool<00:02:29.109> as<00:02:29.260> well

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
to download and that are cool as well

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.640 
to download and that are cool as well
and<00:02:29.709> some<00:02:30.250> of<00:02:30.400> them<00:02:30.579> don't<00:02:30.849> even<00:02:31.060> have

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
and some of them don't even have

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.869 
and some of them don't even have
attributes<00:02:32.650> or<00:02:32.980> better<00:02:33.370> said<00:02:33.549> they<00:02:33.730> don't

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
attributes or better said they don't

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.630 
attributes or better said they don't
even<00:02:34.209> set<00:02:34.480> any<00:02:34.720> attributes<00:02:35.319> they<00:02:36.189> have<00:02:36.430> only

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
even set any attributes they have only

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.339 
even set any attributes they have only
the<00:02:36.819> reskin<00:02:37.269> so<00:02:37.689> if<00:02:37.810> they<00:02:37.930> don't<00:02:38.170> have

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
the reskin so if they don't have

or<00:03:07.480> something<00:03:08.200> like<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:08.319> let's<00:03:09.310> get<00:03:09.430> to<00:03:09.579> the

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:09.669 
or something like that let's get to the

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:12.569 
or something like that let's get to the
next<00:03:09.970> thing<00:03:10.389> the<00:03:10.569> powder<00:03:10.959> keg<00:03:11.620> it's<00:03:12.370> actually

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
next thing the powder keg it's actually

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.629 
next thing the powder keg it's actually
a<00:03:12.819> risk<00:03:13.120> in<00:03:13.359> for<00:03:13.930> Scottish<00:03:14.409> resistance<00:03:15.040> that's

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:15.639 
a risk in for Scottish resistance that's

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:18.719 
a risk in for Scottish resistance that's
why<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.840> bombs<00:03:17.079> look<00:03:17.500> like<00:03:17.739> these<00:03:18.280> from<00:03:18.639> the

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:18.729 
why the bombs look like these from the

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:22.080 
why the bombs look like these from the
Scottish<00:03:19.239> resistance<00:03:20.049> so<00:03:20.829> net<00:03:21.519> let's<00:03:21.819> get<00:03:22.000> to

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
Scottish resistance so net let's get to

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.409 
Scottish resistance so net let's get to
the<00:03:22.209> attributes<00:03:22.810> plus<00:03:23.500> no<00:03:23.979> arm<00:03:24.310> delay<00:03:24.760> plus

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:25.419 
the attributes plus no arm delay plus

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:27.719 
the attributes plus no arm delay plus
active<00:03:26.169> sticky<00:03:26.409> bombs<00:03:26.709> to<00:03:26.919> more<00:03:27.159> damage<00:03:27.549> they

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:27.729 
active sticky bombs to more damage they

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:30.719 
active sticky bombs to more damage they
longer<00:03:27.970> they<00:03:28.120> sit<00:03:28.409> dealing<00:03:29.409> up<00:03:29.590> twice<00:03:30.069> stock

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:30.729 
longer they sit dealing up twice stock

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:34.740 
longer they sit dealing up twice stock
damage<00:03:31.979> minus-35<00:03:32.979> base<00:03:33.549> sticker<00:03:34.030> bomb<00:03:34.269> damage

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
damage minus-35 base sticker bomb damage

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.659 
damage minus-35 base sticker bomb damage
minus<00:03:35.620> 22<00:03:36.370> max<00:03:36.819> pipe<00:03:37.359> bombs<00:03:37.690> out<00:03:37.900> so<00:03:38.799> that's<00:03:39.430> a

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:39.669 
minus 22 max pipe bombs out so that's a

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.159 
minus 22 max pipe bombs out so that's a
really<00:03:39.699> good<00:03:40.150> thing<00:03:40.209> I<00:03:40.540> think<00:03:40.750> it's<00:03:40.900> good<00:03:41.139> for

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
really good thing I think it's good for

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.039 
really good thing I think it's good for
players<00:03:41.739> for<00:03:42.280> new<00:03:42.459> players<00:03:42.729> that<00:03:43.389> like<00:03:43.419> to

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
players for new players that like to

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.069 
players for new players that like to
camp<00:03:44.409> you<00:03:45.129> know<00:03:45.159> because<00:03:45.669> you<00:03:45.909> can<00:03:46.419> only<00:03:46.449> shoot

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
camp you know because you can only shoot

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.680 
camp you know because you can only shoot
out<00:03:47.379> to<00:03:47.829> pipe<00:03:48.310> bombs<00:03:48.669> that's<00:03:48.940> really<00:03:49.209> bad<00:03:49.359> but

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
out to pipe bombs that's really bad but

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.360 
out to pipe bombs that's really bad but
the<00:03:49.780> good<00:03:49.959> thing<00:03:49.989> is<00:03:50.260> that<00:03:50.409> if<00:03:50.650> they<00:03:50.829> sit

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
the good thing is that if they sit

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.789 
the good thing is that if they sit
longer<00:03:51.760> they<00:03:52.299> can<00:03:52.510> deal<00:03:52.720> up<00:03:52.930> to<00:03:53.109> twice<00:03:53.440> as<00:03:53.769> a

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
longer they can deal up to twice as a

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.699 
longer they can deal up to twice as a
stock<00:03:54.220> damage<00:03:54.900> that's<00:03:55.900> really<00:03:56.199> good<00:03:56.379> and<00:03:56.650> a

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
stock damage that's really good and a

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.229 
stock damage that's really good and a
thing<00:03:56.979> for<00:03:57.189> new<00:03:57.340> players<00:03:57.609> it<00:03:57.879> can<00:03:58.060> be<00:03:58.209> very

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
thing for new players it can be very

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.449 
thing for new players it can be very
good<00:03:58.689> but<00:03:58.900> it<00:03:59.379> can<00:03:59.530> also<00:03:59.560> be<00:03:59.919> a<00:04:00.069> really

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
good but it can also be a really

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.550 
good but it can also be a really
annoying<00:04:00.669> if<00:04:00.970> most<00:04:01.299> people<00:04:01.930> are<00:04:02.079> sitting

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
annoying if most people are sitting

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.920 
annoying if most people are sitting
there<00:04:02.859> placing<00:04:03.400> two<00:04:03.609> sticky<00:04:03.909> bombs<00:04:04.150> waiting

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
there placing two sticky bombs waiting

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.869 
there placing two sticky bombs waiting
until<00:04:05.349> they<00:04:05.500> deal<00:04:05.709> up<00:04:05.949> to<00:04:06.159> twice<00:04:06.430> the<00:04:06.669> stock

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
until they deal up to twice the stock

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.969 
until they deal up to twice the stock
damage<00:04:07.299> because<00:04:07.629> they<00:04:07.780> could<00:04:08.019> kill<00:04:08.260> you<00:04:08.439> with

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:08.979 
damage because they could kill you with

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:12.179 
damage because they could kill you with
one<00:04:09.010> or<00:04:09.519> two<00:04:09.549> of<00:04:10.209> the<00:04:10.659> pipe<00:04:10.870> bombs<00:04:11.169> all<00:04:12.009> right
