00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:53.160 
what it is mmm that looks like a pastel
mystic<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:50.440> I<00:02:50.470> guess<00:02:51.480> we'll<00:02:52.480> have<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.690> wait<00:02:52.810> see

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
mystic so I guess we'll have to wait see

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.980 
mystic so I guess we'll have to wait see
see<00:02:53.650> that<00:02:53.860> when<00:02:54.010> it<00:02:54.100> comes<00:02:54.250> out<00:02:54.810> it's<00:02:55.810> pretty

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
see that when it comes out it's pretty

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.500 
see that when it comes out it's pretty
black<00:02:56.290> though<00:02:58.560> so<00:02:59.560> that<00:02:59.710> could<00:02:59.920> be<00:02:59.950> it

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
black though so that could be it

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.680 
black though so that could be it
hopefully<00:03:01.510> hopefully<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:03.420> pastel<00:03:04.420> mystic

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
Wilma's that we're kind of time to

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:46.170 
Wilma's that we're kind of time to
figure<00:04:36.039> out<00:04:36.250> too<00:04:36.460> so

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.920 

the<00:04:46.990> lr<00:04:47.350> will<00:04:48.030> keep<00:04:49.030> puppy<00:04:49.330> that<00:04:49.419> I<00:04:49.509> guess<00:04:49.690> and
