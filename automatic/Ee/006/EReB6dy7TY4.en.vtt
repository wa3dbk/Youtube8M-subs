00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.029
 we are here with a synthesis of the digestive system last year, let's go 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.630
 talk a little about management 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.690
 first what is the management is the processing of food 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.269
 for you to be able to absorb right then you jeri large molecules 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:21.070
 the so-called macromolecules and have to break pro-Palestinian al-hashemi and his 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.560
 digestive system is fully adapted to do this in the best way possible. 

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:27.029
 possible 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.070
 best way this management is eating right then what ate a non snack 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.750
 The more they ate a little bologna 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.620
 that's right 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.890
 and I'm with a bitch if you have carbohydrates if you have fat if you have 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.980
 protein 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.040
 In fact, the bread has wheat flour and the mortadella looks like a pig. 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.730
 and ox 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.620
 if you have pork wheat dna then others 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.540
 is that living things 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.640
 already in your mouth 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.810
 you start from carbohydrate 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.730
 by a has a cinema that exists in the juice salivary shots that is called piti ali 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.260
 huh 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.410
 and textile and active kill in the mouth because I joke of mouth it is relatively 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.570
 neutral and around 7 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.680
 then the pt is the tijerino list of the friend that is the main one for coimbra 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.570
 gift on bread 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.750
 You would then have kept it but come up to face to walk you 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.520
 makes chews correctly 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.480
 though 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.200
 goes through flour that spends vacation or factory and gal stomach 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.410
 the ph of the stomach is a different joke it is 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.750
 it's too low 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.180
 because it is very low because it has the hc there hydrochloric acid one of the 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.170
 subjects of chemistry 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.370
 sure the gastric juice that is the juice of the stomach 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.990
 he will digest what 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.490
 teas 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.520
 Protein macromolecules to turn them into molecules 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.870
 smaller the peptides 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.730
 and she's going to do it by the action of an enzyme called 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.500
 pepsin 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.590
 so spend some time next to your stomach will digest 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.539
 exclusively proteins 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.000
 virtually 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.710
 and finally passes to the first portion of the questioned intestine 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:12.889
 the first portion of the small intestine called the ground is a portion 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:16.039
 small but very important 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:19.319
 because it is very important because there in the duodenum 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.319
 will be released the pancreas juice the pancreatic juice 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:24.470
 the juice of the pancreas is 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.340
 is complete it says eric proteins it to generate liquidity that had not been 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.789
 deferred until now 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:36.389
 folate to digest and carbohydrates right then the current husband and carbohydrates 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:38.029
 intermediates 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:40.339
 he will also digest 

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:42.619
 Come on, it's mine. 

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:47.649
 then all this will be gained ii to begin in the dou fears to continue in the 

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:51.619
 chin or not and in the iririÃº that are the other portions of your intestine 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:53.239
 slender 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.580
 of general manager of gehringer corpus of the supremo how much they only the juice of the 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.739
 to be active kim testino de rogado no 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.810
 but we also have the ability is a substance produced by the liver that 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.909
 will help dissolve the fats 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:11.909
 will thrill the fats 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.619
 then passed from the small intestine they should and a lot of things 

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:18.200
 just about everything 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.650
 and practically the micronutrients are totally absorbed in the intestine 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.209
 slender 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.259
 and passes the raw fine comb 

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:32.579
 what intervened in the brique had to be absorbed was already absorbed 97 min 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:33.649
 slender 

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:36.299
 What will happen in the large intestine 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.510
 in the large intestine you will do water reabsorption 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.229
 So 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:44.889
 the parties that were practically liquefied here 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:46.969
 they will be 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:51.079
 you will see and absorbing reabsorbing and absorbing water over 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.239
 of the colon ascending colon transverse condescending curve follows in the cti 

00:03:56.029 --> 00:03:56.960
 on foot 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.180
 constituted species that way coast steps if you make an ingestion 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:06.539
 of correct food if you ingest fibers if everything is quiet 

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:10.829
 then certain nutrients and in the thick you will see and absorb water and go 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.419
 absorb certain vitamins 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.170
 Thank you very much guys 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.250
 etc until the next
