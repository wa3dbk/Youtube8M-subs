Bay Area from Weber State this young man
I<00:00:24.330> think<00:00:25.140> potentially<00:00:25.590> not<00:00:26.099> only<00:00:26.279> was<00:00:26.430> he<00:00:26.460> that

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
I think potentially not only was he that

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.189 
I think potentially not only was he that
projected<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.300> best<00:00:27.480> point<00:00:27.689> guard<00:00:27.960> and

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
projected you the best point guard and

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.169 
projected you the best point guard and
the<00:00:28.470> first<00:00:28.710> point<00:00:28.949> guard<00:00:29.220> taken<00:00:29.640> but<00:00:29.820> he<00:00:30.000> has<00:00:30.150> a

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
the first point guard taken but he has a

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.630 
the first point guard taken but he has a
chance<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:31.050> have<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.230> tremendous<00:00:31.949> impact<00:00:32.099> at

chance to have a tremendous impact at
the<00:00:32.910> next<00:00:33.210> level<00:00:33.420> he<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.960> very<00:00:34.309> efficient

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
the next level he is in a very efficient

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.100 
the next level he is in a very efficient
basketball<00:00:35.880> player<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.300> terms<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.630> scoring<00:00:36.899> it

season<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:37.500> he's<00:01:37.650> less<00:01:38.490> proven<00:01:38.880> than<00:01:39.030> those

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
season but he's less proven than those

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.060 
season but he's less proven than those
guys<00:01:39.450> personally<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.320> think<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.710> Zellers<00:01:41.009> a

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
guys personally I think that Zellers a

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.520 
guys personally I think that Zellers a
better<00:01:41.310> NBA<00:01:41.909> five-man<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:42.750> Meyers<00:01:43.439> Leonard

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
better NBA five-man but Meyers Leonard

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.139 
better NBA five-man but Meyers Leonard
certainly<00:01:44.070> has<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.220> potential<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.970> playing

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
certainly has that potential and playing

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.789 
certainly has that potential and playing
with<00:01:45.299> Damian<00:01:45.659> Lillard<00:01:45.960> would<00:01:46.380> help<00:01:46.590> him

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
with Damian Lillard would help him

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.429 
with Damian Lillard would help him
absolutely<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.060> like<00:01:48.689> what<00:01:48.960> they<00:01:49.110> got<00:01:49.320> in

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
absolutely and I like what they got in

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.109 
absolutely and I like what they got in
the<00:01:49.530> second<00:01:49.920> round<00:01:50.040> where<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.700> get<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.880> will

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
the second round where you get a will

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.749 
the second round where you get a will
Barton<00:01:51.600> someone<00:01:52.320> who<00:01:52.560> many<00:01:53.310> people<00:01:53.670> have

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
Barton someone who many people have

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.550 
Barton someone who many people have
projected<00:01:54.270> as<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.420> late<00:01:54.659> first-round<00:01:55.140> maybe

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
projected as a late first-round maybe

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.319 
projected as a late first-round maybe
even<00:01:55.770> mid<00:01:55.979> first<00:01:56.250> round<00:01:56.490> pick<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.270> you

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
even mid first round pick and so you

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.270 
even mid first round pick and so you
have<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.570> tremendous<00:01:58.409> talent<00:01:58.829> there<00:01:59.040> so

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
have a tremendous talent there so

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.429 
have a tremendous talent there so
overall<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.090> then<00:02:00.420> also<00:02:00.570> touch<00:02:00.869> on<00:02:01.020> Taylor

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
overall and then also touch on Taylor

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.530 
overall and then also touch on Taylor
and<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:01.979> think<00:02:02.100> they<00:02:02.520> Portland<00:02:03.119> had<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.240> very

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
and so I think they Portland had a very

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.500 
and so I think they Portland had a very
good<00:02:03.630> draft<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:05.040> in<00:02:05.340> any<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.759> the

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
good draft and in any of the

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.000 
good draft and in any of the
seller<00:02:06.660> myers<00:02:07.020> that's<00:02:07.590> when<00:02:07.710> those<00:02:07.800> things

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
seller myers that's when those things

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.640 
seller myers that's when those things
Tom<00:02:08.580> will<00:02:08.820> play<00:02:09.030> out<00:02:09.060> time<00:02:09.600> will<00:02:09.810> tell<00:02:09.840> but<00:02:10.229> he

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:10.650 
Tom will play out time will tell but he

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.650 
Tom will play out time will tell but he

person I mean Leonard they can do a lot

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.470 
person I mean Leonard they can do a lot
of<00:02:16.920> different<00:02:17.040> things<00:02:17.460> yeah<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.270> that's<00:02:18.390> a

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
of different things yeah and that's a

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.300 
of different things yeah and that's a
great<00:02:18.690> point<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.500> me<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:19.650> understand<00:02:20.220> the

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
great point and to me I understand the

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.040 
great point and to me I understand the
pig<00:02:20.490> because<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.850> do<00:02:20.910> think<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.390> Leonard

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
pig because I do think that Leonard

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.470 
pig because I do think that Leonard
ceilings<00:02:22.560> higher<00:02:22.770> than<00:02:23.280> Zellers<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.820> event

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
ceilings higher than Zellers the event

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.780 
ceilings higher than Zellers the event
the<00:02:24.600> reality<00:02:25.200> is<00:02:25.290> Zellers<00:02:26.010> played<00:02:26.250> for<00:02:26.520> years

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
the reality is Zellers played for years

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.030 
the reality is Zellers played for years
and<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.570> kind<00:02:27.900> of<00:02:27.990> see<00:02:28.230> exactly<00:02:28.590> what<00:02:28.920> he's

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
and you kind of see exactly what he's

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.980 
and you kind of see exactly what he's
going<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.370> be<00:02:29.460> I<00:02:29.490> do<00:02:29.790> think<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.240> litter<00:02:30.660> is<00:02:30.870> a

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
going to be I do think that litter is a

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.750 
going to be I do think that litter is a
little<00:02:31.320> bit<00:02:31.440> more<00:02:31.590> gifted<00:02:31.950> athletically<00:02:32.310> and

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
little bit more gifted athletically and

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.610 
little bit more gifted athletically and
has<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.180> chance<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:33.690> have<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.870> higher<00:02:34.110> ceiling<00:02:34.530> I

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
has a chance to have a higher ceiling I

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.900 
has a chance to have a higher ceiling I
think<00:02:34.830> that's<00:02:35.010> what<00:02:35.220> they<00:02:35.340> were<00:02:35.400> going<00:02:35.760> for

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
think that's what they were going for

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.210 
think that's what they were going for
when<00:02:36.690> they<00:02:36.810> made<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.110> pic<00:02:37.530> but<00:02:37.680> all<00:02:37.890> at<00:02:38.070> all<00:02:38.190> i

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
when they made that pic but all at all i

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.520 
when they made that pic but all at all i
think<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.670> blazers<00:02:39.090> serve<00:02:39.900> themselves<00:02:40.080> quite

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
think the blazers serve themselves quite

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.260 
think the blazers serve themselves quite
nicely<00:02:40.800> guys<00:02:41.190> with<00:02:41.520> what<00:02:41.700> they<00:02:41.850> did<00:02:42.060> in<00:02:42.180> this

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
nicely guys with what they did in this

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.000 
nicely guys with what they did in this
year's<00:02:42.480> draft<00:02:42.720> yeah<00:02:43.020> I<00:02:43.050> think<00:02:43.200> Seth<00:02:43.590> actually

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
year's draft yeah I think Seth actually

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.280 
year's draft yeah I think Seth actually
softened<00:02:44.490> it<00:02:44.670> as<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.360> recall<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.930> night<00:02:46.110> before

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
softened it as I recall the night before

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.360 
softened it as I recall the night before
the<00:02:46.830> draft<00:02:47.250> he<00:02:47.490> said<00:02:47.730> that<00:02:47.910> any<00:02:48.090> GM<00:02:48.540> who<00:02:49.050> takes

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
the draft he said that any GM who takes

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.340 
the draft he said that any GM who takes
Meyers<00:02:50.370> Leonard<00:02:50.520> over<00:02:51.030> Tyler<00:02:51.630> Zeller<00:02:51.660> it

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
Meyers Leonard over Tyler Zeller it

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.350 
Meyers Leonard over Tyler Zeller it
should<00:02:52.710> have<00:02:52.800> their<00:02:52.950> head<00:02:53.100> examined<00:02:56.120> che<00:02:57.120> he's

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
should have their head examined che he's

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.210 
should have their head examined che he's
gonna<00:02:57.510> happen<00:02:58.110> when<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.320> let<00:02:58.470> me<00:02:58.680> know<00:02:58.800> so<00:02:59.160> I

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
conscious but it sounds like something I

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.740 
conscious but it sounds like something I
would<00:03:01.350> say<00:03:01.530> i<00:03:01.920> have<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.310> admit<00:03:02.430> myself<00:03:03.150> that

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
see Tyler Zeller right now might be a

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.380 
see Tyler Zeller right now might be a
better<00:03:11.190> fit<00:03:11.310> but<00:03:11.730> when<00:03:11.850> you<00:03:11.940> start<00:03:12.180> talking

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
better fit but when you start talking

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.970 
better fit but when you start talking

I think Meyers lenders a better fit

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.020 
I think Meyers lenders a better fit

know<00:04:38.820> one<00:04:39.000> of<00:04:39.030> the<00:04:39.180> point<00:04:39.420> two<00:04:39.630> guys<00:04:39.810> remember

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
know one of the point two guys remember

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.920 
know one of the point two guys remember
this<00:04:40.350> much<00:04:41.220> like<00:04:41.430> with<00:04:41.580> Bradley<00:04:41.940> bill<00:04:42.150> Meyers

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
this much like with Bradley bill Meyers

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.450 
this much like with Bradley bill Meyers
Leonard<00:04:43.050> didn't<00:04:43.530> play<00:04:43.710> with<00:04:43.860> great<00:04:44.070> guards

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
Leonard didn't play with great guards

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.570 
Leonard didn't play with great guards
and<00:04:44.940> that<00:04:45.630> has<00:04:45.810> a<00:04:45.840> huge<00:04:46.170> impact<00:04:46.320> on<00:04:46.710> how<00:04:46.980> you

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
and that has a huge impact on how you

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.180 
and that has a huge impact on how you
look<00:04:48.120> as<00:04:48.360> a<00:04:48.420> basketball<00:04:49.080> player<00:04:49.170> on<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.950> floor

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
look as a basketball player on the floor

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.970 
look as a basketball player on the floor
Tyler<00:04:50.880> Zeller<00:04:51.000> played<00:04:51.510> with<00:04:51.720> as<00:04:51.870> good<00:04:52.320> a<00:04:52.350> point

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
Tyler Zeller played with as good a point

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.800 
Tyler Zeller played with as good a point
guard<00:04:53.190> past<00:04:53.730> first<00:04:54.060> point<00:04:54.330> guards<00:04:54.570> there<00:04:54.660> was

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
guard past first point guards there was

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.870 
guard past first point guards there was
in<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:55.020> country<00:04:55.380> so<00:04:55.530> that<00:04:56.280> makes<00:04:56.550> you<00:04:56.700> look

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
in the country so that makes you look

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.690 
in the country so that makes you look
even<00:04:57.060> better<00:04:57.480> at<00:04:57.780> times<00:04:58.230> and<00:04:58.560> so<00:04:58.800> you<00:04:59.370> got<00:04:59.550> to

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
even better at times and so you got to

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.190 
even better at times and so you got to
be<00:04:59.820> able<00:04:59.850> to<00:05:00.060> weigh<00:05:00.210> that<00:05:00.390> and<00:05:00.570> that's<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:00.900> the

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
be able to weigh that and that's the the

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.810 
be able to weigh that and that's the the
opportunity<00:05:01.740> that<00:05:01.890> the<00:05:02.010> front<00:05:02.250> office<00:05:02.400> types

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
opportunity that the front office types

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.750 
opportunity that the front office types
and<00:05:03.030> these<00:05:03.480> these<00:05:03.780> Scouts<00:05:04.620> and<00:05:04.950> these<00:05:05.490> coaches

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
and these these Scouts and these coaches

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.610 
and these these Scouts and these coaches
they<00:05:06.300> put<00:05:06.510> a<00:05:06.540> lot<00:05:06.780> of<00:05:06.810> time<00:05:07.110> effort<00:05:07.140> energy

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
they put a lot of time effort energy

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.550 
they put a lot of time effort energy
into<00:05:08.520> into<00:05:09.120> really<00:05:09.450> analyzing<00:05:10.020> these<00:05:10.260> players

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
into into really analyzing these players

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.930 
into into really analyzing these players
and<00:05:10.770> seeing<00:05:10.980> what<00:05:11.160> they<00:05:11.310> could<00:05:11.490> potentially

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
and seeing what they could potentially

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.330 
and seeing what they could potentially
end<00:05:11.970> up<00:05:12.300> becoming<00:05:12.590> down<00:05:13.590> the<00:05:13.770> line<00:05:13.950> and<00:05:14.160> so

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
end up becoming down the line and so

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.650 
end up becoming down the line and so
again<00:05:14.490> that's<00:05:14.760> why<00:05:14.940> it's<00:05:15.090> not<00:05:15.180> a<00:05:15.240> knock<00:05:15.480> on

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
again that's why it's not a knock on

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.000 
again that's why it's not a knock on
Tyler<00:05:15.930> Zeller<00:05:15.960> I<00:05:16.170> think<00:05:16.350> Tyler's<00:05:16.620> L<00:05:16.770> is<00:05:16.860> going

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
Tyler Zeller I think Tyler's L is going

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.160 
Tyler Zeller I think Tyler's L is going
to<00:05:17.070> play<00:05:17.250> in<00:05:17.340> the<00:05:17.460> NBA<00:05:17.580> for<00:05:18.240> 12<00:05:18.510> or<00:05:18.630> 15<00:05:18.720> years

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
to play in the NBA for 12 or 15 years

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.840 
to play in the NBA for 12 or 15 years
but<00:05:19.710> i<00:05:19.920> think<00:05:20.310> that<00:05:20.370> Meyers<00:05:20.730> Leonard

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
but i think that Meyers Leonard

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.310 
but i think that Meyers Leonard
potentially<00:05:21.390> could<00:05:21.510> be<00:05:21.570> an<00:05:21.720> all-star<00:05:21.900> caliber

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
potentially could be an all-star caliber

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.470 
potentially could be an all-star caliber
center<00:05:22.770> I<00:05:22.920> don't<00:05:23.310> know<00:05:23.490> that<00:05:23.670> Tyler<00:05:23.880> Zeller<00:05:24.030> is

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
center I don't know that Tyler Zeller is

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.320 
center I don't know that Tyler Zeller is
in<00:05:24.780> that<00:05:24.990> same<00:05:25.260> mode<00:05:25.730> once<00:05:26.730> he<00:05:26.910> gets<00:05:27.120> to<00:05:27.300> the

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
in that same mode once he gets to the

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.180 
in that same mode once he gets to the
apex<00:05:27.990> of<00:05:28.110> his<00:05:28.170> career<00:05:28.530> I<00:05:28.740> think<00:05:28.980> I'm<00:05:29.070> not

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
apex of his career I think I'm not

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.330 
apex of his career I think I'm not
numbered<00:05:29.490> on<00:05:29.580> this<00:05:29.760> way<00:05:30.980> stick<00:05:31.980> to<00:05:32.070> your<00:05:32.130> guns

numbered on this way stick to your guns
I<00:05:32.550> when<00:05:32.730> I<00:05:32.760> like<00:05:33.000> flag<00:05:33.330> can<00:05:33.750> I<00:05:33.840> wait<00:05:33.960> the<00:05:34.020> left

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
I when I like flag can I wait the left

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.530 
I when I like flag can I wait the left
