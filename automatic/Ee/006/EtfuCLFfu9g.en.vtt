00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello everyone with you camp and today you 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.040
 I will talk about very interesting 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.780
 mod called it simple recipe 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.570
 translates to sort of simple recipes 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.769
 Well, as simple here I have every 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.350
 a lot of stuff 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.930
 from this you can do quite useful 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.779
 items and see what we have first 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.660
 first we have arrows which is done 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.560
 a little unusual way is done not 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.539
 here and so it turns out two arrows 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.260
 quite an easy way to craft an arrow 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.840
 and I think it's a bit expensive 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.050
 well how expensive let's say no no 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.780
 a fan knocked scissors stvu but that you 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.789
 decide yourself already and so what do we have 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.210
 further on we have chicken and 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.440
 bacon and all sorts of raw beef seemed 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.530
 what can be done without them except 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.510
 fry is there then it was if we 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.649
 let's say need bones we can put and 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:02.340
 we get bones that is, with each with each 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.379
 meat and clear and myasco each we get 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.600
 dirty tricks and so we have a lot of bones 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.650
 that is, do not have to be terrorized 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.570
 skeletons will turn out quickly and efficiently 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.210
 the bones really don't understand where are you from 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.570
 the newspaper took the bones like a piece of meat 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:24.259
 but that's not the point of what's next for us 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:26.640
 we must take the land and put next to it 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.680
 his vine liana 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.530
 I call them get this brooches 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:37.330
 cassat earth 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:41.020
 strange little what's wrong with him 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.030
 Well, not the point continue now for 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.630
 crafting books we do not need to kill 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:50.260
 cows to take wool from them 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.660
 this we need to beat the sheep somehow 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.360
 strange i said cows not cows heart 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.810
 Skin Well, it's not a fact not in volume 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.660
 that you can craft perry books and 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.640
 next I will take a bucket of water a bucket of lava 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.920
 how could you guess the pulse 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.770
 one obsidian is very very much I think 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.899
 expensive craft whole bucket waste what 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.480
 get one more thing like that 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.000
 two full buckets of two core and glory and 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:21.400
 water i think i can get more 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:25.480
 in a cheap way but back to the craft that 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.630
 same next next here we have 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.209
 such a finish to we did with us 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.910
 it turns out gravel so grave game play 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.650
 he doesn't know such a gravis 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.370
 something we have at night the whole day 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.050
 starred a day to return the cloak of the day and what 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.880
 we have for the next craft we 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.930
 need a stove that's such a beautiful one 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:52.150
 the stove is very beautiful stove and we take 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.500
 stone bricks and fry them fry and bye 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.959
 we do not roast you tell about 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.890
 next item and next item 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:03.400
 allows us to reduce the ice we also 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.850
 like this take a bucket and leave it with snow 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.890
 and it turns out ice think out of iron 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.709
 buckets of the court to do just generally fucking 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.390
 generally unheard of but minecraft 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.250
 it happens what happens to us 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.260
 turned dirty stone brick 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.739
 which as far as I know does not do that 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.560
 but with ice is not so well anyway, here we are 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.709
 he made right matches ready and so 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:31.080
 what do we have further on we have 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:33.610
 the inkbag goes like this 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.450
 black bag will no longer 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.030
 will have to kill these 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.569
 tentacles in those that are here that are not 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.709
 floats you can get just coal 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.800
 pretty realistic in my 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:50.840
 although it’s not for me to decide with them 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:54.239
 follow but we just continue and now 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.580
 as far as I know it was impossible to take in 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:04:02.549
 simple sponge mode but now it’s us 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:04.349
 under the power already so much shorter I do not know 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:07.500
 It turned out and I do not know what I took for 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:10.049
 but this should have been a sponge 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.780
 Sorry very much but the campaign is not 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:17.030
 finalized because in craft ah 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:20.850
 written yellow wool but of course annoyance 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:24.660
 so the next recipe we allow of 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.990
 simple hell bricks make hellish 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.540
 blog or whatever it is called in short 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.740
 so as not to look for the castle of hell 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.410
 just enough to shove into the stove 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.160
 discounts and hell stone getting us there 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.680
 hellish brick 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.280
 very beautiful to consider for buildings he 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.770
 always come down for buildings and what do u 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.220
 us further and further we can 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.710
 to craft suede tartar or as 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:53.490
 there he is called not exactly remember yes 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.440
 mossy cobblestone and now i need 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.050
 will look for spawn here such a shorten 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:02.419
 any stone can be there too 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:06.330
 make a beautiful house of this stone and 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:08.710
 Now I think so I do not know 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.530
 very useful craft but 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.930
 he is also so clever to us 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.990
 allows you to make clay 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.950
 4 clay is if you really need it 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.190
 brick and 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:25.060
 and the clay you do not have no need to look 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:29.980
 you can just do this and that 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.410
 we still have 3 craft one 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.790
 of them we have such 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.320
 simple and yellow dye and it turns out 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:39.580
 this dust that is you will not need 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.360
 run to hell all yours all with your own hands 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.310
 made their own 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:48.430
 and similarly we take the red dust light 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:51.250
 the dye is obtained with a chisel but all 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.390
 Seen will not be repeated and the last 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.070
 craft last craft 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:59.830
 we can take such a web 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:02.410
 Yes, it is useful for all sorts of traps 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:05.140
 I know that you do not have to spray mod just 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:08.110
 put Putin and slowpoke 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:10.450
 and everything is basically on this mod itself 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.460
 exhausted you liked the video 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.700
 We subscribe to like and to new 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.700
 meeting
