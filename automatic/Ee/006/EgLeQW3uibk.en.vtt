so<00:00:03.360> here's<00:00:03.600> a<00:00:03.720> bit<00:00:03.870> of<00:00:03.990> an<00:00:04.110> interesting

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
so here's a bit of an interesting

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:12.100 
so here's a bit of an interesting
problem<00:00:04.920> oh<00:00:07.550> this<00:00:08.550> is<00:00:08.730> from<00:00:09.050> creative<00:00:10.219> sound

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
problem oh this is from creative sound

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.140 
problem oh this is from creative sound
system<00:00:13.580> amplifier<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:16.640> and<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.970> problem

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
system amplifier and and the problem

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.980 
system amplifier and and the problem
with<00:00:18.539> these<00:00:19.140> walls<00:00:19.590> but<00:00:19.770> it's<00:00:20.510> sometimes<00:00:21.510> was

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
with these walls but it's sometimes was

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.090 
with these walls but it's sometimes was
turning<00:00:22.470> off

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
turning off

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.550 
turning off
I<00:00:23.330> mean<00:00:24.710> medium<00:00:25.710> high<00:00:26.039> frequency<00:00:26.699> speakers

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
I mean medium high frequency speakers

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.080 
I mean medium high frequency speakers
only<00:00:28.560> bass<00:00:28.949> speaker<00:00:29.279> was<00:00:29.550> still<00:00:29.910> working<00:00:30.119> and

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
only bass speaker was still working and

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.850 
only bass speaker was still working and
the<00:00:33.090> problem<00:00:33.420> -<00:00:33.540> not<00:00:33.719> really<00:00:34.219> interesting

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
the problem - not really interesting

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.590 
the problem - not really interesting
example<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.850> have<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.210> ground<00:00:39.930> pit<00:00:41.149> and<00:00:42.149> gives

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
example you have a ground pit and gives

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.260 
example you have a ground pit and gives
a<00:00:42.809> positive<00:00:43.110> lead<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.489> moment<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.030> shows

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
a positive lead and the moment it shows

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:53.060 
a positive lead and the moment it shows
17<00:00:46.020> going<00:00:46.399> extend<00:00:47.399> walls<00:00:49.969> now<00:00:51.649> there<00:00:52.649> are<00:00:52.770> two

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
17 going extend walls now there are two

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.850 
17 going extend walls now there are two
amplifiers<00:00:53.610> chips<00:00:54.059> one<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.660> working<00:00:55.199> for<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
amplifiers chips one is working for the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.520 
amplifiers chips one is working for the
blueprint<00:00:56.280> for<00:00:56.489> central<00:00:56.969> speaker<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.660> second

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
blueprint for central speaker and second

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.860 
blueprint for central speaker and second
one<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.739> working<00:00:59.190> for<00:00:59.430> satellite<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.210> front

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
one is working for satellite and front

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.740 
one is working for satellite and front
speakers<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.609> one<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.879> for<00:01:03.059> channel<00:01:03.510> and

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
speakers so this one is for channel and

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.620 
speakers so this one is for channel and
this<00:01:04.140> one<00:01:04.379> actually<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.489> free<00:01:06.000> channel<00:01:06.390> but

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
this one actually is free channel but

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.200 
this one actually is free channel but
one<00:01:07.110> channel<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.500> not<00:01:07.650> used<00:01:10.010> so<00:01:11.010> as<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.790> problem

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
one channel is not used so as a problem

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.300 
one channel is not used so as a problem
-<00:01:12.360> no<00:01:12.570> -<00:01:12.630> both<00:01:12.960> humpy<00:01:13.320> files<00:01:13.590> are<00:01:13.830> controlled

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
- no - both humpy files are controlled

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.240 
- no - both humpy files are controlled
by<00:01:17.330> standby<00:01:18.330> mute<00:01:18.630> circuit<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.799> we<00:01:19.890> don't<00:01:20.100> have

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
by standby mute circuit so we don't have

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.730 
by standby mute circuit so we don't have
a<00:01:20.280> pop<00:01:20.670> when<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.180> turn<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.630> system<00:01:23.450> and

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
a pop when you turn on the system and

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.249 
a pop when you turn on the system and
one<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.159> traces<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.990> that

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
one of the traces that this in that

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.719 
one of the traces that this in that
control<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:29.520> going<00:01:29.939> right<00:01:30.420> here<00:01:34.579> and<00:01:35.579> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
control is going right here and the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.999 
control is going right here and the
problem<00:01:36.060> turned<00:01:36.240> out<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:37.170> glue<00:01:37.770> that

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
problem turned out that this glue that

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.240 
problem turned out that this glue that
is<00:01:38.250> holding<00:01:38.509> holds<00:01:39.509> heat<00:01:39.960> sink<00:01:40.250> from

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
is holding holds heat sink from

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.440 
is holding holds heat sink from
vibration<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.630> tucked<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.170> conduct<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:44.450> this

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
vibration is tucked to conduct and this

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.620 
vibration is tucked to conduct and this
really<00:01:45.750> rare<00:01:45.990> but<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.970> think<00:01:47.970> second<00:01:48.360> time<00:01:48.600> I

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
really rare but I think second time I

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.289 
really rare but I think second time I
find<00:01:49.259> this<00:01:49.500> kind<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.920> problem

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
find this kind of problem

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.120 
find this kind of problem
so<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:52.259> course<00:01:52.500> our<00:01:52.649> heat<00:01:52.950> sink<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.420> ground<00:01:55.130> so

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
so of course our heat sink is ground so

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.399 
so of course our heat sink is ground so
we'll<00:01:56.520> just<00:01:58.130> put<00:01:59.130> our<00:02:00.020> positive<00:02:01.020> lead<00:02:01.229> to

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
we'll just put our positive lead to

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.170 
we'll just put our positive lead to
positive<00:02:01.619> supply<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.840> check<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:04.939> so<00:02:05.939> as<00:02:06.090> you

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
positive supply and check that so as you

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.820 
positive supply and check that so as you
can<00:02:06.329> see<00:02:06.390> we<00:02:06.719> have<00:02:06.899> 17<00:02:07.350> loads<00:02:08.119> that's<00:02:09.119> right

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
can see we have 17 loads that's right

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.059 
can see we have 17 loads that's right
but<00:02:10.830> if<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.459> put<00:02:12.260> there<00:02:13.260> is<00:02:13.349> no<00:02:13.440> traces<00:02:13.890> here

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
but if you put there is no traces here

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.729 
but if you put there is no traces here
just<00:02:14.610> on<00:02:14.790> group<00:02:16.160> you<00:02:17.160> can<00:02:17.370> see<00:02:17.580> that<00:02:17.790> it's<00:02:18.739> it's

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
just on group you can see that it's it's

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.380 
just on group you can see that it's it's
almost<00:02:19.950> like<00:02:20.160> one<00:02:20.430> point<00:02:20.670> five<00:02:20.940> point<00:02:20.970> two

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
almost like one point five point two

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.880 
almost like one point five point two
volts<00:02:21.629> and<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:24.720> not<00:02:25.020> on<00:02:25.200> on<00:02:25.379> this<00:02:25.530> side<00:02:25.739> this

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
volts and and not on on this side this

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.559 
volts and and not on on this side this
side<00:02:26.129> you<00:02:26.370> can<00:02:26.580> completely<00:02:26.970> see<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.390> there

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
side you can completely see that there

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.360 
side you can completely see that there
is<00:02:27.629> no<00:02:27.810> traces<00:02:28.290> at<00:02:28.440> all<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.800> just<00:02:28.950> touching

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
is no traces at all and just touching

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.970 
is no traces at all and just touching
the<00:02:29.580> black<00:02:29.790> glue<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.750> they<00:02:31.470> already<00:02:31.709> have

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
the black glue and they already have

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.160 
the black glue and they already have
three<00:02:32.190> point<00:02:32.459> five<00:02:32.610> volts<00:02:35.480> and<00:02:36.480> it's<00:02:36.720> changing

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
three point five volts and it's changing

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.449 
three point five volts and it's changing
rapidly<00:02:37.349> also<00:02:38.280> four<00:02:38.730> volts<00:02:39.060> now<00:02:42.650> so<00:02:43.650> don't<00:02:44.099> out

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
rapidly also four volts now so don't out

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.839 
rapidly also four volts now so don't out
that<00:02:44.819> this<00:02:45.450> trace<00:02:45.810> might<00:02:46.230> have<00:02:46.590> some<00:02:46.890> micro

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
that this trace might have some micro

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.890 
that this trace might have some micro
breaking<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.569> because<00:02:49.290> on<00:02:49.560> one<00:02:49.860> side<00:02:50.190> it's<00:02:51.180> as

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.170 
and on this side I had 14 volts and when
after<00:03:05.069> this<00:03:06.349> you<00:03:07.349> can<00:03:07.500> see<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:07.830> this<00:03:08.180> and

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
after this you can see that this and

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.479 
after this you can see that this and
trace<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.750> going<00:03:10.050> from<00:03:10.530> this<00:03:10.680> point<00:03:10.920> to<00:03:11.310> this

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
trace is going from this point to this

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.979 
trace is going from this point to this
point<00:03:12.260> I<00:03:13.260> had<00:03:14.040> different<00:03:14.489> different<00:03:15.390> voltages

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
point I had different different voltages

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.649 
point I had different different voltages
I<00:03:16.319> think<00:03:16.560> here<00:03:16.739> it<00:03:16.830> was<00:03:17.010> fourteen<00:03:17.819> point<00:03:18.090> two

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:18.659 
I think here it was fourteen point two

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.280 
I think here it was fourteen point two
and<00:03:19.050> here<00:03:19.980> I<00:03:20.040> had<00:03:20.250> only<00:03:20.430> eight<00:03:20.760> volts<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.450> was

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
and here I had only eight volts and was

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.280 
and here I had only eight volts and was
jumping<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:22.709> go<00:03:22.920> around<00:03:23.269> seven<00:03:24.269> nine<00:03:24.780> volts

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
jumping to go around seven nine volts

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.759 
jumping to go around seven nine volts
and<00:03:25.470> when<00:03:26.370> it<00:03:26.519> was<00:03:27.330> dropping<00:03:27.720> lower<00:03:28.319> than<00:03:28.590> 5

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
and when it was dropping lower than 5

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.660 
and when it was dropping lower than 5
volts<00:03:29.099> amplify<00:03:29.580> was<00:03:29.760> too<00:03:29.970> Totenkopf<00:03:30.540> itself

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
volts amplify was too Totenkopf itself

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.860 
volts amplify was too Totenkopf itself
after<00:03:32.670> some<00:03:33.030> period<00:03:33.209> of<00:03:33.420> time<00:03:33.629> it<00:03:33.750> was

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
after some period of time it was

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.070 
after some period of time it was
returning<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:34.920> working<00:03:35.220> again<00:03:35.690> so<00:03:36.690> this<00:03:37.019> is

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
returning and working again so this is

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.670 
returning and working again so this is
one<00:03:37.409> of<00:03:37.440> those<00:03:37.680> cases<00:03:37.920> where<00:03:38.959> glue<00:03:39.959> after<00:03:40.260> some

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
one of those cases where glue after some

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.280 
one of those cases where glue after some
time<00:03:40.950> I<00:03:41.129> guess<00:03:41.159> is<00:03:41.519> starting<00:03:41.909> to<00:03:42.030> conduct

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.850 

never<00:03:46.290> so<00:03:46.590> black<00:03:47.069> go<00:03:48.170> starting<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.290> conduct<00:03:49.709> a

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
never so black go starting to conduct a

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.399 
never so black go starting to conduct a
head<00:03:50.099> problem<00:03:50.459> with<00:03:53.120> logitech<00:03:54.120> system<00:03:54.720> which

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409 
head problem with logitech system which

00:03:55.409 --> 00:04:00.110 
head problem with logitech system which
I<00:03:55.439> remember<00:03:55.739> that<00:03:56.340> had<00:03:56.720> that<00:03:58.280> white<00:03:59.280> yellowish

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
I remember that had that white yellowish

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.830 
I remember that had that white yellowish
blue<00:04:00.709> that<00:04:01.709> was<00:04:01.860> conduct<00:04:02.280> in<00:04:02.670> conducting<00:04:03.390> and

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
blue that was conduct in conducting and

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.039 
blue that was conduct in conducting and
it<00:04:04.650> was<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.250> main<00:04:05.430> problem<00:04:05.849> in<00:04:06.599> the<00:04:06.840> power

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
it was the main problem in the power

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.600 
it was the main problem in the power
supply<00:04:07.439> circuit<00:04:07.650> it<00:04:07.950> was<00:04:08.099> killing<00:04:08.370> power

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
supply circuit it was killing power

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.970 
supply circuit it was killing power
supply<00:04:09.620> is<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.860> grimy<00:04:11.280> must<00:04:11.610> as<00:04:11.760> well<00:04:11.790> and<00:04:12.599> just

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
supply is a grimy must as well and just

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.020 
supply is a grimy must as well and just
burning<00:04:13.980> out<00:04:15.709> so<00:04:16.709> have<00:04:17.220> the<00:04:17.340> same<00:04:17.519> problem

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
burning out so have the same problem

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.879 
burning out so have the same problem
which<00:04:18.150> is<00:04:18.299> not<00:04:18.329> that<00:04:18.660> critical<00:04:18.930> of<00:04:19.380> course<00:04:19.620> but

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
which is not that critical of course but

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.300 
which is not that critical of course but
quite<00:04:20.669> annoying<00:04:21.290> so

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
quite annoying so

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.930 
quite annoying so
I'm<00:04:24.150> planning<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:25.040> first<00:04:26.040> of<00:04:26.190> all<00:04:26.340> bridge<00:04:26.639> a

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
I'm planning to first of all bridge a

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.840 
I'm planning to first of all bridge a
wire<00:04:27.270> from<00:04:27.600> this<00:04:27.810> point<00:04:28.050> to<00:04:28.440> this<00:04:28.590> point<00:04:28.850> to

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
wire from this point to this point to

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.150 
wire from this point to this point to
eliminate<00:04:30.480> the<00:04:30.900> micro<00:04:31.530> break<00:04:31.770> that<00:04:32.010> is

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
eliminate the micro break that is

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.060 
eliminate the micro break that is
possibly<00:04:32.760> in<00:04:32.910> this<00:04:33.090> little<00:04:33.600> trace<00:04:34.070> who

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
possibly in this little trace who

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.780 
possibly in this little trace who
scratch<00:04:35.520> off<00:04:35.760> all<00:04:36.090> the<00:04:36.830> conductive<00:04:37.830> goo<00:04:37.980> and

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
scratch off all the conductive goo and

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.690 
scratch off all the conductive goo and
to<00:04:39.060> just<00:04:39.330> put<00:04:39.540> some<00:04:39.840> blobs<00:04:40.620> of<00:04:40.830> hot<00:04:41.430> glue<00:04:41.610> on

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
to just put some blobs of hot glue on

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.430 
to just put some blobs of hot glue on
them<00:04:43.160> so<00:04:44.160> just<00:04:44.520> decided<00:04:45.030> to<00:04:45.060> shut<00:04:45.720> this<00:04:45.930> right

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
them so just decided to shut this right

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.700 
them so just decided to shut this right
over<00:04:47.180> quickly<00:04:48.350> quick<00:04:49.350> repair<00:04:49.740> and<00:04:51.680> for<00:04:52.680> a

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
over quickly quick repair and for a

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.700 
over quickly quick repair and for a
little<00:04:52.919> problem<00:04:53.520> at<00:04:53.639> one

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
little problem at one

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.980 
little problem at one
