about<00:02:58.250> that<00:02:58.400> Expo<00:02:59.000> cannon<00:02:59.540> and<00:02:59.960> two<00:03:00.800> of<00:03:00.830> those

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
about that Expo cannon and two of those

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.760 
about that Expo cannon and two of those
archer<00:03:01.370> towers<00:03:01.670> attacking<00:03:02.090> my<00:03:02.240> queen<00:03:02.780> but

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
archer towers attacking my queen but

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.310 
archer towers attacking my queen but
fortunately<00:03:04.280> I<00:03:04.370> only<00:03:04.520> have<00:03:04.730> one<00:03:05.150> storage<00:03:05.990> left

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
fortunately I only have one storage left

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.660 
fortunately I only have one storage left
so<00:03:06.560> I<00:03:06.590> think<00:03:06.710> we'll<00:03:06.950> be<00:03:07.010> able<00:03:07.160> to<00:03:07.280> take<00:03:07.460> it<00:03:07.550> out

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
so I think we'll be able to take it out

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.030 
so I think we'll be able to take it out
