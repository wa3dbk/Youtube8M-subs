you know there it's all right one thing
I<00:02:16.440> do<00:02:16.739> like<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.190> mean<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.430> button<00:02:17.610> layouts<00:02:17.910> much

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
I do like I mean the button layouts much

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.820 
I do like I mean the button layouts much
better<00:02:18.450> than<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.810> buttons<00:02:19.260> are<00:02:19.379> really<00:02:19.530> great

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
better than the buttons are really great

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.110 
better than the buttons are really great
in<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.040> server<00:02:20.250> was<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.519> nice<00:02:20.670> little<00:02:20.819> cheap

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
in the server was a nice little cheap

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.460 
in the server was a nice little cheap
thing<00:02:21.330> here<00:02:21.540> especially<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:22.080> just<00:02:22.290> got<00:02:22.380> to

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
thing here especially you just got to

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.780 
thing here especially you just got to
hold<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.769> down<00:02:22.860> like<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.069> you<00:02:23.310> click<00:02:23.519> it<00:02:23.610> once

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
hold it down like that you click it once

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:31.010 
hold it down like that you click it once
they<00:02:24.720> don't<00:02:24.900> just

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:37.710 

that's<00:02:31.650> kind<00:02:31.830> of<00:02:31.860> good

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:55.230 

now<00:02:38.200> we'll<00:02:38.350> go<00:02:38.470> for<00:02:38.770> a<00:02:41.130> fireball<00:02:42.130> character

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.580 

you<00:02:55.810> didn't<00:02:56.050> mean<00:02:56.260> it

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
you didn't mean it

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.510 
you didn't mean it
cops<00:02:58.370> are<00:02:58.520> pretty<00:02:58.730> smooth

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.110 

you<00:03:04.060> know

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
you know

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.250 
you know
but

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.290 

well<00:03:09.800> it<00:03:09.920> has<00:03:10.069> advantages<00:03:10.760> I<00:03:10.910> mean<00:03:11.060> just<00:03:11.209> the

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
well it has advantages I mean just the

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.869 
well it has advantages I mean just the
fact<00:03:11.330> that<00:03:11.660> some<00:03:12.560> you<00:03:12.860> know<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.160> diagonal

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 
fact that some you know the diagonal

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.500 
fact that some you know the diagonal
jumpin<00:03:14.239> is<00:03:14.360> is<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:15.050> misses<00:03:15.470> sometimes<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.510> for

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
jumpin is is it misses sometimes and for

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.350 
jumpin is is it misses sometimes and for
some<00:03:17.660> reason<00:03:18.160> I've<00:03:19.160> had<00:03:19.819> the<00:03:19.940> same<00:03:20.060> effect

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
some reason I've had the same effect

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.970 
some reason I've had the same effect
with<00:03:20.599> the<00:03:20.660> Xbox<00:03:20.989> controller<00:03:21.410> I'll<00:03:21.709> show<00:03:21.890> you

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
with the Xbox controller I'll show you

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:28.960 
with the Xbox controller I'll show you
guys<00:03:22.069> okay<00:03:26.410> so<00:03:27.410> here<00:03:27.560> we<00:03:27.590> are<00:03:27.709> with<00:03:27.970> the

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
guys okay so here we are with the

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:36.530 
guys okay so here we are with the
regular<00:03:29.330> Xbox<00:03:29.630> controller<00:03:30.190> do<00:03:31.190> big<00:03:31.400> again

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.869 

now<00:03:37.050> at<00:03:37.170> first<00:03:37.409> I<00:03:37.650> mean<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:38.010> hated<00:03:38.610> this<00:03:38.819> thing

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
now at first I mean I hated this thing

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.550 
now at first I mean I hated this thing
but<00:03:39.239> I<00:03:39.269> guess<00:03:39.450> with<00:03:39.629> looking<00:03:40.140> a<00:03:40.230> little<00:03:40.290> bit<00:03:40.500> of

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
but I guess with looking a little bit of

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.990 
but I guess with looking a little bit of
practices<00:03:41.099> you<00:03:41.459> know<00:03:41.489> it<00:03:41.670> became<00:03:41.909> alright

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
practices you know it became alright

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.270 
practices you know it became alright
still<00:03:45.000> pull<00:03:45.180> off<00:03:45.209> most<00:03:45.870> of<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.049> moves

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.550 

Oh

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.290 

you<00:03:59.069> only<00:03:59.190> want<00:03:59.370> to<00:03:59.430> have<00:03:59.489> a<00:03:59.550> little<00:03:59.970> bit<00:04:00.150> hard

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
you only want to have a little bit hard

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.850 
you only want to have a little bit hard
time<00:04:00.480> maybe<00:04:00.660> doing<00:04:00.870> it<00:04:00.989> to<00:04:01.050> me<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.290> flip<00:04:01.530> but

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
time maybe doing it to me the flip but

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.500 
time maybe doing it to me the flip but
even<00:04:02.099> on<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.489> other<00:04:02.610> controller<00:04:02.970> don't<00:04:03.390> get

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
even on the other controller don't get

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.250 
even on the other controller don't get
it<00:04:03.599> off<00:04:03.690> best<00:04:03.900> move<00:04:04.140> but<00:04:05.690> overall<00:04:06.690> I<00:04:06.810> mean<00:04:07.050> the

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
it off best move but overall I mean the

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.570 
it off best move but overall I mean the
only<00:04:07.440> advantage<00:04:07.680> I<00:04:07.800> see<00:04:07.860> with<00:04:08.099> the<00:04:08.190> other<00:04:08.340> one

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
only advantage I see with the other one

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.229 
only advantage I see with the other one
is<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.819> actual

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
is the actual

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.820 
is the actual
having<00:04:09.630> the<00:04:09.750> two<00:04:10.020> extra<00:04:10.319> buttons<00:04:10.590> here<00:04:10.739> as

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
having the two extra buttons here as

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.309 
having the two extra buttons here as
opposed<00:04:11.099> I<00:04:11.280> switch<00:04:11.640> my<00:04:11.670> buttons<00:04:12.120> to<00:04:12.300> me<00:04:12.540> this

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
opposed I switch my buttons to me this

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.839 
opposed I switch my buttons to me this
one<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.650> two<00:04:13.800> fierce<00:04:14.069> is<00:04:14.220> one<00:04:14.400> here<00:04:14.640> one<00:04:14.819> there

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
one the two fierce is one here one there

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.190 
one the two fierce is one here one there
it's<00:04:15.239> a<00:04:15.269> little<00:04:15.450> bit<00:04:15.540> easier<00:04:15.569> in<00:04:16.019> those

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
it's a little bit easier in those

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:23.000 
it's a little bit easier in those
triggers<00:04:16.590> sucks<00:04:16.919> but<00:04:17.220> I<00:04:17.519> mean<00:04:21.710> the<00:04:22.710> one

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
triggers sucks but I mean the one

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.980 
triggers sucks but I mean the one
advantage<00:04:23.370> I<00:04:23.610> see<00:04:23.639> that<00:04:24.000> you<00:04:24.240> know<00:04:24.360> this<00:04:24.570> takes

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
advantage I see that you know this takes

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.990 
advantage I see that you know this takes
really<00:04:25.560> no<00:04:25.710> effort<00:04:26.040> to<00:04:26.070> jump<00:04:26.370> diagonally<00:04:26.550> in

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
really no effort to jump diagonally in

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.330 
really no effort to jump diagonally in
so<00:04:27.660> it<00:04:27.810> does<00:04:27.990> it<00:04:28.669> and<00:04:30.470> that's<00:04:31.470> actually<00:04:31.740> it's

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
so it does it and that's actually it's

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.240 
so it does it and that's actually it's
become<00:04:32.880> very<00:04:33.180> very<00:04:33.389> important<00:04:33.960> I<00:04:34.080> mean<00:04:34.380> I've

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
become very very important I mean I've

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.920 
become very very important I mean I've
lost<00:04:35.550> a<00:04:35.700> couple<00:04:35.729> masses<00:04:36.240> just<00:04:36.419> because<00:04:36.660> my

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
lost a couple masses just because my

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.390 
lost a couple masses just because my
dumb<00:04:37.139> ass<00:04:37.229> is<00:04:37.410> jumping<00:04:37.800> straight<00:04:37.950> up<00:04:38.070> you<00:04:38.280> know

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
dumb ass is jumping straight up you know

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.710 
dumb ass is jumping straight up you know
so<00:04:39.440> this<00:04:40.440> is<00:04:40.590> one<00:04:40.800> thing<00:04:41.389> so<00:04:42.389> I'd<00:04:42.479> say<00:04:42.600> the

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
so this is one thing so I'd say the

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.240 
so this is one thing so I'd say the
advantage<00:04:43.110> on<00:04:43.290> just<00:04:43.560> you<00:04:43.770> know<00:04:43.889> getting<00:04:44.160> good

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
advantage on just you know getting good

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.560 
advantage on just you know getting good
with<00:04:44.310> this<00:04:44.460> xbox<00:04:44.820> controller<00:04:45.150> for<00:04:45.389> me<00:04:45.479> had

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
with this xbox controller for me had

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.330 
with this xbox controller for me had
been<00:04:45.600> but<00:04:46.290> you<00:04:46.470> know<00:04:46.620> I<00:04:46.680> never<00:04:46.800> really<00:04:47.100> mess<00:04:47.220> up

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
been but you know I never really mess up

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.090 
been but you know I never really mess up
on<00:04:47.460> the<00:04:47.490> diagonal<00:04:47.880> jumps<00:04:48.300> but<00:04:49.020> these<00:04:49.350> two

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
on the diagonal jumps but these two

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.800 
on the diagonal jumps but these two
buttons<00:04:50.370> here<00:04:50.729> you<00:04:50.910> know<00:04:51.030> really<00:04:51.389> make<00:04:51.750> it

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
buttons here you know really make it

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.909 
buttons here you know really make it
difficult<00:04:52.050> sometimes<00:04:53.780> okay<00:04:54.780> everybody<00:04:55.260> can

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
difficult sometimes okay everybody can

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:04.340 
difficult sometimes okay everybody can

used to this don't know what it is but I
mean<00:05:11.490> it's<00:05:11.660> definitely<00:05:12.660> doable<00:05:15.950> so<00:05:16.950> basically

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
mean it's definitely doable so basically

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.760 
mean it's definitely doable so basically
I<00:05:17.430> mean<00:05:17.669> I<00:05:17.970> don't<00:05:18.360> know<00:05:18.630> I've<00:05:18.870> been<00:05:19.560> playing

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
I mean I don't know I've been playing

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.180 
I mean I don't know I've been playing
the<00:05:19.860> same<00:05:20.070> with<00:05:20.310> this<00:05:20.520> and<00:05:20.940> this<00:05:22.190> really

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
the same with this and this really

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.520 
the same with this and this really
hasn't<00:05:23.370> changed<00:05:23.520> much<00:05:23.880> I<00:05:24.060> like<00:05:24.870> I<00:05:25.020> like<00:05:25.169> big<00:05:25.350> it

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
hasn't changed much I like I like big it

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.879 
hasn't changed much I like I like big it
really<00:05:25.710> is<00:05:25.770> my<00:05:25.860> favorite<00:05:26.220> character<00:05:26.669> I<00:05:27.889> can

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
really is my favorite character I can

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.730 
really is my favorite character I can
ride<00:05:29.220> it<00:05:29.370> but<00:05:29.610> I<00:05:30.020> find<00:05:31.020> I<00:05:31.110> can<00:05:31.260> do<00:05:31.350> most<00:05:31.500> of<00:05:31.680> the

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
ride it but I find I can do most of the

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.080 
ride it but I find I can do most of the
moves<00:05:31.889> just<00:05:32.010> about<00:05:32.250> the<00:05:32.370> same<00:05:32.580> only

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
moves just about the same only

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.529 
moves just about the same only
advantages<00:05:33.720> I<00:05:33.870> would<00:05:34.020> say<00:05:34.200> is<00:05:34.260> that<00:05:35.539> this

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
advantages I would say is that this

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.779 
advantages I would say is that this
button<00:05:36.990> layout<00:05:37.289> feels<00:05:38.039> a<00:05:38.130> lot<00:05:38.250> better<00:05:38.460> than

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
button layout feels a lot better than

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:39.740 
button layout feels a lot better than
you<00:05:38.940> know<00:05:39.030> having<00:05:39.300> to<00:05:39.360> press<00:05:39.539> these<00:05:39.690> two

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
you know having to press these two

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.340 
you know having to press these two
buttons<00:05:39.930> here<00:05:40.289> but<00:05:40.800> as<00:05:41.700> far<00:05:41.970> as<00:05:42.000> the<00:05:42.389> joypad

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
buttons here but as far as the joypad

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.710 
buttons here but as far as the joypad
that<00:05:43.880> I'm<00:05:44.880> thinking<00:05:45.060> of<00:05:45.270> maybe<00:05:45.389> getting<00:05:45.690> a

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
that I'm thinking of maybe getting a

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.480 
that I'm thinking of maybe getting a
stick<00:05:46.020> but<00:05:46.440> I've<00:05:46.740> heard<00:05:46.979> bad<00:05:47.100> things<00:05:47.280> about

stick but I've heard bad things about

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.090 
stick but I've heard bad things about
