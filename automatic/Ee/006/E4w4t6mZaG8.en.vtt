a<00:01:07.200> sort<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.890> transparent<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.840> works

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
a sort of transparent and that works

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.429 
a sort of transparent and that works
with<00:01:10.350> well<00:01:11.010> with<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.340> atom<00:01:11.670> launcher<00:01:12.439> since

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
with well with the atom launcher since

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.420 
with well with the atom launcher since
you<00:01:13.590> can<00:01:13.860> also<00:01:14.640> make<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.450> transparent<00:01:16.229> to

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
you can also make this transparent to

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.090 
you can also make this transparent to
whether<00:01:17.430> your<00:01:17.610> app<00:01:17.759> set<00:01:18.320> anyway<00:01:19.320> very<00:01:19.890> nice

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
whether your app set anyway very nice

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.330 
whether your app set anyway very nice
rom<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.700> also<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.090> do<00:01:21.390> get<00:01:21.860> Perseus<00:01:22.860> kernel

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
rom and also you do get Perseus kernel

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.999 
rom and also you do get Perseus kernel
which<00:01:24.030> allows<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.689> overclock<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.500> 1.8

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
which allows you to overclock to 1.8

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.850 
which allows you to overclock to 1.8
giga<00:01:26.220> hertz<00:01:26.840> Perseus<00:01:27.840> alpha<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.320> see<00:01:28.530> it's

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
giga hertz Perseus alpha you see it's

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.240 
giga hertz Perseus alpha you see it's
all<00:01:29.100> like<00:01:29.310> transparent<00:01:30.030> um<00:01:30.920> so<00:01:31.920> let's<00:01:32.130> go

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
all like transparent um so let's go

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.980 
all like transparent um so let's go
ahead<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.460> overclock<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.840> actually

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
ahead and overclock it it is actually

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.330 
ahead and overclock it it is actually
overclocked<00:01:34.590> but<00:01:34.799> let<00:01:34.920> me<00:01:34.950> show<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.130> how<00:01:35.189> to

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
overclocked but let me show you how to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.760 
overclocked but let me show you how to
do<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:36.360> does<00:01:36.540> come<00:01:36.750> with<00:01:36.780> s<00:01:37.110> tweaks<00:01:37.530> app

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
do it it does come with s tweaks app

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.340 
do it it does come with s tweaks app
which<00:01:38.549> comes<00:01:38.820> with<00:01:38.909> Perseus<00:01:39.479> colonel<00:01:39.869> if<00:01:40.259> you

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
which comes with Perseus colonel if you

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.999 
which comes with Perseus colonel if you
go<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.619> here<00:01:41.000> will<00:01:42.000> find<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.720> CPU<00:01:43.200> scaling

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
go in here will find the CPU scaling

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.520 
go in here will find the CPU scaling
here<00:01:44.250> go<00:01:44.759> ahead<00:01:44.970> I'm<00:01:45.210> sorry<00:01:45.450> CPU<00:01:45.869> here<00:01:46.079> go

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
here go ahead I'm sorry CPU here go

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.050 
here go ahead I'm sorry CPU here go
ahead<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.710> set<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.340> maximum<00:01:47.850> frequency

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
ahead and set it the maximum frequency

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.289 
ahead and set it the maximum frequency
it<00:01:48.600> would<00:01:49.020> be<00:01:49.170> set<00:01:49.380> out<00:01:49.460> 1600<00:01:50.460> megahertz<00:01:50.610> you

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
it would be set out 1600 megahertz you

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.270 
it would be set out 1600 megahertz you
can<00:01:51.420> overclock<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.899> up<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.380> eighteen<00:01:53.070> hundred

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
can overclock it up to eighteen hundred

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.520 
can overclock it up to eighteen hundred
