00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 to make the spider we will need 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.530
 paint a white face screams a face 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:14.040
 black also screams shouts of polyester 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:18.060
 Number 8 the weight of it too 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.060
 screams and the 10- numbered brush 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.320
 and reference 305 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:29.609
 Let's start the evolutionary cap date 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.189
 let's start with the ink we go 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:38.239
 make two balls 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:42.500
 the first smallest ball and the second May 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.500
 as if it were an 8 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:57.059
 Let's fill this little ball bigger than 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:01:00.989
 head and the body of the spider here would be the 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:08.130
 her mouth that are 22 points 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:16.850
 we will do a leg two legs again 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:21.240
 one leg we'll raise our legs 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:29.119
 Who are out and now let's do 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:29.119
 another leg down another 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:46.800
 and another and more we'll wash the brush 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:54.830
 and with the white paint also paint each 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:54.830
 let's get two white points here 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.850
 let's make the web up would be a trait 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.619
 another braid 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.690
 but not here in the middle 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.310
 this one would be bigger than these two 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:31.319
 there we do 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:33.600
 another brings here and another here and more 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:42.650
 and we are going to work with a 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:42.650
 circle none 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.780
 Let's repeat another web here. 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:19.600
 with a half circle the boys adore in 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.600
 party again 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:31.550
 who has an interest in deepening and 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:35.090
 perfect I have a DVD teaching the 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:40.510
 I also give the paintings 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:43.700
 private or group 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.830
 now let's play the cry of glitter I 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.860
 I put inside those little bottles that 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:57.580
 they're easier for us to use 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:57.580
 we spend less nÃ© 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.730
 we have a spider that fits for a boy 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:11.830
 for the girl they adore and whoever they want 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:11.830
 classes or my dvd is just to get in touch 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.980
 Thank you and good luck.
