00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.049
 hello and welcome behavior 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:13.340
 cook today we prepare such a janka 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:13.340
 too much fun 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.810
 For this we need post-cut like 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:26.880
 for example salami mortadella and 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:30.050
 ham a glass of ledger gherkins 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.050
 with a little dry water 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:42.650
 Somewhat casual, some crÃ¨me fraiche and 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:45.940
 a lemon and the watson salt pepper 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.940
 and some sugar 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.920
 First we cut the sausage in 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.920
 small stripes 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.040
 then we cut the cucumber believe 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.170
 then we take the paprika out of the 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:31.570
 lead out and cut the ledger glass 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.860
 also small in a pot we leave 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.960
 be increased slightly 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.960
 from the fry then around the wurststÃ¼ckchen 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.370
 then we give the civilians and 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.370
 sympathy no goal 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.500
 Now we fill the whole with the weather 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.500
 and chunks of water 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.180
 The soljanka should be a bit too thick 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:33.189
 just whether something is water 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:37.200
 In addition, let the solyanka be moderate 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:37.200
 Heat about 15 minutes simmer 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.440
 To conclude this janker with salt 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.440
 pepper and sugar to taste 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.909
 these countries with creme fraiche and one 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.829
 lemon slice very much we wish a lot 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.040

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.040
