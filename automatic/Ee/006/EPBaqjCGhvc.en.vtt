tell you what you do about it you make a
clone<00:00:56.760> I've<00:00:56.999> made<00:00:57.629> mine<00:00:57.989> we'll<00:00:58.589> have<00:00:58.709> a<00:00:58.739> look

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
clone I've made mine we'll have a look

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.709 
clone I've made mine we'll have a look
so<00:01:01.260> here<00:01:01.469> we<00:01:01.589> are<00:01:01.709> this<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.339> my<00:01:02.519> experiment<00:01:03.239> he

so here we are this is my experiment he
is<00:01:03.989> my<00:01:04.470> clone<00:01:04.860> yes<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.640> used<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:06.210> little<00:01:06.360> bit<00:01:06.450> of

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
is my clone yes I used a little bit of

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.380 
is my clone yes I used a little bit of
DNA<00:01:06.990> from<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.320> inside<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.830> my<00:01:08.159> leg<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.240> tell

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
DNA from the inside of my leg and I tell

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.610 
DNA from the inside of my leg and I tell
you<00:01:09.420> what<00:01:09.600> he's<00:01:09.720> really<00:01:09.930> good<00:01:10.170> at<00:01:10.260> weeding

are we're going to have a look at the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.280 
are we're going to have a look at the
clone<00:01:17.070> at<00:01:17.250> work<00:01:17.520> remember<00:01:18.240> no<00:01:18.630> sudden<00:01:18.930> moves

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
clone at work remember no sudden moves

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.710 
clone at work remember no sudden moves
and<00:01:19.830> no<00:01:20.040> loud<00:01:20.280> noises<00:01:20.390> we<00:01:21.390> don't<00:01:21.450> want<00:01:21.630> to

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
fine tilth is being produced look no

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.460 
fine tilth is being produced look no
work<00:01:29.190> being<00:01:29.430> done<00:01:29.520> by<00:01:29.670> my<00:01:30.000> hands<00:01:30.450> all<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.290> work

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
work being done by my hands all the work

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.040 
work being done by my hands all the work
is<00:01:31.650> being<00:01:31.710> done<00:01:31.950> by<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.670> clone<00:01:33.090> will<00:01:33.840> leave

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
is being done by the clone will leave

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:44.690 
is being done by the clone will leave
him<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.230> his<00:01:34.410> job<00:01:43.070> here<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.190> are<00:01:44.310> at<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.550> onion

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
him to his job here we are at the onion

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.550 
him to his job here we are at the onion
patch<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.360> course<00:01:45.660> you<00:01:45.780> do<00:01:45.900> get<00:01:46.080> problems<00:01:46.440> with

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
patch of course you do get problems with

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.470 
patch of course you do get problems with
clones<00:01:46.860> they've<00:01:47.370> never<00:01:47.550> seen<00:01:47.790> anything<00:01:48.300> quite

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
clones they've never seen anything quite

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.960 
clones they've never seen anything quite
so<00:01:48.690> sophisticated<00:01:49.200> as<00:01:49.830> my<00:01:50.190> bird<00:01:50.490> scarers

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
so sophisticated as my bird scarers

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.420 
so sophisticated as my bird scarers
before<00:01:51.530> so<00:01:52.530> we'll<00:01:52.650> just<00:01:52.710> leave<00:01:53.040> them<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.340> get

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
before so we'll just leave them to get

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.490 
before so we'll just leave them to get
used<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.730> it<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.450> maybe<00:01:54.690> he<00:01:54.990> might<00:01:55.140> do<00:01:55.320> some

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
used to it and maybe he might do some

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.440 
used to it and maybe he might do some
weeding<00:01:55.760> but<00:01:56.760> of<00:01:56.880> course<00:01:56.909> there's<00:01:57.240> always<00:01:57.330> a

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
weeding but of course there's always a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.320 
weeding but of course there's always a
problem<00:01:58.050> with<00:01:58.860> your<00:01:59.100> clone<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.700> get<00:02:00.060> out<00:02:00.150> of

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
problem with your clone I get out of

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.180 
problem with your clone I get out of
control<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.320> need<00:02:01.530> somewhere<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.920> lock

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
control so you need somewhere to lock

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.649 
control so you need somewhere to lock
them<00:02:02.340> up

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.840 

nice<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.930> safe<00:02:07.200> he'll<00:02:07.650> have<00:02:07.890> no<00:02:08.069> one<00:02:08.250> tonight

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.270 

so<00:02:11.850> what<00:02:12.450> we<00:02:12.630> learned<00:02:12.840> today<00:02:13.010> we've<00:02:14.010> learned

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
so what we learned today we've learned

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.330 
so what we learned today we've learned
that<00:02:14.430> making<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.819> clone<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.750> useful<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:17.160> can

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
that making a clone is useful you can

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.370 
that making a clone is useful you can
make<00:02:17.520> him<00:02:17.700> work<00:02:17.940> do<00:02:18.600> lots<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.930> things<00:02:18.990> that<00:02:19.350> you

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
make him work do lots of things that you

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.160 
make him work do lots of things that you
just<00:02:19.470> can't<00:02:20.100> be<00:02:20.220> bothered<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.550> do<00:02:20.819> so<00:02:21.780> it's

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
just can't be bothered to do so it's

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.830 
just can't be bothered to do so it's
just<00:02:22.380> really<00:02:22.590> quick<00:02:22.830> one<00:02:23.010> today<00:02:23.330> but<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.540> just

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
just really quick one today but I just
