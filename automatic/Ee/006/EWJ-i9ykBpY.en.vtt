00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.010
 the community of competitive players 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.360
 fighting game has practically exploded 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.890
 in the last decade 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.900
 and those who have decided are not few 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.610
 to dedicate body and soul to the world 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.380
 hidden of fighting games 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.360
 maybe even just playing like leaves 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.160
 online hope one day to do 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.379
 peep into the list of names present 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.449
 student we don't talk about hidden world a 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.519
 in case the fighting games are in fact among the 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.440
 more layered titles in circulation 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:43.870
 has an uninteresting eye can 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.579
 look like simple and accessible games 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.559
 but in reality their systems are 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.510
 monstrously complex and can 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.999
 to be mastered only after months and 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.219
 months of hard training a quantity 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:57.050
 unimaginable of data and techniques populates 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.420
 this strange planet made of hype 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.339
 combos and virtual barrels and practically 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.739
 only one thing almost agrees 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.080
 all when it comes to the competitive the 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.580
 re and street fighter iv despite the 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.950
 high level exits seen in the last one 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.540
 period in tournaments in many 20 is always 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.880
 been dedicated to the work of gold and 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.980
 company renewed over the years with 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.500
 numerous rebalancing editions e 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.150
 apparently added characters though 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.000
 capcom decided to pull out of the 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.990
 hat a latest version of the game 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.300
 an expansion not particularly 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.590
 developmentally expensive but 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.260
 important to bring attention back 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.060
 on the genre and who knows convince capoccia 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.610
 company to hunt some money 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.320
 for a completely new title 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.630
 sir has arrived among us ultra street 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.400
 fighter iv will be the perfect closure for 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.910
 the game or business of 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.490
 low alloy 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.020
 let's start from the first and more 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.950
 evident and addition of poole between street 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.110
 fighter iv 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.940
 the new characters are five 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.560
 new entries in title four of the 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.750
 which already notes that played street 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.300
 fighter with stacked warrior names 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.310
 I am poison hugo and I represent and e 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.810
 goats is in effect it's about 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.270
 direct transpositions of the game 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.890
 above mentioned for moves and animations is not 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.960
 certainly a great example of commitment seen 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.550
 evident recycling of assets but at least a 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.110
 fighters management level is 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.909
 a great job was done 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.470
 none of the new entries from 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:14.280
 the impression of being over the top 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.200
 strong or inadequate roast 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.970
 and there seems to be no obstacle with 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.069
 the old warriors available 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.780
 different the speech for de capre that can 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.970
 seem the least inspired character 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.310
 of the quintet but actually a tasty one 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.680
 novelty the goats is in fact a clone of 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.330
 change but on the cause of his background 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.250
 otherwise it differs entirely from the 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.230
 female soldier in swimsuit proposing one 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.580
 fast fighting style based on 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.010
 teleportation and aggression 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.840
 constant and also a churchill cup for 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.040
 what the difference further 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.900
 from his sister 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.970
 ok re-use also in this case of 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.950
 pre-existing models turn up their noses 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.720
 nevertheless it is appreciable to see that there is 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.959
 at least one original choice at 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.300
 gameplay 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.980
 the most curious feature of ultrÃ  

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.450
 street fighter iv does not reside however 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.700
 in the enlargement of the roster 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.590
 new challengers shuffle the cards in 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.180
 table but pale before and 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.400
 changes to the balance and to the 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.010
 system facts in this edition the 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.480
 game boasts three new mechanics 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.120
 able to brutally change the face 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.950
 of challenges the first is focus network a 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.050
 focus attack capable of absorbing a 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.239
 any number of strokes but consumes 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.290
 two notches of the bar super little stuff 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.730
 you say 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.620
 yet it is actually a technique 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.790
 useful for characters capable of 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.640
 overturn a match with combinations 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.430
 devastating second grappler workings 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.140
 and delayed wake up is indeed possible 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.420
 lie down for a few moments in 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.130
 more after a net knockdown by dancing 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.360
 entirely the timing of those who exploit 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.250
 the thing to keep strong 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.350
 pressure on the opponent 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.180
 he latest news is tradable la 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.160
 possibility to select both 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.440
 ultra during a match at the cost of a little 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.030
 from time to time this choice opens up various 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.680
 strategies for some cast members in 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.390
 battle offering more situations 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.019
 dangerous to take advantage of 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.850
 benefit 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.230
 put these found together in one 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.060
 series of heavy touches to the whole 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.769
 roster and you will get a twisted game a 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.390
 level of balance where 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.820
 the balance of power has changed 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.380
 completely we would like to be able to tell you from 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.970
 immediately if work done from this point 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.829
 of view was impeccable either 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.989
 disastrous fact is that it is impossible 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.910
 give a precise evaluation at the moment 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.920
 what is certain is that grs for like 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.959
 theo kazan jeff come out of that smile 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.280
 from the tornado of changes that the tests in 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.350
 Japan showed a great deal 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.940
 diversification of the top ten is that the 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.489
 home has consulted many experts 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.570
 so we better balance 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.380
 so we should be able to do enough 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.120
 sure 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.250
 as always the neophytes barely 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.480
 they will notice the differences but if you don't have them 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.730
 in your daily bread 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.680
 tremble people nothing will be the same as before 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.390
 as for the contents instead 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.010
 there is not much else to say 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.870
 apart from the inclusion of a team battery 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.280
 online fashions and interesting chances 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.000
 to train online in the company of a 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.280
 other player 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.960
 the game only offers extra stages 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.970
 also coming from street fighter 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.100
 kroos stecher and the direct upload of 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.080
 video on youtube the most curious edition 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.430
 select which allows you to choose the 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.840
 previous versions of the fighters 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.430
 during a match 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.140
 if you already think you can unleash the 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.060
 terror among your friends using vanin 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.290
 the saga, however, be careful 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.790
 old versions cannot 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.190
 use the extra mechanics of the 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.110
 their ultra ultra street fighter version 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.800
 iv turned out to be exactly what there 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.720
 We expected 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.370
 a highly edited edition a 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.500
 level of balance and novelty in the 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.850
 system that however disappoints a lot when one does 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.010
 they are going to take into consideration 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.350
 actual content offered and recycling of 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.240
 assen already used the experts will have 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.430
 much to rejoice seen the earthquake 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.900
 of news in the mechanics in the data but 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.060
 for them this was already a purchase 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.510
 there is not much for everyone else 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.510
 meat on the fire
