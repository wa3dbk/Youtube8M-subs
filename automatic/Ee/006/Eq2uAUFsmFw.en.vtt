00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
pyramids mud so today i mothered a

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.290 
pyramids mud so today i mothered a
pyramids<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.010> tools<00:00:08.370> I<00:00:08.550> use<00:00:08.580> was<00:00:09.059> a

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
pyramids and the tools I use was a

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.570 
pyramids and the tools I use was a
screwdriver<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:10.170> course<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.769> get<00:00:11.010> this<00:00:11.280> ruse

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
screwdriver of course to get this ruse

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.940 
screwdriver of course to get this ruse
out<00:00:11.820> so<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.570> could<00:00:12.750> get<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:12.960> sentence<00:00:13.469> out<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:13.830> do

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
out so I could get a sentence out and do

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.660 
out so I could get a sentence out and do
some<00:00:14.250> any<00:00:14.549> things<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.900> other<00:00:15.960> pieces<00:00:16.670> then

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
some any things to the other pieces then

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.349 
some any things to the other pieces then
I<00:00:17.699> used<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.539> knife<00:00:18.750> for<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.140> cutting<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:20.270> then<00:00:21.270> I

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
I used a knife for a cutting and then I

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.590 
I used a knife for a cutting and then I
used<00:00:21.600> some<00:00:21.750> sandpaper<00:00:22.350> for<00:00:23.160> sanding<00:00:23.600> down

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
used some sandpaper for sanding down

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.849 
used some sandpaper for sanding down
things<00:00:25.939> so<00:00:26.939> I'm<00:00:27.269> just<00:00:27.689> going<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.230> go<00:00:28.349> over<00:00:28.529> all

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
things so I'm just going to go over all

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.740 
things so I'm just going to go over all
the<00:00:29.010> pieces<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.609> actually<00:00:29.789> did<00:00:30.210> something<00:00:30.630> to

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
the pieces I actually did something to

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.840 
the pieces I actually did something to
all<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.080> pieces<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.560> that's<00:00:32.309> pretty<00:00:32.640> cool

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
all of the pieces so that's pretty cool

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.729 
all of the pieces so that's pretty cool
I<00:00:33.149> can't<00:00:33.960> wait<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.260> try<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.620> out<00:00:36.170> so<00:00:37.170> fill<00:00:37.440> these

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
I can't wait to try it out so fill these

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.770 
I can't wait to try it out so fill these
pieces<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.460> didn't<00:00:38.700> really<00:00:38.910> do<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.090> much<00:00:39.300> I

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
pieces I didn't really do that much I

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.549 
pieces I didn't really do that much I
just<00:00:40.370> listen<00:00:41.370> miss<00:00:41.610> mold<00:00:41.879> right<00:00:42.180> here<00:00:45.289> which<00:00:46.289> I

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
just listen miss mold right here which I

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.290 
just listen miss mold right here which I
just<00:00:46.620> cut<00:00:47.129> off<00:00:47.250> like<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:49.820> did<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:50.850> with<00:00:51.180> all

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
just cut off like I did that with all

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.930 
just cut off like I did that with all
the<00:00:51.449> pieces<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:52.250> don't<00:00:53.250> know<00:00:53.460> if<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.789> will

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
the pieces I don't know if it will

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.920 
the pieces I don't know if it will
change<00:00:53.969> anything<00:00:54.660> but<00:00:55.050> why<00:00:56.039> not<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.460> then<00:00:56.930> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
change anything but why not and then the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.049 
change anything but why not and then the
next<00:00:58.199> thing<00:00:58.530> I'll<00:00:58.859> just<00:00:58.890> show<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.460> the

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
next thing I'll just show you the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.990 
next thing I'll just show you the
sensors<00:01:00.920> so<00:01:01.920> what<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.100> did<00:01:02.280> was<00:01:02.460> around<00:01:02.820> with

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
sensors so what I did was around with

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.960 
sensors so what I did was around with
these<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:06.170> rounded<00:01:07.170> here<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.810> here<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.140> there

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
these I rounded here and here and there

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.530 
these I rounded here and here and there
so<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.360> will<00:01:12.540> allow<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:14.030> cut<00:01:15.030> corners<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.509> bit

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
so it will allow it to cut corners a bit

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.730 
so it will allow it to cut corners a bit
more<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.259> stop<00:01:17.189> blocking<00:01:17.430> up<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.880> much<00:01:18.740> then

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
more and stop blocking up that much then

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.039 
more and stop blocking up that much then
the<00:01:19.979> next<00:01:20.310> thing<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.180> can<00:01:21.420> just<00:01:21.450> show<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
the next thing I can just show you the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.370 
the next thing I can just show you the
center<00:01:22.460> I<00:01:23.460> didn't<00:01:24.330> really<00:01:24.509> do<00:01:24.659> much<00:01:24.689> though<00:01:25.229> as

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
center I didn't really do much though as

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.320 
center I didn't really do much though as
a<00:01:25.409> few<00:01:25.710> miss<00:01:25.890> malls<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.640> edges<00:01:26.970> here

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
a few miss malls and the edges here

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.359 
a few miss malls and the edges here
which<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.110> just<00:01:28.350> fixed<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.610> that's<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:31.369> one

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
which is just fixed so that's it and one

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.060 
which is just fixed so that's it and one
of<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.579> more<00:01:32.729> exciting<00:01:33.090> things<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.740> have

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
of the more exciting things that I have

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.230 
of the more exciting things that I have
not<00:01:35.400> if<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:36.060> going<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.450> work<00:01:36.689> but<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.520> hope<00:01:38.520> so

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
not if it's going to work but I hope so

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.319 
not if it's going to work but I hope so
I<00:01:39.450> take<00:01:39.659> these<00:01:39.990> two<00:01:40.020> pieces<00:01:40.759> actually<00:01:41.759> did<00:01:42.180> it

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
I take these two pieces actually did it

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.330 
I take these two pieces actually did it
one<00:01:42.720> at<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> time<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.500> faceted<00:01:43.920> this<00:01:44.070> piece

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
one at a time so the faceted this piece

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.859 
one at a time so the faceted this piece
and<00:01:44.549> then<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.700> piece<00:01:44.880> but<00:01:45.299> if<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.600> put<00:01:45.780> them

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
and then that piece but if you put them

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.850 
and then that piece but if you put them
together<00:01:46.049> you'll<00:01:46.439> see<00:01:46.710> what<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.920> did

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
together you'll see what I did

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.910 
together you'll see what I did
that's<00:01:49.860> going<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.340> look<00:01:50.729> something<00:01:51.060> like

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.260 

like<00:01:56.920> this<00:01:59.250> so<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.370> idea<00:02:00.640> behind<00:02:00.760> it<00:02:01.090> is<00:02:01.240> that

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
like this so the idea behind it is that

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.890 
like this so the idea behind it is that
the<00:02:01.600> ball<00:02:01.870> when<00:02:02.710> it<00:02:02.830> goes<00:02:03.070> around<00:02:03.250> from<00:02:03.940> one

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
the ball when it goes around from one

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.440 
the ball when it goes around from one
point<00:02:05.530> to<00:02:05.740> another<00:02:05.830> point<00:02:06.130> it<00:02:06.940> normally<00:02:07.270> has

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
point to another point it normally has

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.410 
point to another point it normally has
to<00:02:07.690> slide<00:02:08.680> over<00:02:08.920> a<00:02:09.190> lot<00:02:09.340> of<00:02:09.460> plastic<00:02:10.119> which

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
to slide over a lot of plastic which

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.720 
to slide over a lot of plastic which
will<00:02:10.680> make<00:02:11.680> it<00:02:11.710> a<00:02:11.860> bit<00:02:12.010> harder<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:14.170> move<00:02:14.890> so

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
will make it a bit harder to to move so

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.530 
will make it a bit harder to to move so
instead<00:02:16.360> I<00:02:16.540> just<00:02:17.220> totally<00:02:18.220> erased<00:02:18.970> this<00:02:19.210> part

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
instead I just totally erased this part

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.190 
instead I just totally erased this part
of<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.900> track<00:02:20.140> so<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.940> kind<00:02:22.330> of<00:02:22.390> just<00:02:22.690> pops<00:02:22.930> out

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
of the track so it kind of just pops out

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.620 
of the track so it kind of just pops out
and<00:02:23.410> then<00:02:23.620> it<00:02:23.800> did<00:02:24.250> all<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.060> way<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.240> the<00:02:25.450> next

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
and then it did all the way to the next

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.870 
and then it did all the way to the next
one<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:26.980> should<00:02:27.130> make<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.460> tips<00:02:27.670> turn

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
one so it should make the tips turn

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:35.910 
one so it should make the tips turn
faster<00:02:28.710> hopefully<00:02:31.740> so<00:02:32.740> it<00:02:32.950> seems<00:02:33.310> like<00:02:33.459> I<00:02:34.920> got

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
faster hopefully so it seems like I got

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:43.100 
faster hopefully so it seems like I got
to<00:02:36.459> put<00:02:36.940> them<00:02:37.150> in<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.930> right<00:02:38.140> positions<00:02:38.890> I

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.360 

mean<00:02:44.110> this<00:02:44.290> turret<00:02:44.740> correct

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
mean this turret correct

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.780 
mean this turret correct
but<00:02:46.170> what<00:02:47.170> did<00:02:47.350> I<00:02:47.440> swap<00:02:47.680> those<00:02:47.950> two<00:02:49.650> yeah<00:02:50.790> and

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
but what did I swap those two yeah and

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.400 
but what did I swap those two yeah and
then<00:02:51.910> I<00:02:51.970> can<00:02:52.120> also<00:02:52.240> put<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.660> edge<00:02:52.780> pieces<00:02:53.140> in

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
then I can also put the edge pieces in

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
then I can also put the edge pieces in
because<00:02:53.680> also<00:02:53.950> forgot<00:02:54.220> to<00:02:54.250> put<00:02:54.490> them<00:02:54.670> in<00:02:56.430> after

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
because also forgot to put them in after

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.620 
because also forgot to put them in after
this<00:02:57.640> I'm<00:02:57.850> going<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.150> put<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.900> tips<00:02:59.140> on<00:02:59.350> and

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
this I'm going to put the tips on and

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:07.040 
this I'm going to put the tips on and
put<00:03:01.630> in<00:03:01.720> some<00:03:01.930> lube<00:03:02.200> and<00:03:02.650> see<00:03:02.830> what<00:03:03.070> happens

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:20.090 

actually<00:03:08.050> I<00:03:08.380> might<00:03:08.620> readjusting<00:03:09.280> before<00:03:11.280> tips

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.960 

it's<00:03:21.100> like<00:03:21.340> super<00:03:21.850> tight<00:03:23.580> so<00:03:24.580> I<00:03:24.670> got<00:03:24.850> it

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
it's like super tight so I got it

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.050 
it's like super tight so I got it
tensioned<00:03:25.570> a<00:03:25.810> bit<00:03:25.989> so<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:26.830> I'll<00:03:26.980> just<00:03:27.340> apply

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
tensioned a bit so and I'll just apply

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.170 
tensioned a bit so and I'll just apply
some<00:03:28.380> lubrication<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:32.709> tips<00:03:33.070> feels<00:03:33.519> really

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
some lubrication the tips feels really

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:56.110 
some lubrication the tips feels really
weird<00:03:36.870> really<00:03:37.870> weird

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.900 

so<00:03:56.690> finished<00:03:57.110> putting<00:03:57.440> it<00:03:57.650> together<00:03:57.950> looping

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
so finished putting it together looping

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:05.650 
so finished putting it together looping
it<00:03:59.090> and<00:03:59.300> I<00:04:00.880> just<00:04:01.880> finished<00:04:02.120> it<00:04:04.270> ready<00:04:05.270> to<00:04:05.510> do

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
it and I just finished it ready to do

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.680 
it and I just finished it ready to do
some<00:04:05.959> Souls<00:04:06.290> and<00:04:06.650> see<00:04:07.010> if<00:04:07.220> it's<00:04:07.400> good<00:04:07.790> or<00:04:08.209> it

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
some Souls and see if it's good or it

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.630 
some Souls and see if it's good or it
feels<00:04:08.900> and<00:04:09.170> thoughts<00:04:09.410> I<00:04:09.530> might<00:04:09.830> stop<00:04:10.250> during

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
feels and thoughts I might stop during

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.089 
feels and thoughts I might stop during
or<00:04:11.510> in<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:11.780> middle<00:04:11.989> of<00:04:12.020> this<00:04:12.140> whole<00:04:12.349> or<00:04:12.769> after

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
or in the middle of this whole or after

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.360 
or in the middle of this whole or after
I<00:04:13.130> solved<00:04:13.550> just<00:04:13.610> to<00:04:14.000> readjust<00:04:14.300> it<00:04:14.840> or

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
I solved just to readjust it or

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.690 
I solved just to readjust it or
something<00:04:16.370> because<00:04:18.280> you<00:04:19.280> cannot<00:04:19.459> have<00:04:19.639> a

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
something because you cannot have a

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:53.840 
something because you cannot have a
puzzle<00:04:20.030> it's<00:04:20.180> not<00:04:24.520> very<00:04:25.520> good<00:04:25.840> everything

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:33.320 

three<00:04:55.140> flat<00:05:08.670> 3<00:05:09.670> flat<00:05:09.880> again

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:06:00.719 

3:22

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:25.420 

boom<00:06:02.889> that's<00:06:04.930> 294<00:06:05.930> plus<00:06:06.229> 2

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430
