00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.619 
was one of my office's fun games I've
been<00:06:31.919> able<00:06:32.039> to<00:06:32.159> watch<00:06:32.310> like<00:06:32.639> I<00:06:32.819> was<00:06:33.030> studying

00:06:33.619 --> 00:06:33.629 
been able to watch like I was studying

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:35.240 
been able to watch like I was studying
over<00:06:33.990> myself<00:06:34.169> trying<00:06:34.500> to<00:06:34.560> get<00:06:34.770> out<00:06:34.889> everything

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
over myself trying to get out everything

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.100 
over myself trying to get out everything
that<00:06:35.280> I<00:06:35.400> wanted<00:06:35.729> to<00:06:35.879> I<00:06:35.909> mean<00:06:36.090> there's<00:06:36.690> just<00:06:36.900> so

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
that I wanted to I mean there's just so

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.930 
that I wanted to I mean there's just so
much<00:06:37.349> going<00:06:37.409> on<00:06:37.770> in<00:06:37.919> every<00:06:38.159> single<00:06:38.310> fight<00:06:38.610> and

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 
much going on in every single fight and

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.999 
much going on in every single fight and
for<00:06:39.870> complexity<00:06:40.259> to<00:06:40.470> be<00:06:40.560> able<00:06:40.620> to<00:06:40.770> win<00:06:40.860> that

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:41.009 
for complexity to be able to win that

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:42.230 
for complexity to be able to win that
there<00:06:41.190> were<00:06:41.280> time<00:06:41.520> periods<00:06:41.879> where<00:06:42.000> I<00:06:42.030> was<00:06:42.180> like

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 
there were time periods where I was like

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.820 
there were time periods where I was like
okay<00:06:42.569> they've<00:06:42.810> just<00:06:43.169> lost<00:06:43.319> the<00:06:43.470> game<00:06:43.500> like

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830 
okay they've just lost the game like

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:44.960 
okay they've just lost the game like
they<00:06:43.949> weren't<00:06:44.099> able<00:06:44.220> to<00:06:44.310> push<00:06:44.520> they<00:06:44.639> got<00:06:44.789> only

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:44.970 
they weren't able to push they got only

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.509 
they weren't able to push they got only
one<00:06:45.180> SAT<00:06:45.330> around
