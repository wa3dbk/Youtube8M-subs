turning<00:02:23.200> then<00:02:23.380> you'll<00:02:23.500> be<00:02:23.590> fine<00:02:23.769> so<00:02:24.280> now<00:02:24.400> let's

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
turning then you'll be fine so now let's

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.940 
turning then you'll be fine so now let's
go<00:02:24.730> into<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.060> pieces<00:02:25.540> so<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.440> take<00:02:26.709> out<00:02:26.860> the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
go into the pieces so to take out the

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.259 
go into the pieces so to take out the
pieces<00:02:27.160> I've<00:02:27.400> found<00:02:27.580> that<00:02:27.670> it's<00:02:27.820> easiest<00:02:28.060> to

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
pieces I've found that it's easiest to

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.240 
pieces I've found that it's easiest to
just<00:02:28.300> turn<00:02:28.630> it<00:02:28.750> 45<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:29.230> just<00:02:29.350> grab<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:29.980> corner

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
just turn it 45 and just grab a corner

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.580 
just turn it 45 and just grab a corner
out<00:02:30.400> to<00:02:31.239> have<00:02:31.360> another<00:02:31.510> corner<00:02:31.840> out<00:02:31.959> and<00:02:32.200> then

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
out to have another corner out and then

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.990 
out to have another corner out and then
the<00:02:32.709> edge<00:02:32.830> will<00:02:33.010> pop<00:02:33.160> out<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.459> as<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.730> can<00:02:33.820> see

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
the edge will pop out and as you can see

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.870 
the edge will pop out and as you can see
there's<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.269> ball<00:02:34.450> court<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.680> pieces<00:02:35.920> you

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
there's a ball court and the pieces you

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.690 
there's a ball court and the pieces you
can<00:02:37.000> see<00:02:37.150> there's<00:02:37.330> pretty<00:02:37.750> much<00:02:37.780> standard<00:02:38.700> 3x3

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
can see there's pretty much standard 3x3

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.000 
can see there's pretty much standard 3x3
pieces<00:02:40.000> that<00:02:40.150> were<00:02:40.239> used<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.829> they<00:02:41.829> fit

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
pieces that were used to they fit

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.550 
pieces that were used to they fit
together<00:02:42.130> like<00:02:42.519> a<00:02:42.549> normal<00:02:42.640> throw<00:02:43.060> 3<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:43.720> the

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
together like a normal throw 3 and the

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.259 
together like a normal throw 3 and the
pieces<00:02:44.799> are<00:02:44.980> little<00:02:45.280> different<00:02:45.610> so<00:02:46.120> when

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
pieces are little different so when

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.210 
pieces are little different so when
you're<00:02:46.390> turning<00:02:46.660> it<00:02:46.750> this<00:02:47.230> piece<00:02:47.709> the<00:02:48.010> corner

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
you're turning it this piece the corner

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.970 
you're turning it this piece the corner
goes<00:02:48.370> underneath<00:02:49.590> that<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.769> when<00:02:50.860> you're

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
goes underneath that and when you're

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.710 
goes underneath that and when you're
actually<00:02:51.100> turning<00:02:51.400> it<00:02:51.640> it<00:02:52.239> kind<00:02:52.420> of<00:02:52.480> feels

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
actually turning it it kind of feels

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.410 
actually turning it it kind of feels
weird<00:02:53.019> because<00:02:53.340> your<00:02:54.340> hand<00:02:54.610> goes<00:02:54.940> over<00:02:55.390> that

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
weird because your hand goes over that

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.890 
weird because your hand goes over that
smooth<00:02:56.079> part<00:02:56.380> right<00:02:56.560> there<00:02:57.540> so<00:02:58.540> it<00:02:58.600> just<00:02:58.630> feels

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
smooth part right there so it just feels

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.259 
smooth part right there so it just feels
a<00:02:59.049> little<00:02:59.110> bit<00:02:59.350> weirder<00:02:59.709> and<00:03:00.220> so<00:03:00.940> there<00:03:01.120> the

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
a little bit weirder and so there the

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.810 
a little bit weirder and so there the
pieces<00:03:01.799> again<00:03:02.799> there's<00:03:02.980> a<00:03:03.040> ball<00:03:03.220> core<00:03:03.519> and<00:03:03.700> put

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
pieces again there's a ball core and put

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.390 
pieces again there's a ball core and put
them<00:03:03.970> back<00:03:04.090> in<00:03:04.470> what<00:03:05.470> I<00:03:05.500> usually<00:03:05.709> do<00:03:05.950> is<00:03:06.160> I<00:03:06.370> just

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
them back in what I usually do is I just

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.880 
them back in what I usually do is I just
put<00:03:06.790> in<00:03:06.940> a<00:03:07.950> corner<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:09.700> an<00:03:09.910> edge<00:03:10.739> which<00:03:11.739> is

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
put in a corner and an edge which is

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.150 
put in a corner and an edge which is
very<00:03:12.190> difficult<00:03:12.940> to<00:03:13.090> do<00:03:13.350> and<00:03:14.350> then<00:03:14.769> I<00:03:14.799> just

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
very difficult to do and then I just

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.430 
very difficult to do and then I just
shove<00:03:15.790> this<00:03:16.060> corner<00:03:16.450> back<00:03:16.600> in<00:03:16.750> here<00:03:16.959> so<00:03:17.320> the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
shove this corner back in here so the

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.660 
shove this corner back in here so the
super<00:03:17.709> quality<00:03:17.980> on<00:03:18.070> this<00:03:18.160> is<00:03:18.340> pretty<00:03:18.549> good

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
super quality on this is pretty good

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.970 
super quality on this is pretty good
there's<00:03:18.910> no<00:03:19.000> chipping<00:03:19.269> and<00:03:19.660> or<00:03:19.989> peeling<00:03:20.650> and

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
there's no chipping and or peeling and

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.830 
there's no chipping and or peeling and
as<00:03:21.519> it<00:03:21.640> goes<00:03:21.730> either<00:03:21.880> textured<00:03:22.329> stickers<00:03:22.720> will

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
as it goes either textured stickers will

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.300 
as it goes either textured stickers will
try<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.019> show<00:03:23.230> you<00:03:23.320> it<00:03:23.470> on<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.769> reflection

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
try to show you it on the reflection

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.699 
try to show you it on the reflection
might<00:03:25.090> be<00:03:25.209> is<00:03:25.329> your<00:03:25.390> on<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.600> blue<00:03:25.810> so<00:03:26.350> here<00:03:26.530> you

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
might be is your on the blue so here you

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.550 
might be is your on the blue so here you
can<00:03:26.829> see<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.070> sticker<00:03:28.000> detector<00:03:28.510> so<00:03:29.470> the

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
can see the sticker detector so the

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.810 
can see the sticker detector so the
color<00:03:29.739> schemes<00:03:29.980> also<00:03:30.130> a<00:03:30.250> little<00:03:30.430> different<00:03:30.700> to

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
color schemes also a little different to

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.069 
color schemes also a little different to
me<00:03:30.940> it<00:03:31.060> looks<00:03:31.180> like<00:03:31.329> there's<00:03:31.510> a<00:03:31.570> light<00:03:31.840> orange

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
me it looks like there's a light orange

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.560 
me it looks like there's a light orange
and<00:03:32.709> green<00:03:32.950> a<00:03:33.190> darker<00:03:33.700> orange<00:03:34.060> and<00:03:34.299> blue<00:03:34.540> a

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
and green a darker orange and blue a

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.220 
and green a darker orange and blue a
pink<00:03:35.079> and<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.410> yellow<00:03:35.620> so<00:03:36.340> it's<00:03:36.519> a<00:03:36.609> very

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
pink and a yellow so it's a very

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.000 
pink and a yellow so it's a very
different<00:03:38.230> color<00:03:38.410> scheme<00:03:38.620> not<00:03:38.739> even<00:03:38.950> the

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
different color scheme not even the

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.390 
different color scheme not even the
Japanese<00:03:39.160> other<00:03:39.549> schemes<00:03:39.790> so<00:03:39.910> it's<00:03:40.060> different

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
Japanese other schemes so it's different

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.250 
Japanese other schemes so it's different
but<00:03:42.400> nonetheless<00:03:42.609> the<00:03:43.120> stickers<00:03:43.720> are<00:03:43.959> still

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
but nonetheless the stickers are still

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.020 
but nonetheless the stickers are still
holding<00:03:44.500> it<00:03:44.590> very<00:03:44.800> well<00:03:44.980> as<00:03:45.459> you<00:03:45.519> can<00:03:45.700> see<00:03:45.879> on

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
holding it very well as you can see on

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.830 
holding it very well as you can see on
the<00:03:46.150> yellow<00:03:46.360> side

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
the yellow side

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.710 
the yellow side
says<00:03:48.790> meffert's<00:03:50.620> challenge<00:03:51.620> that<00:03:52.580> has<00:03:52.819> L<00:03:53.269> be

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
says meffert's challenge that has L be

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.190 
says meffert's challenge that has L be
lovey<00:03:54.200> I'm<00:03:54.290> not<00:03:54.410> sure<00:03:54.560> what<00:03:54.769> that's<00:03:55.040> from<00:03:56.200> I'm

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
lovey I'm not sure what that's from I'm

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.900 
lovey I'm not sure what that's from I'm
not<00:03:57.379> sure<00:03:57.530> whose<00:03:57.890> logo<00:03:58.340> that<00:03:58.430> is<00:03:58.489> and<00:03:58.730> then<00:03:58.819> it

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
not sure whose logo that is and then it

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.509 
not sure whose logo that is and then it
says<00:03:59.060> of<00:03:59.629> Jenny<00:04:00.620> I'm<00:04:00.920> not<00:04:01.099> really<00:04:01.250> sure<00:04:01.400> you

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
says of Jenny I'm not really sure you

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.220 
says of Jenny I'm not really sure you
pronounce<00:04:01.760> that<00:04:01.879> but<00:04:02.090> I'm<00:04:02.840> guessing<00:04:02.959> that

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
pronounce that but I'm guessing that

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.050 
pronounce that but I'm guessing that
those<00:04:03.560> are<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:03.739> designers<00:04:04.160> meffert's<00:04:04.760> is<00:04:04.940> on

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
those are the designers meffert's is on

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.300 
those are the designers meffert's is on
that<00:04:05.180> mass-produced<00:04:05.690> it<00:04:05.840> and<00:04:06.830> again<00:04:07.129> you<00:04:07.190> can

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
that mass-produced it and again you can

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
exact so science comparison to a

Zanjeer<00:04:14.780> here<00:04:15.530> you<00:04:15.620> can<00:04:15.739> see<00:04:15.860> the<00:04:16.040> size

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
Zanjeer here you can see the size

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.699 
Zanjeer here you can see the size
difference<00:04:16.250> and<00:04:16.790> as<00:04:16.910> he<00:04:17.000> could<00:04:17.120> tell<00:04:17.810> this<00:04:18.560> is

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
difference and as he could tell this is

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.440 
difference and as he could tell this is
actually<00:04:19.010> a<00:04:19.070> pillared<00:04:19.459> puzzle<00:04:20.000> so<00:04:20.150> it<00:04:20.299> would

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
actually a pillared puzzle so it would

actually a pillared puzzle so it would
not<00:04:20.570> be<00:04:20.630> competition<00:04:21.109> illegal<00:04:21.500> so<00:04:22.460> this

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
not be competition illegal so this

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.070

in my collection I absolutely love it
it's<00:04:26.150> just<00:04:26.419> a<00:04:26.570> it's<00:04:26.960> this<00:04:27.200> it's<00:04:27.470> all<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.800> exact

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
it's just a it's this it's all the exact

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.560 
it's just a it's this it's all the exact
same<00:04:28.220> way<00:04:28.370> but<00:04:28.400> just<00:04:28.760> something<00:04:29.120> about<00:04:29.210> it

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
same way but just something about it

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.860 
same way but just something about it
makes<00:04:29.750> it<00:04:29.930> more<00:04:30.050> fun<00:04:30.110> to<00:04:30.440> solve<00:04:30.680> maybe<00:04:31.520> how<00:04:31.970> the

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
makes it more fun to solve maybe how the

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.270 
makes it more fun to solve maybe how the
pieces<00:04:33.080> look<00:04:33.410> so<00:04:33.650> this<00:04:33.770> just<00:04:33.919> looks<00:04:34.130> like<00:04:34.160> a

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
pieces look so this just looks like a

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.550 
pieces look so this just looks like a
really<00:04:34.430> cool<00:04:34.639> design<00:04:35.110> maybe<00:04:36.110> that<00:04:36.229> just<00:04:36.320> makes

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
really cool design maybe that just makes

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.990 
really cool design maybe that just makes
it<00:04:36.680> more<00:04:36.830> fun<00:04:37.130> maybe<00:04:37.340> it<00:04:37.490> just<00:04:37.520> tricks<00:04:37.850> your

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
it more fun maybe it just tricks your

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.420 
it more fun maybe it just tricks your
mind<00:04:38.180> and<00:04:38.450> making<00:04:38.690> it<00:04:38.810> seem<00:04:39.560> more<00:04:39.800> fun<00:04:40.070> even

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
mind and making it seem more fun even

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.620 
mind and making it seem more fun even
though<00:04:40.460> exception<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:41.060> same<00:04:41.270> thing<00:04:41.450> and<00:04:41.539> it

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
though exception the same thing and it

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.330 
though exception the same thing and it
is<00:04:42.050> slower<00:04:42.380> because<00:04:42.560> of<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:42.860> colors<00:04:43.100> can<00:04:43.310> be

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
is slower because of the colors can be

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.100 
is slower because of the colors can be
different<00:04:43.760> and<00:04:43.910> the<00:04:44.419> pieces<00:04:44.720> being<00:04:44.960> little

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
different and the pieces being little

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.870 
different and the pieces being little
bit<00:04:45.200> different<00:04:45.470> but<00:04:46.039> anyways<00:04:46.340> it's<00:04:46.520> Irie

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
bit different but anyways it's Irie

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.400 
bit different but anyways it's Irie
