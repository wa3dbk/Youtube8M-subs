00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.820
 hi the company is the horror of 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.439
 clans france rhÃ´ne alpes and good I you 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.020
 found for this new base of the 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.820
 campaign ultimate weapon passage of hillsides 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.169
 sunny 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.550
 I tell you right away the 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.439
 proposals that I do is for 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.800
 compositions and big scoops 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.419
 everyone does not necessarily have them 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.890
 but in my opinion anyway 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.989
 when you get to the level of 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.140
 this campaign did not want to do 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.360
 the economy of riding your troops before 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.190
 to approach the passage of these bases there 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.100
 on the one hand because you have walls 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.500
 systematically level 12 and then because 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.559
 that French buildings are there 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.000
 very high level so there is no 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.829
 photo there is no ambiguity 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.640
 it really heavy the louvre 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:01.690
 order so look at what I had 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.859
 found in the last video 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.119
 I finally opted for a 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:10.970
 terrestrial composition but still in 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.399
 thus introducing famous invaders 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.610
 which is still the guarantee of having 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.590
 a lull zone to be able to send 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.979
 The troops 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:25.909
 of course the storms are pieces of 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.439
 choice to cash in and make 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.159
 quite significant damage since with them 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:33.920
 the walls level 12 therefore causes a 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.310
 Slowdown of the attacking troops 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.070
 at 80% so that's still some 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.159
 something that is extremely consequential and 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.649
 to consider 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.659
 so I was able to create a breach which 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.210
 allowed so 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.380
 to be able to access the central area and 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.200
 from the moment I was in the 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.619
 central area so using 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.789
 my invaders so here I had 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.109
 kept still in reserve 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:05.090
 that's what ultimately allows close to 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:07.899
 2 to clear the square to go 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.110
 type the Staff and again 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:13.519
 without a house but my heroes on 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.610
 news still pretty high 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.470
 I think I would have been really 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.629
 difficulty to go to type this state 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.959
 major in the center there again these 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.920
 hero who saves me the bet I think that 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.900
 it was still playable but you see 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.120
 that even storms get lost a little bit 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.849
 on them be down the screen 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.470
 so it's really merola who still 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.390
 once made the difference even though there 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.910
 it's the storm that will finish the 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.420
 job 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.790
 so we'll let go on so that's 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.590
 age passes it for more is that 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.970
 it's there at least by typing the staff 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.680
 we get all the resources so 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.799
 that was not bad so I finish with 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.959
 a star and 48 years old by winning five 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.700
 one hundred thousand each is not bad it's 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.060
 like the blow I'm more in 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.069
 campaign of pillage that's good of 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.019
 recover some resources 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.230
 as usual we will see the base 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.430
 next so these bronze birds 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:12.620
 but I wanted to say not confuse 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:14.620
 with I dispense you then the bird 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.180
 of bronze 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.459
 ac it's heavy there too because 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.169
 you see we still find walls 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.880
 very high level and then especially one 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.419
 staff that is extremely complicated 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.419
 to approach 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:28.239
 there by cons I think I 'm not 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:32.030
 do the economy I will spend on 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.549
 aerial composite because and that three 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.620
 years I have two walls almost for 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.329
 can access the staff except there 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.209
 on the sides but in my opinion it's even 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:43.459
 no need to think about it too random 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.049
 so an aerial compo 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.680
 presumably I have besides 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.819
 already launched here is the company I hope 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.269
 that this video 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.260
 if you have not shown how to pass if 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.540
 you do not have his troops there at all 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.010
 case it allows you to advanced with 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.749
 me in this campaign and I tell you to 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.749
 very soon 

00:03:58.749 --> 00:04:01.749
 Hi
