00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
 two 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.460
 hello cupcake ers in this occasion we are going to 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.290
 make some ideal cupcakes for the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.240
 Halloween night they do not look very 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.430
 terrifying but its flavor will leave you 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.599
 without words these are the ingredients 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.250
 we need for the cake and these 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:21.810
 what we need for frosting and 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.690
 for the syrup with these amounts 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.430
 you will get about 14 cupcakes I already have 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.670
 ready the pumpkin puree the sugar 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.279
 brown flour butter butter milk 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.690
 cinnamon ginger egg 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.670
 yeast and the pinch of salt 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.420
 we started mixing the butter with 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.420
 brown sugar 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.880
 Brown sugar retains a lot of moisture 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.470
 that's why the mixture is a bit 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.900
 pasty and stick to the bowl of the blender 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.160
 if this happens to you, take it off with a 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.160
 pastry language and keep beating 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.840
 add the egg and beat until 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.840
 be well mixed 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.010
 while we are going to mix the 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.900
 dry ingredients to flour it 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.970
 we add the yeast 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.350
 ginger 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:16.070
 the cinnamon and the pinch of salt 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.020
 we mix all the ingredients well 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.820
 with the blender at low speed 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.229
 we add a third of the mixture of 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.229
 flour and a third of the milk 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.640
 we keep beating while we add another 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.640
 third of flour and milk 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.380
 finally we add the last third 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.380
 Y 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.180
 once the flour has been well integrated 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.360
 milk the mixture we add the puree 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.010
 pumpkin and mix it at low speed 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.410
 to make the puree we boil the pulp of 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.330
 pumpkin for 15 minutes when it 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.300
 has cooked we drain the pulp well and 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.490
 we crush it with the help of a fork 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.900
 once everything is well incorporated and 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.650
 we have our mix ready to 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.650
 fill the capsules 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.360
 as always we fill them in between 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.360
 half and two thirds of the capsule 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.860
 Once stuffed we take them to the oven 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.650
 once removed the cupcakes from the oven 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.629
 we put the syrup this is my trick 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.560
 infallible so that the cupcakes remain 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.560
 even more juicy 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.049
 so that the capsules do not peel off 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.690
 cupcake the draw from the mold and 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.220
 let stand on a rack while 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.560
 cool the cupcakes we will do the 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.959
 zucchini for decoration we amassed 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.849
 a little orange fondant and when 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.890
 be malleable we separated a little bit to 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.540
 make a ball with the help of a 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.519
 stick we click on the top 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.110
 and under the ball to serve us 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.930
 of guidance when making those lines 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.670
 So characteristic of pumpkins with 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.460
 the same little stick we are marking the 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.380
 lines 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.030
 we started at the point that we clicked 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.190
 at the top of the ball and 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.690
 we end up at the bottom point so we 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.780
 we ensure that the lines do not remain 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.410
 crooked now we will stretch a little 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.410
 green fondant 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.819
 we roll it in a toothpick and we leave it 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.819
 dry until it hardens 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.070
 with another piece of green fondant 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.550
 we will make the stem of our little 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.740
 pumpkin 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.730
 we give it a peak shape and we arrange it 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.730
 how we like it 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.240
 if you have powder coloring you can 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.680
 paint the grooves of pumpkins 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.110
 shake yourself in the brush and paint each 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.030
 one of the slots although this seems 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.980
 a tedious process becomes very fast 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.569
 because they do not have to look perfect and 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.640
 you take very little with each pumpkin 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.299
 to assemble the zucchini we started 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.299
 sticking the stem 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.060
 once the rolls that have been dried 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.129
 we had done before we took them out of the 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.769
 stick and we cut them by adjusting the 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:05.319
 the measure that we need and now we only 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.400
 the roll is stuck in the pumpkin 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.530
 remember that the glue that we should 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.510
 use must be edible too 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.030
 you can paste the fondant with water but 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.070
 It takes a little longer to dry accumulate 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.109
 the roll and ready we have our 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.759
 mini pumpkins for decoration yes 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.370
 you have a little orange fondant and 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:23.930
 green do not hesitate to make them will give you a 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.449
 very funny touch to your cupcakes 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.740
 and they are also made in a plis-plas and as 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.330
 you have seen are not needed 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.220
 complicated tools so no 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.470
 you have an excuse 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.560
 for the frosting we need butter 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:39.320
 sugar icing cheese cream and cinnamon 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.240
 we started taking butter for 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.690
 we beat it at high speed during 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.690
 5 minutes 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:51.910
 when it has already been fluffed and is more 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.139
 blanquita we add the icing sugar 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.370
 we beat 5 more minutes until the 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.510
 butter and sugar are 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.510
 perfectly integrated 

00:05:01.359 --> 00:05:06.919
 we add the cream cheese and the cinnamon one 

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:09.049
 once we add the cheese we beat it a couple 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.639
 of minutes if we beat it too much 

00:05:09.049 --> 00:05:13.099
 time the frosting will start to lose 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.809
 consistency when you make pure teens 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:16.429
 with cream cheese the best thing is that what 

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:18.589
 have in the fridge until the moment of 

00:05:16.429 --> 00:05:19.759
 use it so that it is very cold already 

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:21.709
 that if I batiste the cream cheese 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:23.169
 next room temperature will be 

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:25.270
 watery 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.610
 and so our frosting should not remain 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.889
 cheese and cinnamon fluffy but 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.539
 consistent at the same time for this 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.999
 decoration we prepare the pastry bag 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.409
 with an open star nozzle is 

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:38.260
 the same one that we use to make the 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:42.270
 roses 1m wilton 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.270
 we fill the sleeve with our frosting 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.330
 to remove the air from inside the 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.210
 manga we can help with a scraper 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.440
 or some similar tool if we want 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.570
 that the cross team has more consistency 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.730
 When we use it, we can leave it 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.560
 in the fridge about 10 minutes for 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.060
 decorating our cupcakes we started 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.000
 just like when we make roses with 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.740
 manga we start at the center we make a 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.700
 spiral outwards and we go back to 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.700
 center to make a piquito 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.470
 and finally we put the zucchini 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.270
 what we did previously with this 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.110
 decoration will give a small clue 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.110
 cupcake flavor 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.400
 and take advantage of the pumpkin season 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.230
 to make them go to discover a new 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.600
 texture in your cupcakes that is going to
