00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.679
 to 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:17.950
 very very good to all sandro today 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.849
 I bring a softland game with some 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:25.029
 200 to caritas little archers are 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:28.900
 agremia if it is an armament 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:30.940
 now save me there we are today guys 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.250
 as we have done between the videos already 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.449
 the giants of barbarians are going to continue 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.590
 with this series of attacking and trying 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:39.070
 do it with all the properties that 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.890
 they can be worth and they are simply attacks 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.720
 to show the level of courage of 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.309
 strength they have and the grace of the video 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.130
 ok I know that the vowels are not the 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.120
 maybe the best could attack 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.710
 different ways of doing more 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.480
 score but what I want is always 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.899
 between January if I show you a little what 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.739
 what are the troops worth then 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.739
 here we have a 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.820
 because the defenses are quite low and 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.049
 power attacking with valid archers 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.800
 around and I can get to do 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.870
 something pretty 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.160
 interesting especially because now 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.920
 can you do all this from outside 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.120
 without practically killing me, let's go 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.280
 to leave them like that a little bit 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.900
 perfect perfect perfect let's go 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.750
 putting all the time of the circle up 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:31.230
 100 is worth it because if you're not seeing 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.850
 70% I just do not know how many have died in 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.860
 the law by bombs book why I wanted 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.440
 put all knew that I could pass something 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.700
 seemed and we're going to try to break this 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.700
 tower we call not to touch enough the 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.260
 eggs if it's not worth the whole subject of 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.830
 defenses you have to tighten them as 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.630
 ok let's put them all here to the 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.130
 area below where there's what we 're going 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.690
 to do is that I have to break the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.370
 walls now to be able to enter and steal 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.370
 it's good to kill the troops 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.049
 the interiors such as mortar 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.110
 and all this is going to take a little time 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.450
 increase we do not go wrong when we do vale 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.850
 I'll throw a spell of anger and it 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.259
 let's throw it here let's throw all 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.780
 the archers are worth all the archers 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.980
 are here we are going to have the king and 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.230
 let's see if we can respect now 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.450
 quick the mortar is worth one more 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.420
 one more if it's over 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.920
 we are going to withdraw this here is worth 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.000
 voucher voucher come voucher come voucher 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.370
