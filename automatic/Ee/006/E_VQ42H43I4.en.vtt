with<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.500> Babolat<00:01:10.920> pure<00:01:10.950> Drive<00:01:11.460> which<00:01:11.700> is

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
with the Babolat pure Drive which is

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.609 
with the Babolat pure Drive which is
less<00:01:12.090> headlight<00:01:12.600> than<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.930> AeroPro<00:01:13.350> Drive

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
less headlight than the AeroPro Drive

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.440 
less headlight than the AeroPro Drive
and<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.010> used<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.310> load<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.760> thing<00:01:15.000> down<00:01:15.210> with

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
and I used to load that thing down with

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.270 
and I used to load that thing down with
LED<00:01:15.659> tape<00:01:15.869> on<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> head<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.680> was<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.920> little

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
LED tape on the head so I was a little

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.399 
LED tape on the head so I was a little
concerned<00:01:17.490> about<00:01:17.970> how<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.869> racket<00:01:19.320> would

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
concerned about how this racket would

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.350 
concerned about how this racket would
feel<00:01:19.680> it's<00:01:19.890> seven<00:01:20.490> points<00:01:20.820> headlight<00:01:21.180> which

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
feel it's seven points headlight which

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.289 
feel it's seven points headlight which
is<00:01:21.509> pretty<00:01:22.080> significant<00:01:22.830> but<00:01:23.159> once<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.939> started

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
is pretty significant but once I started

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.780 
is pretty significant but once I started
hitting<00:01:24.570> with<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.110> really<00:01:26.100> liked<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.670> way

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
hitting with it I really liked the way

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.550 
hitting with it I really liked the way
that<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.150> racket<00:01:27.540> felt<00:01:27.750> I'm<00:01:28.049> actually<00:01:28.320> in

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
that this racket felt I'm actually in

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.440 
that this racket felt I'm actually in
the<00:01:28.650> market<00:01:29.009> for<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.220> racket<00:01:29.579> myself<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.270> this

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
the market for a racket myself and this

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.450 
the market for a racket myself and this
I<00:01:30.689> would<00:01:31.049> definitely<00:01:31.229> put<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:31.770> my<00:01:31.950> short<00:01:32.220> list

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
I would definitely put on my short list

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.660 
I would definitely put on my short list
the<00:01:33.090> sweet<00:01:33.659> spot<00:01:33.960> felt<00:01:34.320> huge<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:35.579> was

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the sweet spot felt huge that was

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.429 
the sweet spot felt huge that was
probably<00:01:35.909> in<00:01:36.240> my<00:01:36.360> head<00:01:36.600> but<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:36.990> felt<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.380> I

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
probably in my head but I felt like I

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.319 
probably in my head but I felt like I
couldn't<00:01:37.710> miss<00:01:37.890> with<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.250> racket<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.820> felt

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
couldn't miss with this racket I felt

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.210 
couldn't miss with this racket I felt
like<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.540> had<00:01:39.659> really<00:01:39.930> good<00:01:40.049> power<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.799> was<00:01:40.920> easy

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
like I had really good power it was easy

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.210 
like I had really good power it was easy
to<00:01:41.310> create<00:01:41.579> spin<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.570> would<00:01:43.350> have<00:01:43.500> liked<00:01:43.799> maybe

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
to create spin I would have liked maybe

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.340 
to create spin I would have liked maybe
a<00:01:44.340> little<00:01:44.759> more<00:01:45.060> sturdiness<00:01:45.540> on<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.930> volleys

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
a little more sturdiness on the volleys

a<00:02:19.770> match<00:02:19.950> it's<00:02:20.250> really<00:02:20.520> good<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.730> have<00:02:20.850> a

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
a match it's really good to have a

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.120 
a match it's really good to have a
racket<00:02:21.360> where<00:02:21.510> you're<00:02:21.660> not<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:22.350> know<00:02:22.470> having

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
to shake out your arm after you're

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.780 
to shake out your arm after you're
finished<00:02:24.810> but<00:02:25.290> overall<00:02:25.920> I'd<00:02:26.370> say<00:02:26.400> that

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
finished but overall I'd say that

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.210 
finished but overall I'd say that
Babolat<00:02:27.239> has<00:02:27.660> another<00:02:27.959> winner<00:02:28.650> on<00:02:28.860> its<00:02:29.010> hands

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
Babolat has another winner on its hands

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.040 
Babolat has another winner on its hands
with<00:02:29.489> this<00:02:29.610> racket<00:02:29.880> it's<00:02:30.330> been<00:02:30.540> popular<00:02:31.020> for

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
with this racket it's been popular for

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.540 
with this racket it's been popular for
years<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.709> think<00:02:31.920> it's<00:02:32.040> going<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.220> be<00:02:32.280> popular

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.770 
years I think it's going to be popular
for<00:02:33.030> years<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:33.360> come

for years to come

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.320 
for years to come
and<00:02:34.050> I<00:02:34.170> think<00:02:34.440> that's<00:02:34.620> because<00:02:34.830> of<00:02:35.340> its<00:02:36.060> been

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
and I think that's because of its been

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.150 
and I think that's because of its been
potential<00:02:36.900> because<00:02:37.320> of<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.500> power<00:02:37.739> you<00:02:37.980> can

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
potential because of the power you can

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.850 
potential because of the power you can
create<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.730> because<00:02:39.510> it's<00:02:39.930> really<00:02:40.050> easy<00:02:40.350> on

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
create and because it's really easy on

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.540 
create and because it's really easy on
your<00:02:41.040> arm

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
your arm

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.400 
your arm
