00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.920
 today the week-end at sunset so like 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.830
 usually a fast rate of wadding 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:14.700
 so on the face to see the mobile the the 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:18.150
 marks the reference of the phone and 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:22.859
 some features compared to 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.980
 his little brother him if the wikango in 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.329
 there is not much that changes its 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.329
 just to do so on the right side 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:37.079
 so here is the see and that's one hundred and seven 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.719
 screen resolution levels this is 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.399
 this level barely tonight is the bone 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.940
 front is 2 megapixels back and 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.649
 at the advanced 1.3 megapixel separate there is the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.449
 dual core it's the same except it's 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.309
 clocked at 1 giga 3 and there it is clocked 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:56.250
 at 1 gig there there are 4 gigas of ram 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.289
 ld expandable up to 32 gigas version 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.739
 from android this is the same iliad loose more 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.839
 ok and there is the dual sim the screen of that 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.630
 here is the body it is presented to you 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.390
 just previously it's 3.5 and 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.000
 this one of 4 inches he has a little bit 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.890
 more expensive this one is 49 euros and 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.509
 this one must be around 70 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.000
 years grow up 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.710
 go on we continue for this unpacking on 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.720
 water a very interesting on the side 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:29.759
 left no longer on the bottom either and 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:35.369
 on the back so what we find 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:37.140
 directly the mobile will come back 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.700
 just after it is a white color more 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.229
 exactly like the other that's the 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:52.770
 was then worth what we always find the 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:55.860
 little protection then here is so 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.439
 always all white is not badly done 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.760
 we find exactly the same you have 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.300
 the micro usb 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:09.729
 and the usb 2.0 in white enough cord 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:11.140
 solid white sector charger me I 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.290
 prefer in white tell me what you 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.390
 do you personally think 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.860
 for those who do not care low let not 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:24.540
 of comments it's useless hop the 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.540
 this is simply 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.460
 so as I said I dreamed of 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:39.340
 previous is not terrible terrible 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:44.350
 a game are not even pretty the little 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:46.570
 remote control show the little button a 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.870
 hook off m finally I was going to say 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.410
 pause mans I do not think so but 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:58.140
 it's possible 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:58.140
 micro jack 3.5 so very standard 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:18.459
 then the battery of 1300 million 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:22.330
 mistake ok the little book here is always 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:25.870
 the same you have the card adapters 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:32.320
 sim and followed no more difficult to 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.830
 arrange this we do a quick tour of this 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.690
 phone 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:42.010
 we talked about it then on the side 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:44.530
 right on listening to me so nothing at all 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.260
 so always brilliant that none on 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.060
 the top the on / off button so turn on 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.350
 turn off standby sleepy output 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:56.230
 the jack 3.5 the micro usb 2.0 so 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.209
 always on the top of the phone on the 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.519
 left side you always have the button 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:04.870
 volume more stolen - then we go down 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:09.450
 there is nothing on the bottom you 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:12.280
 the microphone on the back you have a 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.110
 2 megapixel photo sensor with a 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.170
 flash 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.980
 the little if yes so that all brilliant 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.940
 on the back on the front I see no 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.890
 brightness sensor 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.620
 on the other hand, the front photo sensors of 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.960
 1.3 megapixel small china where ricco 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.750
 the buttons they are not in the water s 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.450
 they are directly on the screen so there 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.260
 it's a screen size of 4 inches per 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.260
 report to his little brother 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.940
 after design does not change the buttons 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:46.020
 are placed exactly the same it's 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:48.180
 practically all for beauvais except that 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:54.660
 the ipad 3 5 he had 4 inches a size 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:58.200
 of an attack on it is a little bit 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:03.710
 weird you actually have the coast that 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.710
 get a little bit on the bottom 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:16.110
 for me the back so the hull pretty 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:20.760
 solid so the opportunity to put 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:29.220
 two sim cards and tottenham dig in there 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:32.580

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:36.950
