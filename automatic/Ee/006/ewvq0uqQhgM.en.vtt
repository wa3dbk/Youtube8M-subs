pretty decent for tablet considering

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.810 
pretty decent for tablet considering
that<00:01:23.500> we're<00:01:23.770> running<00:01:23.830> Windows<00:01:24.280> and<00:01:24.550> runs

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
that we're running Windows and runs

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.540 
that we're running Windows and runs
legacy<00:01:25.600> Windows<00:01:25.840> applications<00:01:26.470> I<00:01:26.740> would<00:01:27.370> not

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
legacy Windows applications I would not

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.100 
legacy Windows applications I would not
want<00:01:27.940> a<00:01:29.220> heavy-duty<00:01:30.220> software<00:01:31.090> on<00:01:31.360> it<00:01:31.900> I

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
want a heavy-duty software on it I

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.750 
want a heavy-duty software on it I
wouldn't<00:01:32.530> say<00:01:32.740> it's<00:01:32.950> capable<00:01:33.220> running

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
wouldn't say it's capable running

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.810 
wouldn't say it's capable running
through<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.290> simulation<00:01:35.290> software<00:01:35.890> without

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
through the simulation software without

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.790 
through the simulation software without
issues<00:01:37.390> so<00:01:37.659> that's<00:01:37.870> something<00:01:38.350> that<00:01:38.500> you<00:01:38.650> want

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
issues so that's something that you want

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.000 
issues so that's something that you want
to<00:01:38.920> keep<00:01:39.040> in<00:01:39.190> mind<00:01:39.220> unless<00:01:40.120> the<00:01:40.330> ACA<00:01:40.930> w7<00:01:41.680> tablet

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
comparisons and things like that and

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.629 
comparisons and things like that and
show<00:05:33.960> you<00:05:34.020> how<00:05:34.229> different<00:05:34.770> things<00:05:35.190> work<00:05:35.490> as

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
show you how different things work as

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.899 
show you how different things work as
far<00:05:35.789> as<00:05:35.880> this<00:05:35.969> tablet<00:05:36.389> goes<00:05:36.599> but<00:05:37.909> pretty

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 
far as this tablet goes but pretty

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:41.499 
far as this tablet goes but pretty
decent<00:05:39.360> apples<00:05:39.779> I<00:05:39.930> wouldn't<00:05:40.500> say<00:05:40.710> it's<00:05:40.889> worth

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:41.509 
decent apples I wouldn't say it's worth

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:44.870 
decent apples I wouldn't say it's worth
the<00:05:42.509> money<00:05:42.539> that<00:05:42.840> they're<00:05:43.110> charging<00:05:43.880> in

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
the money that they're charging in

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.249 
the money that they're charging in
comparison<00:05:45.479> to<00:05:45.509> what<00:05:45.719> you<00:05:45.750> give<00:05:45.930> it<00:05:46.050> the<00:05:46.110> other

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:46.259 
comparison to what you give it the other

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:49.339 
comparison to what you give it the other
tablets<00:05:47.060> how<00:05:48.060> it<00:05:48.270> compares<00:05:48.690> with<00:05:48.750> the<00:05:48.870> iPad

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:49.349 
tablets how it compares with the iPad

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.200 
tablets how it compares with the iPad
the<00:05:49.650> iPad<00:05:49.919> cannot<00:05:50.430> run<00:05:50.669> your<00:05:50.699> Windows

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
the iPad cannot run your Windows

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.959 
the iPad cannot run your Windows
applications<00:05:51.870> so<00:05:52.500> if<00:05:52.620> you<00:05:52.740> haven't<00:05:53.130> it<00:05:53.520> must

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:53.969 
applications so if you haven't it must

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:55.820 
applications so if you haven't it must
have<00:05:54.240> application<00:05:54.900> that<00:05:55.139> lets<00:05:55.259> running<00:05:55.710> on

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
have application that lets running on

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.930 
have application that lets running on
Windows<00:05:57.440> then<00:05:58.440> again<00:05:58.740> I<00:05:58.770> wouldn't<00:05:59.190> say<00:05:59.490> and

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
Windows then again I wouldn't say and

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.850 
Windows then again I wouldn't say and
it's<00:06:00.210> not<00:06:00.270> the<00:06:00.509> fastest<00:06:00.900> tablet<00:06:01.259> round<00:06:01.500> so<00:06:01.800> you

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
it's not the fastest tablet round so you

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.700 
it's not the fastest tablet round so you
have<00:06:02.130> to<00:06:02.279> be<00:06:02.400> careful<00:06:02.759> with<00:06:02.880> that<00:06:03.590> what<00:06:04.590> you

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
have to be careful with that what you

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.019 
have to be careful with that what you
want<00:06:04.889> to<00:06:04.979> if<00:06:05.130> you're<00:06:05.279> investing<00:06:05.849> in<00:06:05.940> the

00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:06.029 
want to if you're investing in the

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:08.089 
want to if you're investing in the
