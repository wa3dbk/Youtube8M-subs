00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
you're gonna win by like five seconds

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.590 
you're gonna win by like five seconds
guaranteed<00:04:59.100> but<00:05:00.100> I<00:05:00.370> definitely<00:05:00.880> think<00:05:01.120> it<00:05:01.570> was

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
guaranteed but I definitely think it was

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:10.400 
guaranteed but I definitely think it was
a<00:05:01.720> great<00:05:01.900> experience

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.830 

you<00:05:11.410> does<00:05:11.620> long<00:05:11.889> course<00:05:12.310> feel<00:05:12.669> like<00:05:12.940> uncharted

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
you does long course feel like uncharted

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.780 
you does long course feel like uncharted
territory<00:05:14.590> that<00:05:14.949> you<00:05:15.100> really<00:05:15.400> don't<00:05:15.669> even

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 
territory that you really don't even

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.780 
territory that you really don't even
know<00:05:16.180> what<00:05:16.840> your<00:05:17.139> possible<00:05:17.770> ceiling<00:05:18.280> could<00:05:18.580> be

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
know what your possible ceiling could be

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.680 
know what your possible ceiling could be
yeah<00:05:19.479> I<00:05:20.290> think<00:05:20.650> it's<00:05:20.919> I<00:05:21.190> think<00:05:21.699> I'm<00:05:21.910> beginning

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
yeah I think it's I think I'm beginning

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.260 
yeah I think it's I think I'm beginning
to<00:05:22.930> like<00:05:23.169> long<00:05:23.590> course<00:05:23.919> a<00:05:24.190> lot<00:05:24.460> more<00:05:24.760> than<00:05:25.090> when

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
to like long course a lot more than when

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.219 
to like long course a lot more than when
I<00:05:25.330> was<00:05:25.510> younger<00:05:26.490> but<00:05:27.490> just<00:05:28.360> because<00:05:28.600> like<00:05:29.050> you

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
I was younger but just because like you

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.320 
I was younger but just because like you
said<00:05:29.440> it's<00:05:30.280> not<00:05:30.490> like<00:05:30.610> short<00:05:30.880> course<00:05:31.090> where

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
said it's not like short course where

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.850 
said it's not like short course where
you<00:05:31.389> can<00:05:31.419> kind<00:05:31.750> of<00:05:31.840> tell<00:05:32.110> where<00:05:32.680> you're<00:05:32.800> gonna

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
you can kind of tell where you're gonna

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.150 
you can kind of tell where you're gonna
go<00:05:33.160> cuz<00:05:33.490> you<00:05:33.910> know<00:05:34.030> I<00:05:34.060> don't<00:05:34.419> train<00:05:35.050> in<00:05:35.290> a<00:05:35.380> big

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
go cuz you know I don't train in a big

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.790 
go cuz you know I don't train in a big
pool<00:05:36.400> like<00:05:36.610> this<00:05:36.639> you<00:05:37.000> know<00:05:37.090> six<00:05:37.750> six<00:05:38.590> lanes

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
pool like this you know six six lanes

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.640 
pool like this you know six six lanes
twenty-five<00:05:39.340> yards<00:05:39.520> back<00:05:40.150> at<00:05:40.330> home<00:05:40.530> suburb<00:05:41.530> of

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
twenty-five yards back at home suburb of

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.120 
twenty-five yards back at home suburb of
Philly

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
Philly

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.150 
Philly
so<00:05:42.520> it's<00:05:42.760> nothing<00:05:43.120> like<00:05:43.240> this<00:05:43.889> but<00:05:44.889> yeah<00:05:45.130> I

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
so it's nothing like this but yeah I

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.450 
so it's nothing like this but yeah I
think<00:05:45.450> that<00:05:46.590> long<00:05:47.590> course<00:05:47.830> is<00:05:47.979> definitely

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
think that long course is definitely

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.150 
think that long course is definitely
kind<00:05:49.120> of<00:05:49.210> hard<00:05:49.419> to<00:05:49.540> get<00:05:49.690> used<00:05:49.930> to<00:05:50.200> but<00:05:51.100> I

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
kind of hard to get used to but I

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.680 
kind of hard to get used to but I
definitely<00:05:51.400> look<00:05:51.729> forward<00:05:51.760> to<00:05:52.240> the<00:05:52.330> future

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
definitely look forward to the future

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.919 
definitely look forward to the future
and<00:05:52.930> what<00:05:53.320> it<00:05:53.500> hasn't<00:05:53.770> slowed
