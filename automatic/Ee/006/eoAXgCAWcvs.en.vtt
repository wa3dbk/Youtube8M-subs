00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.089 
it's double stitched here where it's put

it's pretty sturdy right there um got a

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.020 
it's pretty sturdy right there um got a
nice<00:00:33.510> little<00:00:33.809> belt<00:00:33.989> loop<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.640> don't<00:00:35.640> really

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
know how sturdy this belt loop is would

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.530 
know how sturdy this belt loop is would
be<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.219> doesn't<00:00:38.670> seem<00:00:38.879> like<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.270> would<00:00:39.329> be<00:00:39.390> all

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540

be it doesn't seem like it would be all
that<00:00:39.570> sturdy<00:00:40.110> but<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.620> guess<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.670> was<00:00:41.790> serve<00:00:41.969> a

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
that sturdy but I guess it was serve a

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.209 
that sturdy but I guess it was serve a
purpose

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
purpose

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:48.529 
purpose

type<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.559> blade<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:50.219> know<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.430> steel<00:00:50.700> they

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
type of blade you know the steel they

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.840 
type of blade you know the steel they
use<00:00:51.180> on<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.420> blade<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:52.190> has<00:00:53.190> on<00:00:53.489> here<00:00:53.730> 10<00:00:54.260> C<00:00:55.850> r17

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
use on the blade it has on here 10 C r17

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.479 
use on the blade it has on here 10 C r17
now<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.809> don't<00:00:57.930> know<00:00:58.140> if<00:00:58.410> I'm<00:00:59.010> pretty<00:00:59.219> sure

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
now I don't know if I'm pretty sure

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.959 
now I don't know if I'm pretty sure
that's<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.140> blade<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.350> type<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.590> Steel<00:01:01.969> but

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
that's the blade the type of Steel but

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.549 
that's the blade the type of Steel but
it<00:01:03.270> could<00:01:03.600> be<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.870> model<00:01:04.170> number<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
it could be the model number of the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.200 
it could be the model number of the
knife<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.159> think<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.790> think<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.090> is

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
knife but I think it is I think it is

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.270 
knife but I think it is I think it is
just<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.659> model<00:01:07.530> still<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.010> uses<00:01:09.979> it's<00:01:10.979> got<00:01:11.250> a

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
just the model still it uses it's got a

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.370 
just the model still it uses it's got a
pretty<00:01:11.640> thick<00:01:11.760> blade<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.630> I'm<00:01:12.869> not<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.229> have

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
pretty thick blade on it I'm not to have

pretty thick blade on it I'm not to have
it<00:01:13.500> measured<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:14.070> but<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.180> it's<00:01:15.540> pretty

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
feel comfortable seems like it would

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.310 
feel comfortable seems like it would
take<00:01:40.079> up<00:01:40.229> some<00:01:40.500> abuse<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.700> handle<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.899> it's

a<00:01:43.380> pretty<00:01:43.530> hard<00:01:43.770> handle<00:01:44.329> I'm<00:01:45.329> not<00:01:45.509> exactly

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
a pretty hard handle I'm not exactly

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.219 
a pretty hard handle I'm not exactly
sure<00:01:45.990> what<00:01:46.350> type<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:46.950> material<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:49.310> but

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
sure what type of material that is but

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.420 
sure what type of material that is but
it's<00:01:52.229> like<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.500> was<00:01:52.619> standing<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.159> some

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
it's like it was standing up to some

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.200 
it's like it was standing up to some
abuse<00:01:54.500> but<00:01:55.500> overall<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.100> knife<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.640> like<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.119> a

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
abuse but overall the knife I like it a

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.780 
abuse but overall the knife I like it a
lot<00:01:57.390> it's<00:01:58.049> real<00:01:58.259> comfortable<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.579> good

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
lot it's real comfortable it's a good

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.080 
lot it's real comfortable it's a good
looking<00:02:00.030> knife

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.539 

I<00:02:03.119> like<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.720> thinks<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.560> big<00:02:05.310> blade

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
I like it thinks that the big blade

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.120 
I like it thinks that the big blade
start<00:02:05.909> right<00:02:06.090> there<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.479> was<00:02:07.470> a<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.829> was<00:02:07.979> what

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
start right there I was a that was what

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.400 
start right there I was a that was what
got<00:02:08.310> me<00:02:08.489> on<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.700> night<00:02:08.880> because<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.360> think<00:02:10.319> it

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
got me on the night because I think it

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.600 
got me on the night because I think it
looks<00:02:10.590> cool<00:02:10.770> for<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.069> knife<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.370> have<00:02:11.459> that

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
looks cool for a knife to have that

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.979 
looks cool for a knife to have that
tickler<00:02:12.000> stock<00:02:15.500> it<00:02:16.500> looks<00:02:16.680> mean

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
tickler stock it looks mean

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.030 
tickler stock it looks mean
but<00:02:18.989> that's<00:02:19.140> pretty<00:02:19.319> much<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.739> about<00:02:19.769> the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
but that's pretty much it about the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.199 
but that's pretty much it about the
knife<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:21.380> got<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.530> little<00:02:22.739> lanyard<00:02:22.980> there<00:02:23.310> that

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
knife I got a little lanyard there that

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.900 
knife I got a little lanyard there that
did<00:02:24.360> not<00:02:24.480> come<00:02:24.690> with<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.900> knife<00:02:25.080> I<00:02:25.290> made<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:25.910> I

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
did not come with a knife I made that I

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.259 
did not come with a knife I made that I
like<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.390> put<00:02:27.540> these<00:02:27.660> on<00:02:27.840> all<00:02:27.959> my<00:02:28.050> fixed<00:02:28.380> blades

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
like to put these on all my fixed blades

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.180 
like to put these on all my fixed blades
