00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.120 
because you know what to expect so they
can<00:01:30.780> go<00:01:30.900> out<00:01:30.930> there<00:01:31.229> like<00:01:31.380> every<00:01:31.590> friday<00:01:31.770> i

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
can go out there like every friday i

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.740 
can go out there like every friday i
mean<00:01:32.280> you're<00:01:32.400> used<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.670> like<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.970> nerves<00:01:33.540> and

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
mean you're used to like the nerves and

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.359 
mean you're used to like the nerves and
you<00:01:33.869> have<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.110> get<00:01:34.200> past<00:01:34.409> them<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:35.040> guess

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
you have to get past them and I guess

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.920 
you have to get past them and I guess
you're<00:01:35.880> more<00:01:36.030> used<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.270> assure<00:01:36.479> not<00:01:36.750> as

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
you're more used to assure not as

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.560 
you're more used to assure not as
nervous<00:01:37.259> but<00:01:37.710> it's<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.400> nice<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.610> have<00:01:39.420> that

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
nervous but it's just nice to have that

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.990 
nervous but it's just nice to have that
fuel<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:40.100> think<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> first<00:01:41.400> three<00:01:41.640> games<00:01:41.790> are

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
fuel I think the first three games are

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.190 
fuel I think the first three games are
the<00:01:42.060> way<00:01:42.150> we<00:01:42.299> want<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.540> start<00:01:42.810> with<00:01:42.869> playing

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
the way we want to start with playing

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.710 
the way we want to start with playing
against<00:01:43.530> three<00:01:43.979> good<00:01:44.159> teams<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:45.600> know

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
against three good teams and you know

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.999 
against three good teams and you know
win<00:01:45.960> or<00:01:46.110> lose<00:01:46.290> we're<00:01:46.530> going<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.710> be<00:01:46.829> better

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
win or lose we're going to be better

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.830 
win or lose we're going to be better
after<00:01:47.250> we<00:01:47.430> get<00:01:47.549> done<00:01:47.610> playing<00:01:47.880> them<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.390> idle

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
after we get done playing them and idle

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.010 
after we get done playing them and idle

get us prepared for the league game if

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.499 
get us prepared for the league game if
there's<00:01:52.320> any<00:01:52.500> concern<00:01:52.799> for<00:01:53.040> Beck<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
there's any concern for Beck it's the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.719 
there's any concern for Beck it's the
depth<00:01:54.810> behind<00:01:55.320> some<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.890> his<00:01:56.040> skilled<00:01:56.340> players

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
depth behind some of his skilled players

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.670 
depth behind some of his skilled players
you<00:01:57.420> know<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.570> don't<00:01:57.750> like<00:01:57.990> there<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.649> a

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
you know I don't like there is a

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.800 
you know I don't like there is a
difference<00:01:59.130> between<00:01:59.189> one<00:01:59.759> and<00:01:59.790> two<00:02:00.060> we<00:02:00.570> want

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
difference between one and two we want

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.249 
difference between one and two we want
to<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.140> push<00:02:01.350> one<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.390> we<00:02:03.390> want<00:02:03.630> if<00:02:03.930> one

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
to to push one and and we want if one

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.020 
to to push one and and we want if one
goes<00:02:04.469> down<00:02:04.530> we<00:02:04.950> need<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.159> come<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:05.670> we<00:02:05.700> can't

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
goes down we need to come in we can't

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.089 
goes down we need to come in we can't
lose<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.180> step<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.689> at<00:02:07.200> some<00:02:07.439> positions<00:02:07.950> I

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
lose a step and at some positions I

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.219 
lose a step and at some positions I
think<00:02:08.340> we<00:02:08.459> would<00:02:08.670> lose<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:09.330> step<00:02:09.959> in<00:02:10.200> that

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
think we would lose a step in that

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.440 
think we would lose a step in that
situation<00:02:11.120> but<00:02:12.120> we're<00:02:12.629> trying<00:02:12.930> to

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450

get them as much beer as experienced as

possible and we'll do that early in the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.140 
possible and we'll do that early in the
