00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:11.400
 So put on the market a lot while recent sports is said that era became much less 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.230
 You have 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.529
 Themes are all very sophisticated 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:22.410
 It the car is gone matching protagonist Gardens 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:26.220
 Driver's voice of feeling gets thinner and thinner 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:31.710
 I think that's the current trend of sports cars 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.829
 I want to say this most if it is a real sports car because the driver is shining 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.650
 is not it 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:39.280
 The driver is enough to control it 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.910
 The driver is the protagonist 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.960
 The feeling of the driver 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.280
 I supported you to give a lecture properly , but it is such a real sports car 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.510
 I think so 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:56.380
 It is 86 of cat 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:01:01.950
 So what do you say that the engine is the hi-tech? 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:03.150
 Such as controlling the movement performance of the night car other than that 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.240
 It seems that the data is Lou 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.620
 Let's make fun jokes contents 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.080
 That visual 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.120
 Aspiring undergraduate 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.050
 It is transmitted from the very ground 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:19.960
 Driver of various Korean Japan 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:22.570
 Car of such thought to tell directly as much as possible 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.330
 Go more entered 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.580
 Let's reduce it as much as possible 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:33.060
 Well like going against the current flow 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:35.780
 I made such a motto as back to the basic 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.120
 That kind of computer 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.780
 Mount 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.580
 Use it or the money to its it 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.720
 For example, if you have the right in design 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.690
 I think that trying to avoid even the car of the senior statesmen of which day 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.360
 Use for slightly bending the body rigidity of the car 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:56.730
 Try to lighten even a little 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:02.020
 That's exactly where it's going to be the second car in the car 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:05.670
 I worked on the joblessly and raised the performance little by little 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:09.100
 That's why I think you'll probably drive 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.430
 It feels totally different from the current car 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:16.810
 Just this unknown Toka view this kind of high 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:21.780
 It is such a feeling that we can talk while driving that can talk 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.780
 There is such a thought jumped kana get to taste
