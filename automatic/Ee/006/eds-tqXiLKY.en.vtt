here's<00:00:02.129> a<00:00:02.220> look<00:00:02.370> at<00:00:02.550> google<00:00:03.330> android<00:00:03.750> 1.6<00:00:04.350> for

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
here's a look at google android 1.6 for

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.140 
here's a look at google android 1.6 for
the<00:00:05.250> creatives<00:00:05.730> egg<00:00:06.000> this<00:00:06.600> is<00:00:06.779> their<00:00:06.990> first

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:08.150 
the creatives egg this is their first

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.100 
the creatives egg this is their first
initial<00:00:09.150> version<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.290> android<00:00:11.040> for<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.460> z<00:00:11.639> egg

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
initial version of android for the z egg

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.169 
initial version of android for the z egg
so<00:00:13.110> it<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.320> still<00:00:13.710> is<00:00:13.889> extremely<00:00:14.639> rough<00:00:14.910> and

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
so it is still is extremely rough and

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.340 
so it is still is extremely rough and
more<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:16.010> proof<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.130> concept<00:00:17.310> than<00:00:17.880> anything

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
more of a proof of concept than anything

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.679 
more of a proof of concept than anything
although<00:00:19.520> many<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.760> functions<00:00:20.910> still<00:00:21.510> are

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
although many of the functions still are

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.040 
although many of the functions still are
are<00:00:22.260> up<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.340> running<00:00:23.460> but<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.539> can<00:00:24.660> see<00:00:24.840> of

are up and running but you can see of

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.769 
are up and running but you can see of
your<00:00:25.199> basic<00:00:25.619> android<00:00:25.949> elements<00:00:26.609> such<00:00:27.449> as<00:00:27.480> your

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
your basic android elements such as your

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.889 
your basic android elements such as your

amp bar there your notifications up top

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.680 
amp bar there your notifications up top
and<00:00:33.899> then<00:00:34.440> your<00:00:34.620> three<00:00:35.329> side<00:00:36.329> screens<00:00:36.809> there

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
and then your three side screens there

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.810 
and then your three side screens there
now<00:00:40.489> jump<00:00:41.489> into<00:00:42.980> you<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.070> your<00:00:44.219> basic<00:00:44.370> photo

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
gallery typical to that android and it

00:00:51.660 --> 00:01:00.400 
gallery typical to that android and it
is<00:00:54.140> responding<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.410> accelerometer<00:00:56.219> okay

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.080 

they<00:01:01.410> map<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.920> back<00:01:02.129> button<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.699> camera

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
they map the back button to the camera

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.250 
they map the back button to the camera
button<00:01:03.329> i<00:01:03.570> don't<00:01:03.750> know<00:01:03.809> if<00:01:03.870> that's<00:01:03.960> going<00:01:04.170> to

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
button i don't know if that's going to

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.070 
button i don't know if that's going to
change<00:01:04.500> what<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.010> little<00:01:05.220> bit<00:01:05.400> awkward

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
change what it is a little bit awkward

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.880 
change what it is a little bit awkward
and<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.290> menu<00:01:07.619> button<00:01:07.830> brings<00:01:08.130> up<00:01:08.240> settings

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890

install and App Store so applications

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.140 
install and App Store so applications
can<00:01:34.700> be<00:01:34.730> installed<00:01:35.410> and<00:01:36.850> from<00:01:37.850> a<00:01:37.880> few

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.340 

browser<00:01:52.600> browser<00:01:53.600> seems<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.110> be<00:01:54.200> working

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
browser browser seems to be working

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.969 
browser browser seems to be working
pretty<00:01:54.620> well<00:01:55.540> and<00:01:56.540> now<00:01:56.660> because<00:01:57.020> this<00:01:57.170> is<00:01:57.229> 1.6

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
pretty well and now because this is 1.6

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.270 
pretty well and now because this is 1.6
you<00:01:58.130> don't<00:01:58.430> have<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:59.500> multi-touch<00:02:00.500> yet<00:02:00.860> so

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
you don't have the multi-touch yet so

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.219 
you don't have the multi-touch yet so
don't<00:02:01.580> expect<00:02:01.729> multi-touch<00:02:02.420> on<00:02:02.660> this<00:02:02.840> until

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
don't expect multi-touch on this until

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:22.030 
don't expect multi-touch on this until
two<00:02:03.979> point<00:02:04.250> oh<00:02:04.370> so<00:02:05.680> you<00:02:06.680> do<00:02:06.920> have<00:02:07.220> these

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.610 

and<00:02:23.040> as<00:02:23.450> it's<00:02:24.450> starting<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.840> slow<00:02:25.050> down<00:02:25.080> I

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
and as it's starting to slow down I

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.730 
and as it's starting to slow down I
notice<00:02:26.310> as<00:02:26.490> you<00:02:26.820> use<00:02:27.240> it<00:02:27.480> in<00:02:28.020> this<00:02:28.230> version<00:02:28.440> of

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
notice as you use it in this version of

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:35.000 
notice as you use it in this version of
firmware<00:02:28.890> it<00:02:29.280> starts<00:02:29.670> really<00:02:29.850> starts<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:34.010> slow

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
firmware it starts really starts to slow

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:55.370 
firmware it starts really starts to slow
down<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.120> still<00:02:36.690> very<00:02:36.840> buggy

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.930 

see<00:02:56.660> okay<00:02:57.660> so<00:02:57.720> here<00:02:58.290> is<00:02:58.500> it's<00:02:59.370> also<00:02:59.490> Twitter

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
see okay so here is it's also Twitter

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.000 
see okay so here is it's also Twitter
client<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:00.390> was<00:03:00.540> able<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.810> install<00:03:01.230> through

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
that and app store and it seems to all

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.520 
that and app store and it seems to all
the<00:03:09.090> application<00:03:09.600> seems<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:09.900> seem<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:10.470> be

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
the application seems you seem to be

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.780 
the application seems you seem to be
running<00:03:10.830> pretty<00:03:11.220> nice<00:03:13.400> haven't<00:03:14.400> had<00:03:14.550> too<00:03:14.700> many

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
running pretty nice haven't had too many

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.200 
running pretty nice haven't had too many
problems<00:03:14.910> but<00:03:16.190> overall<00:03:17.190> it's<00:03:17.400> not<00:03:17.460> really

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
problems but overall it's not really

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.150 
problems but overall it's not really
something<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:18.780> want<00:03:19.050> to<00:03:19.140> use<00:03:19.410> still

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
something you want to use still

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.340 
something you want to use still
developer<00:03:21.030> edition<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:23.930> pretty<00:03:24.930> much<00:03:25.020> just<00:03:25.200> a

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
developer edition and pretty much just a

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.560 
developer edition and pretty much just a
proof<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:25.620> concept<00:03:25.800> so<00:03:26.730> definitely<00:03:27.150> looking

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
proof of concept so definitely looking

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.380 
proof of concept so definitely looking
forward<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:28.200> 2.0<00:03:29.070> and<00:03:29.400> more<00:03:29.730> targeted
