00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
it that's kind of neat the big old

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.230 
it that's kind of neat the big old
exhaust<00:01:28.200> pipes<00:01:28.829> coming<00:01:29.220> out<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.670> back<00:01:29.850> looks

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
exhaust pipes coming out the back looks

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.640 
exhaust pipes coming out the back looks
like<00:01:30.329> it's<00:01:30.479> even<00:01:30.720> got<00:01:30.840> taillights<00:01:31.439> which

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
like it's even got taillights which

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.560 
like it's even got taillights which
doesn't<00:01:31.920> make<00:01:32.009> any<00:01:32.189> sense<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:33.150> course<00:01:33.360> it's<00:01:33.479> on

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
doesn't make any sense of course it's on

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.780 
doesn't make any sense of course it's on
wheels<00:01:33.840> too<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.560> maybe<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.400> does<00:01:35.579> make<00:01:35.759> a

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
wheels too so maybe it does make a

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.910 
wheels too so maybe it does make a
little<00:01:36.030> bit<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.360> sense<00:01:36.570> does<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.409> wheel<00:01:37.560> spin

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
little bit of sense does the wheel spin

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.760 
little bit of sense does the wheel spin
