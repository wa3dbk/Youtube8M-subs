00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
know there were moments where you really

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.710 
know there were moments where you really
doubted<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.760> last<00:03:08.940> couple<00:03:09.269> years<00:03:09.299> that<00:03:09.600> this

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
doubted the last couple years that this

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.000 
doubted the last couple years that this
would<00:03:09.780> actually<00:03:10.200> happen<00:03:10.350> how<00:03:10.560> much<00:03:10.739> did<00:03:10.920> your

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
definitely I think there's times when I

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.550 
definitely I think there's times when I
thought<00:03:15.000> of<00:03:15.060> quitting<00:03:15.570> times<00:03:15.959> when<00:03:16.320> I<00:03:16.350> thought

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
thought of quitting times when I thought

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.620 
thought of quitting times when I thought
of<00:03:16.620> just<00:03:16.799> hanging<00:03:17.340> it<00:03:17.519> up<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:17.940> doing

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
of just hanging it up and doing

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.630 
of just hanging it up and doing
something<00:03:18.900> else<00:03:19.230> or<00:03:19.590> taking<00:03:20.070> a<00:03:20.280> break<00:03:20.459> from

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
something else or taking a break from

watching<00:04:08.240> close<00:04:08.480> by<00:04:08.720> with<00:04:09.050> all<00:04:09.170> the<00:04:09.260> hard<00:04:09.470> work

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
watching close by with all the hard work

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.320

and the sacrifices that he made well I

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.970 
and the sacrifices that he made well I
guess<00:04:14.330> there's<00:04:14.600> a<00:04:14.810> little<00:04:15.680> bit<00:04:15.890> of

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
guess there's a little bit of

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.120 
guess there's a little bit of
misconception<00:04:16.700> is<00:04:16.820> that<00:04:17.950> he<00:04:18.950> didn't

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
misconception is that he didn't

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.340 
misconception is that he didn't
necessarily<00:04:19.190> like<00:04:20.120> try<00:04:20.690> to<00:04:20.720> teach<00:04:21.019> us<00:04:21.200> or

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
necessarily like try to teach us or

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.150 
necessarily like try to teach us or
drill<00:04:21.590> us<00:04:22.090> because<00:04:23.090> he<00:04:23.780> never<00:04:24.620> had<00:04:24.770> like

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
drill us because he never had like

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.310 
drill us because he never had like
coaching<00:04:25.940> himself<00:04:26.300> but<00:04:26.540> the<00:04:26.750> one<00:04:26.960> thing<00:04:27.170> that

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
coaching himself but the one thing that

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.840 
coaching himself but the one thing that
he<00:04:27.410> always<00:04:27.620> did<00:04:27.950> was<00:04:28.160> he<00:04:28.310> would<00:04:28.430> take<00:04:28.580> us<00:04:28.730> to

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
he always did was he would take us to

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.150 
he always did was he would take us to
play<00:04:29.090> and<00:04:29.330> so<00:04:30.050> we<00:04:30.200> would<00:04:30.320> always<00:04:30.530> play<00:04:30.860> and

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
play and so we would always play and

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.340 
play and so we would always play and
then<00:04:31.250> we<00:04:31.430> ran<00:04:31.850> into<00:04:32.060> coaches<00:04:32.630> that<00:04:32.900> really

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
then we ran into coaches that really

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.900 
then we ran into coaches that really
developed<00:04:33.920> us<00:04:34.070> and<00:04:34.340> taught<00:04:34.490> us<00:04:34.700> the

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
developed us and taught us the

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.560 
developed us and taught us the
fundamentals<00:04:34.940> and<00:04:36.010> when<00:04:37.010> we<00:04:37.160> ended<00:04:37.310> up

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
fundamentals and when we ended up

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.460 
fundamentals and when we ended up
playing<00:04:38.570> with<00:04:38.780> my<00:04:38.930> dad

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
playing with my dad

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.390 
playing with my dad
we<00:04:40.190> would<00:04:40.310> play<00:04:40.720> every<00:04:41.720> day<00:04:41.900> and<00:04:42.310> you<00:04:43.310> know

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
that's that's he he wasn't trying to

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.760 
that's that's he he wasn't trying to

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
those family moments where we're all

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.420 
those family moments where we're all
just<00:05:02.900> playing<00:05:03.080> who<00:05:03.230> what's<00:05:04.130> his<00:05:04.250> reaction
