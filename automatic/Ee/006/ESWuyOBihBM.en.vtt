well<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.810> will<00:01:13.870> it<00:01:14.380> doesn't<00:01:14.800> yet<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.790> does<00:01:22.090> it

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
well it will it doesn't yet and does it

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.240 
well it will it doesn't yet and does it
use<00:01:22.360> a<00:01:22.390> capacity<00:01:22.960> well<00:01:23.230> look<00:01:23.410> at<00:01:23.530> that<00:01:23.680> nvidia

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
use a capacity well look at that nvidia

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.140 
use a capacity well look at that nvidia
tegra<00:01:24.780> that's<00:01:25.780> exactly<00:01:26.410> what's<00:01:26.650> in<00:01:26.800> it<00:01:27.150> this

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
tegra that's exactly what's in it this

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.090 
tegra that's exactly what's in it this
is<00:01:28.330> a<00:01:28.360> resistive<00:01:28.840> so<00:01:29.110> it's<00:01:29.320> up<00:01:29.440> to<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:29.710> carrier

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
is a resistive so it's up to the carrier

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.310 
is a resistive so it's up to the carrier
so<00:01:30.640> if<00:01:31.090> they<00:01:31.450> want<00:01:31.720> to<00:01:31.780> release<00:01:32.020> it<00:01:32.200> with

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
so if they want to release it with

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.690 
so if they want to release it with
capacitive<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.880> it<00:01:34.180> can<00:01:34.360> have<00:01:34.480> capacitive

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
capacitive that it can have capacitive

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.610 
capacitive that it can have capacitive
but<00:01:36.700> it's<00:01:37.000> very<00:01:37.180> fast<00:01:37.600> as<00:01:37.870> you<00:01:37.990> can<00:01:38.140> see<00:01:38.380> right

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
but it's very fast as you can see right

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.550 
but it's very fast as you can see right
very<00:01:39.610> responsive<00:01:40.240> yeah<00:01:40.570> and<00:01:40.840> does<00:01:41.260> it<00:01:41.290> have

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
very responsive yeah and does it have

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.260 
very responsive yeah and does it have
multitouch<00:01:43.080> no<00:01:44.080> this<00:01:44.320> is<00:01:44.470> just<00:01:44.500> resistive<00:01:45.270> not

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
multitouch no this is just resistive not

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.420 
multitouch no this is just resistive not
multi-touch<00:01:48.300> but<00:01:49.300> it<00:01:49.570> can<00:01:50.110> have<00:01:50.380> that<00:01:50.620> it

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
multi-touch but it can have that it

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.080 
multi-touch but it can have that it
depend<00:01:51.760> just<00:01:52.090> depends<00:01:52.540> on<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.720> carrier<00:01:53.110> I

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
depend just depends on the carrier I

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.640 
depend just depends on the carrier I
don't<00:01:55.090> have<00:01:55.420> any<00:01:55.570> video<00:01:55.870> on<00:01:55.960> here<00:01:56.290> to<00:01:56.410> show<00:01:56.590> you

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
don't have any video on here to show you

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.180 
don't have any video on here to show you
so<00:01:57.130> you<00:01:58.200> can't<00:01:59.200> make<00:01:59.320> a<00:01:59.350> phone<00:01:59.620> call<00:01:59.800> from<00:02:00.010> this

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
so you can't make a phone call from this

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.910 
so you can't make a phone call from this
chain<00:02:00.430> you<00:02:01.240> will<00:02:01.270> be<00:02:01.570> able<00:02:01.630> to<00:02:01.840> yeah<00:02:02.020> yeah<00:02:02.710> it

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
chain you will be able to yeah yeah it

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.290 
chain you will be able to yeah yeah it
does<00:02:03.250> everything<00:02:03.520> that<00:02:03.700> phone<00:02:03.940> can<00:02:04.150> do

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
does everything that phone can do

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
what the batteries raise that I don't

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.570 
what the batteries raise that I don't
actually<00:02:34.410> I'm<00:02:35.410> I'm<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.190> creative<00:02:36.489> director

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
actually I'm I'm the creative director

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.699 
actually I'm I'm the creative director
so<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:38.290> technical<00:02:38.800> questions<00:02:39.220> i<00:02:40.530> leave<00:02:41.530> to

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
so the technical questions i leave to

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.490 
so the technical questions i leave to
somebody<00:02:42.270> are<00:02:43.270> these<00:02:43.480> apps<00:02:43.780> here<00:02:44.260> we're

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
somebody are these apps here we're

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.190 
somebody are these apps here we're
looking<00:02:44.530> at<00:02:44.890> all<00:02:45.070> or<00:02:45.220> no<00:02:45.489> these<00:02:45.760> are<00:02:46.050> this<00:02:47.050> is

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
looking at all or no these are this is

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.199 
looking at all or no these are this is
just<00:02:47.350> a<00:02:47.560> branded<00:02:48.100> configuration<00:02:49.060> because

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
just a branded configuration because

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.670
