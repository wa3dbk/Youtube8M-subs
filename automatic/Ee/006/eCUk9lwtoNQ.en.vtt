really durable and really affordable I

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.420 
really durable and really affordable I
like<00:00:32.870> this<00:00:33.079> one<00:00:33.230> a<00:00:33.290> lot<00:00:33.530> I<00:00:33.680> happen<00:00:34.040> to<00:00:34.070> purchase

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
like this one a lot I happen to purchase

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.220 
like this one a lot I happen to purchase
it<00:00:34.820> it

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
it it

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.560 
it it
daniel<00:00:36.230> Smith<00:00:36.649> store<00:00:37.100> in<00:00:37.399> Seattle<00:00:38.090> they<00:00:38.420> have

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
daniel Smith store in Seattle they have

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.630 
daniel Smith store in Seattle they have
a<00:00:38.600> bunch<00:00:38.840> of<00:00:39.019> them<00:00:39.170> there<00:00:39.379> but<00:00:40.190> a<00:00:40.250> lot<00:00:40.609> of

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
a bunch of them there but a lot of

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.060 
a bunch of them there but a lot of
stores<00:00:41.180> carry<00:00:41.570> them<00:00:41.809> so<00:00:42.140> I<00:00:42.410> think<00:00:42.620> you<00:00:42.890> could

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
stores carry them so I think you could

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.069 
stores carry them so I think you could
just<00:00:43.100> ask<00:00:43.460> around<00:00:43.910> or<00:00:44.179> do<00:00:44.539> an<00:00:44.660> internet<00:00:45.019> search

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
just ask around or do an internet search

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.860 
just ask around or do an internet search
so<00:00:45.710> I<00:00:45.980> like<00:00:46.219> it<00:00:46.250> because<00:00:46.519> it's<00:00:46.910> clear<00:00:47.269> but<00:00:47.690> it's

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
so I like it because it's clear but it's

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.970 
so I like it because it's clear but it's
made<00:00:48.140> of<00:00:48.289> this<00:00:48.440> heavy<00:00:48.710> reinforced<00:00:50.739> plastic<00:00:51.739> so

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
made of this heavy reinforced plastic so

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.200 
made of this heavy reinforced plastic so
there's<00:00:52.160> something<00:00:52.339> woven<00:00:52.910> in<00:00:53.059> there<00:00:53.320> and

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
there's something woven in there and

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.130 
there's something woven in there and
inside<00:00:56.210> I<00:00:57.129> have<00:00:58.129> I<00:00:58.519> forgot<00:00:59.300> what<00:00:59.420> this<00:00:59.570> case<00:00:59.929> is

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
inside I have I forgot what this case is

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.770 
inside I have I forgot what this case is
called<00:01:00.410> this<00:01:00.829> is<00:01:01.039> a<00:01:01.070> Windsor<00:01:01.519> Newton<00:01:01.730> box<00:01:02.089> and

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
called this is a Windsor Newton box and

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.800 
called this is a Windsor Newton box and
I<00:01:03.379> liked<00:01:03.769> it<00:01:04.070> better<00:01:04.519> than<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:05.030> Bijou<00:01:05.360> box

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
I liked it better than the Bijou box

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.390 
I liked it better than the Bijou box
that<00:01:06.320> I<00:01:06.350> sometimes<00:01:06.650> carry<00:01:07.070> which<00:01:07.220> it's

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
that I sometimes carry which it's

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.000 
that I sometimes carry which it's
smaller<00:01:07.700> because<00:01:08.000> it<00:01:08.300> carries<00:01:08.690> a<00:01:08.960> few<00:01:09.860> more

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
smaller because it carries a few more

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.810 
smaller because it carries a few more
colors<00:01:10.490> and<00:01:10.910> you<00:01:11.090> can<00:01:12.400> purchase<00:01:13.400> these

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
colors and you can purchase these

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.850 
colors and you can purchase these
separately<00:01:14.360> and<00:01:14.810> then<00:01:14.960> put<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.290> colors<00:01:15.620> that

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
separately and then put the colors that

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.100 
separately and then put the colors that
you<00:01:15.950> used<00:01:16.250> most<00:01:16.550> in<00:01:16.850> there<00:01:17.060> but<00:01:17.990> 2<00:01:18.740> 4<00:01:19.070> 6<00:01:19.370> 8<00:01:19.640> 10<00:01:19.970> 12

16 about 16 colors that's plenty of

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.420 
16 about 16 colors that's plenty of
colors<00:01:23.390> there's<00:01:24.140> this<00:01:24.320> little<00:01:24.560> thing<00:01:24.710> for

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
water or for mixing and then this is a

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.580 
water or for mixing and then this is a
good<00:01:28.250> size<00:01:28.580> palette<00:01:29.240> you<00:01:29.810> can<00:01:29.960> tell<00:01:30.200> I<00:01:30.230> haven't

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
good size palette you can tell I haven't

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.140 
good size palette you can tell I haven't
cleaned<00:01:30.800> it<00:01:30.980> out<00:01:31.070> and<00:01:31.340> you<00:01:31.490> can<00:01:31.670> put<00:01:31.910> the

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
cleaned it out and you can put the

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.090 
cleaned it out and you can put the
little<00:01:32.360> travel-size<00:01:32.900> brushes<00:01:33.560> in<00:01:33.710> there<00:01:33.890> so

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
little travel-size brushes in there so

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.950 
little travel-size brushes in there so
that<00:01:34.130> doesn't<00:01:34.550> take<00:01:34.730> up<00:01:34.760> a<00:01:35.030> lot<00:01:35.060> of<00:01:35.240> space

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
that doesn't take up a lot of space

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.920 
that doesn't take up a lot of space
and<00:01:36.500> it<00:01:36.860> doesn't<00:01:37.070> rust<00:01:37.520> I<00:01:37.880> happen<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.300> like<00:01:38.720> the

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
and it doesn't rust I happen to like the

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.860 
and it doesn't rust I happen to like the
metal<00:01:39.230> ones<00:01:39.410> but<00:01:39.710> I<00:01:39.740> have<00:01:40.040> had<00:01:40.250> them<00:01:40.610> rust<00:01:40.940> and

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
metal ones but I have had them rust and

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.760 
metal ones but I have had them rust and
then<00:01:42.050> I<00:01:42.080> don't<00:01:42.470> use<00:01:42.710> this<00:01:42.860> fancy<00:01:43.190> brush<00:01:43.610> case<00:01:43.940> I

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
then I don't use this fancy brush case I

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.080 
then I don't use this fancy brush case I
put<00:01:45.770> my<00:01:46.090> brushes<00:01:47.090> in<00:01:47.840> a<00:01:48.440> packet<00:01:49.430> that<00:01:49.460> one<00:01:49.850> of

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
put my brushes in a packet that one of

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.990 
put my brushes in a packet that one of
them<00:01:50.570> would<00:01:50.780> come<00:01:50.810> in<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:51.470> so<00:01:52.190> you<00:01:52.250> see<00:01:52.700> I<00:01:52.730> have

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
them would come in and so you see I have

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000 
them would come in and so you see I have
a<00:01:53.030> bunch<00:01:53.120> of<00:01:53.510> them<00:01:53.690> here<00:01:53.990> and<00:01:54.200> I'm<00:01:54.410> using<00:01:54.620> water

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
a bunch of them here and I'm using water

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.880 
a bunch of them here and I'm using water
color<00:01:55.310> because<00:01:55.670> it<00:01:55.960> uses<00:01:56.960> smaller<00:01:57.530> brushes

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
color because it uses smaller brushes

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.700 
color because it uses smaller brushes
and<00:01:58.430> takes<00:01:59.210> up<00:01:59.390> less<00:01:59.570> space<00:01:59.630> for<00:01:59.930> travel<00:02:00.530> so<00:02:00.650> I

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
and takes up less space for travel so I

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.370 
and takes up less space for travel so I
have<00:02:00.800> a<00:02:00.860> number<00:02:01.040> of<00:02:01.220> sizes<00:02:01.580> here<00:02:02.330> a<00:02:02.510> couple

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
have a number of sizes here a couple

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
fit smaller than the thing so that they

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.650
