00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.240
 very well we get to the heart of the program 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.040
 so for you to see two cards quickly for the moment 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.139
 we do not use but just to proceed by order 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.289
 the first card here is a card dedicated to the direct acquisition of 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:19.260
 images 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.700
 starting from a connected camera 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.439
 remotely with the PC 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.779
 it is possible to program the main reject parameters to evaluate 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.920
 the exposure on a special stacked histogram will proceed with the click 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.970
 picture 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.250
 this living only to show that it is understood when it was thought by fresu 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.470
 also as you know it is a time one of the major producers of digital backs 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.840
 land 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.319
 studio photography was 

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:49.420
 thought just for setting 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.070
 creative studio then by way of work 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.190
 professional actors who work in this way 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.670
 the next card to the del showed here a card containing some 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.880
 instruments 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.960
 and fundamental work on images 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.090
 is this card been put here as 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.240
 in the first meeting they are so to speak with the program because it was present 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.670
 a tool with which you can work most images 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.040
 who have not 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.800
 many fixes to make 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.230
 in reality the instruments that I am here are also contained in the other tabs 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.140
 and therefore 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.350
 we continue and will become as we will see the work with the other cards 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.010
 we come to this head card 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.920
 which is called composition and contains the tools 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.970
 profits 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.430
 to crop and eventually rotate images 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.860
 here is ooh 100 this image because this architectural element behind 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.590
 the personal we expect were it should be horizontal we see clearly 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.870
 what horizontal you don't have 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.190
 I hope to remain a horizon, an image that is still crooked 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.560
 use this tool called. saddens 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.439
 the straighten tool works 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:14.709
 very simply and not selected 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.269
 and they drawn 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.269
 holding down the mouse button a line 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:22.979
 it goes 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:23.819
 that 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.079
 is parallel to that element as you can on the horizon of an image of 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:30.659
 sea ​​or 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.319
 this architectural element that must be perfectly in our idea 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.759
 horizontal when I release the mouse button a 

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:43.209
 the image is automatically radio was daca you guanda that shows 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.669
 also of what size the clipping I get 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.219
 cartomancy also takes the trouble to cut away image extremes 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:54.419
 which is the rotation would bring 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.789
 em out of reality 

00:02:57.789 --> 00:03:00.299
 useful in short, so to speak 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:05.609
 I repeat the operation so as to make it clearer I select it again 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:06.720
 tool 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.639
 I walk again 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.039
 this line 

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:16.879
 I leave the mouse button you have with imagine imagine as you see a lot 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:17.889
 simple 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:22.209
 at this point however place of the rare in tb cut out the image for 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.259
 Cropping image is available to this other particular tool 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.749
 do not select you see that when I select the image a tool 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:32.089
 change colour 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:35.189
 then hello I apply to the image 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.229
 I can do a little what I want I can take off at some point that 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.559
 d not only the tarallo logo placed exactly in the center 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:51.139
 of useful space or not in this way - 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:59.169
 here I can decide that this is a result that satisfies me 

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:03.460
 I have already exterminated 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.070
 as you can see I can set fixed ratios between the sides in there are more ones 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.620
 common 1 1 the square format 2 3 34 etc. so that to detail 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.209
 respect exactly 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.589
 and the proportions between the data that I wish also in this case delete key 

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:21.419
 understood when he proposes me 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:26.080
 terms of down how many pixels will be cropping that I applied 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.349
 let's try another image 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:33.249
 this image is visibly distorted 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:36.990
 again use the andristic command use this line 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.870
 how to get yourself a guideline 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.559
 the horizontality is done 

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:46.869
 this point I can decide for example that I want to apply the square cut 

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:48.699
 this image 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:52.360
 select a tool crop the free proportion 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:57.249
 I begin to work his name square cut this May 

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:00.900
 I can decide everything ok 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.949
 this division convinces 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:05.620
 green space between 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.760
 the two architectural elements in christ fundamental friends 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.949
 here so obtained we see a little if you like it too 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:19.629
 in my work already finished 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:20.329
 the catch here
