00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
that we looked at we tested out the

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.510 
that we looked at we tested out the
texting<00:05:21.780> function<00:05:22.200> on<00:05:22.320> the<00:05:22.440> ice<00:05:22.560> at<00:05:22.860> phone<00:05:23.100> pro

and<00:05:23.850> that<00:05:24.780> was<00:05:25.020> work<00:05:25.860> this<00:05:26.130> equivalent<00:05:26.940> of<00:05:27.090> the

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
and that was work this equivalent of the

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.760 
and that was work this equivalent of the
way<00:05:27.300> it<00:05:27.510> works<00:05:27.660> on<00:05:27.930> a<00:05:27.960> cellular<00:05:28.230> system<00:05:28.560> is

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
way it works on a cellular system is

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.670 
way it works on a cellular system is
fairly<00:05:29.220> simple<00:05:29.610> to<00:05:29.790> use<00:05:29.970> but<00:05:30.000> it's<00:05:30.510> a<00:05:30.650> not<00:05:31.650> a

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
fairly simple to use but it's a not a

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.270 
fairly simple to use but it's a not a
complicated<00:05:32.130> process<00:05:33.380> well<00:05:34.380> I<00:05:34.410> would<00:05:35.010> say

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
complicated process well I would say

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.150 
complicated process well I would say
that<00:05:35.730> there<00:05:36.000> are<00:05:36.300> not<00:05:36.630> dramatically<00:05:37.530> great

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
that there are not dramatically great

differences between the phones I would

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.730 
differences between the phones I would

in the market to buy a Sat phone
I<00:06:01.650> would<00:06:01.950> certainly<00:06:02.130> choose<00:06:03.060> the<00:06:03.390> ISAT<00:06:03.750> phone

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
I would certainly choose the ISAT phone

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.620 
I would certainly choose the ISAT phone
Pro<00:06:04.380> because<00:06:04.920> it's<00:06:05.640> substantially<00:06:06.390> less

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
Pro because it's substantially less

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.580 
Pro because it's substantially less
expensive<00:06:07.320> and<00:06:07.590> there's<00:06:08.310> no<00:06:08.510> significant

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590

feature of the other phones that's

feature of the other phones that's
better<00:06:12.300> and<00:06:13.130> this<00:06:14.130> would<00:06:14.460> clearly<00:06:14.910> be<00:06:15.230> the

better and this would clearly be the
