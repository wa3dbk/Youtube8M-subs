00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
point out three aspects of goat biology

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.430 
point out three aspects of goat biology
that<00:01:20.940> are<00:01:21.000> integral<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.020> setting<00:01:22.320> up<00:01:22.380> the

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
that are integral to setting up the

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.530 
that are integral to setting up the
situation<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.160> we're<00:01:23.310> concerned<00:01:23.640> about<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
situation that we're concerned about the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.060 
situation that we're concerned about the
interactions<00:01:25.050> between<00:01:25.110> goats<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.770> people

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
interactions between goats and people

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.540 
interactions between goats and people
the<00:01:26.670> first<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.060> what<00:01:27.660> we're<00:01:27.780> seeing<00:01:27.930> here<00:01:28.550> this

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
the first is what we're seeing here this

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.130 
the first is what we're seeing here this
very<00:01:29.790> steep<00:01:29.970> terrain<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.570> where<00:01:30.750> goats<00:01:30.900> like

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
very steep terrain is where goats like

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.620 
very steep terrain is where goats like
to<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.920> spend<00:01:32.130> time<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:33.120> is<00:01:33.270> their<00:01:33.420> way<00:01:33.540> of

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
to to spend time this is their way of

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.360 
to to spend time this is their way of
getting<00:01:33.840> away<00:01:33.930> from<00:01:33.990> predators<00:01:34.500> unlike<00:01:35.160> some

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
getting away from predators unlike some

in this kind of area so they don't

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.570 
in this kind of area so they don't

society they're actually pretty

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.500 
society they're actually pretty
aggressive<00:02:11.129> goats<00:02:11.640> do<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:11.849> fair<00:02:12.150> amount<00:02:12.269> of

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
aggressive goats do a fair amount of

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.610 
aggressive goats do a fair amount of
defending<00:02:12.989> their<00:02:13.109> own<00:02:13.140> turn

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
with people getting too close there is

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.339 
with people getting too close there is
some<00:02:20.400> danger<00:02:20.819> from<00:02:21.030> goats<00:02:21.269> because<00:02:21.510> they<00:02:22.140> can

standing here on the top of Mount
Eleanor<00:02:35.250> just<00:02:35.670> made<00:02:36.329> the<00:02:36.480> long<00:02:36.629> hike<00:02:36.930> up<00:02:37.290> to

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
Eleanor just made the long hike up to

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.580 
Eleanor just made the long hike up to
the<00:02:37.680> peak<00:02:38.459> here<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:38.909> as<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:39.900> can<00:02:40.019> see<00:02:40.079> it's<00:02:40.500> a

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
the peak here and as you can see it's a

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.830 
the peak here and as you can see it's a
pretty<00:02:40.640> small<00:02:41.640> area<00:02:41.670> up<00:02:42.239> here<00:02:42.420> there's<00:02:42.569> not<00:02:42.780> a

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
pretty small area up here there's not a

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.509 
pretty small area up here there's not a
lot<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.200> room<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.680> maneuver<00:02:43.799> there's<00:02:44.310> not<00:02:44.489> a

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
lot of room to maneuver there's not a

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.809 
lot of room to maneuver there's not a
lot<00:02:44.819> of<00:02:44.849> room<00:02:45.780> for<00:02:46.140> people<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:46.950> goat<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.430> so

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
lot of room for people and goat and so

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.520 
lot of room for people and goat and so
that's<00:02:48.060> why<00:02:48.239> it's<00:02:48.420> important<00:02:48.930> for<00:02:49.109> us<00:02:49.260> when

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
that's why it's important for us when

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.559 
that's why it's important for us when
we're<00:02:49.739> up<00:02:49.890> here<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.220> hold<00:02:50.549> this<00:02:50.730> ground<00:02:51.060> for

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
we're up here to hold this ground for

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.750 
we're up here to hold this ground for
for<00:02:51.930> ourselves<00:02:52.049> because<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:53.069> allow<00:02:53.280> goats<00:02:53.579> in

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
for ourselves because to allow goats in

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.789 
for ourselves because to allow goats in
here<00:02:53.790> would<00:02:54.030> be<00:02:54.150> too<00:02:54.840> much<00:02:55.049> into<00:02:55.349> our<00:02:55.379> personal

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
here would be too much into our personal

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.210 
here would be too much into our personal
space<00:02:56.190> so<00:02:56.819> the<00:02:57.690> first<00:02:57.930> thing<00:02:58.109> I<00:02:58.230> always<00:02:58.500> like

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
space so the first thing I always like

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.009 
space so the first thing I always like
to<00:02:59.250> do<00:02:59.519> is<00:02:59.549> just<00:02:59.819> make<00:03:00.060> sure<00:03:00.269> that<00:03:00.299> that<00:03:00.720> I

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
to do is just make sure that that I

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.660 
to do is just make sure that that I
account<00:03:01.829> for<00:03:02.069> my<00:03:02.190> gear<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.700> then<00:03:02.940> my<00:03:03.120> gear<00:03:03.599> is

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
account for my gear and then my gear is

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.199 
account for my gear and then my gear is
secure<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:06.000> not<00:03:07.010> providing<00:03:08.010> its<00:03:08.730> own<00:03:08.909> set<00:03:09.180> of

from<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.440> too<00:03:22.590> much<00:03:22.709> so<00:03:22.919> the<00:03:23.040> goats<00:03:23.250> can<00:03:23.519> get<00:03:23.700> at

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
from it too much so the goats can get at

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.280 
from it too much so the goats can get at
it<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.150> chew<00:03:24.299> on<00:03:24.329> it<00:03:24.480> because<00:03:24.870> number<00:03:25.139> one

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
it and chew on it because number one

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.949 
it and chew on it because number one
it'll<00:03:25.530> could<00:03:26.069> ruin<00:03:26.280> my<00:03:26.519> gear<00:03:26.849> but<00:03:27.090> also

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
provides them with a with a bad example

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.539 
provides them with a with a bad example
if<00:03:32.220> I<00:03:32.430> allow<00:03:32.669> them<00:03:32.790> access<00:03:33.239> to<00:03:33.269> that<00:03:34.310> so<00:03:35.310> that

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
if I allow them access to that so that

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.250 
if I allow them access to that so that
if<00:03:35.760> I<00:03:35.970> see<00:03:36.239> a<00:03:36.269> mountain<00:03:36.599> goat<00:03:36.690> up<00:03:36.900> here<00:03:37.139> the

first thing I'm going to do is just

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.039 
first thing I'm going to do is just
start<00:03:38.489> talking<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.209> in<00:03:39.629> a<00:03:39.690> regular

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
start talking to it and in a regular

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.640 
start talking to it and in a regular

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
and trying to get it to move off because

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.050 
and trying to get it to move off because
there's<00:03:46.169> just<00:03:46.349> not<00:03:47.010> enough<00:03:47.069> room<00:03:47.400> for<00:03:47.579> us<00:03:47.790> both

there's just not enough room for us both
to<00:03:48.269> be<00:03:48.389> on<00:03:48.540> this<00:03:48.720> peak<00:03:48.989> together<00:03:49.290> it's<00:03:49.470> really

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
to be on this peak together it's really
