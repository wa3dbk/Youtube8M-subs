first<00:00:46.460> this<00:00:46.820> Mark<00:00:47.149> Hamill<00:00:47.540> head<00:00:47.750> scope<00:00:48.020> has<00:00:48.290> I

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
first this Mark Hamill head scope has I

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.250 
first this Mark Hamill head scope has I
think<00:00:48.500> been<00:00:49.149> agreed<00:00:50.149> to<00:00:50.390> be<00:00:50.570> probably<00:00:51.079> the

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
think been agreed to be probably the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.400 
think been agreed to be probably the
best<00:00:51.559> head<00:00:51.770> sculpt<00:00:52.160> around<00:00:52.489> at<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:52.700> moment

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
best head sculpt around at the moment

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.470 
best head sculpt around at the moment
hair<00:00:54.410> is<00:00:54.829> pretty<00:00:55.340> good<00:00:55.520> actually<00:00:55.700> a<00:00:56.149> lot<00:00:56.390> of

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
hair is pretty good actually a lot of

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.119 
hair is pretty good actually a lot of
people<00:00:56.719> saying<00:00:56.930> it<00:00:57.020> looks<00:00:57.140> a<00:00:57.230> bit<00:00:57.260> too<00:00:57.530> dark<00:00:57.800> I

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
people saying it looks a bit too dark I

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.520 
people saying it looks a bit too dark I
can<00:00:58.879> say<00:00:59.090> it's<00:00:59.360> the<00:00:59.539> lighting<00:01:00.079> that's<00:01:00.230> causing

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
can say it's the lighting that's causing

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.920 
can say it's the lighting that's causing
that<00:01:00.800> if<00:01:01.070> you<00:01:01.250> see<00:01:01.430> this<00:01:01.550> in<00:01:01.730> person<00:01:01.940> you<00:01:02.480> can

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
that if you see this in person you can

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.899 
that if you see this in person you can
see<00:01:03.230> that's<00:01:03.379> actually<00:01:03.590> a<00:01:03.770> lot<00:01:03.950> lighter<00:01:04.280> than

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
see that's actually a lot lighter than

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.800 
see that's actually a lot lighter than
some<00:01:05.210> of<00:01:05.329> the<00:01:05.390> pictures<00:01:05.840> are<00:01:06.320> showing<00:01:07.810> skin

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
some of the pictures are showing skin

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.340 
some of the pictures are showing skin
tone<00:01:09.229> the<00:01:10.220> sculpts<00:01:10.940> really<00:01:11.570> impressive<00:01:12.080> so<00:01:12.320> I

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
tone the sculpts really impressive so I

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.660 
tone the sculpts really impressive so I
think<00:01:12.590> that's<00:01:13.010> definitely<00:01:13.070> one<00:01:13.520> of<00:01:13.549> the

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
think that's definitely one of the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.630 
think that's definitely one of the
strengths<00:01:14.150> for<00:01:15.080> this<00:01:15.380> figure<00:01:15.770> set<00:01:15.950> I<00:01:16.190> think

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
strengths for this figure set I think

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.310 
strengths for this figure set I think
you<00:01:16.880> can<00:01:17.030> see<00:01:17.210> here<00:01:17.420> I've<00:01:17.510> lightened<00:01:18.140> the

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
you can see here I've lightened the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.530 
you can see here I've lightened the
camera<00:01:18.740> a<00:01:18.770> little<00:01:19.010> bit<00:01:19.189> so<00:01:19.400> you<00:01:19.490> can<00:01:19.549> see<00:01:19.880> that

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
camera a little bit so you can see that

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.660 
camera a little bit so you can see that
it<00:01:20.750> is<00:01:20.780> actually<00:01:21.320> a<00:01:21.350> lighter<00:01:21.650> rather<00:01:22.369> than

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
it is actually a lighter rather than

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.490 
it is actually a lighter rather than
some<00:01:22.909> of<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.030> darker<00:01:23.420> shades<00:01:23.750> of<00:01:23.990> black<00:01:24.290> at

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
some of the darker shades of black at

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.750 
some of the darker shades of black at
the<00:01:24.590> top<00:01:24.799> so<00:01:25.040> this<00:01:25.159> is<00:01:25.310> probably<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:25.640> best

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
the top so this is probably the best

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.990 
the top so this is probably the best
picture<00:01:26.210> of<00:01:26.479> showing<00:01:26.780> how<00:01:26.930> light<00:01:27.229> it<00:01:27.409> is<00:01:27.530> as<00:01:28.000> I

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
picture of showing how light it is as I

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.920 
picture of showing how light it is as I
mentioned<00:01:29.330> earlier<00:01:29.630> this<00:01:29.810> is<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:30.430> training

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
mentioned earlier this is the training

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.560 
mentioned earlier this is the training
droid<00:01:32.930> or<00:01:33.200> robots<00:01:34.119> when<00:01:35.119> he's<00:01:35.299> on<00:01:35.479> the

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
droid or robots when he's on the

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.780 
droid or robots when he's on the
Millennium<00:01:35.780> Falcon<00:01:35.960> so<00:01:36.740> I<00:01:36.920> assume<00:01:37.490> that<00:01:37.640> is

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
Millennium Falcon so I assume that is

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.080 
Millennium Falcon so I assume that is
the<00:01:37.970> correct<00:01:38.320> accessory<00:01:39.320> they're<00:01:39.619> on<00:01:39.740> display

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
the correct accessory they're on display

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.730 
the correct accessory they're on display
nice<00:01:41.090> little<00:01:41.450> piece<00:01:41.630> I<00:01:41.930> don't<00:01:42.350> think<00:01:42.530> this<00:01:42.590> has

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
nice little piece I don't think this has

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.219 
nice little piece I don't think this has
been<00:01:42.770> shown<00:01:43.130> in<00:01:43.189> many<00:01:43.460> places<00:01:43.729> before<00:01:44.090> so<00:01:44.720> I'm

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
been shown in many places before so I'm

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.240 
been shown in many places before so I'm
glad<00:01:45.530> that<00:01:45.740> this<00:01:45.860> is<00:01:45.920> available<00:01:47.799> looking<00:01:48.799> down

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
glad that this is available looking down

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.690 
glad that this is available looking down
on<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.610> tailoring<00:01:50.150> now<00:01:50.650> at<00:01:51.650> the<00:01:51.860> white<00:01:52.159> robe

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
on the tailoring now at the white robe

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.679 
on the tailoring now at the white robe
and<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:54.170> belt<00:01:54.640> nice<00:01:55.640> bit<00:01:55.880> of<00:01:55.909> weathering<00:01:56.509> so

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
and the belt nice bit of weathering so

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.289 
and the belt nice bit of weathering so
it's<00:01:56.780> not<00:01:56.930> completely<00:01:57.470> clean<00:01:57.979> I<00:01:58.340> think<00:01:59.149> it's

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
it's not completely clean I think it's

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.639 
it's not completely clean I think it's
very<00:01:59.450> nicely<00:01:59.899> done<00:02:00.649> along<00:02:01.640> with<00:02:01.700> the

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
very nicely done along with the

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.179 
very nicely done along with the
lightsaber<00:02:03.649> on<00:02:04.579> the<00:02:05.180> belts<00:02:05.509> they're<00:02:06.189> working

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
Star Wars fans probably have a better

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.050 
Star Wars fans probably have a better
idea<00:02:19.640> of<00:02:20.090> that<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:21.319> basic<00:02:21.769> comes<00:02:22.010> with<00:02:22.310> is<00:02:22.519> the

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
idea of that the basic comes with is the

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.339 
idea of that the basic comes with is the
same<00:02:23.420> base<00:02:23.840> as<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:25.489> stormtroopers<00:02:26.360> Darth
