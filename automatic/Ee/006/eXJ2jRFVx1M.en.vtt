00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
that's that's pretty run-heavy you still

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.189 
that's that's pretty run-heavy you still
have<00:03:03.909> to<00:03:04.030> be<00:03:04.120> able<00:03:04.239> to<00:03:04.329> pass<00:03:04.510> be<00:03:04.840> able<00:03:04.989> to<00:03:05.049> pass
