00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.579
 biennale of venice which is a huge 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.050
 surprise on our journey we 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.910
 really lived as a long residence 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.710
 of artists we had never had 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.390
 time to prepare an exhibition 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.020
 had never rarely had so many 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.300
 equipment 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.879
 we could work 24 hours a day 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.950
 if we wanted to be sure to have 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.289
 been selected to represent the 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.629
 canada at the biennale de venise it's a 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.539
 honor for us and then hey we are 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.750
 income it's barely 4 5 days and we 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.940
 come back with bread on the board and then 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.110
 we are in the process of finalizing the project 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.970
 who was called had the str and places 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.439
 which will be installed at the corners of 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.439
 pie-ix streets and henri bourassa 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.270
 we are sculptors who love we have 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.530
 already worked with a ski already doo 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.930
 worked a 4 where we do not work 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.280
 a car with a boat and that 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.350
 pass it must be part of a lot to 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.060
 our interests to work with 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.100
 vehicles etc we started playing in 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.680
 workshop to see what kind of wedding we 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.509
 prefers and by far appeared the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.070
 possibility curves and center buzz 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.450
 it's really fun as well as buzz 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.880
 for rectangular but who 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.920
 become curbet and there was the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.770
 possibility to put the color in 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.649
 using well reflectors in 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.520
 using glass or plexiglass that 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.619
 you will put colored bands on us 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.110
 important element in the velocity of 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.720
 places that's the seat can you take off the 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:02.160
 seats then the real not bad vd not bad 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:04.110
 least all live and therefore the basics of 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.509
 concrete for the eight legs have been 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.970
 sank and was done in two stages 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.370
 so 2 you four paws in the center are 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.340
 just there before less we see with 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.799
 metal templates so that was done 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.750
 this morning and then other packs are 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.910
 hidden we do not see who are in the 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.530
 shrubs behind pau below see at 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.660
 ground 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.370
 a kind of dotted but knows 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.170
 exactly where the Ferris wheel is going to be 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.430
 that one then that allows to have 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.840
 trees in front is a big delusion and 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.799
 it's an incredible opportunity too 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.049
 to offer a moment of contemplation 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.579
 it's quite difficult to get there I 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.230
 do not know if we'll get there we'll see 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.570
 once the are going to be done 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.030
 back up but it's really more what 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.430
 people get pleasure if it's 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.030
 makes you smile and that it feels good 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.030
 is super happy
