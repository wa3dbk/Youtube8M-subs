00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:08.960
 hello this week let's see how 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:11.330
 draw objects that putting them in a 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.400
 Special mode will look bigger and 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.830
 smaller when some with respect 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.160
 to others or who are closer and more 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.250
 far is to say let's make a 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.249
 super simple and super useful introduction 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.800
 to the perspective I hope that your 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:31.150
 children find it useful to you soon 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.150
 we split the image in 2 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.890
 we put 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.210
 a line of the horizon 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.210
 is the point of view 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.219
 As you can see, I put them at the same height 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.219
 and here we are going to draw a line 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.810
 10 centimeters 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.230
 Of 6 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.620
 and another 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.620
 3 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.780
 all right 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.829
 the one of 10 centimeters more or less to the 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:21.460
 half more or less we are going to put a 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:25.299
 hairline what is the 6 to half 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.630
 at 3 centimeters another hairline and the one 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.260
 3 to the centimeter and half another why 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.860
 serves this rat 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.030
 this line of we are going to transform 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.000
 in a tree 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.320
 very simple evidently even more 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.320
 simple after the first tutorial 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.380
 we delete the line so that this starts 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.380
 it looks like a tree 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.740
 and the man masters a little 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.930
 by filling in this is by playing a little 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.900
 it's not necessary either because they look like 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.570
 some that may seem 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.820
 with balloons with a lace 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.340
 honestly up to here it looks like a 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.670
 a tree medium large shaft and a 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.319
 small well now let's do what 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.640
 but otherwise the same way 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:23.560
 same horizon line 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.560
 we make a sloping line 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.420
 we are going to add this line 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.040
 in vertical 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.040
 a line of 10 centimeters 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.540
 another line 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.120
 of 6 as you can see are exactly the same 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.170
 the lines that we have done before 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.510
 of size I mean 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.510
 and another line of three 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:00.379
 in all 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.379
 between 2.3 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.750
 we do what we transform it into 1 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.560
 more or less 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.550
 plus 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.060
 we erase the line that hinders us for 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.800
 watch 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.800
 they prevent us from seeing correctly 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.040
 about masters 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.810
 for giving a more organic look 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.440
 and we no longer have trees that look 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.880
 that they are one closer or further away this 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.180
 further away they do not appear distinct from 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.180
 size 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.519
 what is this is the introduction more 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.959
 simple and more basic that you can do to 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.780
 a child about what the perspective is 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.890
 in the drawing and how we can see the 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.890
 things in three dimensions 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.250
 shortly I will do a tutorial in the 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.549
 that we are going to draw a whole forest 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:08.090
 whole is going to be a project in several 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:09.680
 videos before we need to do 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.379
 some introductions about what the 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.060
 perspective and sizes in this case 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:16.009
 we have seen how putting the objects in 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.049
 the same flat point of view in the 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:21.079
 same point of view we can do that 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.720
 appear bigger and smaller 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.800
 Changing 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.840
 the height of our point of view 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.529
 those same objects may seem that 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.539
 they are moving away 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:34.539
 up here out there I hope you like it
