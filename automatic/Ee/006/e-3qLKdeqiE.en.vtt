00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.200
 hello bq maniacs I think of a 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.630
 super entertaining application especially 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.270
 for your little ones it's called clouds 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.790
 and yep and before you ask me if 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.890
 it's completely free as you see 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.260
 lately I avoid enough those of payment 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.269
 but that's what you're demanding from me 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.180
 I'm looking for the crème de la crème 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:36.190
 of the free apps surely you 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.290
 sound of something the German company handy 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.050
 game with applications like save from daddies 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.790
 jiangmen or guns and glory the truth that 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.769
 the game is quite simple and has a 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.449
 clear appeal to children so 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.909
 I think it 's ideal for everyone who 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.250
 you have dwarves scampering around the house 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.809
 end I'll cut to the chase in this game it will be 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.299
 a kind of shepherd who should take care 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.489
 of his sheep the most fun is that 

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:59.979
 You can handle absolutely all the 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.239
 rain cultivation etc. so that 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:03.220
 you will take care of keeping well 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.040
 fed and taken care of your sheep 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.380
 be careful because if they go too hungry 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.390
 thirsty they are poisoned with a mushroom or they fall 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.580
 too much lightning in a storm its 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.890
 sheep could pass to a better life and it 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.660
 will become clouds of the sky to not be 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.560
 that you have named them in such a case 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.049
 they will leave 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.610
 and you can resurrect the ones to get 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.770
 objects that help you along the 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.540
 departure to vary you will have to accumulate 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.460
 enough stars which 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.939
 you will get through the happiness of your 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.310
 sheep 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.960
 as you pass level surpassing 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.000
 the missions that are proposed to us in the 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.420
 posters you can select different 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.490
 bucolic scenarios good not so much but 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.649
 Of course the thing will get complicated 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.020
 little bit and will unlock different 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.210
 objects and as in every family when 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.970
 together to two lambs you can leave a 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.009
 white or a black and if the latter 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.690
 they should be a little apart and not 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.479
 we want them to electrocute in others 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.789
 what fault will they have to have a 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.830
 uncontrollable electric charge 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.899
 Finally, as you can see, the thing does not have much 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.090
 complication at first glance seems a 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.009
 game too easy but you'll see 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.709
 how looks cheat that if 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.780
 100% addiction guaranteed in your 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.350
 tablet bq to the next video 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.410
 cowherd boys 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.410

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.150
 good
