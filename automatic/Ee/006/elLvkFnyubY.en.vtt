the look just a bit on this side so some

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.900 
the look just a bit on this side so some
records<00:00:52.620> it's<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.890> little<00:00:53.039> bit<00:00:53.160> too<00:00:53.430> big<00:00:53.670> a

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
records it's a little bit too big a

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.819 
records it's a little bit too big a
little<00:00:54.270> too<00:00:54.390> small<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:54.870> others<00:00:55.170> just<00:00:55.559> right

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
little too small for others just right

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.069 
little too small for others just right
bud<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.610> small<00:00:56.969> holes<00:00:57.270> on<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> lot<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.899> these

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
bud the small holes on a lot of these

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.209 
bud the small holes on a lot of these
records<00:00:58.440> vary<00:00:58.710> quite<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.309> bit<00:00:59.399> so<00:01:00.980> and<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.070> use

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
records vary quite a bit so and I use

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.830 
records vary quite a bit so and I use
the<00:01:02.250> extra<00:01:02.609> rot<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:03.030> there<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.300> way<00:01:03.570> I

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the extra rot in there so that way I

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.600 
the extra rot in there so that way I
don't<00:01:04.229> have<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.559> bolt<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:04.979> thing<00:01:05.189> down<00:01:05.369> and

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
don't have to bolt this thing down and

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.010 
don't have to bolt this thing down and
the<00:01:05.670> record<00:01:05.970> doesn't<00:01:06.119> take<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.479> with<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.810> so

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
the record doesn't take it with it so

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.899 
the record doesn't take it with it so
it's<00:01:07.229> always<00:01:07.920> good<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.159> have<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.790> little

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
it's always good to have it a little

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.980 
it's always good to have it a little
extra<00:01:09.060> distance<00:01:11.330> so<00:01:12.330> i'm<00:01:12.840> going<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:14.780> pick<00:01:15.780> one

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.800 
yeah this thing gets pretty loud
definitely<00:04:28.900> yes

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.659 

so<00:04:34.870> well<00:04:35.870> like<00:04:36.050> I<00:04:36.139> said<00:04:36.230> it's<00:04:36.830> real<00:04:37.040> cool<00:04:37.280> so<00:04:37.550> if

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
so well like I said it's real cool so if

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.460 
so well like I said it's real cool so if
you<00:04:37.790> really<00:04:37.970> want<00:04:38.300> if<00:04:38.750> you<00:04:38.870> really<00:04:39.020> want<00:04:39.290> to<00:04:39.350> go

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
you really want if you really want to go

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.740 
you really want if you really want to go
out<00:04:39.620> jamming<00:04:40.160> that<00:04:41.000> this<00:04:41.300> is<00:04:41.419> like<00:04:41.600> the<00:04:41.720> best

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
out jamming that this is like the best

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.990 
out jamming that this is like the best
way<00:04:42.080> to<00:04:42.139> actually<00:04:42.410> do<00:04:42.530> it<00:04:42.560> anyway<00:04:43.000> especially

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
way to actually do it anyway especially

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.780 
way to actually do it anyway especially
if<00:04:44.510> your<00:04:44.720> arm<00:04:44.950> if<00:04:45.950> you're<00:04:46.160> not<00:04:46.250> too<00:04:46.490> worried

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
if your arm if you're not too worried

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.320 
if your arm if you're not too worried
about<00:04:46.850> having<00:04:47.150> a<00:04:47.360> jukebox<00:04:48.610> original<00:04:49.610> and<00:04:49.790> you

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
about having a jukebox original and you

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.120 
about having a jukebox original and you
want<00:04:50.540> something<00:04:50.750> actually<00:04:51.050> really<00:04:51.650> kicks<00:04:51.950> out

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
want something actually really kicks out

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.800 
want something actually really kicks out
higher<00:04:52.490> than<00:04:52.730> the<00:04:52.910> amplifier<00:04:53.450> should<00:04:53.480> be

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
higher than the amplifier should be

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.050 
higher than the amplifier should be
built<00:04:54.020> for<00:04:54.169> these<00:04:54.290> things<00:04:54.669> probably<00:04:55.669> just<00:04:55.910> go

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
built for these things probably just go

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.000 
built for these things probably just go
with<00:04:56.240> the<00:04:56.270> ones<00:04:56.540> with<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:56.780> week<00:04:57.110> that<00:04:57.800> they

the<00:05:58.840> photograph<00:05:59.520> which<00:06:00.520> goes<00:06:00.730> for<00:06:00.940> the<00:06:01.030> tuner

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
the photograph which goes for the tuner

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.560 
the photograph which goes for the tuner
you<00:06:01.750> got<00:06:01.870> to<00:06:01.960> have<00:06:02.080> a<00:06:02.820> separate<00:06:03.820> radio<00:06:04.060> system

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
you got to have a separate radio system

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.530 
you got to have a separate radio system
for<00:06:04.810> it<00:06:04.870> because<00:06:04.990> this<00:06:05.320> thing<00:06:05.530> doesn't<00:06:05.860> have

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540 
for it because this thing doesn't have

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.150 
for it because this thing doesn't have
radio<00:06:07.540> signal<00:06:07.930> to<00:06:08.050> go<00:06:08.170> with<00:06:08.380> itself<00:06:08.770> it<00:06:08.980> just

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160 
radio signal to go with itself it just

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.060 
radio signal to go with itself it just
got<00:06:09.310> the<00:06:09.810> light<00:06:10.810> in<00:06:10.990> the<00:06:11.020> sound<00:06:11.350> bar<00:06:11.560> as<00:06:11.890> you

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
got the light in the sound bar as you

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.800 
got the light in the sound bar as you
see<00:06:12.250> right<00:06:12.280> here<00:06:12.580> this<00:06:13.180> would<00:06:13.390> be<00:06:13.480> the<00:06:13.570> sound

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
see right here this would be the sound

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:19.230 
see right here this would be the sound
bar<00:06:15.660> but<00:06:16.950> how'd<00:06:17.950> you<00:06:18.070> get<00:06:18.190> and<00:06:18.580> of<00:06:18.790> course<00:06:18.820> if

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
bar but how'd you get and of course if

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.660 
bar but how'd you get and of course if
you<00:06:19.980> really<00:06:20.980> wanted<00:06:21.190> to<00:06:21.280> make<00:06:21.370> this<00:06:21.520> thing

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:21.670 
you really wanted to make this thing

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.250 
you really wanted to make this thing
it's<00:06:21.850> your<00:06:21.970> like<00:06:22.120> surround<00:06:22.540> sound<00:06:22.840> system

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
it's your like surround sound system

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260 
it's your like surround sound system
then<00:06:23.740> you<00:06:23.860> can<00:06:23.980> easily<00:06:24.130> hook<00:06:24.460> it<00:06:24.670> to<00:06:24.700> like<00:06:25.000> core

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
then you can easily hook it to like core

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:28.440 
then you can easily hook it to like core
of<00:06:25.390> the<00:06:25.450> speakers<00:06:25.810> like<00:06:26.970> let's<00:06:27.970> see<00:06:28.060> if<00:06:28.210> we<00:06:28.300> got

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:28.450 
of the speakers like let's see if we got

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.010 
of the speakers like let's see if we got
here<00:06:28.750> and<00:06:30.030> one<00:06:31.030> there<00:06:31.060> to<00:06:31.510> be<00:06:31.600> got<00:06:31.750> hanging<00:06:31.960> out

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
here and one there to be got hanging out

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.210 
here and one there to be got hanging out
up<00:06:32.110> on<00:06:32.170> the<00:06:32.230> lawn<00:06:32.440> there's<00:06:32.740> look<00:06:32.890> another<00:06:33.100> one

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:33.220 
up on the lawn there's look another one

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.600 
up on the lawn there's look another one
sitting<00:06:33.550> over<00:06:33.700> here<00:06:35.130> you<00:06:36.130> get<00:06:36.250> actually<00:06:36.490> hook

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
sitting over here you get actually hook

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.580 
sitting over here you get actually hook
into<00:06:36.730> something<00:06:37.060> like<00:06:37.150> that<00:06:37.360> so<00:06:37.780> like<00:06:37.960> you

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.590 
into something like that so like you

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.200 
into something like that so like you
know<00:06:38.620> definitely<00:06:38.950> this<00:06:39.550> would<00:06:39.760> definitely<00:06:39.940> be

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
know definitely this would definitely be

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.760 
know definitely this would definitely be
good<00:06:40.540> if<00:06:40.720> you<00:06:40.840> were<00:06:40.930> running<00:06:41.080> it<00:06:41.260> like<00:06:41.290> a<00:06:41.380> music

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:41.770 
good if you were running it like a music

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.680 
good if you were running it like a music
store<00:06:41.980> and<00:06:42.250> you<00:06:42.700> were<00:06:42.820> selling<00:06:43.060> records<00:06:43.540> or

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:43.690 
store and you were selling records or

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.930 
store and you were selling records or
CDs<00:06:44.050> in<00:06:44.080> whatever<00:06:44.380> and<00:06:44.710> you<00:06:44.800> want<00:06:45.010> to<00:06:45.070> hook<00:06:45.790> a

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.050 
all around the store this would be the

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:55.190
