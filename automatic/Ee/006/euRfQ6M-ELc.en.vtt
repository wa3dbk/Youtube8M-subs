 Generally to get to the competition therefore 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:36.190
 I would like to highlight a little and this 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.930
 moment first and foremost you need to know 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.519

 besides the fact that there are rules and regulations 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.030
 each federation has its own calendar 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:10.060
 competition which is clearly described 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:13.170

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.550

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:51.000

 on biph there is only 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:30.000
 triathlon so carefully 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.220

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:38.790

 Order number assignment number 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:55.740
 athletic everything else is assigned 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:59.850
 by federation how important is that to you or 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:02.850
 Set your otherwise decide for itself 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:08.970
 priorities by and large the sport 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:11.430
 not Olympic so any decision 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.350

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:17.500
 decision and from him the fate of the country is not 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:22.920

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:30.070
 perform i have two singing federations 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:32.230
 powerlifting russia but it is separate 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.180
 conversation there people get a scholarship she 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.620
 can not be small but not on 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.780
 some kind of minimum state provision 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.660
 there are all other organizations 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.520
 insofar as 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.320
 to sports one does not have a relationship 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:48.340
 registered as public yet 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:51.610
 any work risen train 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.810
 act as if for your money all 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:57.090
 I'm starting here 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:59.520

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:02.430
 bus on what you drive 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.810
 room hotel entry fees 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.090
 doping control all for their money 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.640
 one has to be prepared for this 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.150
 initially but it is not a surprise or 

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.940
 news 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:17.550
 that is, everything is written in the rules that 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:20.430
 there is an empty federation read 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:23.260

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:26.610

 sports heights in the next video 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:34.810
 I will try to highlight the question exactly 

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:38.530
 competitive workouts meaning you 

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:41.290
