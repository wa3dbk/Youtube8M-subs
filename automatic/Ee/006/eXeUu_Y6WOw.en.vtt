to<00:00:37.200> me<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.620> was<00:00:37.829> an<00:00:37.980> eye-opener<00:00:38.460> because<00:00:38.940> I

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
to me this was an eye-opener because I

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.639 
to me this was an eye-opener because I
really<00:00:39.840> saw<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.260> there's<00:00:40.469> technology

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
really saw that there's technology

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.100 
really saw that there's technology
that's<00:00:41.550> possible<00:00:42.120> we<00:00:42.360> can<00:00:42.510> actually<00:00:42.930> build

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
that's possible we can actually build

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.590 
that's possible we can actually build
cars<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.800> are<00:00:43.920> safe<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.149> free<00:00:45.450> years

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
cars that are safe and that free years

anywhere<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:57.180> traffic<00:00:58.520> they<00:00:59.520> have<00:00:59.699> modern<00:01:00.390> new

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
anywhere in traffic they have modern new

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.889 
anywhere in traffic they have modern new
sensors<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.620> are<00:01:01.739> given<00:01:01.980> my<00:01:02.100> surround<00:01:02.489> view

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
sensors that are given my surround view

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.859 
sensors that are given my surround view
and<00:01:03.899> they've<00:01:04.320> driven<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.739> San<00:01:04.979> Francisco

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
and they've driven in San Francisco

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.300 
and they've driven in San Francisco
driven<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:06.960> Los<00:01:07.049> Angeles<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.860> all<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.130> way<00:01:08.220> in

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110

is<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.070> little<00:01:20.340> bit<00:01:20.430> fast<00:01:20.700> forward<00:01:22.460> without<00:01:23.460> any

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
is a little bit fast forward without any

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.399 
is a little bit fast forward without any
human<00:01:24.240> intervention<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:26.810> think<00:01:27.810> we're<00:01:28.229> seeing

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
human intervention I think we're seeing

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.039 
human intervention I think we're seeing
the<00:01:28.740> birthing<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.369> technology<00:01:29.909> they<00:01:30.810> can

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
the birthing of the technology they can

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.890 
the birthing of the technology they can
really<00:01:31.259> transform<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:32.780> way<00:01:34.070> traffic<00:01:35.070> works

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
really transform the way traffic works

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.080 
really transform the way traffic works
here's<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.930> video<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.560> Lombard<00:01:37.890> Street<00:01:38.250> for

participants in our experiment didn't

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.650 
participants in our experiment didn't
know<00:01:44.610> about<00:01:44.729> it
