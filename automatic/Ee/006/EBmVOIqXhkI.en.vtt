00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.719 
a rookie that's how much I like what he
brings<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.650> table<00:01:34.799> they<00:01:35.009> got<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.189> steal<00:01:35.490> in

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
brings to the table they got a steal in

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.420 
brings to the table they got a steal in
round<00:01:35.970> seven<00:01:36.650> if<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.829> have<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.070> knock<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
round seven if I have to knock the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.010 
round seven if I have to knock the
Giants<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:38.970> something<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.420> draft<00:01:39.810> they

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
Giants for something in the draft they

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.050 
Giants for something in the draft they
didn't<00:01:40.320> address<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.979> linebacker<00:01:41.549> position

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
didn't address the linebacker position

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.700 
didn't address the linebacker position
in<00:01:42.270> any<00:01:42.570> one<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.020> rounds<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.530> think

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
in any one of the rounds and I think

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.380 
in any one of the rounds and I think
that<00:01:43.890> was<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> huge<00:01:44.490> miss<00:01:44.790> here's<00:01:45.270> some

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
that was a huge miss here's some

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.700 
that was a huge miss here's some
outstanding<00:01:45.600> talent<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.170> was<00:01:46.229> left<00:01:46.470> on<00:01:46.560> the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
outstanding talent that was left on the

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.620 
outstanding talent that was left on the

guy in Cooper Taylor solid player but in

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.060 
guy in Cooper Taylor solid player but in
my<00:01:50.939> opinion<00:01:51.119> he<00:01:51.479> struggles<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.079> space<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:53.040> I

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
my opinion he struggles in space so I

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.230 
my opinion he struggles in space so I
felt<00:01:53.369> as<00:01:53.520> though<00:01:53.610> they<00:01:53.729> could<00:01:53.909> have<00:01:54.000> went<00:01:54.119> with
