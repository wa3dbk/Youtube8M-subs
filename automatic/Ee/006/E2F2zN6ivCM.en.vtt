00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.970 
start shifting to a raw food diet here
are<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.390> few<00:00:45.450> strategies<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.500> can<00:00:46.590> start

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
are a few strategies that you can start

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.639 
are a few strategies that you can start
applying<00:00:47.270> ok<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:50.460> first<00:00:50.670> thing<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.809> realize

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
applying ok the first thing to realize

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.700 
applying ok the first thing to realize
it<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.670> if<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.300> just<00:00:54.600> go<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.680> that

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
it is that if you just go in that

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.740 
it is that if you just go in that
direction<00:00:55.980> go<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.879> direction<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.390> wanting

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
direction go in the direction of wanting

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.770 
direction go in the direction of wanting
to<00:00:57.780> eat<00:00:58.109> more<00:00:58.350> row<00:00:58.940> very<00:00:59.940> often<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.329> are<00:01:00.539> going

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
to eat more row very often you are going

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.080 
to eat more row very often you are going
to<00:01:01.020> hit<00:01:01.469> some<00:01:01.739> challenges<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.520> unless<00:01:02.940> you

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
to hit some challenges and unless you

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.880 
to hit some challenges and unless you
have<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> very<00:01:03.600> solid<00:01:03.930> strategy<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.680> break

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
have a very solid strategy to break

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.030 
have a very solid strategy to break
through<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:06.090> will<00:01:06.270> be<00:01:06.450> set<00:01:06.689> back<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.830> is

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
through you will be set back so it is

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.490 
through you will be set back so it is
important<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.640> plan<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.960> very

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
important that you plan this very

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.960

carefully<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:11.189> little<00:01:11.520> bit<00:01:11.610> like<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.850> would

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
carefully a little bit like you would

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.440 
carefully a little bit like you would
plan<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> battle<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.990> go<00:01:13.740> for<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.220> but<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.240> have

a<00:01:15.479> solid<00:01:15.689> set<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.170> strategies<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.830> can

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
a solid set of strategies that you can

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.830 
a solid set of strategies that you can
start<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.369> climate<00:01:17.820> ok<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.509> first

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840

game realize that just heading in that

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.850 
game realize that just heading in that
direction<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.509> not<00:01:21.720> good<00:01:21.930> enough<00:01:22.229> very<00:01:22.680> often

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
direction is not good enough very often

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.429

you<00:01:23.009> will<00:01:23.280> need<00:01:23.520> some<00:01:24.060> form<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.330> solid<00:01:24.750> battle

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439

a way of doing it which is very simple
for<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.310> that<00:03:11.549> requires<00:03:11.909> little<00:03:12.150> time<00:03:13.019> energy

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859

either<00:03:18.389> so<00:03:19.049> all<00:03:19.680> these<00:03:19.889> recipes<00:03:20.549> are<00:03:20.699> very

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
either so all these recipes are very

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.909 
either so all these recipes are very
simple<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.599> takes<00:03:21.840> you<00:03:22.049> maybe<00:03:22.530> five<00:03:22.799> minutes

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
simple it takes you maybe five minutes

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.680 
simple it takes you maybe five minutes
to<00:03:23.190> prepare<00:03:23.310> every<00:03:23.790> single<00:03:24.060> one<00:03:24.209> of<00:03:24.239> them<00:03:24.510> you

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
to prepare every single one of them you

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.899 
to prepare every single one of them you
know<00:03:24.810> whether<00:03:25.019> it's<00:03:25.199> having<00:03:25.889> salad<00:03:26.280> or<00:03:26.699> having

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:26.909 
know whether it's having salad or having

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:31.219 
know whether it's having salad or having
a<00:03:26.940> shake<00:03:27.269> and<00:03:27.599> the<00:03:28.500> key<00:03:28.799> idea<00:03:29.519> here<00:03:29.579> is<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.269> make

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:31.229 
a shake and the key idea here is to make

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:33.439 
a shake and the key idea here is to make
a<00:03:31.290> relatively<00:03:31.889> big<00:03:31.949> volume<00:03:32.459> of<00:03:32.579> it<00:03:32.760> because

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:33.449 
a relatively big volume of it because

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:36.319 
a relatively big volume of it because
when<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:34.049> eat<00:03:34.260> raw<00:03:34.650> you<00:03:35.250> will<00:03:35.430> need<00:03:35.549> to<00:03:35.760> still

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
when you eat raw you will need to still

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.240 
when you eat raw you will need to still
have<00:03:36.569> a<00:03:36.599> certain<00:03:36.930> amount<00:03:36.989> of<00:03:37.290> calories<00:03:38.010> coming

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
have a certain amount of calories coming

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.219 
have a certain amount of calories coming
into<00:03:38.430> your<00:03:38.549> system<00:03:38.909> and<00:03:39.060> you<00:03:39.720> don't<00:03:39.989> want<00:03:40.139> to

start so you will need all that I will
go<00:03:42.989> deeper<00:03:43.440> into<00:03:43.769> these<00:03:43.979> recipes<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:44.639> tell

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760

you a little bit more about them in

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.750 
you a little bit more about them in
another<00:03:46.109> video<00:03:46.290> but<00:03:46.620> that's<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.430> first<00:03:47.669> step

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
another video but that's the first step

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
another key strategies to think long

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.320 
another key strategies to think long
term<00:04:34.680> okay<00:04:35.680> you<00:04:36.220> don't<00:04:36.430> want<00:04:36.610> just<00:04:36.850> to<00:04:37.060> start

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
term okay you don't want just to start

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.180 
term okay you don't want just to start
applying<00:04:37.630> something<00:04:38.200> which<00:04:38.590> is<00:04:38.770> based<00:04:39.010> on

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
applying something which is based on

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.310 
applying something which is based on
restricting<00:04:40.000> your<00:04:40.180> diet<00:04:40.450> you<00:04:40.750> don't<00:04:40.930> want<00:04:41.140> to

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
restricting your diet you don't want to

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.740 
restricting your diet you don't want to
use<00:04:41.680> restrictive<00:04:42.640> techniques<00:04:43.090> you<00:04:43.300> want<00:04:43.540> to

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
use restrictive techniques you want to

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.130 
use restrictive techniques you want to
go<00:04:44.320> for<00:04:44.530> positive<00:04:45.040> choices<00:04:45.490> and<00:04:45.940> to<00:04:46.720> do<00:04:46.960> that

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
go for positive choices and to do that

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.830 
go for positive choices and to do that
again<00:04:47.650> you<00:04:48.100> think<00:04:48.400> long<00:04:48.640> term<00:04:48.670> what<00:04:49.390> are<00:04:49.600> the

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
again you think long term what are the

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.860

diet<00:04:50.200> shifts<00:04:50.830> that<00:04:51.370> you<00:04:51.670> can<00:04:51.880> make<00:04:52.120> easily

which you can maintain on read it on the

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
long term the kind of you know recipes

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.050 
long term the kind of you know recipes

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
i had to learn and to learn it you

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.040 
i had to learn and to learn it you
actually<00:05:23.110> you<00:05:24.070> know<00:05:24.220> integrate<00:05:24.700> these<00:05:25.660> little

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
actually you know integrate these little

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.710 
actually you know integrate these little
steps<00:05:26.320> one<00:05:27.130> step<00:05:27.160> at<00:05:27.430> a<00:05:27.520> time<00:05:27.550> another<00:05:28.450> thing

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
steps one step at a time another thing

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.090 
steps one step at a time another thing
that<00:05:28.870> you<00:05:28.900> have<00:05:28.990> to<00:05:29.110> understand<00:05:29.680> it<00:05:29.919> is<00:05:30.070> that

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
that you have to understand it is that

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.430 
that you have to understand it is that
food<00:05:30.790> is<00:05:30.940> emotional<00:05:31.419> and<00:05:31.570> when<00:05:32.110> you<00:05:32.230> start

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
food is emotional and when you start

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.520
