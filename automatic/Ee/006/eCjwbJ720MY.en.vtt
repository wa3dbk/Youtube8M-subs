00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
by so on from the states to try and get

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.919 
by so on from the states to try and get
an<00:00:10.349> idea<00:00:10.710> of<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.400> differences<00:00:11.940> between<00:00:12.150> the

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
an idea of the differences between the

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.029 
an idea of the differences between the
engines<00:00:13.349> in<00:00:13.590> Australia<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:15.350> the<00:00:16.350> engines<00:00:16.740> in

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.100 

as<00:00:28.699> you<00:00:28.939> can<00:00:29.060> tell<00:00:29.590> main<00:00:30.590> difference<00:00:31.009> is<00:00:32.110> baby

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
as you can tell main difference is baby

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:44.760 
as you can tell main difference is baby
is<00:00:33.290> a<00:00:33.320> north-south<00:00:33.680> engine

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.590 

and

00:01:48.220 --> 00:02:08.699 
pump and balancer different features
that<00:01:49.090> I've<00:01:49.240> seen<00:01:49.600> so<00:01:49.929> far<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.420> plenum

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.620 

now

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
now

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.710 
now
on<00:02:11.140> this<00:02:11.380> there's<00:02:12.370> three<00:02:12.790> bolts<00:02:15.420> or<00:02:16.420> nuts

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
on this there's three bolts or nuts

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.140 
on this there's three bolts or nuts
rather<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.760> there<00:02:19.800> one<00:02:20.800> directly<00:02:21.310> below<00:02:21.550> in

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
rather and there one directly below in

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:31.050 
rather and there one directly below in
the<00:02:22.330> center<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:24.310> one<00:02:24.700> on<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:24.970> other<00:02:25.000> side<00:02:30.060> the

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
the center and one on the other side the

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.350 
the center and one on the other side the
throttle<00:02:31.570> body<00:02:31.660> I'm<00:02:32.170> assuming<00:02:32.740> still<00:02:33.160> looks<00:02:34.090> a

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
throttle body I'm assuming still looks a

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:41.030 
throttle body I'm assuming still looks a
slightly<00:02:35.050> different<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:36.850> our<00:02:37.090> cousins<00:02:39.930> and

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
slightly different to our cousins and

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.980 
slightly different to our cousins and
then<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.610> have<00:02:43.770> the<00:02:44.770> exhaust<00:02:45.130> system<00:02:45.990> which

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
then you have the exhaust system which

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.120 
then you have the exhaust system which
goes<00:02:47.350> downwards<00:02:49.230> comes<00:02:50.230> from<00:02:50.590> left<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:51.010> right

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
goes downwards comes from left and right

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.840 
goes downwards comes from left and right
and<00:02:51.520> meets<00:02:52.240> up<00:02:52.450> into<00:02:52.750> one<00:02:53.130> two<00:02:54.130> catalytic

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
and meets up into one two catalytic

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:15.010 
and meets up into one two catalytic
converter

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.180 

now<00:03:16.020> the<00:03:16.830> other<00:03:16.980> difference<00:03:17.550> I<00:03:17.700> have<00:03:17.910> noticed

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
now the other difference I have noticed

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:25.339 
now the other difference I have noticed
on<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:21.230> 89<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.910> 1990<00:03:23.910> model<00:03:24.569> vehicles<00:03:25.170> that

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
on the 89 and 1990 model vehicles that

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.740 
on the 89 and 1990 model vehicles that
we<00:03:25.500> have<00:03:25.530> with<00:03:25.830> this<00:03:25.980> motor<00:03:26.989> the<00:03:27.989> thermostat

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
we have with this motor the thermostat

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.070 
we have with this motor the thermostat
comes<00:03:30.750> from<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.050> rear<00:03:31.260> in<00:03:31.680> here<00:03:33.050> follows<00:03:34.050> a

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
comes from the rear in here follows a

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.509 
comes from the rear in here follows a
stainless<00:03:34.620> steel<00:03:34.830> pipe

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
stainless steel pipe

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.170 
stainless steel pipe
although<00:03:36.000> out<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.360> side<00:03:36.599> and<00:03:37.730> then<00:03:38.730> comes<00:03:39.000> out

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
although out the side and then comes out

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.900 
although out the side and then comes out
too<00:03:39.450> close<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.650> radio

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
too close to the radio

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:51.080 
too close to the radio
however<00:03:44.160> 1991<00:03:45.600> and<00:03:46.600> onwards<00:03:47.170> to<00:03:48.120> this<00:03:49.120> model

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
however 1991 and onwards to this model

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.060 
however 1991 and onwards to this model
thermostat<00:03:52.090> comes<00:03:52.360> out<00:03:52.600> on<00:03:52.840> this<00:03:53.680> side<00:03:53.890> of<00:03:54.010> the

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
thermostat comes out on this side of the

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.230 
thermostat comes out on this side of the
planet

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:10.020 

and<00:03:57.930> follows<00:03:58.410> to<00:03:58.680> write<00:03:59.190> it

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:18.120 

also<00:04:13.299> this<00:04:14.299> is<00:04:14.540> the<00:04:14.569> first<00:04:14.690> model<00:04:15.409> of<00:04:16.269> the<00:04:17.269> VR

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
also this is the first model of the VR

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.320 
also this is the first model of the VR
which<00:04:19.130> didn't<00:04:19.519> come<00:04:19.669> with<00:04:19.880> the<00:04:19.970> cam<00:04:20.180> sensor

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
which didn't come with the cam sensor

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.120 
which didn't come with the cam sensor
however<00:04:23.330> the<00:04:24.080> year<00:04:24.290> later<00:04:24.560> they<00:04:24.889> came<00:04:25.100> out

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
however the year later they came out

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:42.870 
however the year later they came out
with<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.520> cam<00:04:25.699> sensor

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.340 

these<00:04:43.880> ran<00:04:44.180> on<00:04:44.450> an<00:04:45.010> a<00:04:46.010> manifold<00:04:46.640> pressure

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
these ran on an a manifold pressure

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.420 
these ran on an a manifold pressure
sensor<00:04:49.630> which<00:04:50.630> has<00:04:50.930> a<00:04:51.230> line<00:04:51.470> going<00:04:52.070> to<00:04:52.190> the

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
sensor which has a line going to the

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.910 
sensor which has a line going to the
back<00:04:52.640> of<00:04:52.760> the<00:04:52.820> throttle<00:04:53.030> body<00:04:53.240> for<00:04:53.810> the<00:04:54.230> vacuum

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.070 

it<00:04:57.920> has<00:04:58.210> throttle<00:04:59.210> position<00:04:59.300> sensor

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
it has throttle position sensor

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:07.590 
it has throttle position sensor
underneath<00:05:02.530> and<00:05:03.530> over<00:05:04.010> at<00:05:04.280> the<00:05:04.310> back<00:05:06.100> we<00:05:07.100> have

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
underneath and over at the back we have

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:31.750 
underneath and over at the back we have
the<00:05:08.600> cold<00:05:08.810> air<00:05:09.020> idle

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.050 

now

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
now

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.570 
now
my<00:05:34.690> question<00:05:35.140> is

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.840 

what<00:05:39.580> parts<00:05:39.970> can<00:05:40.240> be<00:05:40.270> fitted<00:05:41.730> from

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
what parts can be fitted from

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.770 
what parts can be fitted from
american-based<00:05:43.720> motors<00:05:44.440> to<00:05:45.220> this<00:05:45.670> engine<00:05:46.120> in

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
american-based motors to this engine in

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
american-based motors to this engine in
particular<00:05:48.360> the<00:05:49.360> other<00:05:49.540> question<00:05:49.840> would<00:05:49.990> be
