00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
things at each other and what have you

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.170 
things at each other and what have you
well<00:02:45.650> we<00:02:45.769> would<00:02:45.950> you<00:02:46.250> know<00:02:46.280> you<00:02:46.430> spawn<00:02:46.819> camp

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
well we would you know you spawn camp

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.699 
well we would you know you spawn camp
the<00:02:47.389> enemy<00:02:47.630> by<00:02:47.780> constantly<00:02:48.200> attacking<00:02:48.470> their

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
the enemy by constantly attacking their

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.590 
the enemy by constantly attacking their
base<00:02:48.889> and<00:02:49.190> this<00:02:49.670> was<00:02:49.850> obviously<00:02:49.940> a<00:02:50.209> problem<00:02:50.540> at

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
base and this was obviously a problem at

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.420 
base and this was obviously a problem at
the<00:02:50.690> start<00:02:50.959> so<00:02:51.139> now<00:02:51.260> we<00:02:51.319> have<00:02:51.410> automated<00:02:52.010> guns

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
the start so now we have automated guns

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.309 
the start so now we have automated guns
on<00:02:52.609> top<00:02:52.730> of<00:02:52.819> the<00:02:52.880> command<00:02:53.180> center<00:02:53.389> you<00:02:54.079> can't

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
on top of the command center you can't

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.349 
on top of the command center you can't
target<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.829> base<00:02:54.980> with<00:02:55.220> fire<00:02:55.459> support<00:02:55.880> when

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
target the base with fire support when

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:57.849 
target the base with fire support when
people<00:02:56.630> spawn<00:02:56.959> they're<00:02:57.170> invulnerable<00:02:57.440> for

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
people spawn they're invulnerable for

00:02:57.859 --> 00:02:59.680 
people spawn they're invulnerable for
the<00:02:57.950> first<00:02:58.160> couple<00:02:58.340> of<00:02:58.489> seconds<00:02:58.940> and<00:02:59.090> so<00:02:59.540> we

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
the first couple of seconds and so we

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.330 
the first couple of seconds and so we
put<00:03:00.049> solutions<00:03:00.560> like<00:03:00.739> that<00:03:00.950> in<00:03:01.100> at<00:03:01.220> every

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
put solutions like that in at every

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.800 
put solutions like that in at every
location<00:03:01.609> in<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.090> game<00:03:02.209> where<00:03:02.389> we<00:03:02.480> knew<00:03:02.660> an

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
location in the game where we knew an

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.390 
location in the game where we knew an
exploit<00:03:03.200> was<00:03:03.349> gonna<00:03:03.500> break<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:03.889> game<00:03:04.010> down<00:03:04.250> in

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
exploit was gonna break the game down in

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.099 
exploit was gonna break the game down in
a<00:03:04.459> year<00:03:04.670> or<00:03:04.700> twos<00:03:04.970> time<00:03:05.000> because<00:03:05.930> it<00:03:06.019> would

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
a year or twos time because it would

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:07.390 
a year or twos time because it would
just<00:03:06.230> make<00:03:06.380> it<00:03:06.440> really<00:03:06.560> frustrating<00:03:07.280> for

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
just make it really frustrating for

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.860 
just make it really frustrating for
other<00:03:07.549> players<00:03:07.819> but<00:03:08.209> we've<00:03:08.359> done<00:03:08.389> some<00:03:08.690> really

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
other players but we've done some really

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.110 
other players but we've done some really
clever<00:03:09.079> things<00:03:09.530> that<00:03:09.739> make<00:03:10.130> playing<00:03:10.670> much

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
clever things that make playing much

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.750 
clever things that make playing much
more

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
more

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.670

you<00:03:11.819> can<00:03:12.000> mute<00:03:12.209> any<00:03:12.480> player<00:03:12.840> really<00:03:13.170> quickly

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
you can mute any player really quickly

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.740 
you can mute any player really quickly
for<00:03:13.890> example<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.090> thing<00:03:15.269> is<00:03:15.390> if<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:15.629> have

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
for example so the thing is if you have

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.170 
for example so the thing is if you have
a<00:03:15.780> badly<00:03:16.170> behaved<00:03:16.500> player<00:03:16.860> who's<00:03:17.159> cursing<00:03:17.879> and

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
a badly behaved player who's cursing and

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.809 
a badly behaved player who's cursing and
abusing<00:03:19.049> other<00:03:19.200> players<00:03:19.530> through<00:03:20.159> voice<00:03:20.430> chat

once<00:03:21.450> he's<00:03:21.599> muted<00:03:22.019> he<00:03:22.200> actually<00:03:22.349> becomes<00:03:22.799> a

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
once he's muted he actually becomes a

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.259 
once he's muted he actually becomes a
valuable<00:03:23.189> addition<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.790> game<00:03:23.939> because

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
valuable addition to the game because

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.300 
valuable addition to the game because
