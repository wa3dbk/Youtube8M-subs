00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
perform last season Rochelle they won

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.390 
perform last season Rochelle they won
almost<00:01:44.930> everything<00:01:45.470> that<00:01:45.590> was<00:01:45.710> on<00:01:45.830> offer<00:01:45.950> the

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
almost everything that was on offer the

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.700 
almost everything that was on offer the
only<00:01:46.670> format<00:01:47.030> that<00:01:47.300> didn't<00:01:47.660> win<00:01:47.780> was<00:01:48.140> g20<00:01:48.620> and

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
only format that didn't win was g20 and

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.900 
only format that didn't win was g20 and
that<00:01:48.830> that's<00:01:49.040> why<00:01:49.160> this<00:01:49.220> is<00:01:49.460> an<00:01:49.550> ideal

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
that that's why this is an ideal

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.000 
that that's why this is an ideal
platform<00:01:50.120> where<00:01:50.960> players<00:01:51.290> all<00:01:51.590> across<00:01:51.890> the

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
platform where players all across the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.530 
platform where players all across the
street<00:01:52.250> can<00:01:52.460> come<00:01:52.640> showcase<00:01:53.030> their<00:01:53.210> talent

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
street can come showcase their talent

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.450 
street can come showcase their talent
and<00:01:53.660> then<00:01:54.200> probably<00:01:54.680> get<00:01:54.920> into<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.220> canonical

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
and then probably get into the canonical

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.830 
and then probably get into the canonical
side<00:01:55.790> because<00:01:56.060> this<00:01:56.180> is<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.360> format<00:01:56.690> that

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
side because this is the format that

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.090 
side because this is the format that
they<00:01:56.990> really<00:01:57.290> need<00:01:57.440> to<00:01:57.470> work<00:01:57.590> on<00:01:57.860> otherwise

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
they really need to work on otherwise

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.190 
they really need to work on otherwise
all<00:01:58.610> at<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:58.970> other<00:01:59.120> formats<00:01:59.510> they<00:02:00.140> were

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
all at the other formats they were

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.530 
all at the other formats they were
number<00:02:00.470> one<00:02:00.650> yes<00:02:01.430> that's<00:02:01.729> true<00:02:01.880> it<00:02:02.030> seems<00:02:02.300> like

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
number one yes that's true it seems like

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.820

level<00:02:34.190> all<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.400> other<00:02:34.640> because<00:02:34.880> I<00:02:34.910> heard<00:02:35.180> the

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
level all the other because I heard the

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.330

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
and I'm sure most of the others would

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.820 
and I'm sure most of the others would
have<00:02:40.489> done<00:02:40.730> that<00:02:40.910> but<00:02:41.480> like<00:02:41.660> I<00:02:41.780> said<00:02:41.840> competing
