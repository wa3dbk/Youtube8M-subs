time telling I don't appear to be

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.499 
time telling I don't appear to be
compound<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.490> they<00:01:29.579> just<00:01:29.759> don't<00:01:29.939> look<00:01:30.150> as<00:01:30.299> good

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
it's like the figure version so let's go

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.490 
it's like the figure version so let's go
ahead<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.640> set<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:35.850> down<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:37.079> we'll<00:01:37.320> take<00:01:37.470> a

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
ahead and set that down and we'll take a

this actually moves up a little bit too
a<00:02:37.370> lot<00:02:37.519> of<00:02:37.610> movement<00:02:37.910> so<00:02:38.030> you're<00:02:38.180> really<00:02:38.330> not

hindered it all in that department

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.640 
hindered it all in that department
it<00:02:40.640> gets<00:02:40.819> swiveling<00:02:41.209> here<00:02:41.599> double<00:02:42.319> elbow

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
it gets swiveling here double elbow

joint here swiveling at his fist

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.699 
joint here swiveling at his fist
obviously<00:02:44.930> you're<00:02:45.140> able<00:02:45.319> to<00:02:45.349> switch<00:02:45.530> them<00:02:45.650> out

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
obviously you're able to switch them out

swiveling get a double knee joint there
and<00:03:00.069> then<00:03:01.069> I<00:03:01.099> suppose<00:03:01.730> kind<00:03:01.940> of<00:03:02.000> on<00:03:02.120> like<00:03:02.269> a

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
and then I suppose kind of on like a

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.800 
and then I suppose kind of on like a
little<00:03:03.310> hinge<00:03:04.310> type<00:03:04.670> joint<00:03:05.150> here<00:03:05.390> so<00:03:05.599> he<00:03:05.690> can

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
little hinge type joint here so he can

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.170 
little hinge type joint here so he can
move<00:03:05.959> forward<00:03:06.380> and<00:03:06.560> back<00:03:07.099> a<00:03:07.130> little<00:03:07.370> bit<00:03:07.640> not

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
move forward and back a little bit not

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.240 
move forward and back a little bit not
very<00:03:08.360> much<00:03:08.540> side<00:03:08.780> to<00:03:08.900> side<00:03:09.110> but<00:03:09.739> still<00:03:09.920> all<00:03:10.220> in

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
very much side to side but still all in

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.020 
very much side to side but still all in
all<00:03:10.489> very<00:03:10.519> well<00:03:11.060> articulated<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:13.790> one<00:03:13.880> other

all very well articulated and one other

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.280 
all very well articulated and one other
thing<00:03:14.180> of<00:03:14.299> note<00:03:14.329> before<00:03:14.750> I<00:03:14.780> quickly<00:03:15.019> switch

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
thing of note before I quickly switch

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.750 
thing of note before I quickly switch
out<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.590> heads<00:03:15.769> is<00:03:15.980> that<00:03:16.160> it<00:03:16.280> comes<00:03:16.489> with<00:03:16.640> this

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
out the heads is that it comes with this

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.839 
out the heads is that it comes with this
little<00:03:17.090> piece<00:03:17.299> back<00:03:17.599> here<00:03:17.980> which<00:03:18.980> it's<00:03:19.489> just

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
little piece back here which it's just

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.300 
little piece back here which it's just
in<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.120> box<00:03:20.299> and<00:03:20.540> you<00:03:20.629> plug<00:03:20.810> it<00:03:20.870> in<00:03:21.079> I'm<00:03:21.590> gonna

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
in the box and you plug it in I'm gonna

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.309 
in the box and you plug it in I'm gonna
assume<00:03:22.700> it's<00:03:22.940> for<00:03:23.090> like<00:03:23.269> Tom<00:03:23.599> she<00:03:23.780> stages<00:03:23.989> or

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
assume it's for like Tom she stages or

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.479 
assume it's for like Tom she stages or
something<00:03:24.590> if<00:03:24.680> it's<00:03:24.799> for<00:03:24.950> something<00:03:25.099> else<00:03:25.310> let

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
something if it's for something else let

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.400 
something if it's for something else let
me<00:03:25.519> know<00:03:25.610> just<00:03:25.760> cuz<00:03:26.120> I<00:03:26.150> don't<00:03:26.299> know<00:03:26.480> I<00:03:26.720> just<00:03:27.260> put

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
me know just cuz I don't know I just put

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.449 
me know just cuz I don't know I just put
it<00:03:27.500> in<00:03:27.590> there<00:03:27.709> cuz<00:03:27.890> it<00:03:28.010> was<00:03:28.129> just<00:03:28.250> a<00:03:28.310> random

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
it in there cuz it was just a random

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.720 
it in there cuz it was just a random
square<00:03:28.940> piece<00:03:29.180> that<00:03:29.390> was<00:03:29.510> just<00:03:29.750> there<00:03:30.730> so

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
square piece that was just there so

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.160 
square piece that was just there so
switching<00:03:32.090> out<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.299> heads<00:03:32.450> pretty<00:03:32.629> simple<00:03:33.049> it

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
switching out the heads pretty simple it

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.099 
switching out the heads pretty simple it
actually<00:03:33.440> comes<00:03:33.620> off<00:03:33.739> fairly<00:03:34.130> easily<00:03:34.400> and

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
actually comes off fairly easily and

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.710 
actually comes off fairly easily and
then<00:03:36.109> you<00:03:36.260> just<00:03:37.120> place<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.239> other<00:03:38.359> head<00:03:38.540> back

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
then you just place the other head back

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.690 
then you just place the other head back
on<00:03:38.900> there<00:03:39.109> you<00:03:39.230> can<00:03:39.350> see<00:03:39.560> I<00:03:39.739> always<00:03:40.400> did<00:03:40.579> like

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
on there you can see I always did like

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.129 
on there you can see I always did like
the<00:03:40.850> dark<00:03:41.060> eyes<00:03:41.209> formal<00:03:41.540> thing<00:03:41.750> looks<00:03:41.930> pretty

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
the dark eyes formal thing looks pretty

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.559 
the dark eyes formal thing looks pretty
cool<00:03:42.350> and<00:03:42.620> it<00:03:42.709> does<00:03:42.859> look<00:03:43.040> good<00:03:43.220> here<00:03:43.579> but<00:03:44.389> for

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
cool and it does look good here but for

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.539 
cool and it does look good here but for
some<00:03:44.750> reason<00:03:45.109> I<00:03:45.200> just<00:03:45.380> prefer<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:46.340> way<00:03:46.430> the

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
some reason I just prefer the way the

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:47.949 
some reason I just prefer the way the
figure<00:03:46.760> it's<00:03:46.910> version<00:03:47.180> compound<00:03:47.540> eyes<00:03:47.660> look

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
figure it's version compound eyes look

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.080 
figure it's version compound eyes look
maybe<00:03:48.530> it<00:03:48.709> just<00:03:48.889> pops<00:03:49.280> out<00:03:49.459> more<00:03:49.700> because<00:03:50.000> the

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
maybe it just pops out more because the

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.729 
maybe it just pops out more because the
eyes<00:03:50.239> are<00:03:50.269> bigger<00:03:50.660> being<00:03:51.049> a<00:03:51.109> bigger<00:03:51.319> finger

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
eyes are bigger being a bigger finger

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.250 
eyes are bigger being a bigger finger
but<00:03:52.549> on<00:03:52.970> this<00:03:53.120> one<00:03:53.299> for<00:03:53.420> some<00:03:53.660> reason<00:03:53.690> I<00:03:54.049> just

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
but on this one for some reason I just

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.430 
but on this one for some reason I just
prefer<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:55.040> red<00:03:55.190> eyes<00:03:55.510> red<00:03:56.510> eyes<00:03:56.720> red<00:03:57.200> eyes

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
prefer the red eyes red eyes red eyes

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.970 
prefer the red eyes red eyes red eyes
red<00:03:57.859> eyes<00:03:59.440> see<00:04:00.440> if<00:04:00.500> you<00:04:00.590> know<00:04:00.680> what<00:04:00.829> that's

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
red eyes see if you know what that's

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.970 
red eyes see if you know what that's
from<00:04:01.190> that<00:04:01.849> was<00:04:01.940> an<00:04:02.030> obscure<00:04:02.359> reference<00:04:02.980> but

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
from that was an obscure reference but

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.129 
from that was an obscure reference but
so<00:04:04.130> yeah<00:04:04.250> that's<00:04:04.519> pretty<00:04:05.180> much<00:04:05.299> about<00:04:05.569> it<00:04:05.930> it's

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.139 
so yeah that's pretty much about it it's

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:08.020 
so yeah that's pretty much about it it's
really<00:04:06.230> nice<00:04:06.470> really<00:04:07.010> nice<00:04:07.250> I<00:04:07.459> was<00:04:07.790> going<00:04:07.940> off

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
really nice really nice I was going off

really nice really nice I was going off
on<00:04:08.090> a<00:04:08.180> total<00:04:08.419> different<00:04:08.660> scent<00:04:08.900> thought<00:04:09.079> I<00:04:09.139> was

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
on a total different scent thought I was

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.809 
on a total different scent thought I was
going<00:04:09.380> to<00:04:09.470> say<00:04:09.620> it's<00:04:10.220> nice<00:04:10.340> that<00:04:10.579> the<00:04:10.700> head

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
going to say it's nice that the head

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.550 
going to say it's nice that the head
joint<00:04:11.030> is<00:04:11.209> fairly<00:04:11.780> easy<00:04:11.870> to<00:04:12.200> switch<00:04:12.380> out

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
joint is fairly easy to switch out

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.860 
joint is fairly easy to switch out
considering<00:04:13.400> what<00:04:13.549> a<00:04:13.579> pain<00:04:13.819> the<00:04:14.060> like<00:04:14.569> Figgy

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
considering what a pain the like Figgy

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.120 
considering what a pain the like Figgy
arts<00:04:15.079> joints<00:04:15.530> can<00:04:15.650> be<00:04:15.739> to<00:04:15.829> switch<00:04:15.889> out

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
arts joints can be to switch out

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.400 
arts joints can be to switch out
sometimes<00:04:16.579> when<00:04:17.209> you<00:04:17.299> get<00:04:17.510> a<00:04:17.539> certain<00:04:18.079> figure

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
sometimes when you get a certain figure

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.620 
sometimes when you get a certain figure
that<00:04:18.620> will<00:04:18.769> have<00:04:18.950> that<00:04:19.150> but<00:04:20.150> overall<00:04:20.419> I<00:04:20.539> am

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
that will have that but overall I am

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.300 
that will have that but overall I am
very<00:04:20.720> pleased<00:04:21.169> with<00:04:21.289> this<00:04:21.410> figure<00:04:21.739> I<00:04:21.919> really

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
very pleased with this figure I really

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.279 
very pleased with this figure I really
like<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.669> design<00:04:22.820> choices<00:04:23.630> they<00:04:23.870> took<00:04:24.020> for

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:24.289 
like the design choices they took for

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:26.320 
like the design choices they took for
him<00:04:24.470> I<00:04:24.650> think<00:04:25.099> that<00:04:25.370> all<00:04:25.610> the<00:04:25.789> details<00:04:26.120> look

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
him I think that all the details look

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.420 
him I think that all the details look
really<00:04:26.599> nice<00:04:26.750> the<00:04:27.110> the<00:04:27.740> articulation<00:04:28.310> is

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
really nice the the articulation is

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.190 
really nice the the articulation is
really<00:04:28.639> good<00:04:28.760> as<00:04:28.880> always<00:04:29.210> as<00:04:29.419> always<00:04:29.750> hired<00:04:30.050> me

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
to stutter there and no real loose

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.810 
to stutter there and no real loose
joints<00:04:32.570> to<00:04:32.690> speak<00:04:32.900> of<00:04:33.110> I<00:04:33.950> know<00:04:34.280> I<00:04:34.370> say<00:04:34.580> this<00:04:34.700> in
