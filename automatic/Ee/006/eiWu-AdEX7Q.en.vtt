00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.560
 workouts 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.830
 as promised first of all for what 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.150
 need a training program for example you 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.040
 start training 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.599
 you start to train by the eye as 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.699
 it says that you do one 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.390
 workout on monday then you 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.490
 I think that's damn what I have training 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.769
 on Wednesday 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.380
 here comes Wednesday and you start 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:33.030
 otmazyvatsya room to himself in 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.880
 everyone it was and you say well now 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.070
 morning how are you i need to go to work in 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.510
 school at university or just now 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.700
 Now you do not want in the morning, you must first 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.829
 get up wake up go eat and so 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.719
 further and you say a new coat of arms 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.449
 train in two hours or 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.600
 I will practice in the evening a year passes two 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.030
 hours and would imagine excuse yourself again but 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.800
 I really want to eat now or here 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.230
 now there is one very interesting film 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.270
 I'll watch it and start right away. 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.479
 train first with motivated and 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.900
 then I will begin to train you looked 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.600
 the movie you eat and you want 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.580
 train but what it says but 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.530
 Now I want to first go to bed 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.229
 rest a little bit because after 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.979
 the movie is a little tired after 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.380
 ate also need to rest so that the food 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.320
 digested and so on one passes 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.590
 a day so two days pass a month passes 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.170
 and you do nothing or even if you 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.570
 start then also with these from masks you 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.970
 train maximum I know for myself 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.580
 because I'm with a training program 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.480
 started 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.400
 train for about four months or 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.160
 five back before this I also trained 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.560
 on my eyes, the results were but not 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:56.090
 the best are my results right now 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.970
 like and so you have 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.550
 practiced and 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.150
 maximum you train without a program 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.640
 workouts 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.010
 the maximum that you will do it 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.520
 train once a week 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.830
 because especially in summer or especially 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.080
 before summer you don't even notice how 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.240
 the days pass you do n't always 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.220
 will think about training you now 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.990
 you can say that to me too 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.150
 training program is not necessary and so 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.230
 further because everyone is too lazy to write 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.990
 training program 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.730
 you can write it in just 5 minutes 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:33.740
 for two or three months ahead for example 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.430
 how to write a training program 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.260
 very very simple you just write well 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.100
 if you workout three times a week 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:47.000
 house write out these days where there for example 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:49.580
 April 7, April 9 , April 11, and so on 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.750
 two months ahead, that is, write yes 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.670
 you get 30 days in a day and 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.510
 write down before each date you write 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.519
 what is your 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.489
 training for example if you have today 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.980
 there were large muscles with triceps up 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:08.030
 next time you will have legs for example 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.010
 with press or shoulders and and so on then 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.040
 there you make a program 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.220
 workouts on dates and all you take this 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.450
 a piece of paper and put for example 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.170
 attached to simbu 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.569
 next to the computer 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.819
 how my age depends now 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.410
 constantly when i wake up in the morning i 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.709
 I look at my training today 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.090
 if there is no training that is great if there is 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.020
 then I train and that's it 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.150
 but of course there are still nuances that is you 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.280
 must have that will power you must 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.650
 develop willpower because 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.340
 every person can have it 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.350
 says that 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.910
 but I don't have the willpower to 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.130
 start exercising and so on she 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:51.569
 have each they just need to develop 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.280
 and and need to give you need to give strongly 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.410
 motivation to do it 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.970
 because without motivation you can 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.560
 be what is the coolest willpower in the world 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.390
 will not do anything new 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.209
 because you won't need it 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.160
 so you must first yourself 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.190
 motivate to start 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.989
 train if you already have 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.030
 motivation is great you can make 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.070
 yourself a workout program and start 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.079
