00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.269
 the side opposite to the bunds the director 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.599
 also highlights that we are here today is a project 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:13.730
 it's a family 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.730
 the young couple suffering a lot for their lost lives 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.609
 this is a project but every night so far 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.679
 interesting because we have here 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.789
 From there we have a duplex right now, we have a balcony and the 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.929
 People are 30 there. 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.120
 an extremely expensive space 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.480
 Do you already start selling that material mix 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.060
 of mind 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.670
 Roman travertine 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.670
 the lacquered wood 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.070
 and today just 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.520
 that actually it ended up being comarhp is a column that has the screen was 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.920
 disguised and used 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.540
 with these wicks 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.600
 to make the accommodation to give if we have the necessary width through 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.150
 given these we made the size we wish there were month 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.600
 on the other side of where you actually 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.390
 we like the bar 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.390
 and all is continuing 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.680
 to the bottom was invested in the slope beans and love between the third 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.240
 rustic wood solid wood 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.450
 other than the bad guys 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.450
 those who he said are not tall who are not 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.850
 do not want to take the ci in ten pages that they try to accommodate 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.200
 your guests will also treat you at the time you want 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.620
 and makes this partnership with the dining room and get married 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.130
 team that gets the same time giving a feeling of amplitude and in that environment 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.470
 on the side of home are saying 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.770
 we found again arrested 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.600
 this fact must be repeated in the house 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.179
 and this movable ceiling 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.560
 under the stairs taking advantage of this space 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.570
 this new map was used by the tremor caused 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.160
 ing was found to be some law materials as well which remains 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.740
 a sport mixing piece that gave a good bond 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.289
 we have a beard 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:18.129
 he used 15 coconut matches to work this feat you are at 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.609
 sale on the radio website 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:21.959
 national product 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.379
 and he is 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.840
 the opening of the webjet fleet summit the world if it is for real 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.029
 this gateway 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:35.739
 which was also worked with beans 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.040
 the Portuguese tennis player worked the project also of the office agent work 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.639
 with love and participate 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.649
 with teeth found 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:47.339
 so you work the same way will achieve different effect depending 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:50.629
 of how you work at 67 in war 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:55.189
 and is the same as not closing a sliding door that gives access to the TV room and the 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:55.710
 radio 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.710
 the pathetic shoe see 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.590
 How come we worked on another insane war? 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.049
 in the truth yesterday 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.569
 This was another 120 days. You can see that the doors were 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.220
 worked with woods 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.189
 blows 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.059
 and re-elected 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:20.450
 I think you can understand 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.040
 is the way we think it was included in the darkest wood thin 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.919
 very beautiful 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.919
 work with carpentry 

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:35.539
 not everyone is manufactured 

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:38.539
 for many not everyone knows is that what we need 

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:43.289
 I really like to create. I like to draw the things I do above. 

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:44.809
 of each client the password 

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:48.479
 It's very funny at the professional meeting that can bring my 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:49.839
 project 

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:53.659
 You just invented one of my projects, project writer, executor. 

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:56.039
 in that last year 

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.979
 I hope you enjoyed
