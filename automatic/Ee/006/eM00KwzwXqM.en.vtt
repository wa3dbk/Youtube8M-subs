and<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.480> gumming<00:02:38.750> I'm<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:38.900> Jew<00:02:39.170> so<00:02:39.950> this<00:02:40.190> is<00:02:40.430> a

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
and the gumming I'm a Jew so this is a

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.240 
and the gumming I'm a Jew so this is a
really<00:02:41.330> nice<00:02:41.480> weapon<00:02:41.990> in<00:02:42.470> my<00:02:42.709> opinion<00:02:43.130> it

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
really nice weapon in my opinion it

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.980 
really nice weapon in my opinion it
feels<00:02:43.550> nice<00:02:43.790> it's<00:02:44.000> like<00:02:44.030> a<00:02:44.120> small<00:02:44.540> sort<00:02:44.930> of

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
feels nice it's like a small sort of

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.680 
feels nice it's like a small sort of
handgun<00:02:45.560> sort<00:02:46.340> of<00:02:46.459> feel<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.910> it

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
handgun sort of feel to it

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.210 
handgun sort of feel to it
but<00:02:48.050> the<00:02:48.170> way<00:02:48.290> it's<00:02:48.440> designed<00:02:48.620> just<00:02:49.040> kind<00:02:49.190> of

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
but the way it's designed just kind of

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.080 
but the way it's designed just kind of
feels<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.550> little<00:02:49.640> bit<00:02:49.790> more<00:02:49.940> like<00:02:50.060> a

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
feels a little bit more like a

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.449 
feels a little bit more like a
futuristic<00:02:50.630> laser<00:02:51.020> gun<00:02:51.739> or<00:02:51.920> something<00:02:52.220> like

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
futuristic laser gun or something like

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.210 
futuristic laser gun or something like
that<00:02:52.700> and<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.810> Frog<00:02:54.050> design<00:02:54.380> is<00:02:54.620> just<00:02:54.650> so

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
can attach you can't close it back up

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.570 
can attach you can't close it back up
it's<00:04:46.440> all<00:04:46.620> spring-loaded<00:04:47.220> so<00:04:47.490> it

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
it's all spring-loaded so it

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.670 
it's all spring-loaded so it
automatically<00:04:48.060> is<00:04:48.270> out<00:04:48.480> but<00:04:49.050> you<00:04:49.169> can't<00:04:49.440> fire

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
automatically is out but you can't fire

00:04:49.680 --> 00:05:01.850 
automatically is out but you can't fire
multiple<00:04:49.950> times<00:05:00.169> so<00:05:01.169> that<00:05:01.260> is<00:05:01.410> a<00:05:01.440> little<00:05:01.680> bit

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
multiple times so that is a little bit

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.560 
multiple times so that is a little bit
of<00:05:01.919> a<00:05:02.010> bummer<00:05:02.190> and<00:05:02.460> it<00:05:02.790> doesn't<00:05:03.120> matter<00:05:03.240> what

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
of a bummer and it doesn't matter what

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
a little bit of a hassle because it's

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.920
