00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
because I wanted a shorter so I can get

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.880 
because I wanted a shorter so I can get
more<00:01:16.609> mobility<00:01:16.789> in<00:01:17.119> my<00:01:17.149> arm<00:01:17.420> twist<00:01:17.929> my<00:01:18.140> my

trying<00:02:12.740> to<00:02:12.770> make<00:02:12.920> an<00:02:13.070> automatic<00:02:13.760> I<00:02:13.850> eventually

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
trying to make an automatic I eventually

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.730 
trying to make an automatic I eventually
regressed<00:02:14.690> into<00:02:14.930> it's<00:02:15.260> just<00:02:15.380> a<00:02:15.470> simple

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
regressed into it's just a simple

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.520 
regressed into it's just a simple
gravity<00:02:15.950> this<00:02:16.850> is<00:02:16.970> just<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.180> cover<00:02:17.410> you<00:02:18.410> know

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
gravity this is just the cover you know

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.950 
gravity this is just the cover you know
this<00:02:19.010> just<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.850> cover<00:02:20.060> up<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:20.330> rest<00:02:20.480> of<00:02:20.570> this<00:02:20.720> I

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
this just to cover up the rest of this I

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.080 
this just to cover up the rest of this I
used<00:02:21.920> red<00:02:22.100> centre<00:02:22.520> up<00:02:22.610> because<00:02:22.880> I'm<00:02:22.970> getting

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
used red centre up because I'm getting

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.510 
used red centre up because I'm getting
tired<00:02:23.240> of<00:02:23.330> using<00:02:23.480> white<00:02:23.810> that's<00:02:24.590> a<00:02:24.680> little<00:02:24.860> neo

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
tired of using white that's a little neo

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.370 
tired of using white that's a little neo
midium<00:02:25.910> magnet<00:02:26.630> now<00:02:26.810> if<00:02:26.960> I'm<00:02:27.110> saying<00:02:27.260> the

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
midium magnet now if I'm saying the

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.410 
midium magnet now if I'm saying the

right Nimmo diem neo midium something

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.830 
right Nimmo diem neo midium something
like<00:02:29.510> that

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
like that

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.240 
like that
you<00:02:30.140> know<00:02:30.260> really<00:02:30.560> strong<00:02:30.800> man<00:02:31.010> it<00:02:31.130> really

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
you know really strong man it really

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.580 
you know really strong man it really
small<00:02:31.640> guy<00:02:31.850> and<00:02:32.810> there's<00:02:32.990> nother<00:02:33.170> one<00:02:33.380> at<00:02:33.470> the

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
small guy and there's nother one at the

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.670 
small guy and there's nother one at the
blade<00:02:33.830> basically<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:35.030> holds<00:02:35.300> on<00:02:35.440> just<00:02:36.440> enough

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
blade basically it holds on just enough

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.260 
blade basically it holds on just enough
cuz<00:02:37.250> I've<00:02:37.370> got<00:02:37.520> spaced<00:02:37.820> out<00:02:37.940> so<00:02:38.120> they're<00:02:38.240> not

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
cuz I've got spaced out so they're not

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.150 
cuz I've got spaced out so they're not
touching<00:02:38.470> I've<00:02:39.470> got<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.650> wholeness<00:02:39.800> or<00:02:40.070> it

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
touching I've got a wholeness or it

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.490 
touching I've got a wholeness or it
holds<00:02:40.520> for<00:02:41.390> anything<00:02:41.630> but<00:02:41.870> you<00:02:41.990> pick<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:42.380> out

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
holds for anything but you pick it out

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.900 
holds for anything but you pick it out
it'll<00:02:42.830> come<00:02:43.040> out<00:02:43.190> really<00:02:43.670> really<00:02:44.180> cool<00:02:45.170> um<00:02:45.950> to

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
it'll come out really really cool um to

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.560 
it'll come out really really cool um to
get<00:02:47.000> it<00:02:47.150> out<00:02:47.270> you<00:02:47.660> got<00:02:47.810> kind<00:02:48.050> of<00:02:48.080> efficient

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
get it out you got kind of efficient

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.740 
get it out you got kind of efficient
meaning<00:02:50.570> you<00:02:51.230> just<00:02:51.310> lift<00:02:52.310> this<00:02:52.490> up<00:02:52.550> and<00:02:53.540> grab

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
meaning you just lift this up and grab

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.560 
meaning you just lift this up and grab
again<00:02:54.400> fighting<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.640> strength<00:02:55.940> of<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.150> Magnus

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
again fighting the strength of a Magnus

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.730 
again fighting the strength of a Magnus
to<00:02:56.720> get<00:02:56.840> it<00:02:56.960> out<00:02:58.300> alright<00:02:59.300> slides<00:03:00.230> out<00:03:00.500> this<00:03:00.620> is

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
to get it out alright slides out this is

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.380 
to get it out alright slides out this is
probably<00:03:00.950> one<00:03:01.070> of<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.190> best<00:03:01.400> hidden<00:03:02.120> blades

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
probably one of the best hidden blades

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.470 
probably one of the best hidden blades
I've<00:03:02.570> made<00:03:06.730> basically<00:03:07.730> I've<00:03:07.970> need<00:03:08.209> to<00:03:08.300> paint

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
I've made basically I've need to paint

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.850 
I've made basically I've need to paint
that<00:03:08.660> again<00:03:08.900> I<00:03:08.930> was<00:03:09.110> just<00:03:09.140> making<00:03:09.500> cells<00:03:09.680> run

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
that again I was just making cells run

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.680 
that again I was just making cells run
doing<00:03:10.100> trial<00:03:10.370> runs<00:03:12.910> really<00:03:13.910> I<00:03:14.270> think<00:03:14.570> it's

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
doing trial runs really I think it's

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.470 
doing trial runs really I think it's
sexy<00:03:14.900> as<00:03:15.080> hell

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
sexy as hell

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.979 
sexy as hell
um<00:03:18.130> no<00:03:19.130> my<00:03:19.310> girlfriend<00:03:19.700> isn't<00:03:19.820> right<00:03:20.510> here

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.260 

once<00:03:23.989> again<00:03:24.260> I<00:03:24.290> used<00:03:24.590> that<00:03:24.739> fine<00:03:24.980> tip<00:03:25.220> pen<00:03:25.489> so

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
once again I used that fine tip pen so

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.750 
once again I used that fine tip pen so
that<00:03:26.300> highlighter<00:03:27.050> for<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.500> accents<00:03:28.040> accents

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
that highlighter for the accents accents

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.990 
that highlighter for the accents accents
make<00:03:29.000> sense<00:03:30.100> just<00:03:31.100> to<00:03:31.250> give<00:03:31.400> that<00:03:31.610> you<00:03:31.940> know

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
make sense just to give that you know

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.760 
make sense just to give that you know
angle<00:03:32.510> look<00:03:32.989> that<00:03:33.170> it's<00:03:33.290> got<00:03:33.440> in<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.590> game

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
angle look that it's got in the game

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.550 
angle look that it's got in the game
this<00:03:34.640> is<00:03:34.820> all<00:03:34.940> just<00:03:35.180> gravity<00:03:35.540> held<00:03:35.780> flip<00:03:36.440> this

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
this is all just gravity held flip this

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.180 
this is all just gravity held flip this
up<00:03:36.770> a<00:03:36.800> little<00:03:37.010> more<00:03:38.470> basically<00:03:39.470> just<00:03:40.010> shoots

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
up a little more basically just shoots

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.680 
up a little more basically just shoots
out<00:03:40.310> just<00:03:40.610> through<00:03:40.760> gravity<00:03:44.770> very<00:03:45.770> simple<00:03:46.130> um

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
out just through gravity very simple um
