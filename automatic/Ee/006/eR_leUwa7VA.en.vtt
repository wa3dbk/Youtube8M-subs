well as connected it to the present so

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.120 
well as connected it to the present so
things<00:01:05.550> that<00:01:05.729> were<00:01:05.850> going<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.750> world

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
things that were going on in the world

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.450 
things that were going on in the world
in<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:09.049> 1960s<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.710> was<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> very<00:01:11.100> exciting

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
in the 1960s and it was a very exciting

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.450 
in the 1960s and it was a very exciting
time<00:01:11.930> he<00:01:12.930> would<00:01:13.110> make<00:01:13.290> parallels<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.250> things

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
time he would make parallels to things

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.540 
time he would make parallels to things
that<00:01:14.550> have<00:01:14.760> happened<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.480> history<00:01:16.160> and<00:01:17.160> that

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
that have happened in history and that

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.330 
that have happened in history and that
connection<00:01:18.270> was<00:01:18.870> a<00:01:18.900> powerful<00:01:19.560> one<00:01:19.710> for<00:01:19.980> me<00:01:20.130> and

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
connection was a powerful one for me and

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.780 
connection was a powerful one for me and
I<00:01:21.300> think<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:22.020> not<00:01:22.320> only<00:01:22.380> opened<00:01:23.370> my<00:01:23.490> eyes<00:01:23.760> to

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
I think it it not only opened my eyes to

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.490 
I think it it not only opened my eyes to
a<00:01:24.150> broader<00:01:24.510> view<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:26.240> not<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:27.570> Pennsylvania
