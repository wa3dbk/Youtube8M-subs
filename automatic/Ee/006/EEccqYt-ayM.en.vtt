00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
of you guys yeah it's a good point

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.649 
of you guys yeah it's a good point
actually<00:01:07.500> yeah<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.220> staying<00:01:09.060> also<00:01:09.420> staying

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
actually yeah and staying also staying

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.390 
actually yeah and staying also staying
true<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.500> it's<00:01:10.590> very<00:01:10.799> old-fashioned

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
true to that and it's very old-fashioned

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.120 
true to that and it's very old-fashioned
notion<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.790> we<00:01:11.909> have<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.320> 22<00:01:13.320> leads<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.950> we

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
notion that we have the 22 leads that we

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.330 
notion that we have the 22 leads that we
know<00:01:14.280> should<00:01:14.700> be<00:01:14.880> together<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.979> we<00:01:16.979> may<00:01:17.159> not

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
know should be together and we may not

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.640 
know should be together and we may not
necessarily<00:01:17.430> see<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.390> see<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.840> happen<00:01:19.380> so

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
necessarily see that see that happen so

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.530 
necessarily see that see that happen so
I<00:01:19.680> think<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.189> old-fashioned<00:01:21.180> notion<00:01:21.479> of

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
I think the old-fashioned notion of

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.050 
I think the old-fashioned notion of
unrequited<00:01:21.930> love<00:01:22.350> or<00:01:22.970> something<00:01:23.970> that's

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
unrequited love or something that's

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.120 
unrequited love or something that's
broken<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.720> should<00:01:24.990> be<00:01:25.140> fixed<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.710> was<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.040> it

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
broken that should be fixed it was in it

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.280 
broken that should be fixed it was in it
was<00:01:26.430> fun<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.670> play<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.689> was<00:01:27.780> great<00:01:28.020> working

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
hopefully it's a it helps contribute to

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.030 
hopefully it's a it helps contribute to
the<00:01:54.899> dialogue<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.590> think<00:01:55.799> it's<00:01:55.890> always

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
the dialogue and I think it's always

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.499 
the dialogue and I think it's always
going<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.280> be<00:01:56.369> an<00:01:56.490> ongoing<00:01:56.610> dialogue<00:01:57.030> this

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
going to be an ongoing dialogue this

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.300 
going to be an ongoing dialogue this
notion<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:58.020> how<00:01:58.560> much<00:01:58.710> we're<00:01:58.920> prepared<00:01:59.250> to

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
notion of how much we're prepared to

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.660 
notion of how much we're prepared to
give<00:01:59.520> up<00:01:59.670> about<00:01:59.969> privacy<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.280> how<00:02:02.280> much<00:02:02.430> we're

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
give up about privacy and how much we're

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.740 
give up about privacy and how much we're
prepared<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.299> watched<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:04.049> have<00:02:04.350> our

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
prepared to be watched and have our

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.710 
prepared to be watched and have our
mation<00:02:05.250> collated<00:02:06.250> and<00:02:06.490> how<00:02:06.880> that's<00:02:07.030> used<00:02:07.390> and

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
mation collated and how that's used and

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.389 
mation collated and how that's used and
I<00:02:07.750> think<00:02:07.990> it's<00:02:08.140> imperative<00:02:08.920> that<00:02:09.190> that

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
I think it's imperative that that

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.190 
I think it's imperative that that
dialogue<00:02:09.820> continues<00:02:10.060> because<00:02:10.660> in<00:02:11.020> some<00:02:11.140> ways

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
dialogue continues because in some ways

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.810 
dialogue continues because in some ways
I<00:02:11.410> think<00:02:11.440> we're<00:02:11.710> behind<00:02:11.980> technology<00:02:12.670> not

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
I think we're behind technology not

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.110 
I think we're behind technology not
ahead<00:02:13.030> of<00:02:13.150> it<00:02:13.270> so<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:15.100> we<00:02:15.310> need<00:02:15.460> to<00:02:15.610> you<00:02:16.030> know

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
ahead of it so and we need to you know

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.090 
ahead of it so and we need to you know
look<00:02:16.270> after<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.690> people<00:02:16.870> coming<00:02:17.620> below<00:02:17.800> us<00:02:18.010> i

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
look after the people coming below us i

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.970 
look after the people coming below us i
think<00:02:18.130> you<00:02:19.000> know<00:02:19.230> nation<00:02:20.230> of<00:02:20.320> privacy<00:02:20.770> for<00:02:20.950> a

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
think you know nation of privacy for a

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.070 
think you know nation of privacy for a
15<00:02:21.400> year<00:02:21.550> old<00:02:21.730> is<00:02:22.030> completely<00:02:22.540> different<00:02:22.690> to

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
15 year old is completely different to

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.410 
15 year old is completely different to
the<00:02:23.290> notion<00:02:23.470> of<00:02:23.680> privacy<00:02:24.040> for<00:02:24.490> for<00:02:25.209> a<00:02:25.240> mature

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
the notion of privacy for for a mature

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.630 
the notion of privacy for for a mature
adult<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:26.110> so<00:02:26.380> i<00:02:26.620> think<00:02:27.100> that's<00:02:27.430> a

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
adult and so i think that's a

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.560 
adult and so i think that's a
conversation<00:02:27.970> always<00:02:28.810> worth<00:02:29.170> having
