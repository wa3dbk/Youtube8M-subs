it but because the defensive end it's
not<00:03:36.720> really<00:03:37.080> worth<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:38.040> risk<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.459> spend<00:03:38.880> that

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
not really worth the risk to spend that

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.790 
not really worth the risk to spend that
