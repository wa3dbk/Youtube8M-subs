00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
alright so that was the giant television

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.530 
alright so that was the giant television
and<00:05:00.600> a<00:05:00.900> giant<00:05:01.169> game<00:05:01.500> of<00:05:01.530> Donkey<00:05:02.430> Kong<00:05:02.910> that<00:05:03.390> was

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.440 
so apparently that's like games not even
on<00:05:07.440> the<00:05:07.590> NES<00:05:07.890> so<00:05:08.220> it<00:05:08.280> couldn't<00:05:08.490> have<00:05:08.550> been<00:05:08.730> any

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450

the house I think that I should probably
go<00:05:14.940> for<00:05:15.120> a<00:05:15.210> break<00:05:15.450> because<00:05:15.630> yeah<00:05:16.500> this<00:05:16.919> is

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
go for a break because yeah this is
