00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
for extreme layers everything and I mean

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.390 
for extreme layers everything and I mean
everything<00:00:24.199> was<00:00:25.199> layered<00:00:25.650> on<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.070> runway

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
everything was layered on the runway

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.160 
everything was layered on the runway
there's<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.970> little<00:00:27.240> bit<00:00:27.359> tricky<00:00:27.810> trend

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
there's a little bit tricky trend

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.929 
there's a little bit tricky trend
because<00:00:28.500> if<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.769> add<00:00:28.920> too<00:00:29.279> many<00:00:29.429> layers<00:00:29.699> and

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
because if you add too many layers and

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.279 
because if you add too many layers and
you<00:00:30.000> don't<00:00:30.240> do<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.570> right<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.960> can<00:00:30.990> look<00:00:31.230> like

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
you don't do it right you can look like

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.590 
you don't do it right you can look like
a<00:00:31.470> five<00:00:31.800> layer<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.130> bean<00:00:32.279> burrito<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.059> that

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
a five layer of bean burrito and that

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.720 
a five layer of bean burrito and that
should<00:00:33.809> be<00:00:33.899> eaten<00:00:34.200> not<00:00:34.380> worn<00:00:34.590> one<00:00:35.130> way<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.370> do

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
should be eaten not worn one way to do

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.760 
should be eaten not worn one way to do
the<00:00:35.850> trend<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.270> with<00:00:36.480> lots<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.930> light<00:00:37.410> layers

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
the trend is with lots of light layers

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.220 
the trend is with lots of light layers
so<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.610> started<00:00:39.210> with<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:39.540> sweater<00:00:39.840> which<00:00:40.050> has

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
so I started with this sweater which has

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.780 
so I started with this sweater which has
its<00:00:40.410> built-in<00:00:40.739> sheer<00:00:41.190> chiffon<00:00:41.399> layer

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
its built-in sheer chiffon layer

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.369 
its built-in sheer chiffon layer
underneath<00:00:42.180> which<00:00:42.510> makes<00:00:42.750> layering<00:00:43.140> very

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
underneath which makes layering very

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.680 
underneath which makes layering very
easy<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.950> then<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.489> bottom<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.969> did<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.210> trend<00:00:45.539> I

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
easy and then on bottom I did a trend I

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.440 
easy and then on bottom I did a trend I
actually<00:00:45.840> never<00:00:46.079> thought<00:00:46.350> I'd<00:00:46.469> wear<00:00:47.420> under<00:00:48.420> a

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450

actually never thought I'd wear under a
skirt<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.960> know<00:00:49.050> crazy<00:00:49.440> but<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.460> reason<00:00:50.700> it

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
skirt I know crazy but the reason it

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.520 
skirt I know crazy but the reason it
works<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.210> these<00:00:51.480> leather<00:00:51.780> leggings<00:00:52.260> that's

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
works is these leather leggings that's

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.590 
works is these leather leggings that's
almost<00:00:52.829> like<00:00:53.039> tights<00:00:53.460> under<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.360> sheer

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
peak of pants going through so I did a

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.029 
peak of pants going through so I did a
little<00:01:00.539> sashay<00:01:01.020> down<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.320> runway<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.649> see<00:01:01.949> it

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
it's a little colder I could do a black

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.350 
it's a little colder I could do a black
boot<00:01:09.840> as<00:01:09.990> well<00:01:10.340> so<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.490> last<00:01:11.640> look<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.180> did

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
boot as well so in the last look I did

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.690 
boot as well so in the last look I did
lots<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.840> light<00:01:13.260> layers<00:01:13.530> another<00:01:14.220> way<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.460> do

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
lots of light layers another way to do

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.330 
lots of light layers another way to do
it<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.030> with<00:01:15.210> one<00:01:15.689> skin<00:01:16.320> tight<00:01:16.560> layer<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.009> then

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
it is with one skin tight layer and then

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.280 
it is with one skin tight layer and then
you<00:01:17.490> build<00:01:17.759> with<00:01:18.060> thicker<00:01:18.330> layers<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:19.259> I

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
you build with thicker layers so I

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.140 
you build with thicker layers so I
started<00:01:19.680> off<00:01:19.799> by<00:01:19.860> layering<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.520> hidden

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
started off by layering this hidden

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.060 
started off by layering this hidden
tight<00:01:21.330> sweater<00:01:21.659> dress<00:01:21.930> over<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.380> pair<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.770> tight
