 shanti shanti rf backpack yukon 75 Companies 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.940
 new tour 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.220
 compare the legitimate 8 5 seconds easier 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.719
 icons more classic is not pure 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.820
 visual skeptical liked him 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.070
 discharging the back end is essentially not 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.480
 colors on the form of reliability such 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.160
 design to apply again in tone 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.650
 some other backpacks including 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.230
 kipti liter status basically people 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.119
 codes this brand let's say so the series i'm 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.130
 I haven't used this life 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.769
 seems to hold on to 70 liters already 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.460
 exactly cloth sling in my opinion 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.309
 soft 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.300
 some kind of a very strange one from the ramp 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:40.350
 valve is clear that on top and so on 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.750
 stretched do not want to be honest I would Kalman 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.190
 I myself did not take such a backpack 100 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.059
 I liked the 15-liter more 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.960
 of laws 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:54.510
 Well, how would it taste and color 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:57.870
 There is an amateur try his immediately own 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.180
 very good fastener 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.110
 look what a coup I see such 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.659
 there nevsky straight mach fine day strap 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.020
 in my opinion my back is kinda 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.110
 looks tough it is already loaded well 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.640
 working system is also tough now 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.290
 try there is a mount for string and 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.970
 destroyed 7 likely distributing 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.720
 the system will not sit well in public 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.880
 I do not know very small size 46 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.470
 how to live because here she will see 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.890
 drags on almost to the end on 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.759
 tenths sister for some very strange 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.650
 i don't like the trail to the south they have 125 not 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.780
 It seems to sling better do it differently 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.490
 so little villages so itself can not 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.820
 say it doesn't like it though 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.820
 wait we haven't tightened here 1 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.250
 I don't like how this tea is made by 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.570
 lower ph point of view on the plug on 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.380
 old pointer 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:03.130
 as I remember there is a newer series 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.899
 made better here are 100 liters of backpacks 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.659
 this alloy is better for us and not unfortunately 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:12.130
 Special keys are constantly held there 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:14.830
 unloading me not very in this form 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.069
 tolerated as a man with a sore back i would 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.110
 would like to help measure what is there 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.680
 still 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:29.500
 tyazhechko upper valve flap weighs 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:31.900
 Pocket size enough without 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.970
 some extra mounts fabric 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.950
 a little rain will come aquarius soaked 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.170
 there is a need handles unlike 100 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.470
 liters to describe them here is somehow simpler 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.340
 made thinner than the lower screed 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.069
 bottom material 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.160
 good so reliable but for example if 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.780
 take a backpack cross is almost the same 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.250
 we are pulling a little bit softer but 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:58.739
 it looks like the material from not half so 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:02.790
 open my jumper jumper 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:04.409
 medium hard medium density 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.269
 let's see the other side there by the fires 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:10.920
 cockpit here the other side there is no luxor 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.250
 and as dense as I would like 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.159
 denser than often well , somewhere around three 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.500
 hours or more do not put 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:21.599
 it happens at 5 volts at all for 2 what is it 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.280
 ok actually i like this 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.959
 I rarely use a jumper if 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.849
 only very little cargo that is just 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.019
 divide if the goods are more or less a lot 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:33.329
 already to the fore stands they layout 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:37.709
 distribution of pharma to side pockets 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:39.659
 there are sizes quite familiar for 2 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.540
 liter is quite suitable tie screed 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:45.560
 large 125 liter backpack tested 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:52.489
 here the carpets are full of breezes blow mat 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:52.489
 big little little gray 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.790
 it is dangerous to remove that big one there 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.560
 among the factories we put it here on mv 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.220
 air well but it will be 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.849
 a little bit on the edge so pocket a boon 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:15.629
 protective lie too fit here a and 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:18.329
 the poles may not even be 1 7 bathed 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:20.410
 from another make it a campaign I donâ€™t know with 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.960
 what purpose so 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.030
 open molds internally small 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.520
 budget duke series we have like a girlfriend 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.970
 see a review of 125 liters can be clearly seen as 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.700
 it is sheathed in this size with heavy 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.550
 stretch mark 2 and all not so vile 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.620
 there is no registrar before it 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.110
 this is where habits begin 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.600
 somewhere here here 's what to say about 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.730
 the backpack is honest and just chisinau you too 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.250
 did not cause just because I am already very 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.840
 many listed not watched attitude 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.130
 very picky if you have backpacks 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.740
 it was not your first backpack before 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.020
 For example, I think half the problem is not 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.930
 notice which i said can you 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.580
 recommend shopping well for you should 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.490
 say that you can because these are all you 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.500
 should sell something for what 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.540
 good side mount for availability 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.280
 additional mounting points for screeds 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.390
 you know what these fasteners 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.580
 by trekking poles 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.290
 for carrying handles for enough 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.690
 good fabric bottom and lintels behind 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.940
 big pocket and side in principle 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.250
 gift sounded system also works from 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.840
 sinful best option but us 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.300
 met entertainment system 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.820
 much, much better at least double though 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.070
 would have a backpack at 75 better take at 80 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.210
 tenge of heaven between these two and us 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.370
 by the way like the design 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.720
 if you assume the task backpack 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.120
 buy for girls who wear in 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.030
 mostly clothes which here and there yes 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.620
 and in such a package with cosmetics one my 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.350
 friend took to Karelia 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.680
 so here I am not kidding in the end and 125 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:49.030
 liter backpack was two times lighter than 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.100
 my at the same time three times more here for 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.419
 such cases are dramatic without any 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.550
