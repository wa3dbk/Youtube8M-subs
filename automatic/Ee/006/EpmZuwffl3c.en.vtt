00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:13.750
 in something that yes in all my conferences 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.580
 I insist on two fundamental 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.070
 qualities among many that must have 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.210
 a good translation of the bible two 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.270
 that are not negotiable 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.140
 and who direct the action 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.350
 of the translators of the 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.540
 bible the first is fidelity the 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.300
 fidelity to the subsidiary to the text 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.860
 original not to another version but we do not 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.440
 come and tell us that this new 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.010
 international version is not faithful because 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:45.510
 did not translate it as queen valera or as 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.840
 the king james or whatever it is not because the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.600
 new international version was based on 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.309
 manuscripts much more numerous much 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:59.100
 older and much more worthy and for 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.000
 thousands of them on which the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.100
 traditional versions of the bible 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.850
 then it is fidelity to the original text in 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.789
 the best recession or the one we can have 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.100
 today after the critical study of thousands 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:16.289
 of thousands of manuscripts the skill is 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.180
 measured by the original Hebrew text 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:19.920
 Aramaic and Greek and not with another translation 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.189
 from the bible 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.930
 then what does the new version and 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:30.090
 they make all modern versions of the 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:33.270
 bible is to reintegrate integrity if it is 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.490
 has been affected by lack or by 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.390
 addition 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.490
 and therefore not only remove what 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.060
 that was added 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.060
 if it does not refund what was taken away by 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.990
 any circumstance that's why it's called 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.710
 a faithful skill is the first quality 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.270
 quality the fidelity the other if not 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.299
 let's talk about that has been spoken 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.509
 many times is the news today 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.539
 that people can now read the 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.610
 message of God in their own language and 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.789
 how that language is used and spoken today in 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.789
 day
