node which says all right we have
another<00:01:09.700> note<00:01:10.060> in<00:01:10.270> here<00:01:10.479> and<00:01:10.630> there<00:01:10.720> needs<00:01:10.869> to

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
another note in here and there needs to

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.080 
another note in here and there needs to
be<00:01:11.049> loaded<00:01:11.260> for<00:01:12.250> example<00:01:12.670> we<00:01:12.760> have<00:01:12.909> the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
be loaded for example we have the

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.550 
be loaded for example we have the
mountain<00:01:13.360> oh<00:01:13.479> this<00:01:13.900> is<00:01:14.049> where<00:01:14.229> you<00:01:14.320> put<00:01:14.530> your

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
mountain oh this is where you put your

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.760 
mountain oh this is where you put your
hand<00:01:14.890> I<00:01:15.159> just<00:01:15.700> saw<00:01:15.820> on<00:01:16.119> another<00:01:16.150> thought<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
hand I just saw on another thought the

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.490 
hand I just saw on another thought the
y-axis<00:01:18.460> is<00:01:18.490> inverted<00:01:19.299> that<00:01:19.750> means<00:01:19.990> it's

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
y-axis is inverted that means it's

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.709 
y-axis is inverted that means it's
backwards<00:01:21.189> in<00:01:21.579> comparison<00:01:22.179> to<00:01:22.299> other<00:01:22.420> three

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:22.719 
backwards in comparison to other three

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:25.050 
backwards in comparison to other three
applications<00:01:23.200> so<00:01:23.619> please<00:01:24.340> keep<00:01:24.579> that<00:01:24.640> in<00:01:24.820> mind

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
applications so please keep that in mind

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.499 
applications so please keep that in mind
while<00:01:25.299> exporting<00:01:25.899> from<00:01:26.310> blender<00:01:27.310> I'm<00:01:28.210> moving

while exporting from blender I'm moving

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.080 
while exporting from blender I'm moving
on<00:01:28.659> we<00:01:29.320> just<00:01:29.770> do<00:01:29.950> have<00:01:30.189> the<00:01:30.340> shape<00:01:30.579> we<00:01:30.789> have<00:01:30.939> the

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
on we just do have the shape we have the

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.450 
on we just do have the shape we have the
start<00:01:31.439> now<00:01:32.439> we<00:01:32.499> have<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:32.859> more<00:01:33.039> important

start now we have the more important

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.310 
start now we have the more important
notes<00:01:33.729> right<00:01:34.299> here<00:01:34.329> we<00:01:34.600> have<00:01:34.780> line<00:01:35.140> of<00:01:35.170> sight

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
notes right here we have line of sight

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.429 
notes right here we have line of sight
collision<00:01:36.149> that's<00:01:37.149> on<00:01:37.780> one<00:01:38.079> of<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.289> other

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
cages I'm holding shift i'm able to

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.830 
cages I'm holding shift i'm able to
access<00:01:41.289> the<00:01:41.530> other<00:01:41.820> palettes<00:01:42.820> this<00:01:43.630> is

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
access the other palettes this is

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.349 
access the other palettes this is
connected<00:01:44.289> to<00:01:44.380> one<00:01:44.560> of<00:01:44.590> them<00:01:44.829> i<00:01:45.009> like<00:01:45.969> to<00:01:46.149> put

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:46.359 
connected to one of them i like to put

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:49.289 
connected to one of them i like to put
the<00:01:46.479> outer<00:01:46.979> 11<00:01:47.979> to<00:01:48.249> the<00:01:48.369> line<00:01:48.549> of<00:01:48.670> sight<00:01:48.880> then

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
the outer 11 to the line of sight then

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.029 
the outer 11 to the line of sight then
we<00:01:49.420> have<00:01:49.539> collision<00:01:50.079> which<00:01:50.319> is<00:01:50.469> the<00:01:50.649> intermesh

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
we have collision which is the intermesh

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.399 
we have collision which is the intermesh
wrap<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:53.130> those<00:01:54.130> are<00:01:54.490> basically<00:01:54.939> to<00:01:55.810> let<00:01:56.049> they

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
wrap to those are basically to let they

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.860 
at 80 pixels like I said at 80 because
it's<00:02:15.690> easier<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.830> see<00:02:17.100> at<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:18.200> resolution<00:02:19.200> of

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
it's easier to see at a resolution of

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.699 
it's easier to see at a resolution of
1152<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.670> 720<00:02:23.670> because<00:02:24.360> that<00:02:24.510> sofa<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.110> that's

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
1152 and 720 because that sofa so that's

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.010 
1152 and 720 because that sofa so that's
what<00:02:25.830> I<00:02:25.860> like<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.130> work<00:02:26.250> at<00:02:26.490> so<00:02:27.420> we<00:02:27.540> have<00:02:27.630> detail

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
what I like to work at so we have detail

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.500 
what I like to work at so we have detail
ad<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:28.440> shows<00:02:28.650> up<00:02:28.860> on<00:02:29.010> any<00:02:29.280> pixels<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.240> hire

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.830 
ad that shows up on any pixels and hire
any<00:02:31.470> lower<00:02:31.830> like<00:02:32.100> 79<00:02:32.550> pixels<00:02:33.180> then<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.570> reverts

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
any lower like 79 pixels then it reverts

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.880 
any lower like 79 pixels then it reverts
over<00:02:34.320> to<00:02:35.220> detail<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.850> now<00:02:36.540> detail<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.530> stop

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
over to detail to now detail to I stop

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.070 
over to detail to now detail to I stop
it<00:02:38.070> at<00:02:38.160> two<00:02:38.370> because<00:02:38.790> at<00:02:39.120> one<00:02:39.510> Israel<00:02:39.989> is

with<00:04:36.120> that<00:04:36.419> stuff<00:04:36.479> so<00:04:37.400> sequences<00:04:38.400> these<00:04:38.729> are

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:38.909 
with that stuff so sequences these are

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:41.749 
with that stuff so sequences these are
bones<00:04:39.120> arm<00:04:39.539> animations<00:04:40.110> I<00:04:40.370> believe<00:04:41.370> this<00:04:41.580> is

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 
bones arm animations I believe this is
