you're trying to do stuff that other
people<00:00:48.970> haven't<00:00:49.659> done<00:00:49.750> before<00:00:50.140> then

realistically<00:00:51.790> you<00:00:52.000> need<00:00:52.150> to<00:00:52.239> go<00:00:52.390> down<00:00:52.510> the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659 
realistically you need to go down the

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:54.299 
realistically you need to go down the
route<00:00:52.809> of<00:00:52.989> recording<00:00:53.680> your<00:00:53.769> own<00:00:53.949> source

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
route of recording your own source

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:02.609 
route of recording your own source
material<00:00:59.519> trip<00:01:00.519> to<00:01:00.640> Nevada<00:01:00.850> was<00:01:01.360> to<00:01:01.900> go<00:01:02.589> out

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:02.619 
material trip to Nevada was to go out

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:05.880 
material trip to Nevada was to go out
and<00:01:02.920> record<00:01:03.670> i<00:01:04.320> think<00:01:05.320> it<00:01:05.409> was<00:01:05.439> in<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:05.770> end

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
and record i think it was in the end

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:14.470 
and record i think it was in the end
about<00:01:06.070> 45<00:01:06.549> different<00:01:06.790> weapons

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.170 

there<00:01:15.260> was<00:01:15.350> one<00:01:15.620> weapon<00:01:16.430> which<00:01:16.550> was<00:01:16.730> I<00:01:16.910> think

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
there was one weapon which was I think

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.200 
there was one weapon which was I think
it<00:01:17.240> was<00:01:17.300> the<00:01:17.360> Barrett<00:01:17.750> sniper<00:01:17.840> rifle<00:01:19.210> the

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
it was the Barrett sniper rifle the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.910 
it was the Barrett sniper rifle the
armor<00:01:20.600> basically<00:01:20.960> said<00:01:21.110> it<00:01:21.200> sounded<00:01:21.470> like<00:01:21.530> God

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
armor basically said it sounded like God

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:32.010 
armor basically said it sounded like God
coughing<00:01:22.220> because<00:01:23.210> it<00:01:23.330> was<00:01:23.450> that<00:01:23.660> loud<00:01:23.930> I

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.860 

think<00:01:33.020> we're<00:01:33.470> taking<00:01:33.770> a<00:01:33.860> lot<00:01:33.980> of<00:01:34.010> risks<00:01:34.460> and

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
think we're taking a lot of risks and

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.640 
think we're taking a lot of risks and
that's<00:01:35.870> one<00:01:36.020> of<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:36.170> things<00:01:36.230> I<00:01:36.470> like<00:01:36.590> about

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
that's one of the things I like about

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.950 
that's one of the things I like about
the<00:01:36.920> project<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:37.850> smart<00:01:38.090> system<00:01:38.420> that<00:01:38.750> the

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
the project the smart system that the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.420 
the project the smart system that the
merging<00:01:39.170> of<00:01:39.410> the<00:01:39.470> multiplayer<00:01:39.980> and<00:01:40.280> the

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
merging of the multiplayer and the

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.520 
merging of the multiplayer and the
single<00:01:41.060> player<00:01:41.140> those<00:01:42.140> are<00:01:42.260> all<00:01:42.350> pretty

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
single player those are all pretty

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.310 
single player those are all pretty
pretty<00:01:42.950> big<00:01:43.160> risks<00:01:43.520> frankly<00:01:44.050> and<00:01:45.050> when<00:01:45.200> I<00:01:45.230> came

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
pretty big risks frankly and when I came

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.810 
pretty big risks frankly and when I came
here<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:45.860> interviewed<00:01:46.250> with<00:01:46.370> splash<00:01:46.610> damage

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
here and interviewed with splash damage

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.880 
here and interviewed with splash damage
I<00:01:47.150> realized<00:01:47.660> this<00:01:47.990> is<00:01:48.140> my<00:01:48.230> chance<00:01:48.260> I<00:01:48.770> could

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
I realized this is my chance I could

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.140 
I realized this is my chance I could
actually<00:01:49.100> finally<00:01:49.700> do<00:01:49.820> all<00:01:49.970> this<00:01:50.090> stuff

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
actually finally do all this stuff

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.250 
actually finally do all this stuff
that's<00:01:50.390> been<00:01:50.510> in<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:50.630> back<00:01:50.780> of<00:01:50.810> my<00:01:50.960> head<00:01:51.110> for

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
that's been in the back of my head for

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:58.360 
that's been in the back of my head for
10<00:01:51.410> years<00:01:53.050> even<00:01:54.050> now<00:01:54.560> I<00:01:54.950> am<00:01:56.500> slightly<00:01:57.500> dazzled

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
10 years even now I am slightly dazzled

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.240 
10 years even now I am slightly dazzled
and<00:01:58.610> stunned<00:01:59.210> by<00:01:59.600> how<00:01:59.840> much<00:02:00.050> work<00:02:00.320> by<00:02:01.010> how<00:02:01.190> many

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
and stunned by how much work by how many

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.860 
and stunned by how much work by how many
different<00:02:01.760> people<00:02:02.060> don't<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.390> making<00:02:02.660> a<00:02:02.690> game

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
different people don't to making a game

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.560 
different people don't to making a game
and<00:02:03.080> how<00:02:03.680> ideas<00:02:04.430> get<00:02:04.640> passed<00:02:05.000> along<00:02:05.240> and

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
and how ideas get passed along and

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.450 
and how ideas get passed along and
improved<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.230> iterated<00:02:06.740> on<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:07.070> so<00:02:07.220> by<00:02:07.400> the

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
improved and iterated on and so by the

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.889 
improved and iterated on and so by the
time<00:02:07.670> something<00:02:08.000> ends<00:02:08.119> up<00:02:08.270> in<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.420> game<00:02:08.660> it's

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
time something ends up in the game it's

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.870 
time something ends up in the game it's
been<00:02:08.960> concept<00:02:09.860> in<00:02:09.980> and<00:02:10.130> text<00:02:10.490> it's<00:02:10.610> been<00:02:10.760> you
