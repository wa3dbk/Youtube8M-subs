in<00:00:29.699> this<00:00:30.509> tutorial<00:00:30.749> we're<00:00:31.499> going<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.859> discuss

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
in this tutorial we're going to discuss

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.580 
in this tutorial we're going to discuss
how<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.730> detect<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.629> difference<00:00:33.840> between<00:00:34.230> a

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
how to detect the difference between a

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.470 
how to detect the difference between a
well-cut<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.850> poorly<00:00:36.120> cut<00:00:36.420> gemstone<00:00:38.480> we

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
well-cut and a poorly cut gemstone we

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.959 
well-cut and a poorly cut gemstone we
will<00:00:39.600> explain<00:00:40.050> how<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.440> recognize<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.430> windowed

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
will explain how to recognize a windowed

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.599 
will explain how to recognize a windowed
gem<00:00:43.910> facets<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:45.059> don't<00:00:45.329> meet<00:00:46.100> poor<00:00:47.100> polish

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
gem facets that don't meet poor polish

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:50.660 
gem facets that don't meet poor polish
and<00:00:47.850> crooked<00:00:48.420> girdles<00:00:49.070> this<00:00:50.070> will<00:00:50.340> help<00:00:50.550> you

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
and crooked girdles this will help you

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.939 
and crooked girdles this will help you
distinguish<00:00:51.270> between<00:00:51.329> well<00:00:51.960> cut<00:00:52.260> gems<00:00:52.620> and

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
distinguish between well cut gems and

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.259 
distinguish between well cut gems and
poorly<00:00:53.489> cut<00:00:53.699> ones<00:00:55.340> one<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.550> most<00:00:56.789> common

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
poorly cut ones one of the most common

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:00.049 
poorly cut ones one of the most common
signs<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.989> poor<00:00:58.260> cutting<00:00:58.679> is<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.190> window<00:00:59.789> in

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
signs of poor cutting is the window in

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.959 
signs of poor cutting is the window in
many<00:01:00.840> cases<00:01:01.379> such<00:01:01.739> as<00:01:01.769> this<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.609> can<00:01:02.789> actually

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
many cases such as this you can actually

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.620 
many cases such as this you can actually
read<00:01:03.510> through<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.929> gem<00:01:04.759> so<00:01:05.759> what<00:01:05.909> makes<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.360> gem

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
read through the gem so what makes a gem

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.410 
read through the gem so what makes a gem
have<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.080> window<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.799> gem<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.549> windowed<00:01:09.030> because

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
have a window a gem is windowed because

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.990 
have a window a gem is windowed because
it<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.689> cut<00:01:09.930> at<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.229> wrong<00:01:10.439> angles<00:01:10.920> this<00:01:11.759> is

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
it is cut at the wrong angles this is

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.490 
it is cut at the wrong angles this is
usually<00:01:12.210> due<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.720> either<00:01:13.110> primitive

through<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.240> gym

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.080 

you<00:01:34.020> can<00:01:34.229> see<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.070> gym<00:01:35.429> which<00:01:35.820> is

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
you can see that in this gym which is

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.599 
you can see that in this gym which is
cut<00:01:36.630> with<00:01:36.869> angles<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.560> are<00:01:37.619> too<00:01:37.859> shallow<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:38.609 
cut with angles that are too shallow the

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:40.580 
cut with angles that are too shallow the
light<00:01:38.820> goes<00:01:39.060> directly<00:01:39.600> through<00:01:39.689> without

light goes directly through without
coming<00:01:40.979> back<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:42.090> creates<00:01:42.539> a<00:01:42.659> window<00:01:43.049> and

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
coming back this creates a window and

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.669 
coming back this creates a window and
reduces<00:01:44.039> the<00:01:44.219> total<00:01:44.429> brilliance<00:01:44.969> of<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.390> gym

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
reduces the total brilliance of the gym

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.639 
reduces the total brilliance of the gym
in<00:01:46.880> contrast<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.600> gym<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.140> cut<00:01:49.350> at<00:01:49.560> the

the gym is returned back in brilliance

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.800 
the gym is returned back in brilliance
and<00:01:54.270> beauty<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.929> viewer<00:01:56.509> another<00:01:57.509> way<00:01:57.750> to

the middle of the gemstone the girdle

thickness all the way around the gem
this<00:03:51.879> is<00:03:51.939> important<00:03:52.629> because<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:53.200> girdle<00:03:53.469> is
