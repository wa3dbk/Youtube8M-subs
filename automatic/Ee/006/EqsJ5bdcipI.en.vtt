their<00:01:23.850> odds<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.210> low<00:01:24.450> priced<00:01:24.810> at<00:01:25.020> one<00:01:25.140> point

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
their odds a low priced at one point

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.569 
their odds a low priced at one point
eight<00:01:25.560> with<00:01:25.740> bet365<00:01:27.229> yes<00:01:28.229> it's<00:01:29.130> probably

of<00:02:32.650> markets<00:02:33.100> on<00:02:33.250> this<00:02:33.430> game<00:02:33.640> like<00:02:34.210> you<00:02:34.360> said

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
of markets on this game like you said

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.780 
of markets on this game like you said
it's<00:02:34.570> a<00:02:34.870> very<00:02:35.170> very<00:02:35.710> difficult<00:02:36.280> thing<00:02:36.760> to

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
it's a very very difficult thing to

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.890 
it's a very very difficult thing to
predict<00:02:37.210> and<00:02:38.250> but<00:02:39.250> I'm<00:02:39.640> sure<00:02:39.970> that<00:02:40.000> each<00:02:40.630> whole

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
predict and but I'm sure that each whole

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.670 
predict and but I'm sure that each whole
city<00:02:41.820> it's<00:02:42.820> playing<00:02:43.780> an<00:02:43.960> awesome<00:02:44.440> football

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
city it's playing an awesome football

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.850 
city it's playing an awesome football
and<00:02:45.100> and<00:02:46.090> also<00:02:46.990> will<00:02:47.260> have<00:02:47.380> a<00:02:47.620> lot<00:02:47.830> of

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
and and also will have a lot of

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.280 
and and also will have a lot of
difficult<00:02:48.520> to<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:49.210> get<00:02:49.330> a<00:02:49.390> good<00:02:49.660> result<00:02:49.840> here

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
difficult to to get a good result here

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.390 
difficult to to get a good result here
so<00:02:50.890> I<00:02:51.310> believe<00:02:51.760> that<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.450> price<00:02:52.900> of<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:54.100> value

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
so I believe that the price of the value

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.820 
so I believe that the price of the value
on<00:02:54.520> this<00:02:54.640> game<00:02:54.880> is<00:02:55.150> more<00:02:55.570> on<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.900> on<00:02:56.740> the
