00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
we joined a plane marked the profiles

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.630 
we joined a plane marked the profiles
cut<00:00:03.000> them<00:00:03.240> out<00:00:03.360> and<00:00:03.899> sanded<00:00:04.529> them<00:00:04.620> now<00:00:05.069> for

putting<00:00:06.000> it<00:00:06.089> together<00:00:09.320> we'll<00:00:10.320> start<00:00:10.590> off<00:00:10.740> with

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
putting it together we'll start off with

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.950 
putting it together we'll start off with
fitting<00:00:11.429> out<00:00:11.550> one<00:00:11.730> stretcher<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.330> leg

pilot drill and countersink set your

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.870 
pilot drill and countersink set your
screws<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.470> tips<00:00:22.740> are<00:00:22.980> just<00:00:23.010> protruding

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
screws so the tips are just protruding

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.580 
screws so the tips are just protruding
through<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.269> stretcher<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:25.199> just<00:00:25.439> ensures

through the stretcher it just ensures

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.189 
through the stretcher it just ensures
that<00:00:25.830> your<00:00:26.430> pilot<00:00:26.849> holes<00:00:26.880> line<00:00:27.359> up<00:00:27.390> right<00:00:27.990> on

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
that your pilot holes line up right on

that your pilot holes line up right on
target<00:00:31.969> apply<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.030> glue

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.130 

and<00:00:41.310> then<00:00:41.520> drove<00:00:41.880> your<00:00:42.090> screws<00:00:42.450> home<00:00:42.780> there's

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
and then drove your screws home there's

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.560 
and then drove your screws home there's
no<00:00:43.260> need<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.560> clamp<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.130> up<00:00:44.280> as<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.970> screws

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
no need to clamp it up as the screws

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.270 
no need to clamp it up as the screws
will<00:00:45.900> hold<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.290> together<00:00:46.410> while<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.010> glue<00:00:47.250> is

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
will hold it together while the glue is

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.090 
will hold it together while the glue is
drying

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
having cleaned up the squeeze out will

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.060 
having cleaned up the squeeze out will
clamp<00:00:57.050> the<00:00:57.230> legs<00:00:57.440> together<00:00:59.680> because<00:01:00.680> the<00:01:00.860> legs

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
clamp the legs together because the legs

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.920 
clamp the legs together because the legs
create<00:01:01.489> a<00:01:01.520> roughly<00:01:02.059> four<00:01:02.360> inch<00:01:02.570> space<00:01:02.900> between

assemblies<00:02:36.880> in<00:02:37.030> place<00:02:37.270> while<00:02:37.810> we<00:02:37.870> fit<00:02:38.230> the

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
assemblies in place while we fit the

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:45.660 
assemblies in place while we fit the
Francine<00:02:38.800> brace

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.600 

that's<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.720> top<00:02:46.930> pilot<00:02:47.410> hole<00:02:47.590> drive<00:02:48.460> the

now<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:56.770> piece<00:02:57.160> is<00:02:57.370> lying<00:02:57.580> up<00:02:57.760> we<00:02:57.940> can<00:02:58.090> add<00:02:58.240> the

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
now the piece is lying up we can add the

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:06.600 
now the piece is lying up we can add the
countersink<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:05.620> we<00:03:06.100> will<00:03:06.190> just<00:03:06.340> have<00:03:06.400> this

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
countersink and we will just have this

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.910 
countersink and we will just have this
grouper<00:03:07.030> Trude<00:03:07.270> slightly<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:08.080> make<00:03:08.110> refitting

the<00:03:09.010> piece<00:03:09.250> easier<00:03:09.730> once<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.240> glue<00:03:10.390> is

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
the piece easier once the glue is

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:45.070 
the piece easier once the glue is
applied

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.170 

now<00:03:45.620> we'll<00:03:45.800> clam<00:03:46.070> and<00:03:46.370> square<00:03:46.760> up<00:03:46.880> the<00:03:46.910> armed

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
now we'll clam and square up the armed

00:03:47.180 --> 00:04:49.780 
now we'll clam and square up the armed
brackets<00:03:47.600> ready<00:03:48.050> for<00:03:48.260> pilot<00:03:48.590> drill

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:05:02.210 

now<00:04:50.790> for<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:51.060> seats<00:04:51.330> let's<00:05:00.680> we<00:05:01.680> use<00:05:01.890> a<00:05:01.920> piece

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
now for the seats let's we use a piece

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:09.590 
now for the seats let's we use a piece
of<00:05:02.250> scrap<00:05:02.550> lumber<00:05:02.760> for<00:05:03.210> the<00:05:03.330> spacing<00:05:03.810> here<00:05:08.600> and

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
of scrap lumber for the spacing here and

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.720 
of scrap lumber for the spacing here and
just<00:05:09.810> put<00:05:10.020> them<00:05:10.140> in<00:05:10.260> one<00:05:10.620> screwy<00:05:10.950> now<00:05:11.190> because

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
just put them in one screwy now because

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:20.630 
just put them in one screwy now because
we<00:05:11.820> have<00:05:11.970> to<00:05:12.120> remove<00:05:12.390> them<00:05:12.600> again<00:05:12.720> later<00:05:19.640> we

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
we have to remove them again later we

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.910 
we have to remove them again later we
use<00:05:20.790> the<00:05:20.940> expanding<00:05:21.540> claim<00:05:21.810> to<00:05:22.140> square<00:05:22.740> up<00:05:22.890> the

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:22.920 
use the expanding claim to square up the

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:34.430 
use the expanding claim to square up the
C<00:05:23.220> place

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.530 

to<00:05:35.440> finish<00:05:35.620> off<00:05:35.800> we<00:05:36.130> use<00:05:36.340> a<00:05:36.370> spacer<00:05:36.760> a<00:05:37.180> seed

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540 
to finish off we use a spacer a seed

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.540 
to finish off we use a spacer a seed
slit<00:05:37.840> in<00:05:38.470> the<00:05:38.500> lower<00:05:38.770> back<00:05:39.670> brace<00:05:41.310> will<00:05:42.310> mark

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
slit in the lower back brace will mark

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.310 
slit in the lower back brace will mark
the<00:05:42.730> position<00:05:43.210> of<00:05:43.450> the<00:05:43.570> lower<00:05:43.750> seat<00:05:44.050> back

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
the position of the lower seat back

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:56.640 
the position of the lower seat back
brace<00:05:45.660> then<00:05:46.660> fit<00:05:47.080> in<00:05:47.200> on<00:05:47.440> one<00:05:47.680> screen<00:05:55.590> now<00:05:56.590> to

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.490 

finally<00:06:04.000> we'll<00:06:04.240> fit<00:06:04.420> the<00:06:04.450> arms<00:06:04.930> on<00:06:05.050> a<00:06:05.080> single

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
finally we'll fit the arms on a single
