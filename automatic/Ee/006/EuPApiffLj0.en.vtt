00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.759
 the balustrade is a decorative element that distinguishes and differentiates 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:07.759
 one home from another one environment there was another 

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:11.609
 decorative element in interiors and exteriors 

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:15.380
 balustrade the synonym of elegance and good taste 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.519
 at the culmination 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:18.269
 of a construction 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:21.279
 in front of the coldness of the materials to the use 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.259
 the soft and delicate line of palau street 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.819
 architectural figure and basic element of decoration 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.560
 prepared the necessary supplies 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.240
 we will have a base liza 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.540
 marble stone a wall 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.250
 this base can be simple or double 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.160
 today even 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.280
 combine the two existing profile models 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.780
 all this depending on the height we want to achieve 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.150
 the prepared list base can be ret 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.010
 uropa hoben staircase 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.430
 The assembly system with sprinters allows us to use it in the different 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.130
 cases 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.649
 protect the palau estre 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.989
 thus avoiding any damage that may arise in the same reason 

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:14.760
 of transportation or inadequate handling 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.440
 has led us to design and make a wrap capable of alleviating these 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.140
 eventualities 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.000
 the simplicity in the shedding of the envelope 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 is part of the preparation of the material 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.560
 the sprinter is a light plate of plastic material especially 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.560
 designed for the rapid assembly of balustrades 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.030
 our sprinter 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.759
 Guaranteed through its anchoring system 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.499
 a millimeter placement of the val to you 

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:49.499
 as well as its compaction 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.590
 shortly before this technique 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.310
 with a huge saving of time and costs in the placement of the same 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.670
 spectacular and has measures of 27 by 14 by 0 2 centimeters 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.059
 in the center it has a square body of 10 by 10 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:13.059
 to have contact with the upper part of the palau 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.150
 underneath it has a frame centered with the previous hole 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.639
 of 12 by 12 

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:24.609
 which is the measure that also have the basis of the bar to you 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:26.509
 so that the bar parts to you 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:29.509
 fit perfectly in the frame 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:32.059
 in the extremes 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:35.209
 to one side of holes aligned three to three 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.429
 and at a distance of one centimeter 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:38.860
 that will allow us 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.580
 Crimp these holes with the pivots provided by the silver at the other end 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.359
 also of three units 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.459
 yes when fitting a sound piece 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.189
 we do it to the widest extent we have arranged 4 bullet a stress for 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:54.869
 subway 

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:59.419
 and if we do it in the shortest we will have five units per metro line 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.129
 we can also link some pieces with others 

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:09.049
 seeing the holes on one side and the pivots on the other diagonally 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.200
 we will get a curve that will be deeper or not 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.910
 depending on the inclination 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.839
 with what to deny that we have the pieces 

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:21.839
 this element also has four holes 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.019
 in planes perpendicular to the square 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.909
 Parallel 2 to 2 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.049
 whose purpose 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.009
 is received and hold the two steel rods that come under pressure 

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:34.630
 and that once placed 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.630
 you will not be able to move from your accommodation 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:42.629
 the sprinter also arranges the bodies for concentric 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.959
 curved rods in circular 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.979
 5th that lateral 

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:50.069
 although the profile goes its site by its own weight 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.709
 and be fixed without further 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.709
 in its final place 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:58.979
 prepare the base 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:01.829
 we will present the first for you 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.089
 will be linked to the couple or column 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:07.189
 without mentioning it we will make the holes 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:08.929
 we see with the sprinter 

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:11.069
 goalkeepers who will receive later 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.459
 the steel rods 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.729
 the anchoring of sprinters is a simple operation 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.390
 linked one after another will form a chain 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.090
 that will have to have the same length as the balustrade that we are going to place 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:32.539
 Each sprinter will receive a bar to you so in the assembly of the 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:33.210
 chain 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.129
 we will have considered if we want 4 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:37.730
 infobal to you by meter 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.590
 or to an amount that intermediate 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.189
 based on this data 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:45.669
 we will have made the separations in the assembly of the chain 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.190
 With this mounting system you can save half the time of 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.419
 placement or what is the same 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.690
 place double balustrade or more 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.690
 in the same amount of time 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:02.829
 mounted the chain will be placed on the base 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:09.439
 we will make a mark in the lateral gulf of the sprinter 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:16.110
 It will indicate where caravan us3 should be located 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.669
 one by one we will place the balusters in the fine mortar that we have gone 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:30.669
 depositing next to the brands 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:36.639
 we observe 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.310
 that there is no alignment between the balusters since we have not taken 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.310
 no measure for its placement 

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:52.180
 the placement of steel rods on the sprinter chain 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.449
 will subject the balusters to definitively align and compact 

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:02.539
 place the row we will be making fit the head of each of the 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:05.710
 three bullets in the body of the sprinter 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.580
 we will check then that these are perfectly aligned horizontally 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.580
 and plumb perpendicular to the base 

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:22.270
 the piece and aligned and with the rods located 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.860
 It will be covered with a mixture of cement and cement glue 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.099
 that will serve to receive the rail profile 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:32.099
 and that he himself was firmly subject 

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:41.210
 another of the important properties of the sprinter 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.110
 is that its integral design 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.469
 enable the handrail 

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:48.449
 access the right site by its own weight 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:51.879
 matching the outer curve of the sprinter 

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:54.879
 with the lower curve of the profile 

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:02.389
 the clipping of the leftover elements will put an end to a work 

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:06.939
 that undoubtedly dignify someone to say where he is located 

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:11.060
 this company 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.770
 received in the year 1993 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.659
 the gold medal in brussels 

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:20.309
 in the world exhibition of invention industrial research and innovation 

00:07:21.999 --> 00:07:24.999
 improve day by day is our commitment 

00:07:25.559 --> 00:07:27.659
 a daily cry for our company
