00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.800 

you

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:54.310 

you

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.200 

in<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.440> first<00:00:55.649> stage<00:00:55.860> wait<00:00:56.730> quite<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> big

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
in the first stage wait quite a big

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.260 
in the first stage wait quite a big
moment<00:00:57.360> going<00:00:58.290> flat<00:00:58.590> over<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.399> small<00:00:59.730> jump<00:01:00.030> but

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
moment going flat over a small jump but

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.600 
moment going flat over a small jump but
the<00:01:00.719> layer<00:01:01.050> kicks<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.620> air<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.949> we<00:01:02.519> were

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
the layer kicks in the air and we were

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.579 
the layer kicks in the air and we were
really<00:01:02.730> landing<00:01:03.210> on<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.930> front<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.379> car

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
really landing on the front of the car

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.920 
really landing on the front of the car
and<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:05.280> thought<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.700> had<00:01:05.909> damaged<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.840> radiator

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
and I thought I had damaged the radiator

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.399 
and I thought I had damaged the radiator
so<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.979> tried<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.520> do<00:01:09.390> keep<00:01:09.840> an<00:01:09.990> eye<00:01:10.080> on<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
so I I tried to do keep an eye on the

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.680 
so I I tried to do keep an eye on the
water<00:01:10.740> temperature<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:12.030> was<00:01:12.360> distracted

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
water temperature and I was distracted

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.430 
water temperature and I was distracted
and<00:01:13.050> just<00:01:13.080> went<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.770> bit<00:01:14.550> wide<00:01:14.790> into<00:01:15.600> another

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
and just went a bit wide into another

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.010 
and just went a bit wide into another
old<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.100> had<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.369> turn<00:01:17.550> back<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.240> lost

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
old and I had to turn back and I lost

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:38.970 
old and I had to turn back and I lost
six<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.530> seven<00:01:19.830> seconds

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.650 

it<00:01:39.980> was<00:01:40.160> certainly<00:01:40.610> a<00:01:40.880> lot<00:01:41.030> more<00:01:41.090> slot<00:01:41.450> Korea

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
it was certainly a lot more slot Korea

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.700 
it was certainly a lot more slot Korea
this<00:01:41.780> morning<00:01:42.080> than<00:01:42.170> what<00:01:42.260> we<00:01:42.380> thought<00:01:42.500> it<00:01:42.560> was

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
this morning than what we thought it was

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.830 
this morning than what we thought it was
going<00:01:42.770> to<00:01:42.890> be<00:01:43.040> in<00:01:43.760> terms<00:01:44.030> of<00:01:44.150> thai<00:01:44.300> choice<00:01:44.720> i

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
going to be in terms of thai choice i

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.300 
going to be in terms of thai choice i
don't<00:01:44.990> think<00:01:45.170> there<00:01:45.260> was<00:01:45.350> really<00:01:45.590> a<00:01:45.740> rifle

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
don't think there was really a rifle

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.370 
don't think there was really a rifle
wrong<00:01:46.490> choice<00:01:46.760> we<00:01:47.600> went<00:01:47.720> on<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.960> hard<00:01:48.140> tyre

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
wrong choice we went on the hard tyre

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.920 
wrong choice we went on the hard tyre
which<00:01:48.590> which<00:01:49.250> worked<00:01:49.490> okay<00:01:49.820> but<00:01:50.330> you<00:01:50.840> know

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
which which worked okay but you know

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.330 
which which worked okay but you know
never<00:01:51.110> released<00:01:51.350> so<00:01:51.590> you<00:01:51.860> know<00:01:51.980> we<00:01:52.070> had<00:01:52.190> a<00:01:52.220> bit

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
never released so you know we had a bit

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.680 
never released so you know we had a bit
of<00:01:52.370> a<00:01:52.490> moment<00:01:52.790> on<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:52.940> first<00:01:53.120> stage<00:01:53.330> over<00:01:53.660> a

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
of a moment on the first stage over a

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.300 
of a moment on the first stage over a
jump<00:01:53.990> which<00:01:54.500> i<00:01:54.620> think<00:01:54.680> a<00:01:54.800> lot<00:01:54.830> of<00:01:54.980> people<00:01:55.070> got

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
jump which i think a lot of people got

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.700 
jump which i think a lot of people got
caught<00:01:55.520> out<00:01:55.550> by<00:01:55.700> but<00:01:56.510> other<00:01:56.630> net<00:01:56.870> no<00:01:57.500> real

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
caught out by but other net no real

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.350 
caught out by but other net no real
moments<00:01:58.100> just<00:01:58.310> really<00:01:58.640> just<00:01:58.760> have<00:01:58.910> to<00:01:59.060> find

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
moments just really just have to find

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.780 
moments just really just have to find
the<00:01:59.540> rhythm<00:01:59.690> in<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:00.340> just<00:02:01.340> try<00:02:01.460> and<00:02:01.520> get<00:02:01.610> a<00:02:01.670> bit

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
the rhythm in and just try and get a bit

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:22.170 
the rhythm in and just try and get a bit
more<00:02:01.880> confident

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.850 

first<00:02:23.180> two<00:02:23.330> stages<00:02:23.540> were<00:02:23.900> were<00:02:24.260> reasonable<00:02:24.710> I

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
first two stages were were reasonable I

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.500 
first two stages were were reasonable I
was<00:02:25.100> happy<00:02:25.280> with<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.550> first<00:02:25.760> stage<00:02:25.970> but<00:02:26.180> on

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
was happy with the first stage but on

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.860 
was happy with the first stage but on
the<00:02:26.660> last<00:02:26.690> stage<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.880> bit<00:02:28.880> of<00:02:28.970> rhythm<00:02:29.300> and<00:02:29.540> a<00:02:29.690> lot

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
the last stage a bit of rhythm and a lot

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.180 
the last stage a bit of rhythm and a lot
of<00:02:29.900> lost<00:02:30.200> bit<00:02:30.410> of<00:02:30.500> confidence<00:02:30.740> in<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.040> pace

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
of lost bit of confidence in the pace

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.600 
of lost bit of confidence in the pace
notes<00:02:31.370> so<00:02:31.610> I<00:02:31.640> I<00:02:31.910> I<00:02:32.480> back<00:02:32.870> off<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:33.080> little<00:02:33.320> bit

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
notes so I I I back off a little bit

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.070 
notes so I I I back off a little bit
maybe<00:02:34.610> a<00:02:34.730> bit<00:02:34.880> too<00:02:34.910> safe<00:02:35.270> than<00:02:35.480> we<00:02:35.600> we<00:02:35.930> give

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
maybe a bit too safe than we we give

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.480 
maybe a bit too safe than we we give
away<00:02:36.200> some<00:02:36.380> time<00:02:36.530> but<00:02:36.680> hopefully<00:02:37.220> this

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
away some time but hopefully this

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.860 
away some time but hopefully this
afternoon<00:02:37.880> we<00:02:38.000> can<00:02:38.120> push<00:02:38.270> a<00:02:38.360> bit<00:02:38.480> harder<00:02:38.780> and

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
afternoon we can push a bit harder and

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:58.240 
afternoon we can push a bit harder and
make<00:02:38.930> up<00:02:39.110> some<00:02:39.260> ground
