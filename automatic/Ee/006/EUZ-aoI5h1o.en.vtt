00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.740
 hello friends I'm mario arias sensor 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:11.150
 photography in art photography we are going to 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.330
 talk about a new goal of canon 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:18.019
 it's about 100 404 and a half 56 of the series 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.240
 l is version 2 with which this 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:22.730
 means that one of the three objectives 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.789
 most desired by lovers of 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.490
 nature photography 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.679
 bird watching etc are of 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.680
 congratulations since what the 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:35.320
 canon is to revamp this this lens a 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.320
 lens that has high demand among this 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.270
 kind of photographers who have these 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.890
 hobbies and certainly 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.590
 if it has evolved as you can 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.190
 imagine is to go to better is a 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.230
 objective that 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.899
 about everything they have wanted to do is 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.760
 improve considerably what is the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.579
 Focus speed is a speed of 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.879
 approach much faster with respect 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.280
 to version 1 this lens existed and 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.750
 also of course they have improved it in 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.570
 Regarding image stabilization 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.580
 eventually winning up to 4 steps when 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.530
 we have activated and the truth that good 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.600
 is another of the things that can be 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.000
 require targets of these 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.649
 characteristics that by certain volume and 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.509
 weight then to make the stabilizer 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:22.080
 optical image as it is an element 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.420
 really important at the time of a 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.330
 time of 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.310
 to improve and be able to perform better 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.900
 photographs regarding the construction 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.360
 for good is within what is the 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.490
 range of optics of the series l ie 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.040
 nothing to reproach about is a 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.920
 objective that conveys a solidity 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.200
 quite interesting comes prepared 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.960
 to be able to work in environments with 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.270
 moisture moisture with which a goal 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.950
 that many of its uses are going to be in 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.979
 outside of the logo, it is also a 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.590
 This important information we have taken from 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.050
 The box comes with the typical case while 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.240
 typical case you can also observe the 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.590
 parasol apart from warranties and 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.950
 instruction book with 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.990
 technical specifications of the product 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.610
 the 100 400 because it is thought 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.649
 obviously to be able to use them in 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.620
 full sensor format cameras 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.810
 the full frame type 26 is one of the 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.599
 five etcetera can also be 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.910
 undoubtedly use in cameras as 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:24.050
 this one of the seven plus two of the format to 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.660
 psc in this case then the focal length 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.540
 As you all know, it would be equivalent to 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.690
 have a 150 to 600 and well then for 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.340
 cameras of this kind cameras that is 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.770
 a sports photograph is one of his 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.950
 specialties then really 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:43.580
 have a 600 millimeters with this quality 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.450
 in a camera type this 7 frame of the logo 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.190
 it's all a blessing 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.770
 what I told you at the beginning of the 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.860
 focusing speed I already think what 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.680
 I can really appreciate that it is very 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.680
 fast silent at the same time recovers and 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.540
 it refreshes pretty well with which everything 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.910
 what the manufacturer announced to us 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.070
 I think it has led to it going to good 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.450
 port as novelties also has the 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.950
 possibility of blocking the 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.200
 focal length in any of its 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.700
 positions that good for certain 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.740
 type of photographs in which at 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.210
 better by the effect of gravity well 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.610
 let's say because they will be chopped 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.160
 contrapicados we can fix this 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.170
 focal distance to what we believe 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.060
 apart from the large focal length ring 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.830
 we have the possibility of if we put it 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.560
 in power manual focus switch 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.750
 make manual approaches with very good hoop 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.340
 that is, what is really what 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.030
 it works pretty well and it's pretty 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.800
 effective so I see here because we have 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.630
 between the four classic switches 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.240
 I would say the one that limits the 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.830
 approach from three meters to infinity or the 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.620
 which makes the total approach 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.360
 The minimum focusing distance is one 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.130
 a little less than one meter is 98 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.230
 centimeters 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.850
 in manual automatic focus he said to the 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.100
 possibility of disabling the 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.200
 image stabilizers and when it's 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.410
 activated then we have up to three modes 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.040
 stabilization 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.020
 to be able to choose according to our 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.090
 let's say preferences in the use of 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.040
 image stabilizer as for the 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.710
 technical elements so tell you what is 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:15.520
 composed in terms of readers scheme 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:17.950
 optical by 21 elements in 16 groups of 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.280
 these elements because some of them 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.620
 They are fluoride lenses and it is also very 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.520
 typical in the range of the canon l series 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.360
 lenses , 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.490
 of low dispersion there are lenses with 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.520
 anti-glare coatings that good 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.830
 Well to avoid all kinds of light 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.870
 parasitic chromatic aberrations and good 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.610
 Well, here you take great care that a 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.129
 objective of a professional series like 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.509
 species in 400 well get to have a 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:49.199
 new maintain quality levels 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:50.639
 how is the diameter of the 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:53.129
 filter so I see it's 77 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:55.379
 millimeters the weight of the objective is 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:57.180
 just over 1,600 grams we are 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:59.699
 speaking a kilo and a half long that good 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.250
 so to make a 100 400 it is 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:05.190
 within what is a weight index 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.630
 normal and good then certainly not 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.370
 is that it is a light objective not much 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.830
 less but yes we are talking a 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.300
 optics with very good performance with 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.060
 a very good sharpness with a good 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.620
 definition let's see focus and quality in 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.419
 all the life of the image and then 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.610
 because this makes the lens groups and 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.770
 the crystals then have one is one 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.449
 size that irremediably 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.580
 you have to hold for it comes very well 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:28.229
 then the hoop that comes to power 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.960
 move the center of gravity of the 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.370
 typical forward set use 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.910
 a monkey stand with this guy 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:38.699
 of objectives or also because not a 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.250
 tripod say that this hoop will bother 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:44.100
 you could get to remove a little more the 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:48.780
 diaphragm is 9 rounded blades and the 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:53.520
 factor of reproductions of 0.31 that are 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:55.560
 Technical data minus 031 is data 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:00.870
 less less precise technicians so 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:02.880
 nothing I think by the 2200 2000 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.310
 Sorry, we have it on our page 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.169
 web photography art point is well I think 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.580
 that we are facing a good goal is not 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:11.310
 of the cheapest ones but yes we are going to 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.680
 get in return a quality that good 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.250
 Well, when better used optics 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:19.260
 that are not original in our 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.419
 teams, I do not say they are bad this 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.220
 kind of goals but then a 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.830
 original optics is sometimes about the 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.260
 price we end up getting to see something 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.639
 Hence I think that gives you at that point 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.620
 and that the 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:34.470
 price difference so to those who 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.690
 be behind him I hope that I have 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.430
 could clarify something with this video and 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.860
 our website through 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.840
 art photography forum then you can 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.300
 ask any question and of course 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:48.030
 buy is this goal of this great 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:52.080
 piece that canon has evolved and that 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:54.450
 it's about 100 404 and a half 56 l version 2 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:57.680
 thank you friends and nothing we see in 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.680
 next videos see you later
