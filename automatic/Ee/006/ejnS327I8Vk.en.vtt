00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
here is my middle bar male bar spinach

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.880 
here is my middle bar male bar spinach
or<00:00:24.279> sometimes<00:00:25.279> it's<00:00:25.490> called<00:00:25.640> Indian<00:00:26.210> spinach

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
similar to the regular spinach that we

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.110 
similar to the regular spinach that we
know<00:00:32.450> from<00:00:32.629> America<00:00:33.640> this<00:00:34.640> is<00:00:34.789> one<00:00:34.940> of<00:00:35.030> the

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
know from America this is one of the

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.260 
know from America this is one of the
green<00:00:35.390> variety<00:00:36.489> this<00:00:37.489> plant<00:00:37.910> here<00:00:38.030> is<00:00:38.149> about

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
green variety this plant here is about

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.600 
green variety this plant here is about
four<00:00:38.329> inch<00:00:38.840> tall<00:00:39.289> the<00:00:40.039> stock<00:00:40.309> is<00:00:40.460> actually

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
four inch tall the stock is actually

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.840 
four inch tall the stock is actually
very<00:00:40.940> wet<00:00:41.300> very<00:00:41.329> very<00:00:41.899> very<00:00:42.289> big<00:00:42.530> and<00:00:43.070> here's

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
very wet very very very big and here's

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.369 
very wet very very very big and here's
the<00:00:44.030> other<00:00:44.120> one<00:00:44.300> you<00:00:44.660> can<00:00:44.840> see<00:00:45.020> side-by-side

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
the other one you can see side-by-side

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.380 
the other one you can see side-by-side
this<00:00:45.920> is<00:00:46.070> another<00:00:46.309> one<00:00:46.520> that<00:00:46.550> I<00:00:46.789> actually

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
this is another one that I actually

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.229 
this is another one that I actually
germinated<00:00:48.140> it<00:00:48.260> and<00:00:48.770> small<00:00:49.460> one<00:00:49.640> this<00:00:50.059> one<00:00:50.210> I

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
germinated it and small one this one I

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.869 
germinated it and small one this one I
germinate<00:00:50.660> about<00:00:50.840> a<00:00:50.870> month<00:00:51.109> ago<00:00:51.260> so<00:00:51.820> here<00:00:52.820> you

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
germinate about a month ago so here you

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.000 
germinate about a month ago so here you
go<00:00:53.000> and<00:00:53.329> of<00:00:54.050> course<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.350> mid-block<00:00:54.590> spinach

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
go and of course the mid-block spinach

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.400 
go and of course the mid-block spinach
is<00:00:55.250> a<00:00:55.280> fine<00:00:55.579> and<00:00:56.949> you<00:00:57.949> require<00:00:58.250> a<00:00:58.280> lot<00:00:58.640> of<00:00:58.670> heat

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
is a fine and you require a lot of heat

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.439 
is a fine and you require a lot of heat
hot<00:01:00.410> weather<00:01:00.829> because<00:01:01.789> it's<00:01:01.940> made<00:01:02.090> of<00:01:02.239> two<00:01:02.420> I

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
hot weather because it's made of two I

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.010 
hot weather because it's made of two I
guess<00:01:02.899> India<00:01:03.320> and<00:01:03.590> throughout<00:01:04.339> Asia<00:01:04.580> and<00:01:05.020> like

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
guess India and throughout Asia and like

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.179 
guess India and throughout Asia and like
I<00:01:06.049> said<00:01:06.200> this<00:01:06.320> is<00:01:06.439> one<00:01:06.590> of<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:06.770> green<00:01:06.950> variety

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
I said this is one of the green variety

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.359 
I said this is one of the green variety
it<00:01:08.090> can<00:01:08.270> go<00:01:08.450> very<00:01:08.479> prolifically<00:01:09.409> if<00:01:10.220> the

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
it can go very prolifically if the

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.240 
it can go very prolifically if the
weather<00:01:10.549> is<00:01:10.700> right<00:01:11.590> it<00:01:12.590> requires<00:01:12.979> some

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
weather is right it requires some

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.770 
weather is right it requires some
humidity<00:01:14.200> and<00:01:15.200> likely<00:01:15.530> a<00:01:15.650> lot<00:01:15.799> of<00:01:15.890> water<00:01:16.310> so

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
humidity and likely a lot of water so

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.420 
humidity and likely a lot of water so
anyway<00:01:17.780> here<00:01:18.020> I<00:01:18.049> have<00:01:18.200> another<00:01:18.470> trellis<00:01:19.040> here

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
anyway here I have another trellis here

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.840 
anyway here I have another trellis here
this<00:01:20.150> trellis<00:01:20.390> is<00:01:20.600> about<00:01:20.750> 24<00:01:21.229> inches<00:01:21.850> across

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
this trellis is about 24 inches across

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.370 
this trellis is about 24 inches across
and<00:01:24.009> six<00:01:25.009> feet<00:01:25.610> all<00:01:26.509> the<00:01:26.570> way<00:01:26.810> to<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.079> top

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
and six feet all the way to the top

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.219 
and six feet all the way to the top
right<00:01:27.710> there<00:01:28.009> okay<00:01:28.820> this<00:01:29.240> is<00:01:29.390> planning<00:01:29.869> a<00:01:29.930> room

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
right there okay this is planning a room

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.770 
right there okay this is planning a room
for<00:01:30.409> them<00:01:30.500> to<00:01:30.560> climb<00:01:30.979> and<00:01:31.450> when<00:01:32.450> your<00:01:32.570> harvest

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
for them to climb and when your harvest

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.990 
for them to climb and when your harvest
move<00:01:33.619> our<00:01:33.740> spinach<00:01:34.130> you<00:01:34.369> can<00:01:34.490> cut<00:01:34.700> off<00:01:34.820> the

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
move our spinach you can cut off the

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.810 
move our spinach you can cut off the
leaves<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:36.049> stem<00:01:36.290> as<00:01:36.470> well<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:37.430> stem<00:01:37.640> is

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
leaves and the stem as well the stem is

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.569 
leaves and the stem as well the stem is
actually<00:01:38.149> very<00:01:38.270> second<00:01:38.720> one<00:01:38.840> to<00:01:39.710> leave<00:01:39.890> it's

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
actually very second one to leave it's

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.100 
actually very second one to leave it's
also<00:01:40.729> succulent<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:41.689> it's<00:01:42.380> thick<00:01:42.740> green<00:01:43.310> leaf

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
also succulent and it's thick green leaf

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.319 
also succulent and it's thick green leaf
right<00:01:45.110> now<00:01:45.290> is<00:01:45.439> about<00:01:45.530> maybe<00:01:46.040> 2<00:01:46.640> inches<00:01:47.000> 2<00:01:47.240> and

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
right now is about maybe 2 inches 2 and

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.039 
right now is about maybe 2 inches 2 and
1/2<00:01:47.420> inches<00:01:47.719> okay<00:01:48.409> and<00:01:48.939> it<00:01:49.939> can<00:01:50.060> actually<00:01:50.450> grow

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
1/2 inches okay and it can actually grow

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.740 
1/2 inches okay and it can actually grow
to<00:01:51.259> about<00:01:51.350> maybe<00:01:51.680> even<00:01:51.799> 5<00:01:52.250> inches<00:01:52.280> a<00:01:52.909> big<00:01:53.360> it

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
to about maybe even 5 inches a big it

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.679 
to about maybe even 5 inches a big it
