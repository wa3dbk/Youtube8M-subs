00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:11.799
 well my been seen we are already 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:15.039
 seen the trailer with its titles more 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.600
 well that the milk of 20.5 care that 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:19.900
 before saying anything I have to say that 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.660
 I think it's a game but it's already 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.840
 well be already already we begin to tire a 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.640
 little bit of both during the author of both 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.800
 macarra language that yes that is very 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.399
 well but it is that it is already charged 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.350
 he knows tired not so much to leave you scattered 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.379
 around the city ​​and the bigger the better 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.350
 if in the end it does not end up happening the game 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.569
 if what you're going to do combined by 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.140
 if the air monkfish if you do not know what that 

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:48.870
 if bad is an airplane that if a day yes day 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.300
 as well 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.579
 until when to search until when 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.920
 Well, I have to say that I think as 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.470
 you until now have not gone both 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.079
 giant photo 4 I liked it I finished it 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.790
 but I thought it was the bomb that they said and 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.500
 the restaurant photos I have not played them and 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.940
 is andrade for this new partner and I know 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.760
 to justify but I do not seem overwhelmed 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.960
 but this presents certain novelties that 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.300
 they sell very interesting 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.800
 the fact of having three protagonists the 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.570
 be able to exchange between them in everything 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.490
 moment we saw an example in the trailer 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.010
 of how a robbery can serve three 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.440
 bands one being the rapper the 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.390
 to enter the office and do 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.280
 that post or whatever that was 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.290
 being a sniper in an index 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.210
 opposite covering the one in the 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.600
 rappel and another driving in helicopter 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.940
 I think that they bring novelties to the 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.190
 saga that were not present in 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.260
 previous installments and that alone made 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.080
 for me the game is very interesting and 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.490
 then it's the exchange between characters 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.010
 they are not the ones who always give but also 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.080
 in his day to day we can see that he is 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.940
 being one then change to the other and see 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.770
 what are we doing then to see 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.570
 It seems very interesting and that it offers 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.440
 many new things so that it is not a 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.360
 sandbox without good after this 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.060
 short dissertation of yours 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.690
 I have to say 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:15.760
 that is, not 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.760
 the news does not change 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.920
 Never never 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.120
 and you have also commented that you can 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.790
 choose a sniper you can 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:39.280
 exchange rare we are already faced with a 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.280
 incredible game mechanics and how big 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:57.170
 you tell yourself why why not 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.170
 then exactly 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:18.440
 now it is OK 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:18.440
 it's good enough so much that much game 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.800
