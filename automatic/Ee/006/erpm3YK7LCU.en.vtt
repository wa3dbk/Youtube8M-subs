battlefield series is how I got where I

am today I'm with my youtube channel so
it's<00:01:44.130> kind<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.460> hard<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.759> see<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.299> somewhat

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
it's kind of hard to see that somewhat

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.499 
it's kind of hard to see that somewhat
of<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.320> community<00:01:46.799> has<00:01:47.070> not<00:01:47.850> really<00:01:48.119> taken<00:01:48.450> a

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
of the community has not really taken a

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.929 
of the community has not really taken a
liking<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.899> hardline<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.740> has<00:01:50.189> affected<00:01:50.729> my

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
liking to hardline and has affected my

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.300 
liking to hardline and has affected my
viewership<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.720> whatnot<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.920> hence<00:01:53.100> why

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
viewership and whatnot this is hence why

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.010 
viewership and whatnot this is hence why
I'm<00:01:53.460> trying<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.880> break<00:01:54.090> off<00:01:54.299> into<00:01:54.509> other<00:01:54.659> games

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
I'm trying to break off into other games

I'm trying to break off into other games
as<00:01:55.259> well<00:01:55.439> along<00:01:55.950> with<00:01:56.009> hardline<00:01:56.579> but<00:01:57.329> back<00:01:57.540> to

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
as well along with hardline but back to

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.450 
as well along with hardline but back to
the<00:01:57.750> topic<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:58.259> battlefield<00:01:58.799> hardline<00:01:58.829> I

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
the topic of battlefield hardline I

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.399 
the topic of battlefield hardline I
personally<00:02:00.000> believe<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.780> lot<00:02:01.290> of

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
personally believe that a lot of

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.139 
personally believe that a lot of
reviewers<00:02:01.799> are<00:02:02.130> giving<00:02:02.460> hardline<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> tough

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
reviewers are giving hardline a tough

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.060 
reviewers are giving hardline a tough
time<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.689> still<00:02:04.530> don't<00:02:04.710> think<00:02:04.770> people

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
time I still don't think people

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.490 
time I still don't think people
understand<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:06.090> hardline<00:02:06.930> was<00:02:07.110> made<00:02:07.320> by

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
understand that hardline was made by

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.949 
understand that hardline was made by
visceral<00:02:08.009> with<00:02:08.429> some<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.849> dices<00:02:09.239> help<00:02:09.450> along

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
visceral with some of dices help along

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.650 
visceral with some of dices help along
the<00:02:09.989> side<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.530> course<00:02:10.770> but<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.940> don't<00:02:12.540> think

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
the side of course but I don't think

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.000 
the side of course but I don't think
people<00:02:12.989> fully<00:02:13.200> understand

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
people fully understand

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.250 
people fully understand
that<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.580> visceral<00:02:15.060> first<00:02:15.720> try<00:02:16.019> at<00:02:16.080> a

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
that this is visceral first try at a

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.229 
that this is visceral first try at a
battlefield<00:02:16.560> game<00:02:16.769> and<00:02:17.159> I<00:02:17.849> think<00:02:17.909> they<00:02:18.180> did

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
battlefield game and I think they did

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.330 
battlefield game and I think they did
exceptionally<00:02:19.170> well<00:02:19.349> for<00:02:19.379> their<00:02:19.650> first<00:02:19.860> try<00:02:20.099> a

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
exceptionally well for their first try a

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.429 
exceptionally well for their first try a
much<00:02:20.790> more<00:02:21.000> stable<00:02:21.299> launch<00:02:21.720> than<00:02:22.019> battlefield

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:22.439 
much more stable launch than battlefield

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.039 
much more stable launch than battlefield
4<00:02:22.620> had<00:02:22.829> at<00:02:23.430> least<00:02:24.120> from<00:02:24.269> what<00:02:24.420> I've<00:02:24.569> seen<00:02:24.599> so

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
4 had at least from what I've seen so

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:25.490 
4 had at least from what I've seen so
far

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
far

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.229 
far
absolutely<00:02:26.310> I'm<00:02:26.400> not<00:02:26.549> gonna<00:02:26.670> disagree<00:02:27.209> that

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
absolutely I'm not gonna disagree that

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.420 
absolutely I'm not gonna disagree that
the<00:02:27.780> game<00:02:27.989> has<00:02:28.200> problems<00:02:28.680> no<00:02:29.220> doubt

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
the game has problems no doubt

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:37.130 
the game has problems no doubt
destruction<00:02:31.220> weapon<00:02:32.220> balance<00:02:35.329> all<00:02:36.329> of<00:02:36.599> that

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
destruction weapon balance all of that

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.199 
destruction weapon balance all of that
and<00:02:37.349> I<00:02:37.950> fully<00:02:38.190> believe<00:02:38.579> that<00:02:38.819> these<00:02:38.940> things

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
and I fully believe that these things

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.210 
and I fully believe that these things
will<00:02:39.450> be<00:02:39.629> addressed<00:02:40.019> but<00:02:40.319> within<00:02:40.500> time<00:02:40.890> I

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
will be addressed but within time I

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.089 
will be addressed but within time I
think<00:02:41.760> hardline<00:02:42.209> is<00:02:42.569> a<00:02:42.959> great<00:02:43.470> filler<00:02:43.799> game

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
think hardline is a great filler game

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.699 
think hardline is a great filler game
it's<00:02:44.760> something<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.510> can<00:02:45.750> place<00:02:46.440> hold

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
it's something that can place hold

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.229 
it's something that can place hold
another<00:02:47.129> game<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.609> will<00:02:47.730> be<00:02:47.819> coming<00:02:48.000> out<00:02:48.209> in

another game that will be coming out in

another game that will be coming out in
the<00:02:48.329> future<00:02:49.190> personally<00:02:50.190> at<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.090> time<00:02:51.299> being

the future personally at the time being

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.229 
the future personally at the time being
I<00:02:51.840> don't<00:02:52.260> see<00:02:52.470> hardline<00:02:52.920> lasting<00:02:53.519> a<00:02:53.730> long

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239

amount<00:02:54.540> of<00:02:54.599> time<00:02:54.659> I<00:02:55.109> see<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.590> lasting<00:02:56.159> till<00:02:56.400> its

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
amount of time I see it lasting till its

amount of time I see it lasting till its
last<00:02:57.030> DLC<00:02:57.599> and<00:02:57.840> that's<00:02:58.349> probably<00:02:58.829> it<00:02:59.099> for<00:02:59.579> it

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
last DLC and that's probably it for it

their own IP completely take it out of
the<00:03:21.870> battlefield<00:03:22.169> name<00:03:22.470> because<00:03:22.980> that<00:03:23.129> seems

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
the battlefield name because that seems

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.309 
the battlefield name because that seems
like<00:03:23.609> what<00:03:24.060> people<00:03:24.329> have<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.510> problem<00:03:24.780> with<00:03:25.079> and

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
like what people have a problem with and

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.729 
like what people have a problem with and
I<00:03:25.980> don't<00:03:26.160> mind<00:03:26.340> if<00:03:26.489> they<00:03:26.609> take<00:03:26.849> away<00:03:26.879> the<00:03:27.120> name

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
I don't mind if they take away the name

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.990 
I don't mind if they take away the name
battlefield<00:03:28.739> from<00:03:29.099> hardline<00:03:29.579> I<00:03:29.760> think

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
battlefield from hardline I think

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000 
battlefield from hardline I think
hardline<00:03:30.359> is<00:03:30.449> a<00:03:30.510> solid<00:03:30.870> game<00:03:31.049> I<00:03:31.349> think<00:03:31.709> it<00:03:31.829> has

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
hardline is a solid game I think it has

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.470 
hardline is a solid game I think it has
a<00:03:32.040> nice<00:03:32.250> concept<00:03:32.819> and<00:03:33.000> everything<00:03:33.299> like<00:03:33.419> that

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
a nice concept and everything like that

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.809 
a nice concept and everything like that
but<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.650> think<00:03:35.040> people<00:03:35.220> should<00:03:35.639> really

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
but I think people should really

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.610 
but I think people should really
coincide<00:03:36.449> with<00:03:36.480> each<00:03:36.690> other<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.260> two<00:03:37.410> halves

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
coincide with each other the two halves

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.409 
coincide with each other the two halves
the<00:03:37.829> community<00:03:38.250> that<00:03:38.519> are<00:03:38.639> split<00:03:38.849> off<00:03:39.060> between

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
the community that are split off between

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.629 
the community that are split off between
Oh<00:03:39.720> hard<00:03:40.109> lines<00:03:40.319> better<00:03:40.560> or<00:03:40.829> battlefield<00:03:41.280> 4<00:03:41.609> is

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
Oh hard lines better or battlefield 4 is

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.599 
Oh hard lines better or battlefield 4 is
better<00:03:41.940> we<00:03:42.780> should<00:03:42.930> just<00:03:43.079> drop<00:03:43.410> that<00:03:43.609> because

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
better we should just drop that because

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.180 
better we should just drop that because
the<00:03:44.910> main<00:03:45.120> reason<00:03:45.540> is<00:03:45.690> we<00:03:46.260> love<00:03:46.500> battlefield

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
the main reason is we love battlefield

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.629 
the main reason is we love battlefield
equally<00:03:47.790> because<00:03:48.480> of<00:03:48.660> what<00:03:48.870> all-out<00:03:49.709> chaos

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639
