00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.590
 well here I am with a new video of 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.470
 teach how you see is a sheet of the 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:13.550
 fine a playstation 2 teach how 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:16.219
 fix anything let's see then for 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.930
 start if you want to fix the 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:22.910
 disc player you can do one thing 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.730
 how is this worth the disc will spin more 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.580
 fast, it's worth, you see, she turns a lot 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.619
 faster than I'll open you can 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.279
 use this very peculiar tool the 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.279
 which already does well 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.830
 and good 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.240
 Well, the truth is that very resistant 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.440
 They said it was very difficult to open 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.440
 let's do this well 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.720
 still very tough to take this out of 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.720
 here 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.810
 I do not know why the good moment here 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.960
 caught a peculiar tool for 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.960
 do 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.820
 as you see here we have taken this part 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.510
 internal only remains to remove the reader 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.920
 a good moment 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.920
 the more and more part 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.500
 Well as you see does not come out is a bit 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.080
 resistant so let's try another 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.820
 thing here I found a way to 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:34.350
 open it is not prying 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.350
 but to put the camera 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.610
 here for example 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:45.730
 I do not know if it will look good but you can 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.810
 do a bit of leverage 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.810
 so very well 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.800
 inside 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.200
 April 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.689
 to me 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.340
 well this already 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.340
 revealing its interior 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.230
 A) Yes 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.380
 x 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:36.720
 to 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:41.069
 and all its interior 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:45.170
 and here you have your interior 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.170
 here in here of very interesting pieces 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.050
 so you can end up giving some 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.050
 taps 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.560
 well then here until you already see how 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.490
 fix 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.100
 a playstation 2 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.510
 another video I'm sorry for describing but 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.010
 I tried to open it 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.790
 how is this since it is the interior 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.640
 here you go 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.220
 its components 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.760
 that here I like this this is already 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.239
 arranged like this 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.239
 good 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.439
 because here it is over a greeting
