00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.280
 and that's everyone knows 2009 which is 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.260
 find for a brand new video 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.690
 information so just a 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.150
 american issued a hypothesis that I 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.640
 finds it totally plausible so a 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.440
 hypothesis about the fact of the release of the 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.870
 date of the beta so a specific date 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.489
 for the beta of black ops 3 so we did not 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.440
 still not had at the moment is 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.900
 an American simply discovered 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.199
 what could possibly be an easter 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:51.050
 eggs made by acti vision rather 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:54.170
 treyarch in the first teaser so 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.350
 you know 7.7 this teaser pretty form of 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.670
 film or reports we see so there 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.860
 you are currently seeing some pictures 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.019
 and so simply in this teaser 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.580
 we can see a lot of things so 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.610
 you have to know that two during this 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.380
 teaser during interviews and during 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.760
 reports which are done so for 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.170
 6000 simulate a little in quotation marks a 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.930
 TV channel and quite simply 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.820
 we always arrive at the same images 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.240
 so at one date is finally a 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.460
 One hour just is 6:21 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.130
 so simply when we say 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.500
 6:21 we see it everywhere we can say 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.480
 oh yeah but it turns out they had 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.600
 a little laziness in quotation marks da 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.490
 each time changed their eller and everything 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.100
 so since it was a little bit between 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.140
 quotes a template so he edit 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.030
 not seen them it was not very 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.480
 important ones etc 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.010
 he did not care but if we push the 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.080
 thing 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.370
 this sequel comes back enormously time 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.420
 she even comes back to get off 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:58.460
 percentage so 7 6 2 6 2 1 is everything 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.430
 simply in america you have to know 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.410
 so of course that the month their height 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.179
 when writing a date is before the 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:10.940
 day from which why the end of the trailer of 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:13.340
 bo3 so we have the 11 6 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.200
 so just 6 November so 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.030
 has reversed every time and everything 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.970
 just for us french we 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.470
 could not have said bah like 6,21 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.940
 it's a date and everything because everything 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.400
 just for us maybe has ya 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.500
 well twelve months what is real and all 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.390
 just so we have everything we do 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.730
 not be careful but for an american 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.560
 their can be very useful especially when 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.530
 this is easter eggs we all 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.630
 simply 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.690
 he speculated that the beta will be 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.060
 available June 21st 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.680
 simply the 6 would be represented 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.600
 the month of June so you have to know well 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.370
 sure June is the sixth month of 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.480
 the year for those who do not know good 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.080
 well my opinion everyone of his 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.220
 luckily I would like to say 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.350
 this way I think if you know 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.600
 no way you do not have the age to play 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.840
 to call of duty in quotation marks so 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.540
 so you have to know that there is 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.560
 was a lot of little things because 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.730
 that as you said it can be 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.200
 seemed to be a new one and they 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.900
 take it back so you have to be careful 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.610
 but there was also a tweet from david 22 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.930
 art so that simply I do not know 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.390
 too much where exactly that's the 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.850
 community manager finally templon a 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.050
 treyarch employee who communicated 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.060
 more info so we know who 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.550
 communicates a lot of info is everything 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.489
 he just said that the beta will be 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.670
 available between gamescom is 3 the 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.260
 3 simply runs from the 16th to the 18th 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.120
 June 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.310
 and for what there is beta to 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.350
 purposes of the gamescom excuse me it will be 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.030
 in August I think August 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.780
 September is always backwards 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.540
 in these waters 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:48.200
 so here you have to know that if 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:50.880
 it's June 21st it's very possible 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.459
 so at that moment that the beta comes out to 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.200
 that time, of course, was that 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.549
 assumptions one must take with 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.780
 tweezers was not going right now 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.430
 tell everyone must be good enough 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.200
 it is sure that this is what I and all 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.790
 bleeding had this is only a hypothesis 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.320
 so here of course I think we 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.269
 would like everyone to come out during 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.489
 summer vacation and not at the time of the 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.650
 angry rally because I think it 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.019
 would give us all a little power 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.880
 get up during the summer holidays etc 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.680
 but I think that also at this level 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.100
 activision-blizzard it's not 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.510
 stupid 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.519
 they know very well that at the level of 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.940
 communication it is better to leave them 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:26.400
 things during a holiday that during 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.990
 weeks of work etc 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.090
 after that it is not for them 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.669
 go out the dlc on a saturday or a friday 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.940
 but that's it but it's true that it's 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.880
 better to go out a game one for 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.780
 vacation or just 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.950
 leak bac for example a dlc or a beta 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.780
 as at present during 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.030
 vacation 4 simply there are a lot 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.830
 more traffic between quotation marks on 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.270
 and so precisely that brings them 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.680
 surely more etc 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.540
 we see if I hope this 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.550
 information will have pleased you and you will have 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.080
 is a pleasure and I hope it will be 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.300
 true because really it would be great 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.830
 it occupies us very well for us I 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.960
 think at least a week of vacation 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.860
 so it would be super nice and so if I 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.510
 mean the next for new 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.530
 videos it was gaulle 1.9 and it will be 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.530
 more everyone
