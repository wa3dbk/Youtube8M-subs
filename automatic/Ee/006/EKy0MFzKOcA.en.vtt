these<00:00:01.290> are<00:00:01.439> three<00:00:01.650> in<00:00:01.770> my<00:00:01.860> piston<00:00:02.070> because

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
these are three in my piston because

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.169 
these are three in my piston because
one's<00:00:02.669> new

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
one's new

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.629 
one's new
this<00:00:03.419> one's<00:00:06.500> partially<00:00:07.500> new<00:00:07.740> and<00:00:08.069> this<00:00:08.220> one<00:00:08.400> is

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
this one's partially new and this one is

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.829 
this one's partially new and this one is
totally<00:00:09.570> screwed<00:00:12.980> these<00:00:14.210> pistons<00:00:15.210> have<00:00:15.540> all

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
totally screwed these pistons have all

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.480 
totally screwed these pistons have all
been<00:00:16.109> destroyed<00:00:16.619> by<00:00:17.600> are<00:00:18.600> these<00:00:18.840> two<00:00:19.430> by<00:00:20.430> the

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
been destroyed by are these two by the

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.019 
been destroyed by are these two by the
Rings<00:00:21.769> now<00:00:22.769> what<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:22.980> learned<00:00:23.189> from<00:00:23.310> my<00:00:23.550> nice

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
Rings now what I learned from my nice

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.320 
Rings now what I learned from my nice
little<00:00:24.269> two-stroke<00:00:24.630> books<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:26.119> I<00:00:27.119> thought

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
little two-stroke books is I thought

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.529 
little two-stroke books is I thought
that<00:00:27.539> spring<00:00:27.810> tension<00:00:28.260> against<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.920> bore

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
that spring tension against the bore

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.970 
that spring tension against the bore
right<00:00:30.539> here<00:00:31.489> kept<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.940> compression<00:00:33.600> or<00:00:34.350> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
right here kept the compression or the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.319 
right here kept the compression or the
explosion<00:00:35.899> between<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.260> cylinder<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.329> the

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
explosion between the cylinder and the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.040 
explosion between the cylinder and the
top<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.989> cylinder<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:41.059> the<00:00:42.059> piston<00:00:42.360> crown

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
top of the cylinder and the piston crown

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.290 
top of the cylinder and the piston crown
which<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.860> wrong<00:00:45.950> this<00:00:46.950> one<00:00:47.219> as<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:47.969> can<00:00:48.149> see

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
which is wrong this one as you can see

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.270 
which is wrong this one as you can see
it's<00:00:48.539> got<00:00:48.690> blow-by<00:00:49.079> going<00:00:49.770> all<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.010> way<00:00:50.039> down

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
it's got blow-by going all the way down

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.850 
it's got blow-by going all the way down
the<00:00:50.399> sides<00:00:50.809> that's<00:00:51.809> where<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.289> fire<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.800> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
the sides that's where the fire and the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.319 
the sides that's where the fire and the
flame<00:00:53.070> go<00:00:53.309> down<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.610> sides<00:00:53.820> which<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> big

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
flame go down the sides which is a big

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.680 
flame go down the sides which is a big
no-no

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
no-no

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.740 
no-no
it's<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.710> can't<00:00:55.980> happen<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.430> way<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.789> it's

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
it's it can't happen that way and it's

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.990 
it's it can't happen that way and it's
slightly<00:00:58.109> seized<00:00:58.590> which<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.460> not<00:00:59.609> good<00:00:59.820> you

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
slightly seized which is not good you

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.029 
slightly seized which is not good you
can<00:01:00.420> see<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.690> big<00:01:00.930> round<00:01:01.140> oval<00:01:01.620> right<00:01:01.770> here

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
can see this big round oval right here

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.149 
can see this big round oval right here
that<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.239> exhaust<00:01:03.539> port<00:01:03.840> which<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.500> right

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
that is the exhaust port which is right

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.000 
that is the exhaust port which is right
here<00:01:08.450> now<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.510> bottom<00:01:09.869> ring<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.350> frozen<00:01:10.650> in

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
here now the bottom ring is frozen in

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.320 
here now the bottom ring is frozen in
place<00:01:11.189> which<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.640> should<00:01:11.790> not<00:01:11.939> be<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.299> should

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
place which it should not be it should

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.420 
place which it should not be it should
be<00:01:12.659> able<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.900> move<00:01:13.080> around<00:01:13.229> like<00:01:13.860> like<00:01:14.189> these

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
be able to move around like like these

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.149 
be able to move around like like these
new<00:01:14.640> ones<00:01:14.850> they<00:01:15.750> move<00:01:15.990> around<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.740> around<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
new ones they move around and around and

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.399 
new ones they move around and around and
around<00:01:17.220> well<00:01:17.880> we<00:01:18.000> don't<00:01:18.119> move<00:01:18.270> they're<00:01:19.110> free

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
around well we don't move they're free

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.350 
around well we don't move they're free
they<00:01:20.630> they<00:01:21.950> conform<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.159> cylinder<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
they they conform to this cylinder the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.560 
they they conform to this cylinder the
thing<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.939> cylinders<00:01:26.939> around<00:01:27.330> but

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
thing is that the cylinders around but

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.060 
thing is that the cylinders around but
the<00:01:27.659> pistons<00:01:28.020> are<00:01:28.140> slightly<00:01:28.549> egg-shaped<00:01:31.070> so

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
the pistons are slightly egg-shaped so

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.490 
the pistons are slightly egg-shaped so
that<00:01:32.579> allows<00:01:33.509> for<00:01:33.750> expansion<00:01:34.020> and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
that allows for expansion and

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.460 
that allows for expansion and
contraction<00:01:34.680> because<00:01:35.450> aluminium<00:01:36.450> which<00:01:37.290> of

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
contraction because aluminium which of

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.190 
contraction because aluminium which of
the<00:01:37.530> Pistons<00:01:37.890> are<00:01:38.070> made<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.570> has<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> different

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
the Pistons are made of has a different

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.620 
the Pistons are made of has a different
heat<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.920> shrink<00:01:41.250> rate<00:01:41.520> than<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.030> cast-iron

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
heat and shrink rate than the cast-iron

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.510 
heat and shrink rate than the cast-iron
cylinders<00:01:44.420> so<00:01:45.439> when<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.560> gets<00:01:46.649> heat<00:01:46.950> heated<00:01:47.369> up

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
cylinders so when it gets heat heated up

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.030 
cylinders so when it gets heat heated up
it<00:01:47.810> expands<00:01:48.810> at<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.140> different<00:01:49.439> rate<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.829> it

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
it expands at a different rate and it

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.800 
it expands at a different rate and it
cools<00:01:50.220> down<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.549> different<00:01:51.030> rate<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.450> needs<00:01:51.659> to

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
cools down a different rate and needs to

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.350 
cools down a different rate and needs to
be<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.170> povel<00:01:52.680> shape<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.939> keep<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.240> from

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
be that povel shape to keep it from

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.270 
be that povel shape to keep it from
seizing<00:01:56.990> now<00:01:57.990> what<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.200> found<00:01:58.530> out<00:01:58.920> about<00:01:59.040> the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
seizing now what I found out about the

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.190 
seizing now what I found out about the
Rings<00:01:59.520> in<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.240> nice<00:02:00.450> little<00:02:00.479> book<00:02:00.990> which<00:02:01.170> is

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
Rings in this nice little book which is

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.959 
Rings in this nice little book which is
really<00:02:01.530> interesting<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.369> thought<00:02:02.579> spring

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
really interesting is I thought spring

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.260 
really interesting is I thought spring
tension<00:02:03.450> held<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.560> Rings<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.130> piston<00:02:05.549> or

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
tension held the Rings to the piston or

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.540 
tension held the Rings to the piston or
held<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.840> Rings<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.799> cylinder<00:02:08.340> walls

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
held the Rings to the cylinder walls

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.199 
held the Rings to the cylinder walls
right<00:02:08.849> here<00:02:09.179> which<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.050> false<00:02:10.849> what<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.000> book

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
right here which is false what the book

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.910 
right here which is false what the book
says<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.989> that

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
says is that

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.440 
says is that
the<00:02:14.069> explosion<00:02:15.080> pushes<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.620> piston<00:02:16.860> down<00:02:17.450> the

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
the explosion pushes the piston down the

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.640 
the explosion pushes the piston down the
actual<00:02:18.900> explosion<00:02:19.370> gets<00:02:20.370> in<00:02:21.440> behind<00:02:22.440> the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
actual explosion gets in behind the

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.500 
actual explosion gets in behind the
rings<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:23.450> expands<00:02:24.450> them<00:02:25.730> out<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.270> sides

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
rings and expands them out to the sides

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.210 
rings and expands them out to the sides
of<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.890> cylinder<00:02:30.410> in<00:02:31.410> order<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.800> do<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.069> the

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
of the cylinder in order to do that the

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.100 
of the cylinder in order to do that the
Rings<00:02:32.430> have<00:02:32.580> got<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.760> be<00:02:32.850> free<00:02:33.090> now<00:02:33.270> if<00:02:33.300> the

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
Rings have got to be free now if the

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.490 
Rings have got to be free now if the
piston<00:02:34.440> has<00:02:34.500> gotten<00:02:34.800> too<00:02:34.980> hot<00:02:35.190> or<00:02:35.459> you've<00:02:35.790> used

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
piston has gotten too hot or you've used

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.190 
piston has gotten too hot or you've used
a<00:02:37.500> gummy<00:02:39.920> fuel<00:02:40.920> additive<00:02:41.489> for<00:02:42.330> two-stroke<00:02:42.989> oil

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
a gummy fuel additive for two-stroke oil

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.000 
a gummy fuel additive for two-stroke oil
and<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:44.220> ring<00:02:45.120> sees<00:02:45.450> in<00:02:45.780> in<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.620> piston

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
and the ring sees in in the piston

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.040 
and the ring sees in in the piston
itself<00:02:47.430> that<00:02:48.150> you're<00:02:48.300> going<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.480> get<00:02:48.630> blow<00:02:48.870> by

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
itself that you're going to get blow by

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.420 
itself that you're going to get blow by
it<00:02:49.110> you're<00:02:49.290> gonna<00:02:49.410> lose<00:02:49.620> compression<00:02:50.250> and

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
it you're gonna lose compression and

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.900 
it you're gonna lose compression and
it's<00:02:50.550> going<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.700> overheat<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.360> pistons<00:02:52.910> which

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
it's going to overheat the pistons which

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.490 
it's going to overheat the pistons which
you<00:02:54.060> can<00:02:54.209> see<00:02:54.390> in<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.569> bottom<00:02:54.870> let's<00:02:55.080> see<00:02:55.380> in

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
you can see in the bottom let's see in

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.440 
you can see in the bottom let's see in
the<00:02:55.530> bottom<00:02:55.769> this<00:02:56.040> it's<00:02:56.519> black<00:02:56.850> I<00:02:57.120> think<00:02:57.150> you

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
the bottom this it's black I think you

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.050 
the bottom this it's black I think you
can<00:02:57.600> see<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.950> normal<00:02:59.160> piston<00:02:59.489> should<00:02:59.880> look

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
can see the normal piston should look

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.650 
can see the normal piston should look
like<00:03:00.239> this<00:03:02.750> this<00:03:03.750> one<00:03:04.019> is<00:03:04.170> slightly<00:03:04.519> you<00:03:05.519> can

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
like this this one is slightly you can

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.710 
like this this one is slightly you can
tell<00:03:06.660> it's<00:03:06.900> slightly<00:03:07.580> odd<00:03:11.299> and<00:03:12.299> that's<00:03:12.540> how

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
tell it's slightly odd and that's how

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.080 
tell it's slightly odd and that's how
they<00:03:12.840> work<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.920> explosion<00:03:14.400> gets<00:03:14.549> behind<00:03:14.730> the

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
they work the explosion gets behind the

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.660 
they work the explosion gets behind the
Rings<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:17.420> whitens<00:03:18.420> them<00:03:19.190> well<00:03:20.190> on<00:03:20.519> the

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
Rings and whitens them well on the

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.580 
Rings and whitens them well on the
compression<00:03:21.000> stroke<00:03:23.840> so<00:03:24.840> that's<00:03:25.019> my<00:03:25.170> take<00:03:25.380> on

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
compression stroke so that's my take on

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.579 
compression stroke so that's my take on
piston<00:03:26.340> rings
