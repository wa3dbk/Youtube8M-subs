00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.790
 trees have to come before spring 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.040
 and woodcuts are cut back 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.890
 that's my fruit trees 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.690
 comparatively easy in the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.620
 Neighborhood is already there more 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.260
 the agenda 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.570
 This fir is for example 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.140
 close to the house and should therefore like 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.140
 become 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.269
 the big cherry on the north side 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.489
 the house does not leave the wall behind 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.699
 be more dry and therefore must 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.800
 away great worries prepares the poplar 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.199
 the lot boundary their 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.990
 Stability is loud expert opinion 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.810
 Highly endangered by the big beer 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.810
 some branches get very far 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.080
 other land is not supposed to 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.080
 stay like that 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.620
 the man with the soul yes that is one 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.620
 real professional 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.180
 the truncated cordage is piling up 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.829
 high on but there should be a big one 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:14.190
 harder to use 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:15.569
 and make a clean sweep right there 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.470
 I could do something else too 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.349
 contribute 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.780
 short i am announcing this in my garden 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:25.610
 cherry laurel from the for his location 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.610
 is simply grown too large 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.780
 a beautiful rubble yes I will 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:55.109
 him now to shred the neighbor 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.109
 attract 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.620
 clear the like is somehow 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.019
 pity but constantly pine cones in the 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.090
 gutter that is also such a problem 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.860
 especially if you are not quite so 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.590
 is dewy and not even 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.250
 In short, a ladder can snap around the 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.250
 to bring in order 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:51.470
 The poplar gets complicated 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.129
 You can not get it easy 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.129
 let fall over 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.950
 yes there were actually only 15 left 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.840
 until 20 percent the rest was lazy 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.340
 the next storm would have been the 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.340
 catastrophe can mean 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:30.910
 in no time nothing disappears 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.910
 in the big tailor 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.659
 margrit question I may some me 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.750
 wheelbarrows later take good order 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:05:00.460
 would have to start something 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.330
 and the bottom of the lot with 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.190
 he still has the pebble league 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.580
 letting only times correctly spring 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.580
 become
