00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:12.940
 you always wanted a bmw x5 in 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.940
 minecraft then stay tuned 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.310
 yes as you can see it is a bmw 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:34.879
 murder he puts you this bmw x5 in white 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.710
 In addition, it is a very nice one 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.840
 can see the whole details all over 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.920
 lamps 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.230
 if now just another view 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.860
 We can go back then 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.960
 also see the interior of the car 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.989
 is it really very cool I have to 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.140
 once a day you can see it here 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:01:00.470
 whole dashboard the whole scarce 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:03.830
 for made here broken jack us 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.420
 same time again to these these bmw too 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.460
 you need to save this part here 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.500
 There is no strong recipe for that 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.330
 someone just right click ever in 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.799
 in front of this mod quite a lot 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.080
 grow hand is so funny again 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:20.240
 Sometimes I see it you have 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.500
 worst fps burglaries and so one man 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.180
 It really has to look like this 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.290
 just go through the car except through 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:30.590
 the seats yes then you can with 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.509
 right click and there you sit 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.249
 actually already in there as well 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:39.380
 you can see it's you can 

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:40.359
 see yourself there halo and look very much 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.479
 cool out 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:47.539
 In any case, you can right-click 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.490
 again, small bags and if you have it 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.569
 first installed this place and can 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.389
 you do not drive with it you have to 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:56.359
 then first day controls will go then 

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:58.759
 There was no fear at all 

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:59.719
 auspreche is then projected as a vocal 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.659
 0 protrude 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:05.209
 and then you just go down here 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.399
 you just go left and ride 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:09.800
 this with the arrow keys so that everyone 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.569
 know that it is and yes then you have that 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.250
 already set and then could 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.400
 we actually start on the we 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.110
 may now just forward and 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.000
 just may have been pretty right 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.250
 cool if you drive the area yes 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.690
 sometimes you are sweet packed once 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.730
 I know you can start a blog 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.360
 Six times, the house will remain 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.900
 yes it is really a very cool 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.670
 j 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.670
 You can see the tires are moving 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:41.230
 and yes I like this murder is easy 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.630
 pretty pretty awesome and then drive 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.700
 we have ever seen one can unfortunately 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.320
 a pcs or a universal creature 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.730
 It is not possible to get enough, it becomes easy 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.730
 through and here you can drive block 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:03:01.630
 okay, that's always good for now 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:06.480
 So I drive the fun with it 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:09.250
 going so-so 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:17.410
 and if we stay here again and again 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:19.330
 want to get out found naturally comes so so 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.220
 once so that I know where 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.800
 drive 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.000
 so it is possible very very cool 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.030
 motto then you can just do it 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.260
 Braking or reversing is for 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.810
 you still the lights actually 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.410
 work light so if I know 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.410
 man main 8 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.420
 they do not seem to work well 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.610
 think this makes it really cool 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.960
 and then we'll find it then 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.120
 Turn it on then I'll show you now 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.810
 on the desktop the installation up 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:56.620
 right now we are back on the 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.959
 desktop to install the bmwi mods 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.910
 you need these two files oddset 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.770
 and the minecraft forge goes for it 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.330
 Just on the link I like always 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.680
 is going to put into the description 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.230
 gold then just down and clicks 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.209
 both here on download after that are the 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.160
 just start and he's the window 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.209
 execution and gives there percent appdata 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.280
 percent 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.200
 goes in terms of minecraft folder then in 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.790
 the folder and just do one 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.540
 right click on your minecraft year 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:25.480
 open with winrar archivar and me 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.800
 here first page the first thing we need 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.470
 of course, as always with the info 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.440
 examine and delete them 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:35.020
 Think like minecraft forge all 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.630
 files also with words and you them 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.600
 just push over into the minecraft 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.270
 ok then both can decide 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.010
 now I have minecraft except the puck 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.030
 closed but then just goes 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.470
 back that we here again in 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.750
 directory since where am and everything is 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.060
 then you start minecraft once or 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.560
 djd still creates itself or 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.380
 maybe there is already there so the 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.750
 mods folder here and just see the 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.490
 mod in there and the murder is done 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.840
 installed when asked simply as always 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.210
 write in the comments 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.950
 otherwise I thank you for seeing 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.760
 I wish you even better day and 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.760
