another<00:00:01.800> minecraft<00:00:02.040> concept<00:00:02.580> video<00:00:02.790> was

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
another minecraft concept video was

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.940 
another minecraft concept video was
always<00:00:03.179> this<00:00:03.389> is<00:00:03.540> mythos<00:00:04.049> did<00:00:04.740> I<00:00:04.830> have

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
always this is mythos did I have

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.800 
always this is mythos did I have
combined<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.370> few<00:00:05.640> different<00:00:06.000> concepts<00:00:06.720> I've

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
combined a few different concepts I've

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.210 
combined a few different concepts I've
done<00:00:06.960> in<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.080> past<00:00:07.140> to<00:00:07.830> create<00:00:07.859> something

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
done in the past to create something

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.200 
done in the past to create something
pretty<00:00:09.120> cool<00:00:09.330> actually<00:00:09.960> so<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:11.010> is<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.519> class

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
pretty cool actually so this is a class

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.360 
pretty cool actually so this is a class
selector<00:00:12.900> kind<00:00:13.139> of<00:00:13.259> beta<00:00:13.530> I've<00:00:13.889> worked<00:00:14.219> on

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
selector kind of beta I've worked on

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.580 
selector kind of beta I've worked on
this<00:00:14.460> for<00:00:14.580> about<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.759> day<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.690> could<00:00:16.379> have<00:00:16.440> done<00:00:16.529> a

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
this for about a day I could have done a

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.670 
this for about a day I could have done a
lot<00:00:16.710> more<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.130> I<00:00:17.279> understand<00:00:17.850> but<00:00:18.680> the

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
lot more of it I understand but the

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.010 
lot more of it I understand but the
command<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.730> use<00:00:20.880> actually<00:00:21.300> so<00:00:21.480> pretty<00:00:21.750> buggy

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
command I use actually so pretty buggy

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.620 
command I use actually so pretty buggy
so<00:00:22.410> it's<00:00:22.920> not<00:00:23.070> working<00:00:23.490> like<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:24.029> should<00:00:24.060> and

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
so it's not working like it should and

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.170 
so it's not working like it should and
there's<00:00:25.140> some<00:00:25.470> bugs<00:00:25.800> with<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.730> many<00:00:26.789> commands

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
there's some bugs with so many commands

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.689 
there's some bugs with so many commands
for<00:00:27.510> items<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.830> not<00:00:29.039> even<00:00:29.250> nearly

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
for items so this is not even nearly

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.339 
for items so this is not even nearly
what<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.000> had<00:00:30.179> planned<00:00:30.330> for<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.720> concept<00:00:31.140> but

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
what I had planned for this concept but

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.770 
what I had planned for this concept but
nonetheless<00:00:32.130> let's<00:00:32.790> take<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.030> look<00:00:33.270> at<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.420> so

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
nonetheless let's take a look at it so

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.420 
nonetheless let's take a look at it so
you'll<00:00:34.440> say<00:00:34.559> i<00:00:34.590> have<00:00:34.739> this<00:00:34.920> zombie<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
you'll say i have this zombie the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.940 
you'll say i have this zombie the
zombies<00:00:35.760> perfectly<00:00:36.239> stationary<00:00:36.840> i<00:00:37.079> use<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
zombies perfectly stationary i use the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:38.990 
zombies perfectly stationary i use the
neat<00:00:38.100> little<00:00:38.219> trick<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.550> I'll<00:00:38.790> get<00:00:38.879> into

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
neat little trick that I'll get into

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.119 
neat little trick that I'll get into
later<00:00:39.149> keep<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.079> guy<00:00:40.260> stationary<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.890> does

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
later keep this guy stationary it does

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.500 
later keep this guy stationary it does
not<00:00:41.280> involve<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.700> glass<00:00:41.850> but<00:00:42.120> purely

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
not involve the glass but purely

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.940 
not involve the glass but purely
aesthetic<00:00:43.079> but<00:00:43.530> let's<00:00:43.739> take<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> look<00:00:44.460> here<00:00:44.789> so

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
aesthetic but let's take a look here so

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.150 
aesthetic but let's take a look here so
we<00:00:46.950> have<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.460> heavy<00:00:47.670> class<00:00:48.680> we<00:00:49.680> have<00:00:49.770> an<00:00:49.860> archer

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
assassin class this is buggy because

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.740 
assassin class this is buggy because
this<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.730> chest<00:00:57.090> plate<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.390> not<00:00:57.539> supposed

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
wanted to stay and it is here so it's

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.759 
wanted to stay and it is here so it's
pretty<00:01:03.359> cool<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.840> then<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.350> just<00:01:04.379> like<00:01:04.619> goes

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
pretty cool and then it just like goes

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.260 
pretty cool and then it just like goes
back<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.129> here<00:01:05.280> but<00:01:05.790> what's<00:01:06.090> cool<00:01:06.210> about

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
back to you here but what's cool about

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.179 
back to you here but what's cool about
this<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:06.930> if<00:01:07.049> we<00:01:07.110> go<00:01:07.200> too<00:01:07.260> heavy<00:01:07.439> i'm<00:01:08.130> a

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189

which is kind of opie if you ask me but

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.230 
which is kind of opie if you ask me but
it's<00:01:28.350> just<00:01:28.619> concepts<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.610> through<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.909> classes

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
it's just concepts I through the classes

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.539 
it's just concepts I through the classes
together<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.600> matter<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.840> five<00:01:31.020> minutes<00:01:31.549> but

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
together in a matter of five minutes but

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.370 
together in a matter of five minutes but
that<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:32.939> what<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.270> supposed<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.780> that's

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
that is what it's supposed to be that's

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.649 
that is what it's supposed to be that's
the<00:01:35.159> actual<00:01:35.369> class<00:01:35.610> or<00:01:36.119> bow<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.450> whatever

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
the actual class or bow for whatever

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.450 
the actual class or bow for whatever
reason<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.140> does<00:01:37.439> not<00:01:37.560> want<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.770> work<00:01:37.979> so

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
reason it just does not want to work so

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.730 
reason it just does not want to work so
let's<00:01:39.210> take<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.540> look<00:01:39.720> into<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.350> redstone

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
let's take a look into this redstone

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
then once it hits one you can actually

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.050 
then once it hits one you can actually
from<00:03:09.060> over<00:03:09.180> here<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:10.110> see<00:03:10.320> sucks<00:03:10.920> if<00:03:11.370> it

i'm<00:03:36.360> not<00:03:36.510> entirely<00:03:36.780> sure<00:03:36.959> then<00:03:37.560> this<00:03:37.709> one<00:03:37.860> just

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
i'm not entirely sure then this one just

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.640 
i'm not entirely sure then this one just
test<00:03:38.190> 40<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:39.660> replaces<00:03:40.110> it<00:03:40.140> all<00:03:40.320> with<00:03:40.500> air<00:03:40.620> and

test 40 and replaces it all with air and

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.620 
test 40 and replaces it all with air and
this<00:03:40.890> one<00:03:41.040> works<00:03:41.190> perfectly<00:03:41.640> I<00:03:41.880> have<00:03:42.120> no<00:03:42.390> idea

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
this one works perfectly I have no idea

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.470 
this one works perfectly I have no idea
why<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:42.959> other<00:03:43.080> one<00:03:43.230> doesn't<00:03:43.820> then<00:03:44.820> these

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
why the other one doesn't then these

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.890 
why the other one doesn't then these
command<00:03:45.870> blocks<00:03:46.110> right<00:03:46.320> here<00:03:46.920> this<00:03:47.310> one<00:03:47.580> just

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
command blocks right here this one just

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.920 
command blocks right here this one just

of<00:03:53.370> minus<00:03:53.670> one<00:03:53.700> I<00:03:54.090> want<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.570> find<00:03:54.750> is<00:03:54.870> that<00:03:54.900> it

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
of minus one I want to find is that it

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.110 
of minus one I want to find is that it
just<00:03:55.290> sets<00:03:55.440> it<00:03:55.560> back<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:55.860> zero<00:03:56.070> so<00:03:56.160> it'll<00:03:57.090> just

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
just sets it back to zero so it'll just

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.210 
just sets it back to zero so it'll just
cycle<00:03:57.660> it<00:03:57.780> right<00:03:57.959> back<00:03:58.140> to<00:03:58.350> zero<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.799> he<00:03:59.040> will

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
cycle it right back to zero and he will

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.789 
cycle it right back to zero and he will
be<00:03:59.370> free<00:03:59.880> and<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.180> Nisshin<00:04:00.450> just<00:04:00.750> text<00:04:01.049> checks

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
be free and the Nisshin just text checks

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.530 
be free and the Nisshin just text checks
for<00:04:01.980> someone<00:04:02.190> with<00:04:02.310> a<00:04:02.340> net<00:04:02.940> D<00:04:03.060> score<00:04:03.299> or<00:04:03.510> a

for someone with a net D score or a

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.050 
for someone with a net D score or a
target<00:04:03.989> score<00:04:04.110> 5<00:04:04.440> so<00:04:05.160> you<00:04:05.400> complete<00:04:05.700> opposite

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
target score 5 so you complete opposite

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.090 
target score 5 so you complete opposite
of<00:04:06.120> this<00:04:06.239> one<00:04:06.420> and<00:04:06.570> then<00:04:06.660> this<00:04:06.720> one<00:04:06.900> I<00:04:07.380> don't

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
of this one and then this one I don't

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.259 
of this one and then this one I don't
even<00:04:08.160> know<00:04:08.340> what<00:04:08.519> the<00:04:08.670> point<00:04:08.790> in<00:04:08.940> that<00:04:08.970> command

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
even know what the point in that command

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.229 
even know what the point in that command
block<00:04:09.420> is<00:04:09.570> is<00:04:09.750> because<00:04:09.900> it<00:04:10.110> doesn't<00:04:10.320> work<00:04:10.440> I

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
block is is because it doesn't work I

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:12.979 
block is is because it doesn't work I
don't<00:04:12.239> know<00:04:12.299> what<00:04:12.420> I<00:04:12.450> was<00:04:12.510> trying<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.780> do<00:04:12.870> with

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
don't know what I was trying to do with

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.470 
don't know what I was trying to do with
it<00:04:13.110> so<00:04:13.440> it's<00:04:13.590> a<00:04:13.620> pretty<00:04:13.799> simple<00:04:13.980> concept<00:04:14.480> one

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
it so it's a pretty simple concept one

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.750 
it so it's a pretty simple concept one
thing<00:04:15.690> I<00:04:15.810> wanted<00:04:16.080> to<00:04:16.140> do<00:04:16.440> with<00:04:17.070> it<00:04:17.100> thought<00:04:17.729> I

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
thing I wanted to do with it thought I

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.719 
thing I wanted to do with it thought I
would<00:04:18.000> further<00:04:18.380> develop<00:04:19.380> it<00:04:19.500> with<00:04:19.680> with<00:04:20.070> was

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
would further develop it with with was

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.060 
would further develop it with with was
to<00:04:21.060> have<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.269> perks<00:04:21.720> and<00:04:22.019> the<00:04:22.560> equipment<00:04:22.770> and

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
to have the perks and the equipment and

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.710 
to have the perks and the equipment and
like<00:04:23.520> if<00:04:23.640> it<00:04:23.760> had<00:04:23.880> a<00:04:23.910> potion<00:04:24.120> effect<00:04:24.450> display

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
like if it had a potion effect display

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.380 
like if it had a potion effect display
the<00:04:24.870> splash<00:04:25.080> potion<00:04:25.530> and<00:04:25.700> any<00:04:26.700> other<00:04:27.000> items

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
the splash potion and any other items

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.750 
the splash potion and any other items
that<00:04:27.479> it<00:04:27.720> has<00:04:27.870> on<00:04:27.900> this<00:04:28.470> bar<00:04:28.710> so<00:04:29.070> it<00:04:29.280> would<00:04:29.700> be

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
that it has on this bar so it would be

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.880 
that it has on this bar so it would be
pretty<00:04:29.910> cool<00:04:30.030> but<00:04:30.390> the<00:04:30.660> summon<00:04:31.380> command<00:04:31.650> does

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
pretty cool but the summon command does

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:32.990 
pretty cool but the summon command does
not<00:04:32.070> actually<00:04:32.220> work<00:04:32.490> at<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.669> moment<00:04:32.880> it's

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
not actually work at the moment it's

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.589 
not actually work at the moment it's
just<00:04:33.120> some<00:04:33.270> one<00:04:33.360> stone<00:04:33.720> so<00:04:34.729> that<00:04:35.729> kind<00:04:36.539> of

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
just some one stone so that kind of

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:38.650 
just some one stone so that kind of
sucks<00:04:36.810> I<00:04:37.370> have

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
to the bug tracker so hopefully it gets

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.730
