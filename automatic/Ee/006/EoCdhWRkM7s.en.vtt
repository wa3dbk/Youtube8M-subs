00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
handguard it's probably I think it's a

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.349 
handguard it's probably I think it's a
nylon<00:00:55.620> or<00:00:55.829> very<00:00:56.610> type<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.180> hard<00:00:57.539> plastic<00:00:59.359> it's

very much a pain now to take off and put
your<00:01:03.149> battery<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:03.809> there<00:01:04.820> this<00:01:05.820> gun<00:01:06.060> can<00:01:06.270> fit<00:01:06.479> a

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
your battery in there this gun can fit a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.429 
your battery in there this gun can fit a
9.6<00:01:08.070> mini<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.820> 8.4<00:01:10.159> 10.8<00:01:11.299> nunchuck<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.510> 9.6

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
9.6 mini in 8.4 10.8 nunchuck a 9.6

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.980 
9.6 mini in 8.4 10.8 nunchuck a 9.6
nunchuck<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.220> believe<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.420> even<00:01:15.630> fit<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
nunchuck I believe it can even fit the
