00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.889
 I hope April 23 began the 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.019
 application of fines to those who circulate 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.309
 polarized com or other obstructions in 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.309
 glasses of automotive vehicles 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.550
 municipal transit has implemented 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.440
 operatives in various points of 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.790
 saltillo where fines apply to 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.790
 they reach almost three thousand pesos 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.830
 with radio and television service type that 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.380
 remove the updated many did 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.380
 ignore now yes we are really 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.129
 doing the infraction to that people 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.199
 that we have since all the polarized what 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.460
 we make an attentive invitation part of the 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:51.409
 municipality from which they remove the 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.089
 polarized and that 's how it works 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:55.579
 problem if in other municipalities 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:58.410
 neither does it go to the problem only that 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.750
 be of saltillo 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.090
 later I believe that the others 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.589
 municipalities rises to one homologate the 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.719
 same regulation but removing the 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.590
 polarized 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:14.729
 the fine comes out approximately 2,300 a 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.729
 2,500 pesos 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:23.350
 the polarized one that uses a lot and serves 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.760
 also by the meshes or another type that 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.230
 they put the glasses on him and he can not see 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.790
 need 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.490
 all that well wake up well 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.170
 it's lack of insecurity helps us more the 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.080
 security of being the videos 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.620
 transparent to see that we are more 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.110
 quiet 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.730
 then the Maya also 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.710
 anything would be the mornings to 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.560
 Sometimes you put a piece of cardboard or 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.410
 newspaper or something else until painting them 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.350
 they have been touched by the public service of 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.780
 that black spray are used in the 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.430
 trucks and that's also not allowed 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.470
 we also make an attentive 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.950
 invitation to all transport 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:05.480
 urban in general all that require 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.480
 of their viruses 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.600
 I do not know about visiting 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.659
