got<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:10.110> new<00:00:10.230> quarterback<00:00:10.590> so<00:00:10.950> he<00:00:11.219> got<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.400> step

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
got a new quarterback so he got a step

up

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
up

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.570 
up
my<00:00:13.019> leaders<00:00:13.349> not<00:00:13.500> often<00:00:13.860> it's<00:00:14.009> gonna<00:00:14.190> be<00:00:14.340> me

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
my leaders not often it's gonna be me

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.140 
my leaders not often it's gonna be me
and<00:00:17.750> that's<00:00:18.750> pretty<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.740> muted<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.310> guess<00:00:20.970> you

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
and that's pretty this muted I guess you

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.790 
and that's pretty this muted I guess you
could<00:00:21.270> say<00:00:21.390> up<00:00:21.510> quarterback<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.260> we<00:00:22.470> got<00:00:22.619> some

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
could say up quarterback and we got some

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.620 
could say up quarterback and we got some
leaders<00:00:23.070> Rob<00:00:23.220> receiver<00:00:23.640> try<00:00:23.850> on<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.090> hood<00:00:24.269> I

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
leaders Rob receiver try on the hood I

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.189 
leaders Rob receiver try on the hood I
would<00:00:24.930> say<00:00:25.050> me<00:00:25.320> try<00:00:25.590> on<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.800> wood<00:00:25.980> and

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
would say me try on the wood and

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.410 
would say me try on the wood and
probably<00:00:28.199> our<00:00:28.289> quarterback<00:00:28.619> areas<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.420> on

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
probably our quarterback areas and on

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.400 
probably our quarterback areas and on
defense<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:31.050> gonna<00:00:31.260> be<00:00:31.380> dealing<00:00:31.619> Nathan<00:00:33.410> Jerry

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
defense is gonna be dealing Nathan Jerry

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.299 
defense is gonna be dealing Nathan Jerry
Smith<00:00:38.600> and<00:00:39.600> that's<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.989> yes<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.829> could<00:00:40.980> think<00:00:41.129> of

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
Smith and that's it yes I could think of

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.440 
Smith and that's it yes I could think of
and<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:41.969> say<00:00:42.739> J<00:00:43.739> Perkins<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.430> they'll<00:00:44.640> be<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.910> it

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
and I say J Perkins and they'll be it it

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.720 
and I say J Perkins and they'll be it it
leaves<00:00:45.629> no<00:00:45.780> defense<00:00:46.170> will<00:00:47.129> be<00:00:47.219> successful

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
leaves no defense will be successful

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.700 
leaves no defense will be successful
because<00:00:47.969> we<00:00:48.059> work<00:00:48.239> hard<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.809> mean<00:00:49.140> every

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
because we work hard I mean every

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.950 
because we work hard I mean every
everyday<00:00:50.190> we've<00:00:50.520> grown<00:00:50.700> our<00:00:50.820> heart<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.719> full

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
everyday we've grown our heart to a full

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.979 
everyday we've grown our heart to a full
of<00:00:52.079> max<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:54.390> we're<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:54.690> gonna<00:00:54.870> be

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
of max and we're just gonna be

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.510 
of max and we're just gonna be
successful<00:00:55.440> because<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.739> feel<00:00:56.100> like<00:00:56.129> this

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
successful because I feel like this

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.420 
successful because I feel like this
year's<00:00:56.760> with<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> chosen<00:00:57.660> team<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:58.430> think

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
year's with the chosen team I think

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.099 
year's with the chosen team I think
we'll<00:00:59.609> be<00:00:59.730> successful<00:00:59.879> because<00:01:00.570> we've<00:01:01.020> been

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
we'll be successful because we've been

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.290 
we'll be successful because we've been
working<00:01:01.410> hard<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.920> has<00:01:02.520> been<00:01:02.730> grinding<00:01:02.940> out

working hard and has been grinding out
during<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.719> summer<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.470> believe<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.240> we

the most changed by the standpoint clay

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.289

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the most but I'm really looking forward

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.050 
the most but I'm really looking forward
to<00:01:25.920> place<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.250> value<00:01:26.490> looks<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.259> say<00:01:28.259> he's

to place a value looks I say he's

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.450 
to place a value looks I say he's
powerful<00:01:30.060> because<00:01:30.689> he<00:01:30.960> he<00:01:31.680> like<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.009> grinders

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
powerful because he he like the grinders

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.950 
powerful because he he like the grinders
out<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.790> he<00:01:32.850> wants<00:01:33.150> us<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.299> reach<00:01:33.600> our<00:01:33.750> full

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
out and he wants us to reach our full

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.460 
out and he wants us to reach our full
potential<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:35.189> he<00:01:35.479> he<00:01:36.479> really<00:01:36.720> knows<00:01:37.200> our

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
potential and he he really knows our

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.230 
potential and he he really knows our
full<00:01:37.710> potential<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.430> quite<00:01:38.729> don't<00:01:38.970> know

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
full potential but we quite don't know

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.710 
full potential but we quite don't know
it<00:01:39.450> if<00:01:40.259> but<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.829> believe<00:01:41.189> we<00:01:41.490> play<00:01:42.240> together<00:01:42.390> and

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
it if but I believe we play together and

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.660 
it if but I believe we play together and
we<00:01:42.899> be<00:01:43.079> our<00:01:43.259> team<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.799> we<00:01:43.950> can't<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.310> second

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
we be our team and we can't be a second

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.969 
we be our team and we can't be a second
half<00:01:44.790> team<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.240> morning<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.869> if<00:01:46.200> we<00:01:46.380> play

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
half team in the morning that if we play

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.649 
half team in the morning that if we play
like<00:01:47.009> we<00:01:47.250> do<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.460> second<00:01:47.729> half<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.149> I

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
like we do in the second half that I

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.840 
like we do in the second half that I
believe<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.110> we<00:01:49.320> will<00:01:49.710> be<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> great<00:01:50.189> team<00:01:50.520> but

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
believe that we will be a great team but

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.590 
believe that we will be a great team but
we<00:01:51.299> just<00:01:51.450> all<00:01:51.659> got<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.960> see<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.579> amazing
