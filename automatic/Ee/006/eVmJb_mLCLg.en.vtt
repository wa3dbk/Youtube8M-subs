time not so much recently but for a long
time<00:04:36.139> Society<00:04:36.650> has<00:04:36.740> taught<00:04:36.950> us<00:04:36.980> that<00:04:37.370> if<00:04:37.820> a<00:04:37.970> guy

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
time Society has taught us that if a guy

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.270 
time Society has taught us that if a guy
expresses<00:04:38.780> their<00:04:38.900> feelings<00:04:39.380> or<00:04:39.710> talks<00:04:39.950> about

it<00:04:40.460> that<00:04:40.760> is<00:04:40.940> a<00:04:40.970> sign<00:04:41.360> of<00:04:41.540> weakness<00:04:41.780> and<00:04:42.350> I

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
it that is a sign of weakness and I

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.050 
it that is a sign of weakness and I
think<00:04:42.740> it's<00:04:42.860> quite<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.100> opposite<00:04:43.580> I<00:04:43.669> think<00:04:43.700> if

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
think it's quite the opposite I think if

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.270 
think it's quite the opposite I think if
a<00:04:44.150> guy<00:04:44.180> were<00:04:44.930> to<00:04:44.990> speak<00:04:45.590> his<00:04:45.770> feelings<00:04:46.160> that
