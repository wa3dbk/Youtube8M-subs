 according to him 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.120
 it was artificially created in a past 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.220
 by Kryptonian scientists who 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.650
 they were experiencing on a planet with a 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.379
 hostile environment where they only survived 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.080
 wild and hostile beings creatures 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:19.209
 of the most absolute force the forms of 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.370
 dominant lives of that planet were 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.860
 known as the most dangerous of 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.110
 the whole universe the creator of done 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.239
 style was a mysterious someone called 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.810
 bear tron who wanted to create the maximum 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.849
 way of life to achieve it bertran and his 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.310
 team sent a baby of race 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.560
 unknown to the surface of the planet 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.700
 where he would die instantly 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.099
 due to the harsh conditions 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.370
 environmental or killed by the 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:47.200
 violent creatures that inhabited it what 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.450
 little that was left of the baby was 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.700
 collected and used for 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.890
 extraction of their genetic material to 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.859
 then create an improved version and more 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.079
 strong than the previous one in summary the 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:01.150
 deranged scientist used the 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:03.849
 cloning method to accelerate the 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.370
 evolution of the being that was creating a 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:08.680
 through decades of this process the being 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.230
 that would eventually become 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.719
 and he was forced to endure the agony of 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.479
 death thousands of times one after another 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:18.400
 the memory of these countless deaths 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.709
 was recorded in his genes as a 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.620
 residual memory and led him to hate 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.740
 all way of life to ensure its 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.389
 survival the process of evolution 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.639
 greatly increased their capabilities 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:32.440
 defensives by modifying even their 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.810
 emotions that were reduced to 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.870
 practically only an ugly instinct of 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:41.110
 survival fury and constant eye and 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.570
 permanent propensity for violence 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.520
 finally don style won the skill 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.830
 to evolve against that which 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.870
 murdered their previous lives without the 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.139
 Need for technology to see throne 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.240
 at this point don style proceeded to 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:58.389
 Hunt and kill all the creatures 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.280
 lethal people who inhabited that planet on 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.470
 same veltroni scientists 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.139
 Kryptonians found death to 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.669
 hands of his creation 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:10.150

 to find the hundreds of lanterns 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.990

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.479
 space through which gifts of 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.940
 unconscious and wounded he finally fell 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:51.639
 here came brass destroying the world 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:54.069

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:59.590
 royal family combined their forces 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.810
 vital in a single being the radiant the 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.720
 radiant killed don style with a huge 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:07.780
 discharge of energy devastating more than one 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.120

 of the impact 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.280
 He made his coffin penetrate very deep under 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:29.590
 the ground because it can evolve 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:32.380
