00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:06.680
 attacked and laid extrusion 

00:00:03.229 --> 00:00:11.680
 polystyrene is left a small gap 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:16.820
 between polystyrene plates and walls 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:19.599
 half a centimeter centimeter and these gaps 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.869
 then stuffed with foam 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:27.649
 which then trimmed polystyrene 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:38.179
 well cut pasted special 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:39.789
 foam foam junction record then here 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:44.809
 here is such 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:48.820
 polyurethane foam after mounting 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:51.460
 the foam has dried and and cut with glue in places 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.710
 where are the pipes 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.769
 are marked with special labels to 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:03.949
 so it would be easier to remember where 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:10.910
 which pipe goes this mark indicates 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:13.850
 that right in this place is the pipe behind 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.310
 pipe and comes out with the opposite 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.750
 parties 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.220
 heating pipes as you see all these 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.290
 pipes 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.660
 hiding under polystyrene very easily 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.470
 top will be yusbi sheets 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.100
 be on polystyrene stacked 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.330
 sheets 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:37.910
 yusbi 8 millimeters then scroll 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.980
 it is important to leave small gaps between 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:44.320
 sheets to 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:46.080
 Further, the floor is not creaked screwed 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:57.750
 screwdriver 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:02:03.350
 and here are such pipes and centimeters 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.350
 so that you can scroll through the profile 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:12.720
 center center is scrolled first 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:18.450
 scrolls and sheets and then 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:24.900
 fasten from the sides at the attachment points 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.820
 batteries are made cuts before 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.740
 to put 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:33.090
 extrusion polystyrene need 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:36.300
 vacuumed the floor and maybe it 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.470
 to prime so that there are no pebbles and 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.400
 to 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:46.940
 polystyrene sheets adhered well to 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.940
 the floor looks like one of the rooms 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:55.739
 Well, the lights are already glowing at night 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.739
 electricity brought 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.420
 today made an electric cabinet 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.620
 work is going 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.470
 they gave themselves
