00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
that the latency is not as bad as we

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.399 
that the latency is not as bad as we
expected<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.600> very<00:02:00.840> low-end<00:02:01.200> phone

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409

the cortex SM variety and

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.180 
the cortex SM variety and
it's<00:02:09.970> not<00:02:10.150> really<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:11.170> most<00:02:11.590> powerful<00:02:11.800> phone

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.250 
it's not really the most powerful phone
out<00:02:12.430> there<00:02:12.700> it's<00:02:12.910> reading<00:02:13.780> for<00:02:13.930> just<00:02:14.110> about

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
out there it's reading for just about

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.130 
out there it's reading for just about
LAN<00:02:14.530> thousand<00:02:14.890> rupees<00:02:15.100> so<00:02:15.610> it's<00:02:16.360> pretty<00:02:16.810> cool

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
LAN thousand rupees so it's pretty cool

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.010 
LAN thousand rupees so it's pretty cool
to<00:02:17.980> use<00:02:18.310> this<00:02:18.850> functionality<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.780> watch

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
to use this functionality to watch

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.810 
to use this functionality to watch
videos<00:02:20.530> in<00:02:21.160> 1080p<00:02:22.470> that's<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.860> really<00:02:24.610> cool

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
videos in 1080p that's the really cool

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.420 
videos in 1080p that's the really cool
part<00:02:24.880> there<00:02:25.450> so<00:02:26.140> let<00:02:26.380> me<00:02:26.500> resume<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.130> video

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
part there so let me resume the video

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:37.230 
part there so let me resume the video
that<00:02:28.180> I<00:02:28.210> was<00:02:28.390> playing<00:02:28.630> before<00:02:35.820> so<00:02:36.820> what

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
that I was playing before so what

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.450 
that I was playing before so what
happens<00:02:37.630> is<00:02:37.840> that<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.380> video<00:02:38.680> as<00:02:38.920> well<00:02:39.160> as<00:02:39.280> the

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
happens is that the video as well as the

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.020 
happens is that the video as well as the
audio<00:02:39.790> gets<00:02:40.470> streamed<00:02:41.470> over<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:42.610> miracast

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
audio gets streamed over the miracast

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.720 
audio gets streamed over the miracast
Wi-Fi<00:02:43.690> direct<00:02:43.930> connection<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:45.310> miracast

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
Wi-Fi direct connection to the miracast

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.570 
Wi-Fi direct connection to the miracast
dongle<00:02:46.000> so<00:02:46.330> that's<00:02:46.510> how<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:46.840> works<00:02:47.580> the

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
dongle so that's how it works the

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.430 
dongle so that's how it works the
bitterly<00:02:48.880> it<00:02:49.000> used<00:02:49.240> to<00:02:49.390> be<00:02:49.510> very<00:02:49.540> sucky<00:02:50.260> on

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
bitterly it used to be very sucky on

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.990 
bitterly it used to be very sucky on
other<00:02:50.590> Android<00:02:51.040> phones<00:02:51.310> but<00:02:51.490> it<00:02:51.610> seems<00:02:51.850> that

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
other Android phones but it seems that

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.420 
other Android phones but it seems that
Windows<00:02:52.390> Phone<00:02:52.630> is<00:02:52.780> handling<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:53.350> better<00:02:53.500> no

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
Windows Phone is handling it better no

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.680 
Windows Phone is handling it better no
lag<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:55.000> very<00:02:55.930> nicely<00:02:56.820> displayed<00:02:57.820> a<00:02:58.000> video

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
lag and very nicely displayed a video

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.810 
lag and very nicely displayed a video
here<00:02:58.960> with<00:02:59.200> very<00:02:59.590> high<00:02:59.770> bitrate<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.400> exact

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
here with very high bitrate and exact

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.120 
here with very high bitrate and exact
native<00:03:01.270> resolution<00:03:01.750> it's<00:03:01.900> displaying<00:03:02.890> at

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
native resolution it's displaying at

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.850 
native resolution it's displaying at
1080p<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.360> audio<00:03:04.630> is<00:03:04.660> also<00:03:04.990> great<00:03:05.230> so

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
1080p and the audio is also great so

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.530 
1080p and the audio is also great so
that's<00:03:06.100> how<00:03:06.250> it<00:03:06.400> works<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:07.120> Americas

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
that's how it works the Americas

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.510 
that's how it works the Americas
functionality<00:03:08.140> it<00:03:08.290> can<00:03:08.500> also<00:03:08.680> be<00:03:08.980> used<00:03:09.250> for

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
functionality it can also be used for

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.490 
functionality it can also be used for
gaming<00:03:09.910> that's<00:03:10.360> one<00:03:11.020> really<00:03:11.260> interesting

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
gaming that's one really interesting

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.190 
gaming that's one really interesting
aspect<00:03:12.310> that<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:13.900> know<00:03:14.340> you<00:03:15.340> can<00:03:15.520> do<00:03:16.200> using

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
aspect that you know you can do using

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.740 
aspect that you know you can do using
the<00:03:17.410> phone<00:03:17.710> as<00:03:17.950> a<00:03:18.040> wireless<00:03:18.750> controller

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
the phone as a wireless controller

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.420 
the phone as a wireless controller
that's<00:03:20.530> pretty<00:03:21.010> much<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:22.120> dream<00:03:23.010> if<00:03:24.010> you<00:03:24.310> are

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
that's pretty much the dream if you are

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.280 
that's pretty much the dream if you are
thinking<00:03:24.760> about<00:03:24.850> mobile<00:03:25.480> gaming<00:03:25.750> in<00:03:26.080> the

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
thinking about mobile gaming in the

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.550 
thinking about mobile gaming in the
future<00:03:26.850> it's<00:03:27.850> certainly<00:03:28.690> achievable<00:03:29.050> but

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
future it's certainly achievable but

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.400 
future it's certainly achievable but
right<00:03:30.130> now<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.400> power<00:03:30.790> is<00:03:30.940> not<00:03:31.420> there<00:03:31.690> but

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
right now the power is not there but

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.130 
right now the power is not there but
we'll<00:03:32.590> show<00:03:32.830> you<00:03:32.860> how<00:03:33.010> it's<00:03:33.430> going<00:03:33.640> to<00:03:33.730> work

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
we'll show you how it's going to work

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.470 
we'll show you how it's going to work
using<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.440> wireless<00:03:35.850> miracast<00:03:36.850> technology

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
using the wireless miracast technology

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.630 
using the wireless miracast technology
I'm<00:03:38.170> just<00:03:38.560> going<00:03:38.800> to<00:03:38.860> select<00:03:39.310> some

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.160 

it<00:03:43.640> will<00:03:43.849> take<00:03:44.030> some<00:03:44.300> time<00:03:44.510> to<00:03:44.660> load<00:03:44.810> this<00:03:44.989> is<00:03:45.140> a

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
it will take some time to load this is a

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.839 
it will take some time to load this is a
very<00:03:45.410> low-end<00:03:45.800> phone<00:03:46.010> it<00:03:46.250> has<00:03:46.430> only<00:03:46.550> fight

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
very low-end phone it has only fight

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.460 
very low-end phone it has only fight
well<00:03:47.030> MB<00:03:47.270> of<00:03:47.300> RAM<00:03:47.390> so<00:03:47.810> the<00:03:47.900> graphics<00:03:48.319> are

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
well MB of RAM so the graphics are

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.960 
well MB of RAM so the graphics are
complete<00:03:48.890> crap<00:03:49.270> but<00:03:50.590> despite<00:03:51.590> that<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:52.790> game

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
complete crap but despite that the game

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.990 
complete crap but despite that the game
plays<00:03:53.330> pretty<00:03:53.989> well<00:03:54.290> on<00:03:54.530> the<00:03:55.010> big<00:03:55.160> screen<00:03:58.000> so

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
plays pretty well on the big screen so

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:10.270 
plays pretty well on the big screen so
there<00:03:59.209> you<00:03:59.300> go<00:03:59.450> let<00:03:59.720> me<00:03:59.900> just<00:03:59.930> skip<00:04:00.830> all<00:04:01.069> that

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.080 

so<00:04:10.850> there<00:04:11.030> you<00:04:11.090> go<00:04:11.240> that's<00:04:11.450> me<00:04:11.810> that's<00:04:12.260> my

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
so there you go that's me that's my

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.760 
so there you go that's me that's my
wireless<00:04:14.090> steering<00:04:14.840> control<00:04:15.290> for<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:15.590> game

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
wireless steering control for the game

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.099 
wireless steering control for the game
as<00:04:16.310> you<00:04:16.489> can<00:04:16.640> see<00:04:16.820> the<00:04:16.970> game<00:04:17.180> is<00:04:17.420> laggy<00:04:17.720> because

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
as you can see the game is laggy because

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.130 
as you can see the game is laggy because
of<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.560> processor<00:04:19.250> and<00:04:19.450> you<00:04:20.450> know<00:04:20.570> running<00:04:21.019> at

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
of the processor and you know running at

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.820 
of the processor and you know running at
the<00:04:21.670> with<00:04:22.670> the<00:04:22.820> fight<00:04:23.030> well<00:04:23.210> MB<00:04:23.480> of<00:04:23.510> RAM<00:04:23.830> but

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
the with the fight well MB of RAM but

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.080 
the with the fight well MB of RAM but
still<00:04:25.600> this<00:04:26.600> is<00:04:26.900> something<00:04:27.500> really<00:04:27.830> cool<00:04:28.090> and

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
still this is something really cool and

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.930 
still this is something really cool and
as<00:04:29.780> you<00:04:29.930> can<00:04:30.050> see<00:04:30.230> there<00:04:30.410> is<00:04:30.500> not<00:04:30.710> much<00:04:31.130> latency

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
as you can see there is not much latency

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.990 
as you can see there is not much latency
there<00:04:32.150> there<00:04:32.510> is<00:04:32.690> a<00:04:32.900> little<00:04:33.710> bit<00:04:33.860> of<00:04:34.070> latency

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
there there is a little bit of latency

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.750 
there there is a little bit of latency
of<00:04:35.030> course<00:04:35.360> that<00:04:36.170> is<00:04:36.380> inherent<00:04:36.860> with<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.250> kind

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
of course that is inherent with the kind

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.950 
of course that is inherent with the kind
of<00:04:37.880> technology<00:04:38.420> that<00:04:38.450> miracast<00:04:39.170> is<00:04:39.470> but<00:04:40.370> still

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
of technology that miracast is but still

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.930 
of technology that miracast is but still
this<00:04:41.960> is<00:04:42.230> pretty<00:04:42.560> good<00:04:42.860> performance<00:04:43.130> if<00:04:43.790> you

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
this is pretty good performance if you
