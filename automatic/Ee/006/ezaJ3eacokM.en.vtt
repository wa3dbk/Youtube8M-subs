00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.740
 Hi everyone 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.440
 today I want to show you how 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.960
 make a Christmas decoration for 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.630
 the table is in fact a 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.239
 small sapling in cardboard with which that 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.460
 hypothesized as decoration lo 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.530
 place each guest on the plate 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.650
 to make the table super super 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.390
 themed is very simple to realize yes 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.850
 it is two cardboard shapes e 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.040
 in fact, covered with a gift card 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.280
 normally when receiving a gift either 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.229
 Christmas birthday sure not to be the 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.970
 I take the paper put it aside in 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.460
 this case I just picked up 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.650
 all my Christmas cards 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.479
 to started creating these trees in 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.130
 actually for now they have only created two 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.410
 but the intention is to create them 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.530
 precisely for all my relatives who 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.149
 they will be with us on Christmas day 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.640
 in fact we are usually at my parents' house 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.619
 All cousins ​​are used by parents 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.300
 it's a very fun day maybe 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.460
 the only one in the year in which it succeeds 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.960
 everywhere get all together 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.460
 I therefore hope you enjoy this idea 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.429
 I assure you that also very fast from 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.539
 therefore realize if obviously one 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.179
 during the christmas holidays always 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.069
 engaged in cooking and preparing though 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:44.410
 actually you can read that these 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.860
 trees because it doesn't take much 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.500
 time 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.119
 I hope you like this idea there 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.979
 I leave the tutorial but as usual vi 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.289
 remember in the info box you will find all the 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.000
 my contacts if you want to find me on 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.729
 facebook if you want to go and see the 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.470
 new site for hiring weddings is 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.090
 obviously if you like this video 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.009
 put I like to share it on 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.880
 facebook see you next time 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.440
 hello let's see what we need 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.440
 pencil cutter rubber scissors from 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.390
 cancel gift card with the 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.690
 vinyl a small brush to spread it 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.340
 cardboard square and finally a shape 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.290
 guide where we're going to draw the 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.480
 our Christmas tree and now let's see 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.490
 how to proceed 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.340
 first we draw our own 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.680
 Christmas tree shaped silhouette 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.260
 I will use this verne but first I have it 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.439
 used in the campaign 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.989
 the printer to draw let's say the 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.819
 first Christmas sapling so 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.829
 do it totally symmetrical so i have 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.569
 May I designed albarello folded 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.970
 sheet in two their is cut after that 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.790
 praise traced and I prepared mine 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.310
 so shit silhouette in cardboard this 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.970
 we no longer needed one for now let's try 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.849
 the cardboard our silhouette is 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.519
 we simply decant twice 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.650
 we review twice the outline of the 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.739
 our sapling after which we will go to 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.019
 cut it out with the cutter 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.819
 and here are our two shapes is a 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.739
 tree shape at this point 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.680
 take the cutter and go to 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.599
 cut out the contours so if 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.519
 you can use one 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.180
 bracket otherwise you can do like 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.450
 I do 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.950
 so you can swirl free at the beginning 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.019
 may frighten you a little because 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.329
 surely be a little bit scared of 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.159
 make mistakes but I assure you that it is not one 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.019
 what so complicated is it only necessary 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:33.150
 take your hand a little else otherwise 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.220
 go quietly with the incorrect 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.389
 and cut out the two health of the 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.400
 saplings 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.199
 and here is our two shapes this 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.500
 point we have to make two cuts so 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:47.250
 let the two shapes fit together then 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.260
 a cut will start from the base 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.810
 of the tree will arrive at about the center 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.639
 while in the other it will start from the tip 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.790
 from the tree and will always come up to 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:59.400
 center in this case help me with the 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.160
 team to find the center in this 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.970
 case the basis of my all garelli 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:09.010
 is about 11 cm so half 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:12.830
 this is where I come from at this point 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:16.370
 I will slightly leave about half 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:19.190
 centimeter I draw two lines to make a 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.440
 I don't say precise cut but at least for 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.490
 a guideline to follow 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.810
 let's say he came up to about 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.490
 this point should therefore be 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.940
 about half 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:37.100
 the same thing I do here from the tip 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:40.750
 as I told you this way about this 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:44.090
 point takes the cutter again 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.730
 we no longer need and how to cut out 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.160
 these two little pieces ran two languages 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.050
 obviously takes then I will go to try 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.780
 the joint if it is not good enough to remove 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.760
 an additional piece of cardboard 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.390
 if instead you want to do everything in a way 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.280
 very precisely measure the height 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:03.650
 of the sapling you divide by two and you will have 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.260
 the exact measure you need to go to 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.870
 cut out of each template I make 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.790
 instead so by eye 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.470
 here are two cuts once made 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.880
 the cut so we can go to 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:17.750
 fit the two shapes in this way 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.480
 it is so 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.050
 we get our remaining little tree 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.419
 standing 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.790
 so let's say a kind of sapling 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.470
 three-dimensional at this point that 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.240
 we see that we have seen that therefore the 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.490
 two silhouettes are perfectly fattening 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.590
 take our vinyl glue 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.110
 gift card and we are going to dress the 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:39.830
 surfaces on both the front and the front 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:42.550
 that on the back with the brush spread 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.550
 the glue 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.880
 in this way very much indeed 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.460
 simply after that it leaves it 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.140
 dry for a few moments and go to 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.750
 apply the gift card 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.750
 v how to wait a few moments 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.480
 let the glue begin 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:01.420
 to dry slightly in this way 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.610
 the gift card will not get wet 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.800
 too otherwise then maybe and we risk 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.500
 let the bubbles ruin you 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.720
 instead in this way it should come out 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.560
 everything perfect in just a few moments 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:17.770
 at this point the thing is drying 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:25.050
 so I spend my piece of paper 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:30.700
 from packs and sticky mamia silhouette nothing 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:32.919
 and the other also leaves some to dry 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.300
 instant after which it will paste I will do the 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:35.680
 same thing also on this 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.350
 side of the card 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.780
 after that we will see how to proceed 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.210
 coated on one of my trees 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.010
 on one side of the other it has already started 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.080
 trim them because in fact after having 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:50.080
 once the paper has dried, it does not remain 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.390
 that to go to trim rossago but a lot 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.750
 fast with scissors so as to 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:57.460
 precisely to show our little tree 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.760
 the shape of our sapling does not 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:03.669
 forget about going to cut out 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.290
 paper also along our cut 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:07.930
 which will help us fit the two together 

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.520
 shapes once we trimmed the 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.160
 two sagas craft the result that 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.410
 we will get this and at this point 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.760
 all that remains is to reassemble arinc ha 

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.900
 cold and the silhouettes as we did 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.240
 at the beginning of the video 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:21.190
 so in this way and at this point 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.320
 we can say that our decoration 

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:25.000
 for the Christmas table is ready 

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:28.410
 I hope you enjoyed this idea and 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.410
 see you at the next video 

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:47.100
 if instead you go on the part that small 

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.100
 keeps me on 

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:57.420
 yes, because the system accepts a place
