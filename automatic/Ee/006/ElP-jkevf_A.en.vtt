00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.579

 how are you welcome as always to 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.650
 this one more edition of mma spanish 4.0 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.280
 as you know we always talk about arts 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.620
 mixed martial arts but today since 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.960
 it's a contact sport and since it 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.270
 looming which many have called the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.660
 fight of the century let's talk about the 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:36.059
 next boxing match between floyd 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.789
 mayweather and manny pacquiao of course 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.860
 without forgetting before greeting 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:44.490
 our partners knocking out 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.370
 dotcom and of mma crazy two of the 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.739
 most important latin websites 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.220
 totally mixed martial arts 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.430
 recommended to visit so we are going to 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.649
 it so if they did not know something 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.320
 that I do not believe if they live in the same 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.649
 planet that the rest of the mortals the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.500
 next May 2 is going to meet the 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:10.530
 what is going to be the so-called combat of 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.900
 century inside of what boxing is 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.950
 true that in other combats or events 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.500
 sports 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.869
 phrases like these are used to give if 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.390
 it fits even more emotion but in this 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.140
 he has earned it for several 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.299
 very heavy reasons for example 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.939
 economically speaking this fight is 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.569
 has become a madness of dizziness 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.000
 figures that scare anyone without going 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:38.969
 further away and many days of the tan 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.030
 longed for event has already hung the 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:44.969
 poster of no tickets and does not stop 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.299
 be surprising because the tickets more 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:51.750
 cheap ones have not gone down of 3500 dollars 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:55.170
 the most expensive 20,000 and we can not 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.770
 forget the vip boxes that amount to 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.739
 the whopping amount of 61 thousand dollars 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.739
 it could not be otherwise since in the 

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:07.170
 also called event or fight like 

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:09.840
 most lucrative in history had to 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.230
 be disputed precisely by the 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.989
 fighter in this case the athlete 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.209
 best paid in history we know that 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.340
 this event is going to be estimated around 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.800
 the 800 million 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.560
 dollars and it had to be therefore money 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.680
 mayweather considered as said by the 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.810
 forbes magazine the best paid of all 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.870
 the athletes in all sports and 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.860
 areas of the world knowing that it is going 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:41.160
 to bag nothing more and nothing less than 120 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.370
 millions of dollars against the 80 's 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.250
 pacquiao who says he states that his 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.250
 best prize will be to beat all this 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.220
 you should include the extra income 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.620
 as are the advertising and the pay per 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.380
 view that should be noted that it will be 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:03.840
 also the most expensive in history with 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:06.060
 89 with 95 and 99 with 95 in its hd version 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.220
 I would not be surprised if with these 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.549
 sometimes complicated amounts of 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.590
 assimilate are thinking stop seeing 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.349
 this video but I'm going to ask today 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.730
 a favor, do not do it because in the end 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.790
 I'm going to ask a question that to me 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.040
 it really interests me so much so 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.040
 before, if you allow me to introduce myself 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.940
 in the sporting plane I'm going to tell you the 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.770
 last amount 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.340
 economic that I'm going to put in quotes 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:35.550
 which are the ten thousand dollars that is going to 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.820
 pocket the referee for just one 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.280
 Work time is not bad at this time 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.500
 mega combat everything is going to be big 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.080
 because in it they will defend three 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.650
 the council's welterweight titles 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:53.370
 world boxing or wv ce of the 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.770
 world boxing association w see and of 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.640
 age and the world organization of 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:02.220
 boxing w I see why the winner will be 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:06.090
 considered the best boxer pound for 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:08.220
 pound of the world it is commented that in addition 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.100
 will mention the winner of the 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.010
 duel with a belt with a very design 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.830
 special already entering the field 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.380
 sporting which is where mainly 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:22.920
 the true fans of noble art 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:26.070
 The more you wanted to see this 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.530
 fight that after five long years 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.050
 that it practically seemed like it was going to 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.450
 close on more than one occasion failed us 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.900
 It could not be but the funny thing about all this 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.870
 is that 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.520
 five years later and because of the 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.280
 normal cycles we went through 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.979
 all humans these two geniuses the 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.949
 Quadrilateral do not come at their best 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:49.770
 moments of yesteryear there is no doubt that both 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:52.830
 they are among the best boxers in the 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:56.550
 history and that they are record keepers 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:59.490
 practically impossible to improve 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:04.800
 manny pacquiao without going any further in his 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:08.970
 race has played 64 fights 57 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:12.240
 won 38 for every five losses and two 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:17.639
 no contest and floyd mayweather has 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:20.789
 disputed 47 fights and has 47 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:24.539
 concrete victories with this case 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:27.419
 practically impossible to beat 26 of 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:30.870
 they also please not from the American 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:34.440
 They may look like better numbers than 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:37.080
 of the Filipino but you would have to see when 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.830
 dispute the 17 fights that are missing 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.400
 to get to the disputed x 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.860
 if it would improve or worsen that record 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.200
 already entering technical terms 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.380
 pacquiao is a fighter who always 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.840
 box forward and it exposes maybe 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.240
 too much but that takes advantage of 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.020
 Devilish fist speed everything 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.150
 contrary 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.880
 that mayweather who is an expert in the 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.810
 counterattack being the king of skiing see 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:08.270
 and throwing precise punches while 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:11.570
 He goes back to put his 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:14.840
 adversary we talk about two styles 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:17.300
 totally opposite and it would be a matter 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.720
 of pugilistic tastes floy mayweather 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:23.990
 he is an exceptional champion and athlete 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.300
 fantastic that has not lost for 19 years 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:29.990
 and which is known for its 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:32.180
 eccentricities and manny pacquiao is another 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:35.090
 quadrilateral artist with a record 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:38.480
 blameless to what is known as a 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:40.760
 simple and humble man all the 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.340
 bets give the fight to the current 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.340
 champion and his status as undefeated 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:49.030
 want or not in case of equality can 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:51.530
 in favor of the American but 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.630
 independently of the forecasts and 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:57.020
 here he threw the question that before 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:59.570
 I warned you who they want me to win 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:02.320
 please answer me really 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.320
 he is very interested 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:10.810
 Well, logically, for reasons 

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:13.060
 by profession logically I'm not going to 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:15.610
 pronounce but I'm just going to 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:18.370
 give a clue I love the values 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:20.290
 like simplicity and humility if I 

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.180
 have listened with attention possibly 

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:24.640
 you know my answers I'm going to 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:27.610
 fire and summoned them to be 

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:29.050

 since shortly we are going to do one of the 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.820
 that we usually do and what 

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.890
 what we like most are the arts 

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.780
