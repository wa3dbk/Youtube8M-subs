00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
Germany have produced in a long time

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.660 
Germany have produced in a long time
like<00:00:51.149> he's<00:00:52.140> amazing<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.949> think<00:00:53.340> he<00:00:53.460> would<00:00:53.579> be<00:00:53.610> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
like he's amazing I think he would be a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.549 
like he's amazing I think he would be a
class<00:00:53.969> player<00:00:54.210> I've<00:00:54.390> erroneous<00:00:54.750> 36<00:00:55.379> million

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
class player I've erroneous 36 million

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.799 
class player I've erroneous 36 million
buyout<00:00:55.829> clause<00:00:55.980> main<00:00:56.640> idea<00:00:56.940> can<00:00:57.210> buy<00:00:57.570> that

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
buyout clause main idea can buy that

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.639 
buyout clause main idea can buy that
mullah<00:00:58.440> he's<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.219> talks<00:00:59.550> with<00:01:00.440> Bayern<00:01:01.440> right

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
mullah he's in talks with Bayern right

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.740 
mullah he's in talks with Bayern right
now<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.640> think<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.120> probably<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.539> best

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
now so I think this is probably the best

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.560 
now so I think this is probably the best
idea<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.500> time<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.670> actually<00:01:05.850> put<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.390> bid

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
idea and time to actually put in a bid

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.969 
idea and time to actually put in a bid
for<00:01:06.689> mullah<00:01:06.869> because<00:01:07.200> he<00:01:07.380> could<00:01:07.590> consider

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
for mullah because he could consider

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.590 
for mullah because he could consider
leaving<00:01:08.250> because<00:01:08.580> he's<00:01:08.700> not<00:01:08.850> getting<00:01:09.150> every

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
leaving because he's not getting every

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.649 
leaving because he's not getting every
match<00:01:10.140> up<00:01:10.530> by<00:01:10.799> him<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.520> pay<00:01:11.729> young<00:01:12.360> dutch

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
match up by him and to pay young dutch

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.170 
match up by him and to pay young dutch
player<00:01:12.960> really<00:01:13.860> got<00:01:14.010> loads<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.490> potential<00:01:14.790> I

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
player really got loads of potential I

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.440 
player really got loads of potential I
think<00:01:15.479> he's<00:01:15.600> 18<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.820> he<00:01:17.820> should<00:01:18.030> be<00:01:18.060> joining

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
think he's 18 and he should be joining

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.840 
think he's 18 and he should be joining
because<00:01:18.689> he<00:01:19.020> does<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.369> Dutch<00:01:20.549> squad

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
because he does is in the Dutch squad

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.890 
because he does is in the Dutch squad
and<00:01:21.060> Louis<00:01:21.869> van<00:01:22.200> how<00:01:22.560> does<00:01:23.189> actually<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
and Louis van how does actually is the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.840 
and Louis van how does actually is the
coach<00:01:25.110> on<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.680> he<00:01:25.890> actually<00:01:26.220> can<00:01:26.549> see

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
coach on that so he actually can see

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.080 
coach on that so he actually can see
what<00:01:27.689> he<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.500> like<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.280> think<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.970> would

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
what he is like and I think that would

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.670 
what he is like and I think that would
be<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> class<00:01:30.720> player<00:01:30.990> for<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.200> future<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.530> my

Carrick<00:01:47.939> old<00:01:48.409> Fletcher<00:01:49.409> old<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.310> cleverly

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
Carrick old Fletcher old and cleverly

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.810 
Carrick old Fletcher old and cleverly
well<00:01:51.530> had<00:01:52.530> anything<00:01:52.680> said<00:01:53.100> about<00:01:53.220> him<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.670> just

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
well had anything said about him is just

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.649 
well had anything said about him is just
bad<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:54.659> him<00:01:55.049> definitely<00:01:55.909> classy<00:01:56.909> he's<00:01:57.479> is

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
bad so him definitely classy he's is

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.109 
bad so him definitely classy he's is
probably<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.990> young<00:01:58.640> probably<00:01:59.640> better<00:01:59.939> than

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
probably a young probably better than

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.280 
probably a young probably better than
cleverly<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.750> think<00:02:00.869> we<00:02:01.049> should<00:02:01.170> probably

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
cleverly so I think we should probably

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.080 
cleverly so I think we should probably
