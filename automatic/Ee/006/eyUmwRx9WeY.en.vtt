00:00:07.329 --> 00:00:11.640
 April you will use music teacher 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.289
 she 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.080
 Oh 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.080
 fact 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.080
 I've done 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.080
 to size 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.659
 in nothing 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.040
 in the air 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.430
 usandivaras 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.430
 luckily it's in the air 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.400
 Gentlemen, let's see the vote for the 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:33.049
 anthony to open it 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.049
 NACHA Mrs. guevara 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:40.060
 half white danced before you said 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:44.079
 never ever in my life I think that 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.379
 doing these three hours a day that the 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:50.530
 program proposes and you can get to dance 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:53.829
 well because it makes rhythmic sense that is 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.930
 important and has some natural grace 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:58.239
 to take advantage of it 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.950
 the choreography was simple on the floor 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.359
 complicated in the tricks but simple 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.310
 on the floor but they get along 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:09.280
 no advice, never, never put a 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:13.090
 animal before your act because the animal 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.099
 you'll always take the act nor 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.430
 animal or a child not because they have more 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.239
 angel that we but well I think that 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.949
 in time 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.840
 this couple is going to evolve you have a 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:25.090
 good mate this couple is going to 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.930
 evolve the same way we are going calm 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.930
 let's go easy
