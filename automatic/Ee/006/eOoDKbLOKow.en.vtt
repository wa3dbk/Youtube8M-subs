00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:15.350
 in this new video showing 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:18.119

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.990
 nothing here the paper 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:33.380
 he has in various graduations is starting 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:36.420
 to know even her safe room I know 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.540
 He's on the account like that. 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:47.120
 a lot of people prefer to buy more expensive 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:56.190
 here are several weights 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:01:00.149
 beginning in weight h more than it is 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:05.549
 more air move buy related more 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:08.420
 expensive than this but this one also gives 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.960
 give the message and do not look there 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:20.009
 castel you will find in more 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:27.659
 accessible than this one but you just 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:30.540
 find specialized websites and 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:41.100

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:55.940
 softer 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:59.159
 a case for example of natura of 400 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:03.409
 four hundred is not the role of natura 4 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:09.420
