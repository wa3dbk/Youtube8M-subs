00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.579 

we're<00:00:23.000> going<00:00:23.210> to<00:00:23.300> use<00:00:23.509> a<00:00:23.539> double<00:00:23.960> portafilter

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:24.589 
we're going to use a double portafilter

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:26.380 
we're going to use a double portafilter
with<00:00:24.949> two<00:00:25.189> spouts<00:00:25.490> to<00:00:25.970> pull<00:00:26.119> a<00:00:26.150> single

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390

espresso<00:00:26.720> why<00:00:27.619> I<00:00:27.949> know<00:00:28.009> that<00:00:28.130> sounds<00:00:28.519> crazy

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
espresso why I know that sounds crazy

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.419 
espresso why I know that sounds crazy
and<00:00:28.999> wasteful<00:00:29.449> but<00:00:30.050> the<00:00:30.349> shape<00:00:30.589> of<00:00:30.800> the<00:00:30.949> basket

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:31.429 
and wasteful but the shape of the basket

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.060 
and wasteful but the shape of the basket
for<00:00:31.910> a<00:00:31.939> single<00:00:32.419> shot<00:00:32.450> is<00:00:32.900> radically<00:00:33.650> different

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
for a single shot is radically different

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.650 
for a single shot is radically different
than<00:00:34.190> that<00:00:34.340> for<00:00:34.520> a<00:00:34.579> double<00:00:34.910> shot<00:00:35.090> so<00:00:35.390> we<00:00:35.510> would

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
than that for a double shot so we would

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.240 
than that for a double shot so we would
actually<00:00:36.050> need<00:00:36.200> to<00:00:36.320> make<00:00:36.470> an<00:00:36.590> adjustment<00:00:36.710> to

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
actually need to make an adjustment to

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.810 
actually need to make an adjustment to
the<00:00:37.370> grind

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
the grind

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.030 
the grind
in<00:00:37.880> order<00:00:38.210> to<00:00:38.300> pull<00:00:38.480> a<00:00:38.510> single<00:00:38.750> shot<00:00:39.080> so<00:00:39.860> what

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
in order to pull a single shot so what

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.310 
in order to pull a single shot so what
we<00:00:40.130> typically<00:00:40.550> do<00:00:40.820> is<00:00:41.000> pull<00:00:41.330> a<00:00:41.360> double<00:00:41.570> split

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
we typically do is pull a double split

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.480 
we typically do is pull a double split
it<00:00:42.560> and<00:00:42.740> just<00:00:43.160> take<00:00:43.280> the<00:00:43.400> best<00:00:43.580> one<00:00:43.820> here<00:00:44.390> we<00:00:44.510> go

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.490 
it and just take the best one here we go

00:00:45.490 --> 00:01:48.520 
it and just take the best one here we go
follow<00:00:46.490> the<00:00:46.730> espresso<00:00:47.330> standard

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.830 

so<00:01:49.530> we<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:49.830> to<00:01:50.130> actually<00:01:51.120> beautiful<00:01:51.330> and

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
so we have to actually beautiful and

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.590 
so we have to actually beautiful and
equal<00:01:52.170> shots<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.560> espresso<00:01:53.210> this<00:01:54.210> one's<00:01:54.420> got

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
equal shots of espresso this one's got

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.150

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
that little ring of brown around the

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.680 
that little ring of brown around the
outside<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:56.970> one's<00:01:57.150> got<00:01:57.330> lots<00:01:57.540> of
