recommend that people begin with the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.440 
recommend that people begin with the
story<00:01:24.170> mode<00:01:24.470> as<00:01:24.710> it<00:01:25.280> has<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:25.670> steadiest<00:01:26.090> level

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450

story mode as it has the steadiest level
of<00:01:26.570> difficulty<00:01:26.960> progression<00:01:27.649> and<00:01:27.800> it<00:01:28.250> allows

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
of difficulty progression and it allows

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.950 
of difficulty progression and it allows
you<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:28.729> get<00:01:28.850> a<00:01:28.909> sampling<00:01:29.330> of<00:01:29.509> the<00:01:29.659> different

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.870 
gameplay elements which there are a ton
of<00:01:32.350> some<00:01:33.350> like<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.740> double<00:01:33.920> and<00:01:34.220> rocket<00:01:34.640> jump

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880

of some like the double and rocket jump
are<00:01:35.060> pretty<00:01:35.330> easy<00:01:35.509> concepts<00:01:36.200> to<00:01:36.320> grasp<00:01:36.350> but

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
are pretty easy concepts to grasp but

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.980 
are pretty easy concepts to grasp but
