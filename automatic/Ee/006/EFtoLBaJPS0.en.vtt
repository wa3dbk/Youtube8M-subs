and making those three-dimensional

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.760 
and making those three-dimensional
models<00:01:43.450> because<00:01:43.690> I<00:01:43.810> usually<00:01:43.990> work<00:01:44.350> in<00:01:44.530> two

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
models because I usually work in two

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.899

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
dimensions and so in that respect it was

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:49.770 
dimensions and so in that respect it was
