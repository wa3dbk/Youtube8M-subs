numbers whole numbers are the numbers

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.350 
numbers whole numbers are the numbers
that<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:13.740> probably<00:00:14.099> use<00:00:14.340> most<00:00:14.670> often<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.330> your

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
that you probably use most often in your

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.019 
that you probably use most often in your
life<00:00:15.529> whole<00:00:16.529> numbers<00:00:16.920> consists<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.640> all<00:00:17.910> of

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
life whole numbers consists of all of

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.179 
life whole numbers consists of all of
the<00:00:18.210> natural<00:00:18.630> numbers<00:00:19.170> or<00:00:19.380> counting<00:00:19.650> numbers

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
the natural numbers or counting numbers

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.519 
the natural numbers or counting numbers
as<00:00:20.400> we<00:00:20.609> see<00:00:20.850> here<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.830> 0<00:00:22.830> here<00:00:24.109> we<00:00:25.109> see<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.320> very

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
as we see here and 0 here we see a very

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.099 
as we see here and 0 here we see a very
straightforward<00:00:26.150> addition<00:00:27.150> problem<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.720> two

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
straightforward addition problem of two

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.299 
straightforward addition problem of two
whole<00:00:28.380> numbers<00:00:28.560> we<00:00:29.429> have<00:00:29.580> 1<00:00:29.910> plus<00:00:30.300> 2<00:00:30.480> equals<00:00:31.109> 3

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
whole numbers we have 1 plus 2 equals 3

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:34.340 
whole numbers we have 1 plus 2 equals 3
which<00:00:32.309> means<00:00:32.550> if<00:00:32.759> we<00:00:32.880> take<00:00:33.030> one<00:00:33.360> item<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.870> we

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
which means if we take one item and we

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.940 
which means if we take one item and we
add<00:00:34.559> two<00:00:35.550> more<00:00:35.700> items<00:00:36.200> we<00:00:37.200> have<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.380> total<00:00:37.829> of

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
add two more items we have a total of

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.260 
add two more items we have a total of
one<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:39.120> three<00:00:39.480> items<00:00:40.700> the<00:00:41.700> numbers<00:00:42.059> being

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
one to three items the numbers being

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.529 
one to three items the numbers being
added<00:00:42.540> are<00:00:42.809> called<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:44.239> addenda<00:00:45.239> skasely

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
added are called the addenda skasely

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.369 
added are called the addenda skasely
identity<00:00:46.410> one<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.010> two<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:48.780> answer<00:00:48.960> is

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
identity one and two and the answer is

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.850 
identity one and two and the answer is
called<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.890> sum<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.629> in<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.750> problem<00:00:51.989> 3<00:00:52.590> is

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
called the sum so in this problem 3 is

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.910 
called the sum so in this problem 3 is
the<00:00:53.039> sum<00:00:53.280> now<00:00:53.899> one<00:00:54.899> key<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.379> adding<00:00:55.530> whole

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
the sum now one key to adding whole

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.760 
the sum now one key to adding whole
numbers<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.489> knowing<00:00:56.879> place<00:00:57.149> value<00:00:57.770> starting

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
numbers is knowing place value starting

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.680 
numbers is knowing place value starting
with<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.070> rightmost<00:00:59.789> digit<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.510> whole

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
with the rightmost digit of a whole

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.030 
with the rightmost digit of a whole
number<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:01.739> would<00:01:01.829> have<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.219> ones<00:01:02.780> tens

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
number we would have the ones tens

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.570 
number we would have the ones tens
hundreds<00:01:05.270> thousands<00:01:06.270> ten<00:01:06.900> thousands<00:01:07.580> hundred

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
hundreds thousands ten thousands hundred

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.450 
hundreds thousands ten thousands hundred
thousands<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.270> millions<00:01:09.799> so<00:01:10.799> for<00:01:10.979> example<00:01:11.369> if

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
thousands and millions so for example if

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.770 
thousands and millions so for example if
we<00:01:11.520> wanted<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.760> write<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.210> number<00:01:12.420> in

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
we wanted to write this number in

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.289 
we wanted to write this number in
expanded<00:01:13.409> form<00:01:13.460> to<00:01:14.460> represent<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:15.060> place

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
expanded form to represent the place

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.960 
expanded form to represent the place
value<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.930> each<00:01:16.140> digit<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:17.430> could<00:01:17.580> write<00:01:17.759> this

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
value of each digit we could write this

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.860 
value of each digit we could write this
number<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.960> table

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.210 

so<00:01:24.870> this<00:01:25.050> one<00:01:25.380> represents<00:01:26.070> 10,000<00:01:27.830> this<00:01:28.830> five

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
so this one represents 10,000 this five

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.370 
so this one represents 10,000 this five
is<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.700> thousands<00:01:30.420> place<00:01:30.480> value<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.260> this

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
is in the thousands place value so this

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.070 
is in the thousands place value so this
represents<00:01:31.980> 5,000

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.260 

the<00:01:36.710> two<00:01:37.010> is<00:01:37.190> in<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:37.370> hundreds<00:01:37.940> so<00:01:38.120> this

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
the two is in the hundreds so this

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.830 
the two is in the hundreds so this
represents<00:01:38.810> 200<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:40.820> six<00:01:41.120> is<00:01:41.270> in<00:01:41.300> the<00:01:41.510> tens

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
represents 200 the six is in the tens

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.890 
represents 200 the six is in the tens
that<00:01:42.260> represents<00:01:42.770> sixty<00:01:43.330> the<00:01:44.330> four<00:01:44.600> is<00:01:44.750> in<00:01:44.870> the

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
that represents sixty the four is in the

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.310 
that represents sixty the four is in the
ones<00:01:45.020> so<00:01:45.980> that<00:01:46.010> represents<00:01:46.640> four<00:01:47.140> so<00:01:48.140> this

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
ones so that represents four so this

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.060 
ones so that represents four so this
expanded<00:01:48.920> form<00:01:49.570> shows<00:01:50.570> what<00:01:51.350> each<00:01:51.500> digit

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
expanded form shows what each digit

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.460 
expanded form shows what each digit
represents<00:01:52.610> in<00:01:52.670> this<00:01:52.820> number<00:01:53.180> based<00:01:53.990> upon<00:01:54.260> its

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
represents in this number based upon its

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.970 
represents in this number based upon its
place<00:01:54.710> value<00:01:56.020> okay<00:01:57.020> so<00:01:57.080> here's<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.530> procedure

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
place value okay so here's the procedure

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.100 
place value okay so here's the procedure
for<00:01:58.310> adding<00:01:58.490> whole<00:01:58.760> numbers<00:01:58.930> we're<00:01:59.930> going<00:02:00.050> to

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
for adding whole numbers we're going to

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.140 
for adding whole numbers we're going to
write<00:02:00.290> this<00:02:00.440> sum<00:02:00.680> in<00:02:00.830> vertical<00:02:01.220> form<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:01.850> line

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
write this sum in vertical form and line

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.240 
write this sum in vertical form and line
up<00:02:02.300> the<00:02:02.330> corresponding<00:02:03.200> place<00:02:03.470> values<00:02:03.620> and

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
up the corresponding place values and

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.910 
up the corresponding place values and
then<00:02:05.090> we'll<00:02:05.240> add<00:02:05.510> by<00:02:05.930> starting<00:02:06.380> with<00:02:06.410> the<00:02:06.680> ones

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
then we'll add by starting with the ones

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.750 
then we'll add by starting with the ones
column<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:07.700> then<00:02:08.180> work<00:02:08.390> our<00:02:08.540> way<00:02:08.570> left<00:02:09.760> we

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
column and then work our way left we

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.460 
column and then work our way left we
will<00:02:10.910> have<00:02:11.090> to<00:02:11.240> carry<00:02:11.510> if<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:11.990> sum<00:02:12.170> of<00:02:12.290> any

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
will have to carry if the sum of any

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.340 
will have to carry if the sum of any
column<00:02:12.980> is<00:02:13.160> a<00:02:13.190> two-digit<00:02:13.910> number<00:02:14.140> so<00:02:15.140> here's

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
column is a two-digit number so here's

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.350 
column is a two-digit number so here's
an<00:02:15.440> example<00:02:16.390> 348<00:02:17.390> +<00:02:17.840> 73<00:02:18.850> we'll<00:02:19.850> write<00:02:20.000> this<00:02:20.180> in

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
an example 348 + 73 we'll write this in

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.060 
an example 348 + 73 we'll write this in
vertical<00:02:20.750> form<00:02:21.220> so<00:02:22.220> write<00:02:22.490> down<00:02:22.810> 348<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:24.070> then

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
vertical form so write down 348 and then

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
we write down the one in the ones column

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.710 
we write down the one in the ones column
when<00:02:51.739> we<00:02:51.800> carry<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.310> one<00:02:52.610> over<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:53.390> tens

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
plus seven well that would be 12 so we

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.080

lined up vertically let's go ahead and
start<00:03:39.080> to<00:03:39.200> find<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:39.620> sum<00:03:39.890> of<00:03:39.920> each<00:03:40.190> column

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
start to find the sum of each column

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.330 
start to find the sum of each column
starting<00:03:41.090> in<00:03:41.210> the<00:03:41.300> ones<00:03:41.590> nine<00:03:42.590> plus<00:03:42.890> six<00:03:43.190> would

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
starting in the ones nine plus six would

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.510 
starting in the ones nine plus six would
be<00:03:43.370> 15<00:03:44.140> so<00:03:45.140> we<00:03:45.230> write<00:03:45.410> down<00:03:45.440> the<00:03:45.770> five<00:03:46.100> in<00:03:46.400> the

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
be 15 so we write down the five in the

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.420 
be 15 so we write down the five in the
ones<00:03:46.790> column<00:03:47.000> and<00:03:47.600> carry<00:03:48.320> a<00:03:48.410> 1<00:03:48.860> to<00:03:49.100> the<00:03:49.130> tens

check for $149 so we want to find the

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.370 
check for $149 so we want to find the
sum<00:06:02.410> of<00:06:02.740> these<00:06:03.010> three<00:06:03.070> numbers<00:06:04.020> so<00:06:05.020> as<00:06:05.140> long<00:06:05.320> as

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
sum of these three numbers so as long as

sum of these three numbers so as long as
we<00:06:05.590> line<00:06:05.740> up<00:06:05.770> the<00:06:05.950> place<00:06:06.130> values<00:06:06.160> we<00:06:06.700> can<00:06:06.729> add

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
we line up the place values we can add

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.719 
we line up the place values we can add
all<00:06:07.419> three<00:06:07.690> of<00:06:07.810> these<00:06:07.930> at<00:06:08.200> the<00:06:08.290> same<00:06:08.320> time<00:06:08.860> we

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:09.729 
all three of these at the same time we

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:17.580 
all three of these at the same time we
have<00:06:09.880> 204<00:06:11.820> 748<00:06:12.820> and<00:06:14.190> 149<00:06:16.169> and<00:06:17.169> we'll<00:06:17.350> follow

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
have 204 748 and 149 and we'll follow

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.560 
have 204 748 and 149 and we'll follow
the<00:06:17.770> same<00:06:18.010> procedure<00:06:18.400> we'll<00:06:19.000> start<00:06:19.300> with<00:06:19.450> the

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.570 
the same procedure we'll start with the

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.030 
the same procedure we'll start with the
ones<00:06:19.810> column<00:06:20.169> 4<00:06:21.070> plus<00:06:21.430> 8<00:06:21.700> be<00:06:22.540> 12<00:06:22.930> plus<00:06:23.440> 9<00:06:23.770> that

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.040 
ones column 4 plus 8 be 12 plus 9 that

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.350 
ones column 4 plus 8 be 12 plus 9 that
would<00:06:24.160> be<00:06:24.250> 21<00:06:26.310> so<00:06:27.310> we<00:06:27.400> write<00:06:27.610> down<00:06:27.850> the<00:06:28.030> one<00:06:28.330> and

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
would be 21 so we write down the one and

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.130 
would be 21 so we write down the one and
carry<00:06:28.720> the<00:06:29.110> 2<00:06:29.410> into<00:06:29.800> the<00:06:30.010> tens<00:06:30.280> column<00:06:30.990> here<00:06:31.990> we

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.140 
carry the 2 into the tens column here we

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.860 
carry the 2 into the tens column here we
have<00:06:32.260> 0<00:06:32.530> plus<00:06:32.770> 4<00:06:33.130> plus<00:06:33.280> 4<00:06:33.640> that's<00:06:33.789> 8

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
have 0 plus 4 plus 4 that's 8

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.420 
have 0 plus 4 plus 4 that's 8
plus<00:06:34.990> the<00:06:35.140> two<00:06:35.320> that<00:06:35.500> we<00:06:35.590> carry<00:06:35.980> that<00:06:36.160> would<00:06:36.310> be

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
plus the two that we carry that would be

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.810 
plus the two that we carry that would be
ten<00:06:36.930> so<00:06:37.930> we<00:06:38.020> write<00:06:38.200> down<00:06:38.380> the<00:06:38.440> zero<00:06:38.650> and<00:06:39.340> carry

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:39.820 
ten so we write down the zero and carry

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.470 
ten so we write down the zero and carry
the<00:06:40.030> one<00:06:40.300> to<00:06:40.510> the<00:06:40.630> hundredths<00:06:41.050> column<00:06:42.360> so<00:06:43.360> here

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:43.480 
the one to the hundredths column so here

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.450 
the one to the hundredths column so here
we<00:06:43.570> have<00:06:43.690> two<00:06:43.900> plus<00:06:44.230> seven<00:06:44.620> plus<00:06:44.650> one<00:06:45.220> that's

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
we have two plus seven plus one that's

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:50.670 
we have two plus seven plus one that's
10<00:06:45.910> plus<00:06:46.360> 1<00:06:46.870> which<00:06:47.770> would<00:06:47.920> be<00:06:47.980> 11<00:06:49.410> so<00:06:50.410> the<00:06:50.530> New

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:50.680 
10 plus 1 which would be 11 so the New

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.690 
10 plus 1 which would be 11 so the New
Balance<00:06:50.890> and<00:06:51.370> the<00:06:51.790> checking<00:06:52.060> account<00:06:52.390> will<00:06:52.540> be

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:53.700 
Balance and the checking account will be

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.480 
Balance and the checking account will be
1,100<00:06:54.700> one<00:06:55.030> dollar<00:06:56.010> okay<00:06:57.010> that's<00:06:57.190> going<00:06:57.310> to<00:06:57.400> do
