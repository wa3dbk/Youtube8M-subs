some<00:00:29.250> really<00:00:29.490> fine<00:00:29.849> areas<00:00:30.390> because<00:00:31.289> I'm<00:00:31.410> using

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
some really fine areas because I'm using

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.220 
some really fine areas because I'm using
the<00:00:31.769> wind<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.730> key<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.180> windier<00:00:33.450> back<00:00:33.690> you

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
the wind the key to the windier back you

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.430 
the wind the key to the windier back you
get<00:00:34.320> longer<00:00:34.590> distance<00:00:35.190> throws<00:00:35.520> but<00:00:36.360> when<00:00:37.350> you

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
get longer distance throws but when you

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.200 
get longer distance throws but when you
do<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:38.190> got<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.370> really<00:00:38.670> make<00:00:38.760> sure<00:00:38.910> you

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
do that you got to really make sure you

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.729 
do that you got to really make sure you
keep<00:00:39.420> up<00:00:39.570> lower<00:00:39.840> control<00:00:40.200> because<00:00:40.620> you're

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
keep up lower control because you're

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.010 
keep up lower control because you're
actively<00:00:41.070> drifting<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.670> here<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.989> looks

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
actively drifting in here so it looks

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.940 
actively drifting in here so it looks
like<00:00:43.350> I'm<00:00:43.469> really<00:00:43.590> fast<00:00:43.980> like<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.600> I'm<00:00:45.600> not

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.970 

ran<00:00:49.160> into<00:00:49.460> a<00:00:49.610> crosswind

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
ran into a crosswind

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.220 
ran into a crosswind
this<00:00:51.520> is<00:00:51.670> where<00:00:51.850> it<00:00:51.910> gets<00:00:52.000> touchy<00:00:52.300> because

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
this is where it gets touchy because

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.890 
this is where it gets touchy because
your<00:00:53.559> accuracy<00:00:53.920> isn't<00:00:54.190> good<00:00:54.610> but<00:00:55.450> if<00:00:55.570> I<00:00:55.690> want

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
your accuracy isn't good but if I want

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.390 
your accuracy isn't good but if I want
to<00:00:55.989> throw<00:00:56.079> it<00:00:56.230> across<00:00:56.290> these<00:00:56.770> sticks

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
to throw it across these sticks

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.600 
to throw it across these sticks
you<00:00:58.150> got<00:00:58.300> to<00:00:58.420> go<00:00:58.510> upwind<00:00:59.020> and<00:00:59.739> you<00:01:00.250> create<00:01:00.550> a

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
you got to go upwind and you create a

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.619 
you got to go upwind and you create a
pole<00:01:00.879> in<00:01:01.000> your<00:01:01.150> line

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
pole in your line

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.530 
pole in your line
now<00:01:02.020> what<00:01:02.199> happens<00:01:02.559> with<00:01:02.680> that<00:01:02.710> boat<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:04.390> you

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
now what happens with that boat is you

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.090 
now what happens with that boat is you
got<00:01:04.690> to<00:01:04.839> keep<00:01:04.960> up<00:01:05.140> with<00:01:05.290> the<00:01:05.409> lure<00:01:05.560> because<00:01:05.890> now

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
got to keep up with the lure because now

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.910 
got to keep up with the lure because now
you're<00:01:06.250> changing<00:01:06.550> the<00:01:06.909> course<00:01:07.180> of<00:01:07.360> this<00:01:07.540> bait

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
you're changing the course of this bait

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.140 
you're changing the course of this bait
using<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.009> wind<00:01:09.220> to<00:01:09.369> catch<00:01:09.550> your<00:01:09.700> line<00:01:09.910> and

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
using the wind to catch your line and

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.450 
using the wind to catch your line and
bring<00:01:10.360> it<00:01:10.450> in<00:01:10.570> into<00:01:10.810> comfort<00:01:11.170> structure<00:01:11.619> and

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
bring it in into comfort structure and

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.040 
bring it in into comfort structure and
you<00:01:12.850> just<00:01:13.030> got<00:01:13.180> to<00:01:13.270> keep<00:01:13.360> up<00:01:13.540> to<00:01:13.720> it<00:01:13.810> because

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
you just got to keep up to it because

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.240 
you just got to keep up to it because
when<00:01:14.200> you<00:01:14.290> get<00:01:14.380> hit<00:01:14.650> you<00:01:14.800> got<00:01:14.890> to<00:01:15.009> bring<00:01:15.160> up

when you get hit you got to bring up

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.740 
when you get hit you got to bring up
that<00:01:15.369> slap<00:01:15.670> and<00:01:15.940> set<00:01:16.119> the<00:01:16.240> hook

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
that slap and set the hook

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.230 
that slap and set the hook
the<00:01:17.290> last<00:01:17.530> cast<00:01:17.890> is<00:01:18.369> thrown<00:01:18.670> right<00:01:18.850> into<00:01:19.090> the

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
the last cast is thrown right into the

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.899 
the last cast is thrown right into the
wind<00:01:19.619> problem<00:01:20.619> here<00:01:20.800> is<00:01:20.950> is<00:01:21.220> your<00:01:21.400> backlash

that<00:01:36.160> tool<00:01:36.460> through<00:01:36.759> the<00:01:36.850> water<00:01:37.060> call<00:01:37.330> so<00:01:38.110> this

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
that tool through the water call so this

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.200 
that tool through the water call so this
would<00:01:38.740> be<00:01:38.830> the<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.310> best<00:01:39.550> way<00:01:39.759> to<00:01:39.789> do<00:01:40.030> it<00:01:40.119> to

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
would be the the best way to do it to

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.359 
would be the the best way to do it to
keep<00:01:40.330> your<00:01:40.509> bait<00:01:40.720> at<00:01:41.020> a<00:01:41.350> constant<00:01:42.009> the<00:01:42.340> whole
