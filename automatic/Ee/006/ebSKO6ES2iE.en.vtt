hat well it's probably because I also
like<00:05:52.369> Sherlock<00:05:53.369> Holmes<00:05:53.580> and<00:05:54.379> he<00:05:55.379> doesn't<00:05:55.709> have

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
like Sherlock Holmes and he doesn't have

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.139 
like Sherlock Holmes and he doesn't have
this<00:05:55.949> hat<00:05:56.129> he's<00:05:56.249> a<00:05:56.279> different<00:05:56.459> kind<00:05:56.819> of<00:05:56.939> hat

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:57.149 
this hat he's a different kind of hat

00:05:57.149 --> 00:06:00.230 
this hat he's a different kind of hat
but<00:05:57.659> he<00:05:58.199> always<00:05:58.319> has<00:05:58.619> a<00:05:58.649> hat<00:05:58.919> when<00:05:59.819> he<00:05:59.909> thinks

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
but he always has a hat when he thinks

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.999 
but he always has a hat when he thinks
and<00:06:00.419> that's<00:06:01.050> why<00:06:01.199> I<00:06:01.229> would<00:06:01.589> like<00:06:01.709> to<00:06:01.860> have<00:06:01.979> a

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:02.009 
and that's why I would like to have a

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:05.329 
and that's why I would like to have a
hat<00:06:02.189> than<00:06:02.339> I<00:06:02.399> think<00:06:02.809> so<00:06:03.809> that<00:06:04.349> I<00:06:04.860> think<00:06:05.219> that

00:06:05.329 --> 00:06:05.339 
hat than I think so that I think that

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:06.439 
hat than I think so that I think that
the<00:06:05.490> hat<00:06:05.639> on<00:06:05.819> my<00:06:05.939> head<00:06:05.969> is<00:06:06.240> kind<00:06:06.389> of

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:06.449 
the hat on my head is kind of

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:07.969 
the hat on my head is kind of
representing<00:06:06.930> that<00:06:06.990> I'm<00:06:07.139> thinking<00:06:07.559> that's

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 
representing that I'm thinking that's

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:09.609 
representing that I'm thinking that's
why<00:06:08.069> I<00:06:08.099> like<00:06:08.279> to<00:06:08.339> have<00:06:08.459> it<00:06:08.550> during<00:06:08.669> the<00:06:08.849> game

00:06:09.609 --> 00:06:09.619 
why I like to have it during the game

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:12.320 
why I like to have it during the game

00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:38.939 
give to this question well what both

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:42.649 
give to this question well what both
sides<00:06:39.300> have<00:06:39.749> their<00:06:40.019> own<00:06:40.259> you<00:06:40.589> know<00:06:41.539> they<00:06:42.539> have

00:06:42.649 --> 00:06:42.659 
sides have their own you know they have

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:45.920 
sides have their own you know they have
their<00:06:42.839> own<00:06:43.219> agenda<00:06:44.219> you<00:06:44.729> know<00:06:44.759> they<00:06:45.059> have

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:45.930 
their own agenda you know they have

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.299

ideas they want to do things and I think

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:52.119 
ideas they want to do things and I think
both<00:06:50.309> parties<00:06:50.550> could<00:06:50.969> do<00:06:51.389> contribute<00:06:51.930> to

00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:52.129 
both parties could do contribute to

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:55.939 
both parties could do contribute to
chess<00:06:54.019> equality<00:06:55.019> you're<00:06:55.379> sitting<00:06:55.769> on<00:06:55.860> the

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:55.949 
chess equality you're sitting on the

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:57.859 
chess equality you're sitting on the
fence<00:06:56.129> I'm<00:06:56.849> not<00:06:57.089> sitting<00:06:57.330> on<00:06:57.389> the<00:06:57.479> fence<00:06:57.629> I

00:06:57.859 --> 00:06:57.869 
fence I'm not sitting on the fence I

00:06:57.869 --> 00:06:59.049 
fence I'm not sitting on the fence I
think<00:06:58.229> at<00:06:58.319> this<00:06:58.439> point

00:06:59.049 --> 00:06:59.059 
think at this point

00:06:59.059 --> 00:07:01.510 
think at this point
Kasparov<00:07:00.059> doesn't<00:07:00.719> have

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 
Kasparov doesn't have

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.210 
Kasparov doesn't have
the<00:07:02.120> funding<00:07:02.509> behind<00:07:02.810> him<00:07:03.020> himself<00:07:03.289> I<00:07:03.919> mean<00:07:04.160> I

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:04.220 
the funding behind him himself I mean I

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.969 
the funding behind him himself I mean I
think<00:07:04.310> he's<00:07:04.580> not<00:07:04.729> ready<00:07:05.050> it's<00:07:06.050> not<00:07:06.229> that<00:07:06.380> I<00:07:06.410> say

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:06.979 
think he's not ready it's not that I say

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:08.800 
think he's not ready it's not that I say
we<00:07:07.099> should<00:07:07.250> vote<00:07:07.400> for<00:07:07.460> Kirsten<00:07:07.970> because<00:07:08.300> he's

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:08.810 
we should vote for Kirsten because he's

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.450 
we should vote for Kirsten because he's
been<00:07:09.020> there<00:07:09.169> or<00:07:09.319> his<00:07:09.440> the<00:07:09.560> incumbent<00:07:10.039> or<00:07:10.280> he

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:10.460 
been there or his the incumbent or he

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.350 
been there or his the incumbent or he
has<00:07:10.580> more<00:07:10.759> power

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 
has more power

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.480 
has more power
I<00:07:11.389> think<00:07:12.199> the<00:07:12.289> scare<00:07:12.590> Kasparov<00:07:13.069> is<00:07:13.130> not<00:07:13.280> ready

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:13.490 
I think the scare Kasparov is not ready

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:14.970 
I think the scare Kasparov is not ready
for<00:07:13.550> it

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:14.980 
for it

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.510 
for it
thank<00:07:15.760> you<00:07:15.850> very<00:07:15.880> much<00:07:16.060> Yeltsin
