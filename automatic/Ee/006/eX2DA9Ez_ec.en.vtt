playing some some phenomenal halo you

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.950 
playing some some phenomenal halo you
know<00:01:46.890> usually<00:01:47.310> once<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.299> take<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.600> break<00:01:48.840> from

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
know usually once you take a break from

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.770 
know usually once you take a break from
a<00:01:49.079> game<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.470> gives<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.770> kind<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.280> drive<00:01:51.270> to

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
a game it gives you kind of the drive to

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.749 
a game it gives you kind of the drive to
come<00:01:52.140> back<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.470> play<00:01:52.619> your<00:01:52.770> best<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.250> usually

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
come back and play your best and usually

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.520 
come back and play your best and usually
you<00:01:54.479> don't<00:01:54.570> really<00:01:54.780> stress<00:01:54.990> about<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.409> much

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
you don't really stress about it so much

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.870 
you don't really stress about it so much
so<00:01:55.740> I've<00:01:55.950> been<00:01:56.040> kind<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.280> doing<00:01:56.399> about<00:01:56.640> that

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
you know it's frustrating you know once

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.660 
you know it's frustrating you know once
you're<00:02:22.129> determined<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.849> make<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:23.180> montage<00:02:23.480> and

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
you're determined to make a montage and

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.430 
you're determined to make a montage and
you<00:02:25.670> know<00:02:25.790> you<00:02:25.819> just<00:02:26.060> things<00:02:26.930> don't<00:02:27.260> go<00:02:27.410> your

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
you know you just things don't go your

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.670 
you know you just things don't go your
way<00:02:27.620> or<00:02:28.010> you<00:02:28.970> know<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.480> get<00:02:29.690> almost<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.560> the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
way or you know you get almost to the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.140 
way or you know you get almost to the
point<00:02:30.799> of<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:31.010> clip<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.400> then<00:02:31.700> something

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
point of a clip and then something

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.509 
point of a clip and then something
interrupts<00:02:32.629> at<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.900> last<00:02:33.200> second<00:02:33.620> so<00:02:34.370> it's

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
interrupts at the last second so it's

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.210 
interrupts at the last second so it's
frustrating<00:02:34.910> but<00:02:35.739> you<00:02:36.739> know<00:02:36.860> you'll<00:02:37.010> have<00:02:37.040> to
