00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
many makers of these cars so many people

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.840 
many makers of these cars so many people

in<00:00:44.059> this<00:00:45.059> really<00:00:45.690> nice<00:00:45.989> detailed<00:00:46.649> painted

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
in this really nice detailed painted

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:55.250 
in this really nice detailed painted
interior<00:00:50.600> really<00:00:51.600> cool<00:00:52.760> and<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:54.120> came<00:00:54.360> without

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
interior really cool and it came without

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.920 
interior really cool and it came without
a<00:00:55.500> push<00:00:55.739> bar<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.309> went<00:00:56.460> ahead<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.390> had

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
a push bar but I went ahead and I had

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.389 
a push bar but I went ahead and I had
one<00:00:58.469> for<00:00:59.039> my<00:01:00.350> CHP<00:01:01.350> unit<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:01.920> went<00:01:02.129> ahead<00:01:02.190> and

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
one for my CHP unit so I went ahead and

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.709 
one for my CHP unit so I went ahead and
put<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.180> there

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
put that on there

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.840 
put that on there
and<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.680> think<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.979> fits<00:01:05.010> good<00:01:07.549> and<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
and I think it fits good and the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.730 
and I think it fits good and the
interior<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.390> really<00:01:09.810> well<00:01:10.020> done<00:01:10.260> it's<00:01:10.560> not

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
interior is really well done it's not

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.929 
interior is really well done it's not
like<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:14.729> paint<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.299> very<00:01:15.540> good<00:01:15.990> for<00:01:16.700> these<00:01:17.700> do

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
like the paint is very good for these do

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:26.870 
like the paint is very good for these do
have<00:01:18.259> lights<00:01:19.850> drawers<00:01:20.850> open<00:01:21.270> up

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.110 

and<00:01:27.000> there's<00:01:27.690> mesh<00:01:28.580> for<00:01:30.860> prisoner<00:01:31.860> cage<00:01:32.159> both

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
and there's mesh for prisoner cage both

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.210 
and there's mesh for prisoner cage both
on<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.479> back<00:01:33.690> which<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.590> kind<00:01:34.830> of<00:01:34.890> wish<00:01:35.040> it

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
on the back which I kind of wish it

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.730 
on the back which I kind of wish it
wouldn't<00:01:35.460> be<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.910> back<00:01:36.090> window<00:01:36.540> if<00:01:37.530> they

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
wouldn't be on the back window if they

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.960 
wouldn't be on the back window if they
would<00:01:37.920> have<00:01:37.979> put<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.250> mesh<00:01:38.490> on<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.729> back

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
would have put the mesh on the back

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.770 
would have put the mesh on the back
window<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.570> then<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:41.180> believe<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.330> is<00:01:42.390> made

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
window and then I believe this is made

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.109 
window and then I believe this is made
for<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.490> client<00:01:44.490> who<00:01:44.820> asked<00:01:45.450> for<00:01:45.510> it<00:01:45.869> but<00:01:47.119> the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
for a client who asked for it but the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.170 
for a client who asked for it but the
back<00:01:48.330> window<00:01:49.050> mesh<00:01:49.290> kind<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.830> blocks<00:01:50.160> the<00:01:50.940> deck

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
back window mesh kind of blocks the deck

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.320 
back window mesh kind of blocks the deck
lights<00:01:51.479> which<00:01:52.050> is<00:01:52.200> kind<00:01:52.410> of<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.770> know<00:01:53.330> not

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
lights which is kind of you know not

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.770 
lights which is kind of you know not
really<00:01:54.690> what<00:01:55.020> what<00:01:55.590> you'd<00:01:55.740> want<00:01:55.910> this<00:01:56.910> is<00:01:57.420> made

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
really what what you'd want this is made

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.980 
really what what you'd want this is made
a<00:01:57.810> lot<00:01:58.020> better<00:01:58.290> because<00:01:59.330> you've<00:02:00.330> got<00:02:00.630> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
a lot better because you've got the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.410 
a lot better because you've got the
battery<00:02:01.640> up<00:02:02.640> top<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:04.250> you've<00:02:05.250> got<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:06.300> know

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
battery up top and you've got you know

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.499 
battery up top and you've got you know
the<00:02:06.720> wheels<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.320> are<00:02:07.619> custom<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.509> believe

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
the wheels that are custom I believe

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.040 
the wheels that are custom I believe
those<00:02:09.750> are<00:02:09.899> just<00:02:10.050> painted<00:02:11.120> but<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.209> back<00:02:12.390> you

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
those are just painted but the back you

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.380 
those are just painted but the back you
know<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.260> can<00:02:13.560> actually<00:02:13.739> see<00:02:14.250> in<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:15.120> see<00:02:15.360> a

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
know you can actually see in you see a

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.590 
know you can actually see in you see a
lot<00:02:15.600> more<00:02:15.630> detail<00:02:15.810> in<00:02:16.260> here<00:02:16.739> on<00:02:17.250> this<00:02:18.090> one

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
lot more detail in here on this one

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.259 
lot more detail in here on this one
I'll<00:02:19.200> flip<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.680> lights<00:02:19.890> on<00:02:20.190> oh<00:02:20.430> yeah<00:02:21.000> you've

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
I'll flip the lights on oh yeah you've

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.890 
I'll flip the lights on oh yeah you've
seen<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.630> hood

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.699 

and<00:02:27.190> you've<00:02:28.190> got<00:02:28.489> to<00:02:28.730> switches<00:02:29.209> back<00:02:29.390> here

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
and you've got to switches back here

00:02:29.709 --> 00:04:00.099 
and you've got to switches back here
ones<00:02:30.709> for<00:03:56.590> two<00:03:57.590> toggles<00:03:58.660> which<00:03:59.660> I<00:03:59.870> think

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
ones for two toggles which I think

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:01.990 
ones for two toggles which I think
should<00:04:00.230> be<00:04:00.290> under<00:04:00.709> the<00:04:00.739> carpet<00:04:01.340> again<00:04:01.760> I<00:04:01.790> think

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
should be under the carpet again I think

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.290 
should be under the carpet again I think
this<00:04:02.299> is<00:04:02.480> an<00:04:02.629> earlier<00:04:02.930> model

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.750
