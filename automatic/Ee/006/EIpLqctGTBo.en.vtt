good and hot it's just about boiling I
don't<00:02:01.470> need<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.740> be<00:02:01.800> going<00:02:02.100> crazy

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
don't need it to be going crazy

where<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.460> score<00:02:08.820> is<00:02:09.060> not<00:02:09.540> too<00:02:09.690> much<00:02:09.840> passed

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
where the score is not too much passed

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.100 
where the score is not too much passed
it<00:02:10.320> and<00:02:11.130> then<00:02:11.250> I'm<00:02:11.310> just<00:02:11.340> gonna<00:02:11.490> hold<00:02:11.820> it<00:02:12.110> until

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
it gets nice and hot right up against

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.530 
it gets nice and hot right up against
the<00:02:16.110> score<00:02:16.940> we're<00:02:17.940> gonna<00:02:18.060> see<00:02:18.209> if<00:02:18.270> we<00:02:18.360> can<00:02:18.450> get

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
the score we're gonna see if we can get

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.330 
the score we're gonna see if we can get
this<00:02:18.690> done<00:02:18.959> in<00:02:19.230> one<00:02:19.530> shot<00:02:19.560> we're<00:02:20.040> gonna<00:02:20.130> give

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
this done in one shot we're gonna give

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.280 
this done in one shot we're gonna give
it<00:02:20.400> another<00:02:20.610> minute<00:02:20.820> just<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.810> get<00:02:22.020> warmer

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.960

try to hold the camera steady for you

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.339 
try to hold the camera steady for you
guys<00:02:27.180> just<00:02:29.810> a<00:02:30.810> few<00:02:30.959> minutes<00:02:31.200> we'll<00:02:31.319> have

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
guys just a few minutes we'll have

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.009 
guys just a few minutes we'll have

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
ourselves a great bottle next slide jam

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.949 
ourselves a great bottle next slide jam
with<00:02:38.000> alright<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.239> should<00:02:39.269> be<00:02:39.480> good<00:02:39.599> we'll

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
with alright that should be good we'll

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.410 
with alright that should be good we'll
see<00:02:40.049> if<00:02:40.110> we<00:02:40.170> can<00:02:40.260> do<00:02:40.319> this<00:02:40.440> in<00:02:40.530> one<00:02:40.650> shot<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:41.420> have

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
see if we can do this in one shot I have

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.750 
see if we can do this in one shot I have
to<00:02:42.510> dump<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.810> into<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.099> cold<00:02:44.099> water<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.519> I<00:02:44.580> did

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
to dump it into the cold water and I did

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.800 
to dump it into the cold water and I did
get<00:02:44.849> a<00:02:44.910> bigger<00:02:45.090> pocket<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.510> went<00:02:45.629> to<00:02:45.690> make

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
get a bigger pocket and went to make

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.559 
get a bigger pocket and went to make
sure<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:45.989> was<00:02:46.080> deep<00:02:46.230> enough<00:02:46.410> here<00:02:46.920> we<00:02:46.980> get

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.440 

there<00:02:51.569> it<00:02:51.660> is<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:52.019> crack<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:53.299> could<00:02:54.299> probably

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
there it is the crack I could probably

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.660 
there it is the crack I could probably
just<00:02:54.599> kind<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:54.959> give<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.379> little<00:02:55.409> tap<00:02:55.769> and<00:02:56.549> it

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
just kind of give it a little tap and it

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.979 
just kind of give it a little tap and it
would<00:02:56.760> just<00:02:57.150> come<00:02:57.299> right<00:02:57.420> off<00:02:59.870> sometimes<00:03:00.870> it

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
would just come right off sometimes it

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.339 
would just come right off sometimes it
needs<00:03:01.079> another<00:03:01.230> go<00:03:01.560> in<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.769> hot<00:03:01.920> water<00:03:03.349> I'm

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
needs another go in the hot water I'm

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.069 
needs another go in the hot water I'm
just<00:03:04.500> going<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.650> tap<00:03:04.920> it<00:03:04.950> in<00:03:05.190> sides<00:03:05.930> tap<00:03:06.930> it

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
just going to tap it in sides tap it

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.220 
just going to tap it in sides tap it
against<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.349> bottom<00:03:08.810> shake<00:03:09.810> it<00:03:09.930> around<00:03:10.019> a

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
against the bottom shake it around a

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:17.490 
against the bottom shake it around a
little<00:03:10.319> bit

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.350 

we<00:03:18.100> need<00:03:18.250> your<00:03:18.340> back<00:03:18.460> into<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.790> hot<00:03:18.910> water<00:03:18.940> one

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
we need your back into the hot water one

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.020 
we need your back into the hot water one
more<00:03:19.540> time<00:03:20.250> now<00:03:21.250> there's<00:03:21.520> some<00:03:21.640> risk<00:03:21.820> that<00:03:21.910> it

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
more time now there's some risk that it

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.810 
more time now there's some risk that it
will<00:03:22.150> fall<00:03:22.420> off<00:03:22.630> as<00:03:22.960> we're<00:03:23.110> moving<00:03:23.200> it<00:03:23.820> one

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
will fall off as we're moving it one

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.010 
will fall off as we're moving it one
last<00:03:25.060> time<00:03:25.330> in<00:03:25.420> the<00:03:25.480> hot<00:03:25.600> water<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:27.930> here<00:03:28.930> we

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
last time in the hot water and here we

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.160 
last time in the hot water and here we
go<00:03:29.140> okay<00:03:30.300> so<00:03:31.300> now<00:03:31.510> we've<00:03:31.660> got<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:31.840> fish<00:03:31.990> this

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
go okay so now we've got to fish this

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.610 
go okay so now we've got to fish this
out<00:03:32.380> we're<00:03:32.530> gonna<00:03:32.590> turn<00:03:32.860> off<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:33.010> heat<00:03:34.620> you

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
out we're gonna turn off the heat you

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.070 
out we're gonna turn off the heat you
grab<00:03:35.800> some<00:03:36.010> tongs<00:03:36.190> pull<00:03:36.790> out<00:03:36.910> your<00:03:37.060> your<00:03:37.810> slide

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
grab some tongs pull out your your slide

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.840 
grab some tongs pull out your your slide
the<00:03:38.650> next<00:03:38.860> thing<00:03:38.980> to<00:03:39.070> do<00:03:39.190> is<00:03:39.220> to<00:03:39.520> cool<00:03:39.700> it<00:03:39.820> down

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
the next thing to do is to cool it down

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:56.930 
the next thing to do is to cool it down
and<00:03:40.270> start<00:03:40.570> sanding<00:03:40.750> it

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.840 

okay<00:03:57.870> so<00:03:57.930> here's<00:03:58.350> where<00:03:58.560> we<00:03:58.770> have<00:03:58.800> ended<00:03:59.190> up<00:03:59.310> we

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
okay so here's where we have ended up we

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.540 
okay so here's where we have ended up we
had<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.390> pretty<00:04:00.840> good<00:04:01.080> line

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
had a pretty good line

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.250 
had a pretty good line
it's<00:04:02.790> nothing<00:04:03.060> not<00:04:03.150> perfect<00:04:03.510> there's<00:04:04.110> always

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
it's nothing not perfect there's always

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.390 
it's nothing not perfect there's always
going<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.530> be<00:04:04.620> some<00:04:04.800> stuff<00:04:04.890> that<00:04:05.160> you<00:04:05.220> have<00:04:05.310> to

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
going to be some stuff that you have to

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.390 
going to be some stuff that you have to
chip<00:04:05.580> away<00:04:05.610> or<00:04:06.000> sand<00:04:06.270> away<00:04:06.860> but<00:04:07.860> the<00:04:08.040> ratio

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
chip away or sand away but the ratio

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.850 
chip away or sand away but the ratio
success<00:04:08.700> is<00:04:08.850> about<00:04:09.090> 50%<00:04:09.780> half<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.620> slides

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
success is about 50% half the slides

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.050 
success is about 50% half the slides
that<00:04:10.980> you<00:04:11.070> do<00:04:11.280> will<00:04:11.490> probably<00:04:11.640> have<00:04:11.880> some

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
that you do will probably have some

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.530 
that you do will probably have some
stress<00:04:12.330> lines<00:04:12.600> probably<00:04:13.320> if<00:04:13.860> you<00:04:14.040> can<00:04:14.540> keep

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
stress lines probably if you can keep

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.840 
stress lines probably if you can keep
the<00:04:15.690> heat<00:04:15.870> source<00:04:16.110> directly<00:04:16.800> on<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.280> score

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
the heat source directly on the score

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.090 
the heat source directly on the score
you'll<00:04:18.300> have<00:04:18.450> some<00:04:18.660> better<00:04:19.020> results<00:04:19.650> but<00:04:19.920> this

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
you'll have some better results but this
