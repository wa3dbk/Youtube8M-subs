00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.829
 personalized here with my name here 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.780

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.170
 news reporter 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.870

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.300
 Army clothing is a noted

 brabatt soldier going on mission 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.840

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.660
 and it is the reporter wellington moreira 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.700
 now it 's the soldier the edict we're going to 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.650
 This mission of peace here we are going to do. 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.750
 simulated but you're living now 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.060
 characterized so let's not go then 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.680
 I'll drop the microphone because from the 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.690
 from now i am soldier of the army 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.430
 Brazilian with great pride 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.650
 let's go to the track where 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.360
 would be the graduation of the military 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.300
 who participated in the peace mission 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.090
 moment of concentration order and 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.580
 discipline and an outstanding moment was the 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.190
 the national anthem singing in haiti 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.460
 Creole dialect 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.460
 parents 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.310
 then the military together marched on 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.490
 to the presence of the main 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.470
 between the military authorities and 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.610
 northern military commander general 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.610
 general manager 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.830
 we have our work the preparation 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.470
 which is done throughout the year bringing the 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.620
 preparation of our troops for 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.660
 fulfilling a mission like this has to 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.950
 there is a preparation that we call 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.350
 specific 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.510
 the battalion at this moment is 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.030
 finalizing its preparation a 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.340
 consecrated preparation that every year will 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.190
 being perfected and we do not have the 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.870
 less doubt that the battalion is in 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.430
 conditions to comply with this 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.170
 Brilliant mission that Brazil has done 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.190
 throughout these various quotas 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.590
 brabatt 20 is that it is the basis of it 's 23rd 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.780
 brigade you saw there by the composition 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.700
 we have our four battalions of 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.040
 infantry cavalry squadron of 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.940
 tucuruí all involved there with much 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.790
 folks 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.920
 he had a preparation like all 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.709
 Brazilian contingent who will have it 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.660
 Are we in the 20th contingent, right? 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.940
 and completing the ten-year mission in 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.980
 haiti then we already have a new raul 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.260
 very large preparation of these battalions 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.720
 our activity here in the city of marabá 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.700
 started on April 7 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.459
 all the contingent about 900 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.650
 military focused not passed 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.540
 for the basic stage as I said and 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.489
 The next week we'll be in a 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.160
 culminating stage will be the advanced stage 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.500
 of peace operations where we will have a 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.790
 center of peace operations of the 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.950
 Brazil that is an army unit 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.840
 Brazilian who will come with his military 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.299
 directly from rio de janeiro to do 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.640
 in our assessment and see how we 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.160
 we are carrying on as we leave is 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.650
 in the missions is for which they could be 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.030
 night employees for the peace mission 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.340
 of the United Nations 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.920
 the female presence with 11 women and 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.049
 made with them captain Cacilda 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.670
 loyal very happy to be for the first time 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.170
 time with the troop 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.989
 I think it's a great opportunity and 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.609
 women always care is and 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.260
 rights and I think that this 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:59.420
 opportunity to be able to represent the 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.220
 his country such a noble mission and as 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.569
 important I think it's a 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.550
 unique opportunity 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.920
 one of the most important phases of 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.530
 training is when the military pass 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.290
 in the evaluation of the cadeq which is the 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.120
 Army evaluation of the training 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.650
 armament it only works when it is 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.530
 near college 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.530
 now the collective works without the moment 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.450
 so you can check if this 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.210
 when firing with this 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.280
 whether he hit an opponent or not 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.410
 here it is possible to know the degree of 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.770
 engagement of soldiers of the armed 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:37.060
 and I of course also feel up close as 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.060
 the training works 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:46.360
 I was in the position of a soldier in the 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:51.789
 sniper condition and follow all 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:53.860
 rules and now the troops are 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:57.580
 making a fine adjustment so let's say 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:00.129
 training and within this premise are the 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.300
 technical progression of strips 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:03.129
 are fundamental 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.599
 At this point in the training I 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:07.120
 he was in touch with the rest 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:09.099
 companions of the army but not 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.819
 he imagined the degree of difficulty 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:11.819
 was about to come 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.949
 the next step would be to participate in a 

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:23.229
 input simulation in an enclosed location 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:25.479
 with opponents also armed a 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:28.029
 true maze looking overhead 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:30.819
 because it is at this stage of our reporting 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:32.710
 we will now show the track 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:34.389
 combat and locality 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.909
 we'll show you how it works 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:39.430
 this training in what is called 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:41.830
 pcs the local combat track has a 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.569
 name here track bomb guy who in 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.599
 language of Haitians means good 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:48.759
 We're here O h pump including 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:52.000
 the opening date of April 23, 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:54.099
 2014 we'll show you how 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.659
 does this training work on the 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:58.629
 combat in locality 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:06:00.339
 Come on, I accepted the challenge. I put the 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:02.349
 armament and move on 

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:04.389
 we advanced in the closed place with the 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:07.210
 intent to locate the enemy 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:10.289
 then just point and shoot the 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.289
 sequential shots 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:18.249
 then me and captain Eduardo Navagio 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:20.800
 we invert the roles 

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:22.539
 I was interviewed by him from the 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.219
 when you place yourself in the position of the 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:26.469
 other you know the importance of what 

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:28.749
 represents in fact a mission of peace 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:32.020
 that of the Brazilian army in Haiti 

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:34.689
 and all the reception that was made here of 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:37.300
 our reporting team shows 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:40.060
 organization that the army has to 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.949
 and it is therefore important to reverse the 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.139
 roles at this point is to show 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:46.089
 the community, we really feel like 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:47.740
 does this training end? 

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:49.839
 on May 2 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.419
 then the military left their 

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:53.860
 families and continued for six months 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:54.880
 challenges in haiti 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.490
 my whole family has 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.590
 looked finished this support and it is for them 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.000
 I'm also going because you know the 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:04.090
 my importance to the army 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.750
 Brazilian is not to represent our 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:10.870
 country is in a foreign region after 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:12.510
 of a day as a brabatt soldier close up 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.950
 the mission that these men and women 

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:17.380
 passed in central america 

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:20.530
 unforgettable moments where you feel in 

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:24.340
 skin what it is to serve the motherland if 

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:26.080
 as military of the Brazilian army to 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.510
 We talk to you guys who do the 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.760
 his work in military training 

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:34.750
 intensive for that peace mission but 

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:37.440
 I say I'm on that day for slaughter. 

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:40.890
 I'm really seeing a lot of difficulty. 

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:44.050
 training this strong 3rd year shirt 

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:46.210
 showing a little skin in the latter 

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:49.120
 that they are actually passing and it was 

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:52.510
 Upwards but what makes the team is late 

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.430
 after this preparation here not 100% 

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:55.690
 them for this mission 

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.900
 A certainty, I'm feeling that in the 

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.900
 question
