 maggots people earth so I do that 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.440
 in the mess the human casualties 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.760
 disturbed so we start from the point of 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.960
 pass to prosperity we go online 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.070
 right in this cave that will 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.350
 open only if you realized 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.610
 the event that I spoke to you in the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.690
 previous video unless like 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.129
 I usually mixed 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.840
 pencils in my time of publication 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.120
 you are used to and you tell me in 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.629
 comment so we get into the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.370
 cave 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.309
 we come with friends because at full 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.520
 of veterans at the cut his 23 jan 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.300
 react to come but we do too bad 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.559
 then you will see there is a passage 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.869
 who is a little triki finally me I want 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.780
 not that every time in May but 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.479
 I believe it I believe it there if I put a 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.080
 stable his mom that prevents me from doing myself 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.020
 this lot not a no no no no no 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.009
 everything so I take the form of ghost 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.659
 and the TP does it and then I like to be 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.040
 at 100 the nebulous appearance you go when 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.939
 even take you the damage mass because 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.070
 that I do not but it's not for me 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.689
 move fast 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.299
 yes but usually includes the 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.829
 sun crystal was there I 'm going 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.880
 also start with the crystal of 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.009
 sun but in ben here we have not been 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.680
 pretty fast and it closed up because 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.090
 that they did not realize the 28 years no 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.409
 it's just that it was finished I'm not it 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:54.420
 happened before the last shower 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:57.450
 damn long enough to spend that they 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.530
 have not made the game takes the spaces 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.560
 in the cave 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.570
 go ahead ferries enough for me the tp so 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.020
 a narrative then understands had as his 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.520
 aunt daisy 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:13.810
 too late too late I would not have the 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:15.340
 time to do it so I think we're getting 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.140
 drop into the moving sand one 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.379
 is all standing yellow in the background 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.379
 cranks 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:32.069
 go it's good there is not one 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:32.069
 a lot of sweets I had also go 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.739
 the erasmo yellows in charge I think 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.040
 that it's mismanaged my mother so I'm 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:44.709
 went too far in the sand it was 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.269
 there legendary actually I had not 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.190
 took the good 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:53.470
 is this people could be I think 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.880
 will appear this radius of 100 so that's it 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.500
 so if you want to be quiet you 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.090
 come with 10 friend since with 10 pts 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.709
 is done widely and you finish 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.209
 the event that starts when the cave 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.170
 is unblocked and there the cave and remains 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.739
 open for at least half an hour 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:11.680

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:25.420

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:27.700
 these two millennia past buys at 700 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.880

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.739

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.720
