but<00:01:37.680> basically<00:01:38.680> uh<00:01:39.610> I<00:01:40.270> got<00:01:40.750> started<00:01:41.229> on<00:01:41.380> cod4

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
but basically uh I got started on cod4

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.020 
but basically uh I got started on cod4
modern<00:01:42.400> warfare<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.990> right<00:01:44.860> after<00:01:45.009> that<00:01:45.159> was

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
modern warfare and right after that was

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.760 
modern warfare and right after that was
world<00:01:46.360> at<00:01:46.509> war<00:01:46.659> and<00:01:46.840> I<00:01:46.869> just<00:01:47.110> really<00:01:47.380> never<00:01:47.530> got

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
world at war and I just really never got

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.399 
world at war and I just really never got
into<00:01:47.979> it<00:01:48.189> for<00:01:48.310> some<00:01:48.490> reason<00:01:49.079> mostly<00:01:50.079> because<00:01:50.110> I

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
into it for some reason mostly because I

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.730 
into it for some reason mostly because I
don't<00:01:50.649> like<00:01:50.829> the<00:01:51.159> older<00:01:51.759> style<00:01:51.970> games<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
don't like the older style games the

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.249 
don't like the older style games the
older<00:01:54.009> guns<00:01:54.310> and<00:01:54.549> stuff<00:01:54.610> like<00:01:54.820> that<00:01:54.880> so<00:01:55.240> then<00:01:56.170> I

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
older guns and stuff like that so then I

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.350 
older guns and stuff like that so then I
got<00:01:56.439> modern<00:01:56.619> fair<00:01:56.890> to<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:57.369> loved<00:01:57.579> it<00:01:57.790> and<00:01:58.000> just

I've<00:03:23.019> been<00:03:23.109> practicing<00:03:23.500> a<00:03:23.620> little<00:03:23.739> with<00:03:23.950> the

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
I've been practicing a little with the

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.039 
I've been practicing a little with the
submachine<00:03:24.370> guns<00:03:24.700> but<00:03:25.450> if<00:03:25.569> you<00:03:25.690> want<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:25.930> just

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
submachine guns but if you want to just

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.930 
submachine guns but if you want to just
practice<00:03:26.230> overall<00:03:26.890> to<00:03:27.220> get<00:03:27.340> ready<00:03:27.519> for<00:03:27.819> it

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
practice overall to get ready for it

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.819 
practice overall to get ready for it
then<00:03:28.510> what<00:03:28.690> I'd<00:03:28.780> recommend<00:03:28.959> is<00:03:29.440> using

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
then what I'd recommend is using

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.090 
then what I'd recommend is using
whatever<00:03:30.220> gun<00:03:30.579> type<00:03:31.480> you<00:03:32.019> usually<00:03:32.049> use<00:03:32.799> of

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
whatever gun type you usually use of

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.569 
whatever gun type you usually use of
salt<00:03:33.430> rifle<00:03:33.760> use<00:03:33.940> that<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:35.290> then<00:03:35.590> use<00:03:36.100> perks

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
salt rifle use that and then use perks

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.390 
salt rifle use that and then use perks
that<00:03:36.970> are<00:03:37.090> gonna<00:03:37.620> kind<00:03:38.620> of<00:03:38.769> mirror<00:03:39.130> things

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
that are gonna kind of mirror things

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.979 
that are gonna kind of mirror things
that<00:03:39.579> will<00:03:39.700> be<00:03:39.790> in<00:03:39.880> the<00:03:39.970> next<00:03:40.000> game<00:03:40.389> like<00:03:40.870> it

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
that will be in the next game like it

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.629 
that will be in the next game like it
makes<00:03:41.109> no<00:03:41.290> sense<00:03:41.319> to<00:03:41.680> jump<00:03:41.950> back<00:03:42.130> into<00:03:42.310> modern

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
makes no sense to jump back into modern

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.030 
makes no sense to jump back into modern

warfare 2 and use Danger Close in

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.199 
commando and run around knifing people
all<00:03:47.590> day<00:03:47.769> that's<00:03:48.579> not<00:03:48.730> going<00:03:48.819> to<00:03:48.910> be<00:03:48.970> in<00:03:49.120> the

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
all day that's not going to be in the

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.140 
all day that's not going to be in the
game<00:03:49.420> so<00:03:49.840> that<00:03:50.319> doesn't<00:03:50.560> help<00:03:50.910> things<00:03:51.910> that

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
game so that doesn't help things that

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.590 
game so that doesn't help things that
will<00:03:52.299> be<00:03:52.329> you<00:03:52.720> know<00:03:52.840> scavenger<00:03:53.560> hardline

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
will be you know scavenger hardline

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.289 
will be you know scavenger hardline
things<00:03:55.600> like<00:03:55.780> that<00:03:56.019> and<00:03:57.180> what<00:03:58.180> I<00:03:58.209> would

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
things like that and what I would

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.470 
things like that and what I would
recommend<00:03:58.510> is<00:03:59.100> also<00:04:00.359> adjust<00:04:01.359> your

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
recommend is also adjust your

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.930 
recommend is also adjust your
killstreaks<00:04:01.930> now<00:04:02.079> obviously<00:04:02.530> we<00:04:03.190> can't<00:04:03.459> go<00:04:03.760> in

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
killstreaks now obviously we can't go in

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.819 
killstreaks now obviously we can't go in
and<00:04:04.299> have<00:04:04.480> a<00:04:04.540> you<00:04:04.810> know<00:04:04.900> our<00:04:05.019> point<00:04:05.230> streaks<00:04:05.560> of

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
and have a you know our point streaks of

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.039 
and have a you know our point streaks of
not<00:04:06.549> stack<00:04:06.880> or<00:04:07.120> stacking<00:04:07.389> and<00:04:07.690> things<00:04:07.930> like

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
not stack or stacking and things like

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.559 
not stack or stacking and things like
that<00:04:08.109> like<00:04:08.290> they<00:04:08.560> will<00:04:08.739> in<00:04:08.889> modern<00:04:09.459> 43<00:04:09.850> but<00:04:10.420> if

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
that like they will in modern 43 but if

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:11.879 
that like they will in modern 43 but if
you<00:04:10.690> know<00:04:10.900> you're<00:04:11.079> going<00:04:11.109> to<00:04:11.230> use<00:04:11.410> the<00:04:11.560> assault

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
you know you're going to use the assault

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:15.420 
you know you're going to use the assault
streaks<00:04:12.340> pretty<00:04:12.970> much<00:04:13.150> that's<00:04:13.959> it<00:04:14.170> then<00:04:14.829> just

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
streaks pretty much that's it then just

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.070 
streaks pretty much that's it then just
use<00:04:15.670> a<00:04:15.700> salt<00:04:16.030> type<00:04:16.299> streaks<00:04:16.690> and<00:04:16.900> I<00:04:16.959> would

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
use a salt type streaks and I would

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.870 
use a salt type streaks and I would
recommend<00:04:17.200> doing<00:04:17.530> something<00:04:18.130> it's<00:04:18.700> not

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
recommend doing something it's not

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.810 
recommend doing something it's not
really<00:04:19.150> a<00:04:19.180> good<00:04:19.419> game<00:04:19.630> to<00:04:19.840> say<00:04:20.019> that<00:04:20.229> because<00:04:20.380> I

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
really a good game to say that because I

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.010 
really a good game to say that because I
just<00:04:21.000> kind<00:04:21.150> of<00:04:21.180> killed<00:04:21.390> hoard<00:04:21.600> in<00:04:21.720> this<00:04:21.870> one

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
just kind of killed hoard in this one

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.360 
just kind of killed hoard in this one
but<00:04:22.250> but<00:04:23.250> uh<00:04:23.750> use<00:04:24.750> stuff<00:04:25.080> like<00:04:25.370> prednisolone

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
but but uh use stuff like prednisolone

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.720 
but but uh use stuff like prednisolone
air<00:04:27.360> strike<00:04:27.720> stealth<00:04:28.710> bomber<00:04:28.950> all<00:04:29.400> of<00:04:29.610> those

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
air strike stealth bomber all of those

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.760 
air strike stealth bomber all of those
are<00:04:29.790> going<00:04:29.970> to<00:04:30.030> be<00:04:30.120> in<00:04:30.330> there<00:04:30.620> that's<00:04:31.620> pretty

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
are going to be in there that's pretty

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.290 
are going to be in there that's pretty
straightforward<00:04:32.100> stuff<00:04:32.670> it'll<00:04:32.940> give<00:04:33.150> you<00:04:33.240> a

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
straightforward stuff it'll give you a

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.850 
straightforward stuff it'll give you a
good<00:04:33.570> feel<00:04:33.870> for<00:04:34.080> how<00:04:34.170> the<00:04:34.200> game<00:04:34.500> is<00:04:34.650> going<00:04:34.710> to

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
good feel for how the game is going to

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.220 
good feel for how the game is going to
go<00:04:35.090> but<00:04:36.090> yeah<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.420> little<00:04:36.570> things<00:04:36.900> are<00:04:37.080> what

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
go but yeah the little things are what

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.810 
go but yeah the little things are what
really<00:04:37.260> is<00:04:37.770> going<00:04:37.860> to<00:04:38.040> help<00:04:38.250> if<00:04:38.400> you<00:04:38.520> if<00:04:38.700> you

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
really is going to help if you if you

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.350 
really is going to help if you if you
practice<00:04:39.240> here<00:04:39.450> um<00:04:40.040> the<00:04:41.040> player<00:04:41.370> movement<00:04:41.700> now

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
practice here um the player movement now

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.910 
practice here um the player movement now
I<00:04:42.390> haven't<00:04:43.050> actually<00:04:43.200> got<00:04:43.410> to<00:04:43.500> play<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:43.770> game

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
I haven't actually got to play the game

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.050 
I haven't actually got to play the game
but<00:04:44.040> I'm<00:04:44.160> imagining<00:04:44.460> it's<00:04:44.790> going<00:04:44.910> to<00:04:44.970> be

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
but I'm imagining it's going to be

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.670 
but I'm imagining it's going to be
pretty<00:04:45.360> close<00:04:45.630> to<00:04:45.810> modern<00:04:45.930> warfare<00:04:46.170> 2<00:04:46.440> the

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
pretty close to modern warfare 2 the

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.250 
pretty close to modern warfare 2 the
looks<00:04:46.890> are<00:04:47.040> going<00:04:47.160> to<00:04:47.220> be<00:04:47.310> about<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:47.640> same<00:04:47.850> um

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
looks are going to be about the same um

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.540 
looks are going to be about the same um
one<00:04:49.260> thing<00:04:49.290> that<00:04:49.590> I<00:04:49.620> noticed<00:04:50.010> right<00:04:50.250> off<00:04:50.310> the

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
one thing that I noticed right off the

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.180 
one thing that I noticed right off the
bat<00:04:50.700> is<00:04:50.910> the<00:04:51.090> sprint<00:04:51.450> distance<00:04:51.900> it<00:04:52.560> is<00:04:52.770> quite<00:04:53.160> a

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
bat is the sprint distance it is quite a

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.920 
bat is the sprint distance it is quite a
bit<00:04:53.430> shorter<00:04:53.790> on<00:04:53.940> modern<00:04:54.210> warfare<00:04:54.330> 2<00:04:54.600> than<00:04:54.840> it

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
bit shorter on modern warfare 2 than it

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.500 
bit shorter on modern warfare 2 than it
is<00:04:55.020> on<00:04:55.140> black<00:04:55.410> ops<00:04:55.940> so<00:04:56.940> that's<00:04:57.150> something<00:04:57.390> to

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
is on black ops so that's something to

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.600 
is on black ops so that's something to
play<00:04:57.690> with<00:04:57.720> gun<00:04:58.650> recoil<00:04:59.070> is<00:04:59.250> going<00:04:59.400> to<00:04:59.460> be<00:04:59.580> a

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
play with gun recoil is going to be a

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.250 
play with gun recoil is going to be a
lot<00:04:59.880> different<00:04:59.910> than<00:05:00.360> you<00:05:00.480> see<00:05:00.690> in<00:05:00.720> black<00:05:00.990> ops

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
lot different than you see in black ops

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.740 
lot different than you see in black ops
I<00:05:02.100> think<00:05:02.520> modern<00:05:02.730> warfare<00:05:02.910> 3<00:05:03.060> s<00:05:03.360> will<00:05:03.450> be<00:05:03.570> kind

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
I think modern warfare 3 s will be kind

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.210 
I think modern warfare 3 s will be kind
of<00:05:03.810> a<00:05:03.900> mix<00:05:04.140> between<00:05:04.290> black<00:05:04.650> ops<00:05:04.890> and<00:05:05.040> modern

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
of a mix between black ops and modern

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.510 
of a mix between black ops and modern
warfare<00:05:05.340> 2<00:05:05.960> but<00:05:06.960> another<00:05:07.170> thing<00:05:07.410> the<00:05:07.950> gun<00:05:08.190> swap

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
warfare 2 but another thing the gun swap

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.230 
warfare 2 but another thing the gun swap
of<00:05:08.760> the<00:05:09.590> the<00:05:10.590> speed<00:05:10.860> on<00:05:11.040> the<00:05:11.130> swaps<00:05:11.400> the<00:05:11.940> speed

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
of the the speed on the swaps the speed

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.150 
of the the speed on the swaps the speed
on<00:05:12.420> throwing<00:05:12.690> your<00:05:12.840> needs<00:05:13.080> calling<00:05:13.710> in<00:05:13.860> kill

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
on throwing your needs calling in kill

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.370 
on throwing your needs calling in kill
streaks<00:05:14.520> I<00:05:14.730> think<00:05:15.360> that's<00:05:15.600> going<00:05:15.810> to<00:05:15.870> be<00:05:16.050> close

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
streaks I think that's going to be close

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.620 
streaks I think that's going to be close
to<00:05:16.410> the<00:05:17.310> way<00:05:17.430> it<00:05:17.580> will<00:05:17.670> be<00:05:17.790> in<00:05:17.910> modern<00:05:18.240> for<00:05:18.390> a<00:05:18.420> 3

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
to the way it will be in modern for a 3

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.420 
to the way it will be in modern for a 3
and<00:05:18.750> those<00:05:18.840> are<00:05:18.990> little<00:05:19.170> things<00:05:19.350> they<00:05:20.130> may<00:05:20.310> not

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
and those are little things they may not

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.920 
and those are little things they may not
you<00:05:20.850> might<00:05:21.030> think<00:05:21.060> well<00:05:21.390> that's<00:05:21.510> you<00:05:21.840> know
