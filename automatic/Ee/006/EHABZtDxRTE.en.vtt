the head sound flattens totally out then

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.370 
the head sound flattens totally out then
select<00:01:36.970> one<00:01:37.119> of<00:01:37.149> the<00:01:37.330> tension<00:01:37.720> rods<00:01:37.899> at<00:01:38.170> the

select one of the tension rods at the
top<00:01:38.590> of<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:38.830> drum<00:01:39.039> and<00:01:39.310> tune<00:01:39.850> it<00:01:40.000> while<00:01:40.270> you're

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
top of the drum and tune it while you're

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.469 
top of the drum and tune it while you're
tapping<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:42.490> should<00:01:42.670> hear<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:43.000> drum<00:01:43.179> begin

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
tapping you should hear the drum begin

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.139 
tapping you should hear the drum begin
to<00:01:43.569> resonate<00:01:44.080> fully<00:01:44.440> and<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:45.460> field<00:01:45.759> becomes

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
to resonate fully and the field becomes

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.270 
to resonate fully and the field becomes
more<00:01:46.330> bouncy<00:01:46.780> if<00:01:47.500> this<00:01:47.770> tickles<00:01:47.979> your<00:01:48.220> fancy

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
more bouncy if this tickles your fancy

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.389 
more bouncy if this tickles your fancy
then<00:01:48.909> loosen<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.360> same<00:01:49.570> key<00:01:49.840> rod<00:01:50.079> and

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
slightly tune each tension rod up until

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.050 
slightly tune each tension rod up until
you<00:01:53.439> feel<00:01:53.770> and<00:01:54.040> hear<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.369> same<00:01:54.549> results<00:01:54.939> you

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
directly in front of the drum and detune

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.569 
directly in front of the drum and detune
each<00:02:16.690> tension<00:02:17.170> rod<00:02:17.320> until<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.860> head<00:02:18.070> rattles

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
each tension rod until the head rattles

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.580 
each tension rod until the head rattles
then<00:02:19.239> tension<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.810> back<00:02:19.959> up<00:02:20.140> until<00:02:20.320> it

like keep messin with the keys that's

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.370 
like keep messin with the keys that's
what<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.060> individual<00:02:28.510> rides<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:29.050> listen<00:02:29.260> to

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
what the individual rides and listen to

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.830 
what the individual rides and listen to
the<00:02:29.500> effect<00:02:29.860> they<00:02:29.980> make<00:02:30.390> there's<00:02:31.390> always<00:02:31.690> a

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
the effect they make there's always a

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.380 
the effect they make there's always a
magical<00:02:32.590> tension<00:02:33.220> ride<00:02:33.400> that<00:02:33.670> does<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.090> trick

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
magical tension ride that does the trick

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.720 
magical tension ride that does the trick
and<00:02:34.600> I<00:02:35.350> wish<00:02:35.470> I<00:02:35.560> had<00:02:35.680> a<00:02:35.710> formula<00:02:36.190> for<00:02:36.340> this<00:02:36.490> but

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
and I wish I had a formula for this but

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:53.570 
and I wish I had a formula for this but
it's<00:02:36.880> really<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.180> matter<00:02:37.450> of<00:02:37.570> trial<00:02:38.020> and<00:02:38.170> error

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.890 

if<00:02:54.580> you<00:02:54.700> don't<00:02:54.880> like<00:02:55.000> internal<00:02:55.360> muffling<00:02:55.660> pads

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
if you don't like internal muffling pads

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.450 
if you don't like internal muffling pads
against<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.230> head<00:02:56.440> then<00:02:56.740> at<00:02:56.860> minimum<00:02:57.190> place

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
against the head then at minimum place

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.580 
against the head then at minimum place
an<00:02:57.610> absorbent<00:02:58.120> material<00:02:58.540> in<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.840> drum<00:02:59.080> even

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
an absorbent material in the drum even

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.840 
an absorbent material in the drum even
if<00:02:59.680> it<00:02:59.770> doesn't<00:02:59.950> touch<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.340> head<00:03:00.459> to<00:03:00.580> produce

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
if it doesn't touch the head to produce

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.120 
if it doesn't touch the head to produce
a<00:03:01.000> rounder<00:03:01.390> denser<00:03:01.810> sound<00:03:02.110> this<00:03:02.680> also<00:03:02.920> affects

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
a rounder denser sound this also affects

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:12.449 
a rounder denser sound this also affects
the<00:03:03.430> way<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.610> drum<00:03:03.790> feels<00:03:11.340> muffling<00:03:12.340> the

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
the way the drum feels muffling the

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.100 
the way the drum feels muffling the
front<00:03:12.700> head<00:03:12.820> will<00:03:12.970> lower<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.390> overall<00:03:13.540> pitch

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
front head will lower the overall pitch

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:38.130 
front head will lower the overall pitch
of<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.320> bass<00:03:14.530> drum<00:03:14.800> check<00:03:15.340> it<00:03:15.430> out<00:03:36.840> with<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:37.870> pre

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
of the bass drum check it out with a pre

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.020 
of the bass drum check it out with a pre
muffled<00:03:38.500> batter<00:03:38.769> head<00:03:39.010> like<00:03:39.190> this<00:03:39.370> one<00:03:39.550> a<00:03:39.760> cool

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
muffled batter head like this one a cool

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.850 
muffled batter head like this one a cool
technique<00:03:40.420> I<00:03:40.540> often<00:03:40.870> use<00:03:41.050> is<00:03:41.320> to<00:03:41.440> place<00:03:41.680> the

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
technique I often use is to place the

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.370 
technique I often use is to place the
pad<00:03:42.070> only<00:03:42.880> on<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.360> front<00:03:43.510> head<00:03:43.810> while<00:03:44.110> leaving

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
pad only on the front head while leaving

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.890 
pad only on the front head while leaving
the<00:03:44.590> batter<00:03:44.769> head<00:03:44.950> wide<00:03:45.310> open<00:03:45.580> this<00:03:46.390> produces

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
the batter head wide open this produces

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.720 
the batter head wide open this produces
a<00:03:46.959> natural<00:03:47.230> airy<00:03:47.800> tone<00:03:48.070> with<00:03:48.310> a<00:03:48.340> sharp<00:03:48.610> attack

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
a natural airy tone with a sharp attack

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.900 
a natural airy tone with a sharp attack
characteristic<00:03:49.630> a<00:03:50.280> booming<00:03:51.280> bass<00:03:51.370> drum<00:03:51.640> sound

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
characteristic a booming bass drum sound

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.270 
characteristic a booming bass drum sound
by<00:03:52.120> itself<00:03:52.420> is<00:03:52.660> great<00:03:52.959> but<00:03:53.709> unfortunately

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
by itself is great but unfortunately

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.850 
by itself is great but unfortunately
it's<00:03:54.550> not<00:03:54.760> very<00:03:55.000> useful<00:03:55.320> this<00:03:56.320> combination

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
it's not very useful this combination

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.830 
it's not very useful this combination
will<00:03:56.980> provide<00:03:57.220> a<00:03:57.250> big<00:03:57.610> sound<00:03:57.910> with<00:03:58.630> enough

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
will provide a big sound with enough

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.260 
will provide a big sound with enough
control
