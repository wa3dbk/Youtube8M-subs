get<00:00:49.020> into<00:00:49.140> vlogging<00:00:49.289> but<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.829> can't<00:00:50.280> seem<00:00:50.460> to

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
get into vlogging but I can't seem to

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.160 
get into vlogging but I can't seem to
think<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.820> anything<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.239> talk<00:00:51.360> about<00:00:51.420> now<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
think of anything to talk about now the

answer to that question I thought was

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.029 
answer to that question I thought was
pretty<00:00:54.239> simple<00:00:54.629> because<00:00:55.320> they're<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.800> things

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:51.509 
like the way that you've delivered it
Jesus<00:03:39.950> what<00:03:40.099> the<00:03:40.129> fuck<00:03:40.670> was<00:03:40.939> that

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.770 

also<00:03:52.519> there's<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:52.819> fluidity<00:03:53.180> of<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:53.569> vlog

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
also there's the fluidity of the vlog

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.229 
also there's the fluidity of the vlog
you<00:03:53.959> don't<00:03:54.170> want<00:03:54.379> it<00:03:54.439> to<00:03:54.530> be<00:03:54.650> too<00:03:54.859> soft<00:03:55.159> and<00:03:55.879> a

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
you don't want it to be too soft and a

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:02.949 
you don't want it to be too soft and a
blob<00:03:56.480> of<00:03:56.659> art<00:04:01.150> it's<00:04:02.150> bare<00:04:02.419> if<00:04:02.569> it's<00:04:02.719> you<00:04:02.870> know

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
blob of art it's bare if it's you know

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.610 
blob of art it's bare if it's you know
in<00:04:03.139> noise<00:04:03.319> segments<00:04:05.200> well<00:04:06.200> that<00:04:06.319> comes<00:04:06.530> to

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
in noise segments well that comes to

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.319 
in noise segments well that comes to
practice<00:04:07.040> and<00:04:07.250> it<00:04:07.340> also<00:04:07.579> makes<00:04:07.879> your<00:04:08.000> editing

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
practice and it also makes your editing

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:09.699 
practice and it also makes your editing
life<00:04:08.510> a<00:04:08.629> lot<00:04:08.719> easier<00:04:09.079> if<00:04:09.139> you<00:04:09.260> do<00:04:09.379> things<00:04:09.620> that

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
life a lot easier if you do things that

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.689 
life a lot easier if you do things that
way<00:04:11.829> and<00:04:12.829> because<00:04:13.069> people<00:04:13.099> are<00:04:13.400> going<00:04:13.489> to<00:04:13.549> ask

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:13.699 
way and because people are going to ask

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:15.520 
way and because people are going to ask
me<00:04:13.879> what<00:04:14.090> am<00:04:14.150> I<00:04:14.209> doing<00:04:14.239> here<00:04:14.599> basically<00:04:15.469> I've

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
me what am I doing here basically I've

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.319 
me what am I doing here basically I've
just<00:04:15.560> got<00:04:15.829> some<00:04:16.489> more<00:04:16.639> RAM<00:04:16.880> for<00:04:17.090> my<00:04:17.180> laptop

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
just got some more RAM for my laptop

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.240 
just got some more RAM for my laptop
because<00:04:17.840> I've<00:04:18.259> recently<00:04:18.560> discovered<00:04:18.859> that

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
because I've recently discovered that

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.060 
because I've recently discovered that
Windows<00:04:19.669> 7<00:04:20.030> requires<00:04:20.720> two<00:04:21.079> gigabyte<00:04:21.769> of<00:04:21.889> RAM

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
Windows 7 requires two gigabyte of RAM

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.850 
Windows 7 requires two gigabyte of RAM
minimum<00:04:22.550> to<00:04:22.699> run<00:04:22.930> my<00:04:23.930> laptop<00:04:24.289> I<00:04:24.320> bought<00:04:24.530> only

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
minimum to run my laptop I bought only

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.219 
minimum to run my laptop I bought only
has<00:04:25.070> two<00:04:25.370> gigabytes<00:04:25.550> of<00:04:26.000> RAM<00:04:26.210> so<00:04:26.449> surely<00:04:26.930> that

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
has two gigabytes of RAM so surely that

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:29.080 
has two gigabytes of RAM so surely that
laptop<00:04:27.650> is<00:04:27.800> fucking<00:04:28.190> flawed<00:04:28.550> because<00:04:28.849> the

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
laptop is fucking flawed because the

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.150 
laptop is fucking flawed because the
second<00:04:29.389> you<00:04:29.479> put<00:04:29.720> anything<00:04:29.930> on<00:04:30.139> it<00:04:30.349> you<00:04:31.039> know

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
second you put anything on it you know

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.879 
second you put anything on it you know
and<00:04:31.430> ask<00:04:31.550> to<00:04:31.820> do<00:04:31.970> anything<00:04:32.210> it's<00:04:32.479> just<00:04:32.539> like

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:37.540 

back<00:04:36.889> to<00:04:37.009> the<00:04:37.099> subject

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
back to the subject

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.480 
back to the subject
it<00:04:37.669> basically<00:04:37.870> vlogs<00:04:38.979> sometimes<00:04:39.979> take<00:04:40.250> a<00:04:40.310> life

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
it basically vlogs sometimes take a life

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.159 
it basically vlogs sometimes take a life
of<00:04:40.669> their<00:04:40.789> own<00:04:40.849> like<00:04:41.330> this<00:04:41.479> one<00:04:41.659> has<00:04:41.840> a<00:04:41.870> little
