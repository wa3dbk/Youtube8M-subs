yeah I mean the car looks very cool

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.649 
yeah I mean the car looks very cool
first<00:01:47.680> of<00:01:47.799> all<00:01:47.890> but<00:01:48.610> you<00:01:49.060> know<00:01:49.180> it's<00:01:49.299> very<00:01:49.360> good

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
first of all but you know it's very good

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.510 
first of all but you know it's very good
to<00:01:49.720> drive<00:01:50.020> as<00:01:50.200> well<00:01:50.229> the<00:01:50.530> handling<00:01:50.860> is<00:01:50.979> fine<00:01:51.189> so

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
to drive as well the handling is fine so

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.630 
to drive as well the handling is fine so
it's<00:01:51.640> just<00:01:51.820> right<00:01:52.119> it's<00:01:52.420> not<00:01:52.570> out<00:01:52.840> of<00:01:52.869> balance

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
it's just right it's not out of balance

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.330 
it's just right it's not out of balance
you<00:01:54.640> know<00:01:54.759> in<00:01:54.909> other<00:01:55.799> other<00:01:56.799> cars<00:01:57.130> who

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
you know in other other cars who

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.830 
you know in other other cars who
sometimes<00:01:57.580> have<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:58.030> feeling<00:01:58.330> I<00:01:58.450> it's<00:01:58.630> a<00:01:58.689> bit

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
sometimes have the feeling I it's a bit

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.510 
sometimes have the feeling I it's a bit
lazy<00:01:59.080> or<00:01:59.380> it's<00:01:59.530> too<00:01:59.680> aggressive<00:01:59.890> you<00:02:00.280> can't

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
lazy or it's too aggressive you can't

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.430 
lazy or it's too aggressive you can't
really<00:02:00.820> put<00:02:01.180> it<00:02:01.299> on<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.539> track<00:02:01.720> but<00:02:01.990> here<00:02:02.229> the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
really put it on the track but here the

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.740 
really put it on the track but here the
balance<00:02:02.799> is<00:02:02.920> just<00:02:03.190> right<00:02:03.399> and<00:02:03.670> as<00:02:04.030> I<00:02:04.180> said<00:02:04.240> the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
balance is just right and as I said the

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.649 
balance is just right and as I said the
grip<00:02:04.990> is<00:02:05.289> a<00:02:05.979> new<00:02:06.220> dimension<00:02:06.399> so<00:02:07.060> all<00:02:07.450> of<00:02:07.509> that

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
grip is a new dimension so all of that

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:18.160 
grip is a new dimension so all of that
mexican<00:02:08.080> so<00:02:08.619> enjoyable

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.050 

yeah<00:02:18.709> it<00:02:18.770> was<00:02:18.920> going<00:02:19.160> too<00:02:19.340> quick<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:19.790> thought

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
yeah it was going too quick I thought

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.000 
yeah it was going too quick I thought
okay<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.450> know<00:02:20.750> we're<00:02:21.200> talking<00:02:21.530> about<00:02:21.620> speeds

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
okay you know we're talking about speeds

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.760 
okay you know we're talking about speeds
around<00:02:22.160> 400<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.180> so<00:02:23.540> on

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
around 400 and so on

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.380 
around 400 and so on
went<00:02:25.770> around<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.220> Nurburgring<00:02:26.910> I<00:02:27.060> think<00:02:27.300> the

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
went around the Nurburgring I think the

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.730 
went around the Nurburgring I think the
first<00:02:27.570> time<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.230> was<00:02:28.350> a<00:02:29.930> straight<00:02:30.930> away<00:02:31.170> 20

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
first time and it was a straight away 20

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.590 
first time and it was a straight away 20
or<00:02:31.890> 30<00:02:32.100> seconds<00:02:32.610> quicker<00:02:32.760> than<00:02:33.000> i<00:02:33.150> was<00:02:33.300> in<00:02:33.450> the

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
or 30 seconds quicker than i was in the

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.220 
or 30 seconds quicker than i was in the
real<00:02:34.080> formula<00:02:34.320> 1<00:02:34.620> car<00:02:34.860> so<00:02:35.780> it<00:02:36.780> was<00:02:36.930> quite<00:02:37.110> a

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
real formula 1 car so it was quite a

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.540 
real formula 1 car so it was quite a
surprise<00:02:37.470> how<00:02:38.460> how<00:02:39.030> fast<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.900> price<00:02:40.140> cut

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
surprise how how fast the price cut

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.760 
surprise how how fast the price cut
really<00:02:41.730> need<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:42.030> get<00:02:42.150> into<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.540> how<00:02:43.320> late<00:02:43.590> you

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
really need to get into it how late you

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.920 
really need to get into it how late you
can<00:02:43.950> break<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.460> then<00:02:44.580> still<00:02:44.880> how<00:02:45.090> fast<00:02:45.750> you

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
can break and then still how fast you

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.740 
can break and then still how fast you
can<00:02:46.110> go<00:02:46.260> in<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.500> corners<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.670> its<00:02:48.570> really

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
can go in the corners and its really

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.960 
can go in the corners and its really
very<00:02:48.900> tricky<00:02:49.590> car<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:49.920> drive<00:02:50.100> but<00:02:50.460> once<00:02:50.820> you

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
very tricky car to drive but once you

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.240 
very tricky car to drive but once you
find<00:02:51.240> out<00:02:51.390> how<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.050> works<00:02:52.260> it's<00:02:52.500> really<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.160> lot

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
find out how it works it's really a lot

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.910 
find out how it works it's really a lot
of
