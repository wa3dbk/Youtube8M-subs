see here we have a girl she's blonde I

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.880

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.390 
a soft light
I<00:02:10.180> found<00:02:11.180> that<00:02:11.330> soft<00:02:11.630> I<00:02:11.810> works<00:02:12.110> best<00:02:12.890> when

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
I found that soft I works best when

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.770 
I found that soft I works best when
doing<00:02:13.730> this<00:02:15.520> so<00:02:16.520> of<00:02:17.030> course<00:02:17.090> if<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:17.510> want<00:02:17.690> it

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
doing this so of course if you want it

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.010 
doing this so of course if you want it
more<00:02:17.930> harsh<00:02:18.850> you<00:02:19.850> can<00:02:20.000> go<00:02:20.120> to<00:02:20.180> over<00:02:20.540> layer<00:02:20.720> or

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
more harsh you can go to over layer or

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.240 
more harsh you can go to over layer or
something<00:02:21.380> like<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:21.530> but<00:02:21.770> you<00:02:21.860> can<00:02:22.010> change

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
something like that but you can change

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.950 
something like that but you can change
that<00:02:22.370> once<00:02:22.550> you're<00:02:22.670> all<00:02:22.760> done<00:02:22.790> with<00:02:23.120> this<00:02:23.240> so

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
that once you're all done with this so

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.720 
that once you're all done with this so
basically<00:02:24.350> i'm<00:02:24.560> on<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.680> feather<00:02:24.920> brush<00:02:25.190> now<00:02:25.430> and

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
basically i'm on a feather brush now and

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.820 
basically i'm on a feather brush now and
you<00:02:26.120> just<00:02:26.270> kind<00:02:26.540> of<00:02:26.630> you<00:02:26.960> know<00:02:27.220> click<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.570> draw

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
you just kind of you know click and draw

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.120 
you just kind of you know click and draw
pretty<00:02:30.830> much<00:02:31.100> over<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.670> hair<00:02:31.940> and<00:02:33.100> with<00:02:34.100> a

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
pretty much over the hair and with a

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.950 
pretty much over the hair and with a
feathered<00:02:34.490> brush<00:02:34.760> it's<00:02:35.090> a<00:02:35.240> lot<00:02:35.360> easier<00:02:35.390> than

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
feathered brush it's a lot easier than

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.660 
feathered brush it's a lot easier than
if<00:02:36.320> it<00:02:36.410> was<00:02:36.530> just<00:02:36.590> a<00:02:36.800> hard<00:02:37.010> edge<00:02:37.130> brush<00:02:37.370> because

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
if it was just a hard edge brush because

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.380 
if it was just a hard edge brush because
it's<00:02:38.650> it's<00:02:39.650> a<00:02:39.740> little<00:02:40.010> you<00:02:40.460> know<00:02:40.490> less<00:02:41.060> harsh

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
it's it's a little you know less harsh

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.770 
it's it's a little you know less harsh
along<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.930> edges<00:02:42.580> so<00:02:43.580> yeah<00:02:43.820> that's<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.630> whole

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
along the edges so yeah that's the whole

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.430 
along the edges so yeah that's the whole
point<00:02:44.960> of<00:02:45.080> feathering<00:02:45.380> to<00:02:45.710> do<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:47.510> as<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:48.320> can

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
point of feathering to do so as you can
