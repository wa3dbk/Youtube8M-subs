the max is 1080p you can go down to 720p

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.270 
the max is 1080p you can go down to 720p
640<00:01:56.430> by<00:01:56.549> 480<00:01:56.759> or<00:01:57.119> 320<00:01:57.689> by<00:01:57.840> 240<00:01:58.049> one<00:01:58.860> sad<00:01:59.100> thing

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
640 by 480 or 320 by 240 one sad thing

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.499 
640 by 480 or 320 by 240 one sad thing
is<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.579> we<00:01:59.700> do<00:01:59.820> not<00:01:59.909> have<00:02:00.149> image

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
is that we do not have image

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.209 
is that we do not have image
stabilization<00:02:00.869> option<00:02:01.469> in<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.710> video<00:02:02.009> mode

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
stabilization option in the video mode

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.730 
stabilization option in the video mode
and<00:02:02.520> these<00:02:03.149> are<00:02:03.299> some<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.630> other<00:02:03.810> settings

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
and these are some of the other settings

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.889 
and these are some of the other settings
that<00:02:05.040> are<00:02:05.100> possible<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:06.210> Samsung<00:02:06.630> has

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
that are possible so Samsung has

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.960 
that are possible so Samsung has
provided<00:02:07.500> quite<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.770> few<00:02:08.129> settings<00:02:08.520> on<00:02:08.789> this

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
provided quite a few settings on this

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.029 
provided quite a few settings on this
one<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.360> again<00:02:09.810> as<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.050> said<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.709> quickly

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
one and again as I said it quickly

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.610 
one and again as I said it quickly

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.470 
and let me just show you these shots
I've<00:02:18.739> actually<00:02:19.010> taken<00:02:19.310> a<00:02:19.519> lot<00:02:19.700> of<00:02:19.730> photographs

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
I've actually taken a lot of photographs

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.420 
I've actually taken a lot of photographs
and<00:02:20.690> again<00:02:20.959> as<00:02:21.170> you<00:02:21.290> see<00:02:21.440> we<00:02:21.650> took<00:02:22.250> this

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
and again as you see we took this

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.059 
and again as you see we took this
photograph<00:02:23.180> an<00:02:23.510> artificial<00:02:24.050> light<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:24.470> the

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
photograph an artificial light and the

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.680 
photograph an artificial light and the
good<00:02:25.220> thing<00:02:25.400> is<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.670> camera<00:02:25.879> is<00:02:26.090> pretty<00:02:26.390> sharp

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
good thing is the camera is pretty sharp

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.479 
good thing is the camera is pretty sharp
and<00:02:26.989> even<00:02:27.230> low<00:02:27.560> lighting<00:02:27.769> conditions<00:02:27.920> like

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
and even low lighting conditions like

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.839 
and even low lighting conditions like
this<00:02:28.730> it<00:02:29.269> does<00:02:29.510> take<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.870> shot<00:02:30.080> but<00:02:30.620> again<00:02:30.950> you

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
this it does take the shot but again you

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.070 
this it does take the shot but again you
have<00:02:31.879> to<00:02:32.030> be<00:02:32.209> careful<00:02:32.599> and<00:02:32.720> low<00:02:32.840> lighting

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
have to be careful and low lighting

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.199 
have to be careful and low lighting
conditions<00:02:33.230> because<00:02:33.799> there<00:02:34.760> can<00:02:34.970> be<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.120> little

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
conditions because there can be a little

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.449 
conditions because there can be a little
bit<00:02:35.390> of<00:02:35.510> camera<00:02:35.750> shake<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:36.920> image<00:02:37.310> this

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
bit of camera shake and the image this

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.580 
bit of camera shake and the image this
can<00:02:37.970> come<00:02:38.180> out<00:02:38.299> to<00:02:38.420> be<00:02:38.510> blurry<00:02:38.810> but<00:02:39.200> overall

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
can come out to be blurry but overall

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.910 
can come out to be blurry but overall
I'm<00:02:39.769> actually<00:02:40.160> pretty<00:02:40.640> impressed<00:02:40.940> with<00:02:41.420> this

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
I'm actually pretty impressed with this

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.220 
I'm actually pretty impressed with this
camera<00:02:42.920> and<00:02:43.269> let<00:02:44.269> me<00:02:44.420> now<00:02:44.540> show<00:02:44.750> you<00:02:44.810> all<00:02:45.049> these

camera and let me now show you all these

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.170 
camera and let me now show you all these
samples<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:45.860> full-screen<00:02:46.400> mode<00:02:46.519> so<00:02:46.940> that<00:02:46.970> you

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
samples and full-screen mode so that you

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.850 
samples and full-screen mode so that you
can<00:02:47.420> get<00:02:47.569> a<00:02:47.599> better<00:02:47.840> idea<00:02:47.989> regarding<00:02:48.739> the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
can get a better idea regarding the

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.789 
can get a better idea regarding the

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
camera performance these features were

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.520 
camera performance these features were
shot<00:02:52.040> outdoors<00:02:52.519> with<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:52.760> mega<00:02:52.970> 5.8<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:54.349> as

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
you can see even though it was an

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.759 
you can see even though it was an
overcast<00:02:56.239> day<00:02:56.599> the<00:02:56.930> pictures<00:02:57.290> come<00:02:57.470> out<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:57.739> be
