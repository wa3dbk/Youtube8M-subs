00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
use my fingers to get some some power

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.610 
use my fingers to get some some power
and<00:00:42.090> produce<00:00:42.629> some<00:00:42.840> double<00:00:43.110> strokes<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.530> use

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
and produce some double strokes and use

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.430 
and produce some double strokes and use
finger<00:00:43.890> control<00:00:44.780> there<00:00:45.780> with<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.110> fulcrum

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
finger control there with the fulcrum

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.200 
finger control there with the fulcrum
just<00:00:46.649> behind<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.980> middle<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.219> stick<00:00:47.489> okay

there<00:01:32.270> because<00:01:33.270> that's<00:01:33.420> further<00:01:34.020> back<00:01:34.610> that's

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
there because that's further back that's

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.310 
there because that's further back that's
going<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.880> be<00:01:35.909> forming<00:01:36.390> my<00:01:36.509> new<00:01:36.780> fulcrum<00:01:37.229> at

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
going to be forming my new fulcrum at

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.179 
going to be forming my new fulcrum at
the<00:01:37.409> base<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.829> thumb<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.040> the

traditional<00:01:38.610> grip<00:01:38.729> spot<00:01:39.090> there<00:01:39.299> okay<00:01:39.720> but

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
traditional grip spot there okay but

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.990 
traditional grip spot there okay but
that's<00:01:40.560> going<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.860> be<00:01:40.979> actually<00:01:41.189> once<00:01:41.729> again

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
that's going to be actually once again

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.490 
that's going to be actually once again
just<00:01:42.299> behind<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.810> middle<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.079> stick<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.470> a

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
just behind the middle of the stick so a

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.600 
just behind the middle of the stick so a
little<00:01:43.649> bit<00:01:43.799> further<00:01:43.979> towards<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.430> tip<00:01:44.549> of

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
little bit further towards the tip of

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.149 
little bit further towards the tip of
the<00:01:44.790> stick<00:01:45.000> from<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:46.320> slight<00:01:46.770> behind<00:01:47.070> the

fulcrum from the perspective of my new
traditional<00:01:49.140> grip<00:01:49.290> then<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.710> actually<00:01:49.890> want<00:01:50.189> to

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
traditional grip then I actually want to

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.249 
traditional grip then I actually want to
do<00:01:50.399> all<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.329> things<00:01:51.540> i<00:01:51.630> would<00:01:51.689> do<00:01:52.020> with<00:01:52.170> these

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
fingers to create our full traditional

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.450 
fingers to create our full traditional
grip<00:01:54.329> or<00:01:54.509> pull<00:01:54.720> these<00:01:54.869> things<00:01:54.930> around<00:01:55.500> okay

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
grip or pull these things around okay

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.130

and<00:01:56.700> I'll<00:01:56.850> have<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.119> finger<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:57.689> top<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.079> the

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
and I'll have this finger on top of the

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.749 
and I'll have this finger on top of the
stick<00:01:58.350> that's<00:01:58.500> pretty<00:01:58.799> important<00:01:59.280> for

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
stick that's pretty important for

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.550 
stick that's pretty important for
getting<00:02:00.420> control<00:02:00.810> not<00:02:01.110> putting<00:02:01.320> too<00:02:01.350> much

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
getting control not putting too much

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.020 
getting control not putting too much
stress<00:02:01.770> on<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.920> fulcrum<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.430> get<00:02:02.579> this<00:02:02.700> finger

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
stress on the fulcrum to get this finger

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.480 
stress on the fulcrum to get this finger
on<00:02:03.149> top<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.930> stick<00:02:04.140> there<00:02:04.439> okay<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.369> that

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
on top of the stick there okay and that

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.490 
on top of the stick there okay and that
way<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:05.640> can<00:02:06.060> play<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.750> lyre<00:02:06.930> normally<00:02:07.320> would

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
way I can play the lyre normally would

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.469 
way I can play the lyre normally would
well<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:07.979> once<00:02:08.220> again<00:02:08.550> because<00:02:09.090> I'm<00:02:09.209> more<00:02:09.390> in

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
well I once again because I'm more in

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.850 
well I once again because I'm more in
the<00:02:09.509> middle<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.840> sticker<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.349> really

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
the middle of the sticker I really

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.800 
the middle of the sticker I really
that<00:02:11.039> worked<00:02:11.490> my<00:02:11.670> arm<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.090> lot<00:02:12.240> and<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:12.570> forth

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
that worked my arm a lot and so forth

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.480 
that worked my arm a lot and so forth
they<00:02:12.930> get<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.200> notes<00:02:13.410> that's<00:02:13.920> not<00:02:14.130> quite<00:02:14.280> as

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
they get the notes that's not quite as

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.460 
they get the notes that's not quite as
nice<00:02:14.580> as<00:02:14.820> playing<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.270> bit<00:02:15.450> further<00:02:15.780> back<00:02:16.080> the

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
nice as playing a bit further back the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.410 
nice as playing a bit further back the
way<00:02:16.560> we<00:02:16.590> normally<00:02:16.830> would<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:17.730> each<00:02:18.030> position

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
way we normally would so each position

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.950 
way we normally would so each position
is<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.630> compromise<00:02:20.300> we're<00:02:21.300> further<00:02:21.600> into<00:02:21.870> the

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
is a compromise we're further into the

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.150 
is a compromise we're further into the
middle<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.230> stick<00:02:22.440> them<00:02:22.590> in<00:02:22.710> would

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
middle of the stick them in would

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.180 
middle of the stick them in would
normally<00:02:23.490> like<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.730> be<00:02:24.020> but<00:02:25.020> from<00:02:26.010> each

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
normally like to be but from each

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.680 
normally like to be but from each
position<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.940> this<00:02:27.030> is<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.300> crucial<00:02:27.510> point

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
position and this is the crucial point

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.050 
position and this is the crucial point
you're<00:02:28.410> actually<00:02:28.590> making<00:02:29.070> your<00:02:29.400> fulcrum<00:02:29.700> just

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
you're actually making your fulcrum just

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.970 
you're actually making your fulcrum just
behind<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.660> middle<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.020> stick<00:02:31.320> I<00:02:31.530> start

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
behind the middle of the stick I start

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.050 
behind the middle of the stick I start
off<00:02:32.100> there<00:02:32.310> just<00:02:32.550> behind<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.790> middle<00:02:32.970> of<00:02:33.000> the

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
off there just behind the middle of the

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.480 
off there just behind the middle of the
stick<00:02:33.330> as<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.990> stick<00:02:34.200> rotates<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.890> comes<00:02:35.220> up

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
stick as the stick rotates it comes up

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.430 
stick as the stick rotates it comes up
to<00:02:35.760> there<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.210> let<00:02:36.720> go<00:02:36.750> with<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.080> tip<00:02:37.230> of<00:02:37.260> the

to there I let go with the tip of the

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.980 
to there I let go with the tip of the
stick<00:02:37.650> there<00:02:37.860> where<00:02:38.340> r<00:02:38.520> lick<00:02:38.750> sorry<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:39.780> let<00:02:39.959> go

with the these fingers and the new
fulcrum<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.600> kind<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.959> little<00:02:43.020> bit<00:02:43.230> further

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
fulcrum is kind of a little bit further

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.010 
fulcrum is kind of a little bit further
back<00:02:43.680> there<00:02:43.950> when<00:02:44.520> I<00:02:44.550> go<00:02:45.330> back<00:02:45.570> to<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.840> front

back there when I go back to the front
the<00:02:46.170> same<00:02:46.380> things<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:46.740> happens<00:02:47.010> in<00:02:47.100> Reverse

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
the same things that happens in Reverse

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.250 
the same things that happens in Reverse
I<00:02:47.610> actually<00:02:47.820> use<00:02:48.150> these<00:02:48.330> fingers<00:02:48.930> here<00:02:49.110> to

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
I actually use these fingers here to

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.280 
I actually use these fingers here to
kind<00:02:49.680> of<00:02:49.770> grip<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.370> stick<00:02:50.610> back<00:02:50.790> here<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.330> as

little back sticking section on the left
hand<00:04:04.890> which<00:04:05.489> basically<00:04:05.850> forces<00:04:06.390> you<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.690> be

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
hand which basically forces you to be

out of control your notes were all

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.819 
out of control your notes were all
because<00:04:09.030> it<00:04:09.120> uses<00:04:09.269> a<00:04:09.420> few<00:04:09.750> more<00:04:10.320> complex

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
because it uses a few more complex

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.009 
because it uses a few more complex
patterns<00:04:11.220> with<00:04:11.700> that<00:04:11.910> it<00:04:12.329> goes<00:04:12.510> a<00:04:12.540> little<00:04:12.840> bit

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
patterns with that it goes a little bit

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:20.610 
patterns with that it goes a little bit
like<00:04:13.230> this

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.230
