00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
RP so the good thing about this glitch

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.580 
RP so the good thing about this glitch
is<00:01:10.880> that<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.479> cops<00:01:11.719> will<00:01:11.959> never<00:01:11.990> really<00:01:12.319> catch

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
is that the cops will never really catch

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.260 
is that the cops will never really catch
you<00:01:12.770> they're<00:01:12.950> always<00:01:13.100> too<00:01:13.429> slow<00:01:13.609> to<00:01:13.759> respond

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
you they're always too slow to respond

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.059 
you they're always too slow to respond
they're<00:01:14.810> too<00:01:15.139> busy<00:01:15.289> eating<00:01:15.409> donuts<00:01:15.979> or

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:16.069

00:01:17.949 --> 00:01:17.959 
whatever the fuck cops do and I actually

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:20.589 
whatever the fuck cops do and I actually
worked<00:01:18.259> out<00:01:18.409> the<00:01:18.529> math<00:01:18.560> and<00:01:18.770> it's<00:01:19.069> about<00:01:19.599> 200

00:01:20.589 --> 00:01:20.599 
worked out the math and it's about 200

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:23.080 
worked out the math and it's about 200
RP<00:01:20.899> every<00:01:21.229> 20<00:01:21.619> to<00:01:21.649> 25<00:01:22.159> seconds<00:01:22.609> if<00:01:22.700> you<00:01:22.729> do<00:01:22.939> this

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
RP every 20 to 25 seconds if you do this

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.269 
RP every 20 to 25 seconds if you do this
fast<00:01:23.359> now<00:01:24.109> as<00:01:24.380> some<00:01:24.679> of<00:01:24.740> you<00:01:24.829> might<00:01:24.920> argue<00:01:25.249> that

00:01:25.269 --> 00:01:25.279 
fast now as some of you might argue that

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:26.980 
fast now as some of you might argue that
that's<00:01:25.579> not<00:01:25.759> a<00:01:25.819> lot<00:01:26.029> but<00:01:26.329> it<00:01:26.509> does<00:01:26.749> add<00:01:26.779> up

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
that's not a lot but it does add up

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.629 
that's not a lot but it does add up
pretty<00:01:27.200> quickly<00:01:27.799> and<00:01:28.099> it's<00:01:28.219> a<00:01:28.279> lot<00:01:28.459> faster

00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:28.639 
pretty quickly and it's a lot faster

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:30.669 
pretty quickly and it's a lot faster
than<00:01:28.969> doing<00:01:29.270> this<00:01:29.359> legit<00:01:29.779> there<00:01:30.289> are<00:01:30.469> some

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
than doing this legit there are some

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:32.559 
than doing this legit there are some
missions<00:01:31.069> that<00:01:31.279> will<00:01:31.490> allow<00:01:31.999> you<00:01:32.060> to<00:01:32.209> rank<00:01:32.419> up

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:32.569 
missions that will allow you to rank up

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:35.139 
missions that will allow you to rank up
faster<00:01:33.079> than<00:01:33.109> this<00:01:33.439> method<00:01:33.919> but<00:01:34.490> this<00:01:34.819> one<00:01:35.029> is

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
faster than this method but this one is

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.239 
faster than this method but this one is
