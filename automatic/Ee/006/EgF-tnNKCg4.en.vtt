00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.850
 love 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.240
 i 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.770
 good kids, how are you doing? 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.449
 we have a guide and I guess many do not 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.009
 would be expected is that out of this weapon 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.989
 ACA 12 probably the first 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.460
 weapon with which we expose in the game 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.960
 but first I had to tell you a couple of 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.360
 things first like many already 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.949
 you will know butterfield 3 is totally 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.480
 that is to say it is not one of these things 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.610
 that last a weekend like those of 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.230
 steam but if right now you are going to 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.150
 your origin account and download is 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.559
 Battlefield 3 is what it gives is free with 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.940
 which I recommend you a lot since 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.920
 I think you will enjoy it very much 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.150
 It's a great game as you will know if 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.500
 you've been on this channel for a while 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.699
 well the other thing that I have to tell you is 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.769
 that the other day I forgot to comment 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.970
 one thing in the hard line video in the 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.830
 which by the way was the clamp 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.140
 commenting was a pass but good the 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.030
 Fortunately thing is that it just has 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.440
 recently made a video about that 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.700
 with which I highly recommend that you 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.320
 go see how it is quite 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.820
 interesting so you'll have it in the 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.590
 description and as I say I recommend you 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.210
 that you look at it and well said this 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.920
 let's go to the guide let's go to your 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.840
 unlock and today with this topic we are not going 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.400
 to have any problem since really 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.720
 if we bought the game right now and 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.850
 Let's start playing the multiplayer 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.560
 we would go out with her since she is the first 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.119
 weapon of the predetermined class with what 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.890
 which is not necessary to unblock it like this 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.960
 we move on to the next section 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.920
 which as you already know is that of the 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.630
 cadence and in this 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.909
 has one of the slowest in the game 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.189
 with 650 rounds per minute this already 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.900
 indicates that it will not be anything good short 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.030
 but as we will see later in combination 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.740
 with its recoil it can even compete 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.360
 with long wings but like many already 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.580
 you will know the aka 12 as well as almost 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.020
 all battlefield 4 weapons not only 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.729
 they shoot full cars but they have a 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.770
 burst mode what does not have in common 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.530
 with the rest of the weapons is that when the 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.600
 we change to this its cadence increases 750 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.670
 which is for example that of the m 416 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.320
 making it practically useless to put it on 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.880
 this mode since it does not offer too much more 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.380
 that its automatic version this does not 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.899
 it's always been like that, what do you remember? 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.759
 of the beta in it its bursts will be 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.890
 I think 1000 rounds per minute but according to 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.019
 says dais they followed the tertiary or 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.700
 dive the weapons in the amount of people 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.410
 who uses them but could not have 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.150
 taken into account that the reason for the 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.310
 that so many people used it can be 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.019
 call me crazy because there were only two 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.700
 assault rifles in the beta apart from 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.480
 that without effe have depending on the people 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.310
 who uses the weapons 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.709
 I think that 23 would have needed 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.269
 a good nerve has long since passed to 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.700
 your next look we will go to your 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.220
 charger which will have 31 bullets of 545 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.410
 x 39 what I understand is 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.580
 the Russian equivalent to 556 NATO 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.710
 so it's a damage model 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.710
 the normal assault rifles of 25 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.880
 short and 18 to long as well as 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.640
 in almost all assault rifles 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.320
 we will also have 31 bullets which 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.540
 we will recharge in a fairly medium time 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.070
 that is , it is not about the m16, it is not about 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.780
 the aec so it will stay in the middle with 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.310
 two seconds for the short and three 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.080
 seconds for the long and today I 'm going to 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.820
 recommend that ricard gays when you 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.590
 there is at least one bullet since this 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.270
 It is always advisable but time 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.790
 long recharge does not usually exceed 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.740
 a second to the short so have a lot 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.030
 Beware of that since you already know that the 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.860
 typical animation of the you take in 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.780
 battlefield is quite long and you can 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.790
 get in a mess once in a while and 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.200
 leaving the recharge and let's go to your 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.640
 recoil which will be one of the 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.560
 minors of the class and of the game with a 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.690
 0.3 upwards 0.15 towards the 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.340
 left and a 0.1 to the right what 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.050
 that will do it and obviously up and 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.300
 a little to the left and everything 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.430
 this will have a multiplier of 2.1 of 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.990
 first kick which makes it one 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.880
 of the quietest assault rifles 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.740
 that we can find ourselves doing the 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.360
 quite viable for size maps 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.610
 reasonable and last as always 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.530
 let's see its accuracy which at no 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.900
 being a ship is the normal of 0.2 while 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.489
 we point in stopped and of 1 while we 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.330
 we move in addition to having three points of 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.580
 hip but good 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.200
 last does not matter as much as with that 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.880
 cadence we're not going to get into short 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.430
 distances but hey there and today 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.050
 as we see its greatest quality is that it is 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.580
 a very easy weapon that is to say is in a 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.110
 good point in the table for the 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.760
 unlocks since there are other weapons 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.800
 slow with little recoil as could 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.540
 be the salt but imagine that they release you 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.040
 with that the first day anyway 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.260
 I think you always try to put 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.000
 first these 650 type weapons 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.770
 as I call them because if you remember 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.800
 the first weapon that we had on the side 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.540
 Russian in battlefield 3 was here 74 m 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.280
 which by the way we will make allusion 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.109
 but before that we move on to their 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.459
 accessories and as always we will have two 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.989
 configurations but both for 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.910
 very different objectives since one will be 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.200
 for automatic mode and another for 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.790
 of bursts let's start with the one of 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.470
 automatic and as I told you before this 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.510
 weapon is quite easy to handle well 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.980
 what I usually carry when I have it 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.320
 in this way that as I told you is how the 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.820
 uses is usually the heavy barrel for 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.440
 improve its accuracy also in the 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.880
 angular so that it does not go too far and 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.410
 you know that I never put myself in 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.060
 you look at them since it's something quite 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.800
 but I usually carry one of 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.530
 a few increases I usually carry 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.090
 the premium of 3.4 that I think apart from 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.620
 to be pretty pretty is practical though 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.300
 I also know that those you like 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.129
 respect the integrity of weapons 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.960
 you do not want to put a Chinese look a 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:55.849
 Russian weapon but good you have to give advice 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.259
 and for the burst mode it basically goes 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:58.819
 to be the same except the accessory of 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:00.800
 cannon for which we will change the canyon 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:02.419
 heavy by the muzzle brake since to me 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.039
 I do not like to recommend making a lady 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.659
 more imprecise but as you already know the 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:08.060
 Mouth brake alone takes precision from the 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:09.560
 automatic fire so what bursts mode what 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.060
 only thing that it will do is take us back 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.159
 which is precisely what we want to 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.620
 house as I have told you we will put the 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:17.900
 angled handle for him in this last case 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.340
 recoil since there is a curiosity 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.169
 about blast guns in 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.479
 battlefield 4 that almost nobody knows and is 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.159
 that the first setback for weapons 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.599
 of bursts is the last bullet instead of 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:28.729
 the first one so it can be said that in 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:30.740
 this case the first setback is the 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.090
 last and that said let's move on to the opinion 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.740
 and the truth is that today I will try to 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.300
 be relatively brief as you are 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.620
 seeing my opinion on this weapon is that 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.629
 I know it 's a kalashnikov because I 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.370
 they have said no because it is a weapon here 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:41.960
 When you see the guy say that's a 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.819
 kalashnikov that feeling you have 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.440
 when you see an unknowing weapon like 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:46.849
 classic bags and that's precisely what 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.069
 that make other games better like 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:51.740
 example battlefield 3 because although not 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:53.240
 he gave us the fashion with 47 they gave us 74 the 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.800
 which despite having a few more 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.510
 polymers that the 47 that was 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.280
 practically made of wood 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.380
 in that classic way that allows you 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.910
 recognize a house once you see something that 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.520
 I already said in a ub is that I think it was the 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.170
 of the rp here can not give you this block 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.850
 of polymer more flat than the table in the 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.560
 I'm writing this but good 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.940
 regardless of my opinion on 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.740
 she believes that the weapon fulfills its function 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.330
 if you do not take it out of your game that's something 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.610
 that should not be done with any so 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.290
 I think he deserves a 4 out of 5 which is 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.060
 maybe a little high maybe it deserves a 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.620
 little less statistically but the 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.870
 truth is that it works quite well from 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.370
 there the extra point and good kids that 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.960
 It would be all for today I hope that I have 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.370
 liked and taking advantage of that we are in 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.720
 Sunday I will tell you what we 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.760
 waits this week that as I already know 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.440
 I would expect it will be pretty focused with 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.060
 the battlefield hard line in the first place 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.950
 as many of you already know you read that a 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.630
 gameplay that probably although what 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.520
 will deny the developers of visceral 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.440
 I think it was made for e3 and for 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.030
 course as it was uploaded to youtube 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.800
 electronics began his campaign 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.270
 massive destruction of channels giving it a 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.770
 gift in the form of strike to each one 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.630
 that raised it so that as you can 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.860
 imagine I can not upload it all 

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.750
 ways if for the judge has not raised 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.700
 the embargo something that I think they're not going to 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.140
 do until after 3 I'll take the 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.150
 video which I have downloaded what 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.190
 I will analyze select in the elements 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.260
 most important and I will bring you a summary 

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.880
 so that those who do not get to see it 

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.530
 you do not understand English well or something 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.080
 you can learn more or less about how 

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:12.970
 be the game so nothing said this I 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.970
 goodbye goodbye kids
