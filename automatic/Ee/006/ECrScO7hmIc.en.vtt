00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.990
 eike is the felipe that the 10/5 day this time 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.670
 with a 100% state game look only give 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.289
 satisfaction the team members are the 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.390
 next for those who are still there in the fanpage 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.189
 From facebook, I know I was bloodied in 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.000
 eyes to 5% throughout the game and 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.820
 probably also know that I was 31 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.960
 99.5 percent of the game due to a bug 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.480
 manager where the last mission of the good 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.090
 one that moves after doing all 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.340
 the parachute missions did not appear 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.950
 no matter what I tried to do 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.050
 I researched the whole internet has everything 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.640
 that I could try to understand them, I did not 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.379
 I'm the only one with a lot of people with 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.850
 same problem already sent a lot of e 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.860
 mails to the hawks where she always 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.480
 responds with a lot of resolution failure 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.100
 to fix the bunny saying that 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.079
 none worked the cd was 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.879
 corrupt and could faun everyone 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.980
 practically this then simple motto 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.780
 between playing 80 hours of play everything from 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.100
 new and download a breast from the internet I 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.660
 I think 16 on the internet with my 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.250
 consciousness is more than clean 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.350
 after all, what I lost was an omission 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.390
 and finally with the game five cents now 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.939
 Can I show you or the celebrities? 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.890
 flying saucers at 100% to match the 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.470
 Big foot mission come in all 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.420
 investigation of that conspiracy and 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.909
 montijo where they believe that 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.680
 even a flying backpack on a jetpack in the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.600
 end of everything but I do not want to come in 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.159
 in detail now the end of the video I 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.920
 I come in but for now no I just want 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.200
 to present to you the 3 beautiful ones 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.000
 flying saucers you can see to the circle 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.060
 center the game the first appears in the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.740
 top of the hill and will only form about 3 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.930
 hours of dawn if it is raining 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.880
 You can be the flying saucer of that one. 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.470
 observation platform because it can 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.790
 shooting at it will not react to anything 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.439
 money neither minister nor by any 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.210
 You try to get close and go. 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.979
 disappear if you try to fly it goes 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.329
 disappear or it is as if it were a 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.610
 hologram position has none 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.470
 interaction with the disk the second disk 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.790
 flying over strong fort san 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.590
 When I want from him, strong that not 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.149
 appears on the map he does not have time 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.590
 specific to appear 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.450
 It will simply appear to be 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.000
 it is as if it were the other way around 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.460
 of the flying saucer of the mountain but finally 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.979
 point here is that 36 remaining 500 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.239
 The maximum of the game has no errors and goes 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.370
 to find the flying saucer in my 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.560
 opinion is the most beautiful of all is where 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.420
 they look good with rude looks 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.950
 very hostile appearance and any 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.510
 interaction with a flying saucer can 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.400
 end a tragic end 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.680
 You try to land on them. 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.660
 helicopter will explode and try to pass 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.430
 near or below it will turn off the 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.880
 Copter helicopter engine will start to 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.099
 fall 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.330
 if you try to land a parachute in 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.459
 It is very likely that he is going to 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.590
 slip and fall or stand in the middle 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.840
 his skin will push you up 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.790
 meters tall but of course I passed 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.980
 a lot of time on the mattress in this disk value 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.590
 that until you get on top of it 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.300
 take the pretty pictures of cute feet 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.400
 this disc here unlike that of the 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.140
 monte is totally interacting you 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.060
 can land on top can hit can 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.580
 exploding can give only shot he has 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.200
 1001 is a force field that will fade 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.450
 with the bullet make an effective of choctaw 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.580
 everything very well done and all this without 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.530
 tell in the disturbing noise that he 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:12.660
 Does when you come near was serious 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:15.299
 even fucking fear fucking listen just fucking 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.820
 the third and last flying saucer is 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:20.370
 that over those team camps 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.200
 and this is the full time of the game there 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.150
 in the last risquinho understood 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.070
 apparently he is the same as the one who 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.989
 it appears on the mount 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.519
 interacted just like that of fortis in 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.650
 also new that he has 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.959
 acronym is five on the side nor that equals 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.970
 to fbi in the game which leads to think what 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.350
 characterizes fbi has to do with fucking 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.120
 of a flying saucer 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.040
 but finally the interaction results are 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.600
 the same 70 after the helicopter will only go 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.220
 if it fucking keep Roberto going 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.870
 turn off the helicopters try to stay at 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.639
 piece will slip and fall in most 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.170
 of the times but unlike the disc 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.269
 Fort without an angle he has a 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.090
 look a little more passive a little 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.040
 more intimidating than can be seen 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.660
 that the distortion effect of the screen 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.040
 is now white instead of black the 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.870
 The noise it makes when it comes close. 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.870
 is also different thinner at last 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:10.140
 finally as if it were that flying saucer 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.189
 fortis the angle but the appearance and 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.859
 different style 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:15.629
 both very beautiful and very fuck up but 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:18.299
 Anyway what I showed you is now 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:21.329
 only his parturition only what each one does 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:25.020
 where there is only one theory 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.699
 giant conspiracy focus is on 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.530
 relation to the subject for us all 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.990
 we know that drawing on the wall in the 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.550
 mount monte mountain that much 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.009
 People have already broken their heads to try 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.720
 to identify what Carlos means 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:38.759
 that goal being that it is as if it were a 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.919
 map of the mountain with several 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:43.080
 marked points and underneath three small boxes 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.210
 with different designs being a disk 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.130
 flying another one cracked egg and another one 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.660
 nurturing with a jetpack with the backpack 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.210
 flying on the back 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.130
 hence the question what caravaggio da 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.020
 rockstar was going to do something so detailed 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.970
 so do not have an easter egg to not 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.590
 have no mystery no reward 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.169
 behind all this after all 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.120
 this begins to appear after 100% to the game 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.050
 imagine that the prize was not only to find the 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.240
 flying saucers 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.250
 after all if you put this map being the 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.229
 as if it were a view of the mountain there 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.360
 stated well you will find in every 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.699
 point marked on the map is a 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.860
 mountain in part of camp rip 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:20.099
 besides the own firing camp itself 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.930
 crowded with ali's drawings, all that 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:23.490
 imaginable way there are also drawings 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.590
 similar to those that people 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.810
 found on the mountain what also gives 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.820
 loophole to much study without counting the 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.440
 map in the game collector version 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.690
 if you put on a black light go 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.360
 find multiple locations phrases 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.460
 marked on the map is more suggestive than 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.860
 the other side this is not even the beginning if 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.599
 I was just going to show you each clue 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.759
 every thing they've ever found about 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:46.919
 subject and take about 20 minutes 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:49.409
 video here anyway last week 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:51.780
 include central game 80% of my time I 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:54.180
 I was able to choose from a monitor of a pc 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.310
 I was reading about it in a forum 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.740
 in the unic of the gta that exceeded 100 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.720
 discussion pages large where 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.030
 in bizarre theory and for death that does not 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.070
 Fuck yeah no but with a lot of clue 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.990
 interesting thing about 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.820
 I think I'm doing my scheme here in 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.860
 my schedule busy schedule difficult 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.830
 several things the guy in my head is 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.270
 just aching to think about it 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.250
 but I still want to bring you a 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.050
 video about but without further ado 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.370
 Thank you so much for watching. 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.370
 Okay, he said until the next time.
