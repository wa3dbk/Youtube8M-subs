the floor was installed first so that

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.900 
the floor was installed first so that
way<00:02:42.900> everything<00:02:43.170> was<00:02:43.440> kept<00:02:43.650> square<00:02:44.100> we<00:02:44.760> also

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
way everything was kept square we also

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.150 
way everything was kept square we also
went<00:02:45.270> through<00:02:45.330> had<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.320> weld<00:02:46.530> these<00:02:46.680> support

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.340 
went through had to weld these support
beams<00:02:47.190> in<00:02:47.640> here<00:02:47.670> while<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.840> was<00:02:48.989> up<00:02:49.140> on<00:02:49.230> the

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
beams in here while it was up on the

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.870 
beams in here while it was up on the
rotisserie<00:02:49.800> we<00:02:49.980> cut<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.280> floor<00:02:50.520> out<00:02:50.700> because

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
rotisserie we cut the floor out because

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
rotisserie we cut the floor out because
otherwise<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.480> would<00:02:51.600> have<00:02:51.630> been<00:02:51.810> an

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
otherwise it would have been an

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.680 
otherwise it would have been an

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
accordion so we didn't want to ruin the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.600 
accordion so we didn't want to ruin the
roof<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.230> I'll<00:02:55.410> save<00:02:55.650> us<00:02:55.830> work<00:02:56.070> keep<00:02:56.459> it

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
roof and I'll save us work keep it

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.990 
roof and I'll save us work keep it
straight<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.299> so<00:02:57.900> this<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:59.010> mocked<00:02:59.310> up<00:02:59.610> it's

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
straight and so this is mocked up it's

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.449 
straight and so this is mocked up it's
ready<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.480> be<00:03:00.720> welded<00:03:00.870> in<00:03:01.260> but<00:03:01.739> I'm<00:03:02.160> not<00:03:02.280> gonna

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
ready to be welded in but I'm not gonna

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.250 
ready to be welded in but I'm not gonna
weld<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.760> in<00:03:02.940> just<00:03:03.180> yet<00:03:03.480> I'm<00:03:03.720> gonna<00:03:03.840> wait<00:03:04.049> until

quarters put on in the doors so that way

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.820 
quarters put on in the doors so that way
everything's<00:03:09.239> test<00:03:09.510> fitted<00:03:09.870> we<00:03:10.049> know<00:03:10.200> the

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
everything's test fitted we know the

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.740 
everything's test fitted we know the
lines<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.519> car's<00:03:11.730> gonna<00:03:11.910> be<00:03:12.090> straight<00:03:12.480> and

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
lines the car's gonna be straight and

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.640 
lines the car's gonna be straight and
then<00:03:13.440> once<00:03:14.130> that's<00:03:14.400> all<00:03:14.850> done<00:03:15.209> then<00:03:16.200> I'll<00:03:16.500> go

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
just a three-piece floor section that

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.890 
just a three-piece floor section that
came<00:04:14.220> with<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.520> car<00:04:14.730> and<00:04:15.209> we<00:04:15.480> ended<00:04:15.600> up<00:04:15.720> going

came with the car and we ended up going
this<00:04:16.170> route<00:04:16.380> causes<00:04:16.760> lots<00:04:17.760> of<00:04:17.910> lot<00:04:18.209> nicer

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
this route causes lots of lot nicer

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.330 
this route causes lots of lot nicer
finish<00:04:19.709> to<00:04:19.920> it<00:04:19.950> so<00:04:20.810> I<00:04:21.810> mean<00:04:22.650> that's<00:04:22.770> basically

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
finish to it so I mean that's basically

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.470 
finish to it so I mean that's basically
the<00:04:24.120> car<00:04:24.390> itself<00:04:25.550> we<00:04:26.550> still<00:04:26.790> got<00:04:26.910> a<00:04:26.940> curves

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
the car itself we still got a curves

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.930 
the car itself we still got a curves
quarters<00:04:28.200> put<00:04:28.350> on<00:04:28.500> and<00:04:28.800> we<00:04:29.100> land<00:04:29.340> on<00:04:29.520> this<00:04:29.669> side
