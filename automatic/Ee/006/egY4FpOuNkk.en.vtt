 I started with workshops 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.630
 improvisation because he needs to 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.420
 see how it evolves and in their 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.040
 body in their dance what they 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.950
 tell them what they had 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.960

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.950
 head what they had in their dreams 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.720
 So we exchanged were exchanged 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.060
 small this information could not 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.590
 discover the work of working with 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.080
 the first one happens when she 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.120

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.250
 it us many things because 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.070

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.750
 I like dance is true in general I have 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.060

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.700
 few all kinds of gestures 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.880
 not only in dance to enrich my 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.880
 dance 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.150
 me week can work on 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.160
 caliber you do what you want you do 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.070

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:49.850
 given you are and pop and finally that's it 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:53.300
 it is my will no longer worked on 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:57.080
 a gesture search on not getting 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.610
 limit to ok what beyond this 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.020
 Information then compared to hip hop 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.750
 once we have this information 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:07.090
 in reading but it's anchored 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.090
 now go further 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.690
 it's a tilting his two daughters 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.970
 super interesting and who are beautiful 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.890
 it's beautiful people and 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:24.550
 it's interesting work binoculars 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:26.900
 because because I already like them 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.850
 see the human relationships in the dance 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.320
 the but how is it going 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.820
 and that's really interesting because 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.050
 that they are it's in itself is 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:39.620
 that you drink trips and this one is 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.500
 she who manages it happened and how 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.120
 he works with that because it does not 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.480
 not necessarily always obvious 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.040
 dance with his twin sister and so if 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.669
 it was interesting to see that for me 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.199
 it made me 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.960
 it was intriguing and his beautiful me 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.760
 personally I did not think that in 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.190
 five days this and give something 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.320
 and here we are the last days and on 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:07.110
 the diplomas it's going to be still here's the 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.110
 come to relax without framing things 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:33.719
 it
