years<00:00:04.680> ago<00:00:04.890> or<00:00:05.009> so<00:00:05.779> so<00:00:06.779> let<00:00:06.930> me<00:00:07.020> present<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.770> you

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
years ago or so so let me present to you

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.970 
years ago or so so let me present to you
the<00:00:08.639> acceleration<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.630> ages<00:00:12.679> the<00:00:13.679> first

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
the acceleration of the ages the first

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.260 
the acceleration of the ages the first
step<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.309> separation<00:00:17.000> well<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.029> mean<00:00:18.150> you

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
step of separation well I mean you

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.740 
step of separation well I mean you
couldn't<00:00:18.449> take<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.600> back<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.140> cell<00:00:20.630> to<00:00:21.630> the

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.269 
to life itself to the first homeostatic
organism<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.380> creates<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.859> boundary<00:00:26.189> between

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
organism that creates a boundary between

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.970 
organism that creates a boundary between
self<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:26.939> other<00:00:27.090> okay<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.470> do<00:00:28.529> take<00:00:28.830> it

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
self and other okay and I do take it

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.589 
self and other okay and I do take it
back<00:00:29.130> there<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.670> book<00:00:29.820> but<00:00:30.000> let's<00:00:30.210> just<00:00:30.420> go

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
back there in the book but let's just go

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.240 
back there in the book but let's just go
back<00:00:30.750> three<00:00:31.109> million<00:00:31.410> years<00:00:31.590> give<00:00:31.920> or<00:00:32.009> take<00:00:32.189> a

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
back three million years give or take a

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.700 
back three million years give or take a
few<00:00:32.369> million<00:00:33.110> when<00:00:34.110> we<00:00:34.230> started<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.590> make

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
few million when we started to make

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.660 
few million when we started to make
stone<00:00:35.010> tools<00:00:36.950> this<00:00:37.950> was<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.219> first<00:00:38.430> step<00:00:38.610> in

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
stone tools this was the first step in

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.000 
stone tools this was the first step in
separation<00:00:39.149> because<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:40.079> first<00:00:40.350> artificial

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
separation because the first artificial

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.180 
separation because the first artificial
object<00:00:41.460> was<00:00:42.059> created<00:00:42.090> if<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.230> if<00:00:43.890> you're<00:00:44.100> an

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
object was created if you if you're an

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.680 
object was created if you if you're an
archaeologist<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:44.969> know<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.300> dig<00:00:45.539> one

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
archaeologist you know and you dig one

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.170 
archaeologist you know and you dig one
up<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.350> know<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.950> was<00:00:47.160> made<00:00:47.520> by<00:00:47.910> human

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
up you know this was made by human

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.529 
up you know this was made by human
beings<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.899> not<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> natural<00:00:49.289> object<00:00:50.539> so

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
beings this is not a natural object so

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.080 
beings this is not a natural object so
the<00:00:51.780> realm<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.379> human<00:00:52.739> began<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.610> diverge

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
the realm of the human began to diverge

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.709 
the realm of the human began to diverge
from<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.750> realm<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.079> natural<00:00:56.719> three

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
from the realm of the natural three

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:58.900 
from the realm of the natural three
million<00:00:57.960> years

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
million years

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.090 
million years
now<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.629> next<00:01:00.840> step<00:01:01.079> about<00:01:01.620> three<00:01:01.949> hundred

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
now the next step about three hundred

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.950 
now the next step about three hundred
thousand<00:01:02.730> years<00:01:02.820> ago<00:01:03.799> the<00:01:04.799> age<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.189> fire<00:01:05.430> began

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
thousand years ago the age of fire began

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.060 
thousand years ago the age of fire began
give<00:01:06.960> or<00:01:07.080> take<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.260> few<00:01:07.439> hundred<00:01:07.680> thousand

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
give or take a few hundred thousand

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.800 
give or take a few hundred thousand
years<00:01:08.659> I<00:01:09.659> won't<00:01:10.380> go<00:01:10.470> into<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.880> historian<00:01:11.880> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
years I won't go into the historian the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.270 
years I won't go into the historian the
debate<00:01:13.140> among<00:01:13.320> archaeologists<00:01:13.950> about<00:01:14.130> this

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
debate among archaeologists about this

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.140 
debate among archaeologists about this
but<00:01:14.460> let's<00:01:14.610> just<00:01:14.760> say<00:01:14.909> three<00:01:15.090> hundred

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
but let's just say three hundred

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.640 
but let's just say three hundred
thousand<00:01:15.600> years<00:01:15.750> ago<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:15.960> started<00:01:16.200> using<00:01:16.290> fire

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
thousand years ago we started using fire

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.530 
thousand years ago we started using fire
this<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.430> another<00:01:17.670> step<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.119> separation

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
this is another step in separation

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.010 
this is another step in separation
because<00:01:19.400> fire<00:01:20.400> allows<00:01:20.909> us<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.390> master<00:01:21.869> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
because fire allows us to master the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.380 
because fire allows us to master the
wild<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:23.040> creates<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.580> circle<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.060> domesticity

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
wild it creates a circle of domesticity

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.050 
wild it creates a circle of domesticity
it<00:01:25.380> creates<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.830> boundary<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.430> circle<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
it creates a boundary that circle of the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
campfire creates of boundary animals

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.109 
campfire creates of boundary animals
won't<00:01:28.770> go<00:01:28.950> near<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.850> creates<00:01:29.970> a

won't go near it and it creates a

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.520 
won't go near it and it creates a

it's<00:02:03.580> much<00:02:03.700> earlier<00:02:04.500> but<00:02:05.500> symbolic<00:02:06.010> culture

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.219 
it's much earlier but symbolic culture
is<00:02:06.550> another<00:02:07.000> step<00:02:07.270> in<00:02:07.330> distancing<00:02:07.930> because

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
is another step in distancing because

is another step in distancing because
now<00:02:11.550> we<00:02:12.550> create<00:02:13.030> this<00:02:13.870> layer<00:02:14.470> of<00:02:15.750> names<00:02:16.750> of

now we create this layer of names of

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.180 
now we create this layer of names of
symbols<00:02:17.560> between<00:02:17.920> us<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:18.490> reality<00:02:19.890> two<00:02:20.890> masks

to name something is to master it it's
to<00:02:23.620> bring<00:02:23.800> it<00:02:23.890> into<00:02:24.040> your<00:02:24.370> world<00:02:24.640> your

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
to bring it into your world your

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.470 
to bring it into your world your
conceptual<00:02:25.510> world<00:02:29.010> once<00:02:30.010> you've<00:02:30.190> done<00:02:30.400> that

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
conceptual world once you've done that

conceptual world once you've done that
conceptually<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:32.170> next<00:02:32.440> step<00:02:32.620> is<00:02:32.830> very

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
conceptually the next step is very

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.080 
conceptually the next step is very
natural<00:02:34.680> domestication

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
natural domestication

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.430 
natural domestication
you<00:02:37.240> know<00:02:37.330> first<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:37.630> make<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:38.050> yours<00:02:38.260> by

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
you know first you make it yours by

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.600 
you know first you make it yours by
naming<00:02:38.830> it<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.070> then<00:02:39.340> you<00:02:39.430> actually

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
naming it and then you actually

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.170 
naming it and then you actually
domesticate<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.570> you<00:02:40.630> make<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:40.900> yours<00:02:41.140> by

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
domesticate it you make it yours by

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.820 
domesticate it you make it yours by
controlling<00:02:43.180> it<00:02:43.300> by<00:02:43.660> corralling<00:02:44.530> it<00:02:44.680> by

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
controlling it by corralling it by

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.700 
controlling it by corralling it by
planting<00:02:45.340> it<00:02:45.430> by<00:02:45.550> pulling<00:02:45.760> up<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.000> weeds<00:02:46.710> so

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
planting it by pulling up the weeds so

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.800 
planting it by pulling up the weeds so
this<00:02:47.830> is<00:02:47.950> another<00:02:48.330> further<00:02:49.330> step<00:02:49.660> of

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
this is another further step of

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.340 
this is another further step of
separation<00:02:50.320> from<00:02:50.950> nature<00:02:53.490> and<00:02:55.350> with

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
separation from nature and with

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.520 
separation from nature and with
agriculture<00:02:57.270> many<00:02:58.270> new<00:02:58.510> concepts<00:02:59.020> are<00:02:59.290> born

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
agriculture many new concepts are born

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.180 
agriculture many new concepts are born
for<00:03:00.400> example<00:03:00.760> good<00:03:00.940> and<00:03:01.120> evil<00:03:02.190> basically

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
for example good and evil basically

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.949 
for example good and evil basically
unknown<00:03:03.340> before<00:03:03.670> domestication<00:03:04.330> but<00:03:05.200> now<00:03:06.959> the

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
unknown before domestication but now the

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.800 
unknown before domestication but now the
wolf<00:03:08.800> becomes<00:03:09.160> evil<00:03:09.550> the<00:03:09.850> Sheep<00:03:10.090> becomes<00:03:10.510> good

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
wolf becomes evil the Sheep becomes good

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.220 
wolf becomes evil the Sheep becomes good
the<00:03:11.380> weeds<00:03:11.620> become<00:03:12.040> evil<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.970> crops<00:03:13.780> become

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
the weeds become evil the crops become

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.610 
the weeds become evil the crops become
good<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:15.570> with<00:03:16.570> population<00:03:17.200> growth<00:03:17.410> we

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
these natural forces which can destroy

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.949 
these natural forces which can destroy
the<00:03:25.060> crops<00:03:25.330> and<00:03:27.090> we<00:03:28.090> begin<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.690> make

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
the crops and we begin to make

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.199 
the crops and we begin to make
sacrifices<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:31.170> gradually<00:03:32.170> divinity

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
sacrifices and gradually divinity

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.520 
sacrifices and gradually divinity
abandons<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.720> earth<00:03:34.870> and<00:03:35.140> moves<00:03:35.260> up<00:03:35.380> to<00:03:35.500> the

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.880 
abandons the earth and moves up to the
sky<00:03:39.660> so<00:03:40.660> that's<00:03:40.810> three<00:03:41.200> thousand<00:03:41.620> years<00:03:41.739> ago

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
sky so that's three thousand years ago

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:42.780 
sky so that's three thousand years ago
so<00:03:41.950> you<00:03:42.040> see<00:03:42.190> a<00:03:42.220> pattern<00:03:42.430> here

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
so you see a pattern here

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.640 
so you see a pattern here
three<00:03:43.600> thousand<00:03:43.989> years<00:03:44.110> give<00:03:44.290> or<00:03:44.320> take<00:03:44.500> a<00:03:44.560> few

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
three thousand years give or take a few

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.949 
three thousand years give or take a few
thousand<00:03:45.160> okay<00:03:45.400> in<00:03:46.120> some<00:03:46.300> places<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:46.720> hundred

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
thousand okay in some places the hundred

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.390 
thousand okay in some places the hundred
years<00:03:47.110> ago<00:03:47.350> in<00:03:47.470> some<00:03:47.590> places<00:03:47.800> maybe<00:03:48.160> ten

thousand<00:03:48.730> years<00:03:48.790> ago

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
thousand years ago

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.210 
thousand years ago
so<00:03:49.720> three<00:03:50.019> million<00:03:50.350> three<00:03:50.560> hundred<00:03:50.620> thousand

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
so three million three hundred thousand

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.949 
so three million three hundred thousand
thirty<00:03:51.430> thousand<00:03:51.880> three<00:03:52.030> thousand<00:03:52.510> three

that's<00:04:49.700> 30<00:04:50.090> years<00:04:50.150> into<00:04:50.960> the<00:04:51.050> information<00:04:51.320> age

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
that's 30 years into the information age

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.710 
that's 30 years into the information age
so<00:04:52.520> this<00:04:53.270> acceleration<00:04:54.200> is<00:04:55.160> happening<00:04:55.700> now<00:04:56.420> is

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
so this acceleration is happening now is

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.390 
so this acceleration is happening now is
there<00:04:57.020> going<00:04:57.140> to<00:04:57.170> be<00:04:57.260> some<00:04:57.500> mini<00:04:57.710> age<00:04:57.920> of<00:04:58.100> three

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
there going to be some mini age of three

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.580 
there going to be some mini age of three
years<00:04:58.640> starting<00:04:59.510> right<00:04:59.780> about<00:04:59.870> now<00:05:00.140> and<00:05:00.440> then

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
years starting right about now and then

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.170 
years starting right about now and then
three<00:05:00.860> months<00:05:01.040> and<00:05:01.340> then<00:05:01.430> for<00:05:01.670> three<00:05:01.880> days<00:05:02.150> you

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
three months and then for three days you

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.240 
three months and then for three days you
know

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
know

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.380 
know
so<00:05:04.250> it's<00:05:04.400> reaching<00:05:04.760> a<00:05:04.880> a<00:05:06.610> singularity<00:05:07.610> as

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
so it's reaching a a singularity as

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:23.530 
so it's reaching a a singularity as
something<00:05:10.630> and<00:05:11.630> I<00:05:11.750> think<00:05:19.330> from<00:05:22.060> 100<00:05:23.060> gathering

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
something and I think from 100 gathering

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.750 
something and I think from 100 gathering
to<00:05:23.930> agriculture<00:05:24.800> or<00:05:24.920> agriculture<00:05:25.550> to<00:05:25.670> the

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
to agriculture or agriculture to the

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.940 
to agriculture or agriculture to the
Machine<00:05:26.090> more<00:05:26.720> momentous<00:05:27.170> than<00:05:27.200> the<00:05:27.590> advent

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
Machine more momentous than the advent

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.190 
Machine more momentous than the advent
of<00:05:28.010> computer<00:05:28.610> information<00:05:28.760> technology

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
of computer information technology

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.300 
of computer information technology
something<00:05:30.200> that's<00:05:30.380> qualitatively<00:05:31.070> different

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
something that's qualitatively different

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.160 
something that's qualitatively different
an<00:05:31.550> entirely<00:05:31.910> new<00:05:32.680> level<00:05:34.750> the<00:05:35.750> earth<00:05:35.930> is

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.170 
an entirely new level the earth is

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.750 
an entirely new level the earth is
excited<00:05:36.560> about<00:05:36.620> that<00:05:39.250> bill<00:05:40.250> was<00:05:40.370> telling<00:05:40.550> me

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
excited about that bill was telling me

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.900 
excited about that bill was telling me
that<00:05:40.970> the<00:05:41.950> heartbeat<00:05:42.950> of<00:05:43.130> the<00:05:43.220> earth<00:05:43.250> I<00:05:43.700> think

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
that the heartbeat of the earth I think

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.240 
that the heartbeat of the earth I think
it's<00:05:44.030> called<00:05:44.180> a<00:05:44.300> Schumann<00:05:44.660> resonance<00:05:45.250> has

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
it's called a Schumann resonance has

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.560 
it's called a Schumann resonance has
speeded<00:05:46.880> up<00:05:47.000> in<00:05:47.840> the<00:05:48.500> last<00:05:48.680> 20-30<00:05:49.550> years<00:05:49.669> it

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
speeded up in the last 20-30 years it

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.600 
speeded up in the last 20-30 years it
used<00:05:50.600> to<00:05:50.870> be<00:05:50.960> how<00:05:51.110> many<00:05:51.169> beats<00:05:51.500> per<00:05:51.590> minute<00:05:52.190> per

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
used to be how many beats per minute per

00:05:52.610 --> 00:06:00.600 
used to be how many beats per minute per
second

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:06.540 

yeah<00:06:01.750> and

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.230 

according<00:06:07.550> to<00:06:07.610> that<00:06:07.700> article

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
according to that article

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.980 
according to that article
yeah<00:06:08.390> yeah<00:06:09.140> right<00:06:09.980> and<00:06:10.220> so<00:06:10.520> so<00:06:11.120> it's<00:06:11.570> speeding

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
yeah yeah right and so so it's speeding

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:17.470 
yeah yeah right and so so it's speeding
up<00:06:12.140> and<00:06:14.770> so<00:06:15.770> the<00:06:16.490> transition<00:06:17.060> that<00:06:17.090> we're<00:06:17.390> on

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480 
up and so the transition that we're on

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:24.250 
up and so the transition that we're on
the<00:06:17.600> verge<00:06:17.750> of<00:06:18.050> is<00:06:21.610> not<00:06:22.840> just<00:06:23.840> another

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.260 
the verge of is not just another

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.970 
the verge of is not just another
intensification<00:06:24.950> of<00:06:25.400> separation
