00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
explosive device so let's go ahead and

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.389 
explosive device so let's go ahead and
test<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.090> out<00:01:09.270> really<00:01:09.990> quick<00:01:10.289> let's<00:01:10.530> say<00:01:10.829> we

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
the place being burned but as you guys

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.209 
the place being burned but as you guys
can<00:02:27.250> see<00:02:27.430> that<00:02:27.640> c4<00:02:28.599> is<00:02:28.810> no<00:02:29.200> joke<00:02:29.680> it's<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:30.010> pretty

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:30.219 
can see that c4 is no joke it's a pretty

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:32.910 
can see that c4 is no joke it's a pretty
huge<00:02:30.519> explosion<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.180> lot<00:02:31.390> bigger<00:02:31.689> than<00:02:31.959> TNT<00:02:32.769> and

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
huge explosion a lot bigger than TNT and

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.640 
huge explosion a lot bigger than TNT and
I<00:02:33.010> think<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.310> lot<00:02:33.459> bigger<00:02:33.670> than<00:02:33.760> for<00:02:34.150> TNT<00:02:34.480> so<00:02:35.170> you

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
I think a lot bigger than for TNT so you

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.039 
I think a lot bigger than for TNT so you
definitely<00:02:35.799> get<00:02:36.220> your<00:02:36.459> bangs<00:02:36.640> worth<00:02:36.970> for<00:02:37.870> that

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.930 
you place the c-4 it will give you the
c4<00:03:20.349> controller<00:03:20.739> and<00:03:20.979> all<00:03:21.069> you<00:03:21.159> have<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.370> do<00:03:21.519> is

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
c4 controller and all you have to do is

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.149 
c4 controller and all you have to do is
tap<00:03:22.329> the<00:03:22.389> ground<00:03:22.780> with<00:03:23.229> the<00:03:23.349> c-4<00:03:23.739> controller

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 
tap the ground with the c-4 controller

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.089 
tap the ground with the c-4 controller
and<00:03:24.430> it<00:03:24.760> will<00:03:24.970> blow<00:03:25.269> up<00:03:25.569> a<00:03:25.750> massive<00:03:26.409> chunk<00:03:26.919> of

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
and it will blow up a massive chunk of

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.129 
and it will blow up a massive chunk of
Earth<00:03:27.250> where<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:27.909> c4<00:03:28.329> was<00:03:28.569> so<00:03:28.810> I<00:03:28.840> know<00:03:28.959> you

guys are wondering well how much can you
actually<00:03:32.049> blow<00:03:32.409> up<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:32.799> we're<00:03:32.979> gonna<00:03:33.129> test

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
actually blow up and we're gonna test

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.339 
actually blow up and we're gonna test
that<00:03:33.699> today<00:03:34.090> so<00:03:34.329> I<00:03:34.359> actually<00:03:34.690> haven't<00:03:35.019> tested

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
that today so I actually haven't tested

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.830 
that today so I actually haven't tested

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
this but I want to see ah it doesn't

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.960 
this but I want to see ah it doesn't
work<00:03:38.199> not<00:03:38.650> in<00:03:38.829> a<00:03:38.889> stack<00:03:39.159> you<00:03:39.310> can't<00:03:39.579> stack<00:03:39.819> it

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
work not in a stack you can't stack it

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.909 
work not in a stack you can't stack it
well<00:03:40.090> let<00:03:40.209> me<00:03:40.239> try<00:03:40.510> let<00:03:40.870> me<00:03:40.900> try<00:03:40.959> unfortunately

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
well let me try let me try unfortunately

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.920 
well let me try let me try unfortunately
I<00:03:41.949> found<00:03:42.430> out<00:03:42.609> that<00:03:43.269> you<00:03:43.449> can't<00:03:43.750> actually

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
I found out that you can't actually

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.599 
I found out that you can't actually
place<00:03:44.260> more<00:03:44.590> than<00:03:44.620> one<00:03:44.919> at<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.129> time<00:03:45.340> so<00:03:45.579> you

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
place more than one at a time so you

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:47.729 
place more than one at a time so you
don't<00:03:45.790> have<00:03:45.849> to<00:03:45.970> blow<00:03:46.150> that<00:03:46.329> one<00:03:46.540> up<00:03:46.569> and<00:03:46.930> yeah

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
don't have to blow that one up and yeah

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.379 
don't have to blow that one up and yeah
it's<00:03:47.979> it's<00:03:48.280> a<00:03:48.400> little<00:03:48.699> bit<00:03:48.790> annoying<00:03:48.940> but<00:03:49.239> you

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
it's it's a little bit annoying but you

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.210 
it's it's a little bit annoying but you
can<00:03:49.569> place<00:03:49.780> one<00:03:50.019> down<00:03:50.199> and<00:03:50.409> it's<00:03:51.010> quick

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
can place one down and it's quick

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.770 
can place one down and it's quick
succession<00:03:51.639> so<00:03:52.000> you<00:03:52.090> can<00:03:52.269> blow<00:03:52.449> up<00:03:52.540> a<00:03:52.629> little

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
succession so you can blow up a little

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.569 
succession so you can blow up a little
bit<00:03:52.959> more<00:03:53.109> but<00:03:53.440> unfortunately<00:03:53.709> you<00:03:54.340> can't

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
bit more but unfortunately you can't

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.189 
bit more but unfortunately you can't
have<00:03:54.729> more<00:03:54.970> than<00:03:55.030> one<00:03:55.180> down<00:03:55.540> at<00:03:55.659> once<00:03:55.810> I'll<00:03:55.989> try

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:56.199 
have more than one down at once I'll try

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:58.199 
have more than one down at once I'll try
that<00:03:56.229> with<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.859> timed<00:03:57.220> one<00:03:57.549> let's<00:03:57.939> see<00:03:58.090> if

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
that with the timed one let's see if

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.219 
that with the timed one let's see if
that<00:03:58.389> makes<00:03:58.629> a<00:03:58.780> difference<00:03:58.810> yeah

00:03:59.219 --> 00:03:59.229 
that makes a difference yeah

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:01.589 
that makes a difference yeah
unfortunately<00:03:59.579> again<00:04:00.579> you<00:04:01.000> can't<00:04:01.269> actually

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
unfortunately again you can't actually

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.439 
unfortunately again you can't actually
time<00:04:02.260> up<00:04:02.590> more<00:04:02.979> than<00:04:03.129> one<00:04:03.370> c4<00:04:03.879> so<00:04:04.120> I<00:04:04.150> guess

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:04.449 
time up more than one c4 so I guess

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:06.509 
time up more than one c4 so I guess
that's<00:04:04.629> good<00:04:04.930> as<00:04:05.199> far<00:04:05.650> as<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:05.859> lag<00:04:06.189> goes

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
that's good as far as the lag goes

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.099 
that's good as far as the lag goes
unfortunately<00:04:07.329> you<00:04:07.419> can't<00:04:07.659> just<00:04:07.870> blow<00:04:08.079> up

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
unfortunately you can't just blow up

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:09.960 
unfortunately you can't just blow up
your<00:04:08.319> whole<00:04:08.470> world<00:04:08.739> which<00:04:09.340> I<00:04:09.489> know<00:04:09.549> some<00:04:09.819> of
