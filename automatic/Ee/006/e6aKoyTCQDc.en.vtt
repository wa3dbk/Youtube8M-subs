00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
traps where white can fall into and

in this position which is Knight g6 so

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.950 
in this position which is Knight g6 so
yeah<00:01:47.979> I'm<00:01:48.100> going<00:01:48.280> to<00:01:48.550> go<00:01:48.820> over<00:01:48.850> two<00:01:49.630> variations

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
yeah I'm going to go over two variations

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.600 
yeah I'm going to go over two variations
today<00:01:50.590> which<00:01:50.860> is<00:01:51.030> Queen<00:01:52.030> d4<00:01:52.900> or<00:01:54.720> Queen<00:01:55.720> a3

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
today which is Queen d4 or Queen a3

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.330 
today which is Queen d4 or Queen a3
slightly<00:01:57.610> sharper<00:01:58.330> but<00:01:58.720> also<00:01:59.350> as<00:01:59.890> good<00:02:00.159> as

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
slightly sharper but also as good as

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.859 
slightly sharper but also as good as
Queen<00:02:00.670> d4<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:03.940> first<00:02:04.180> variation<00:02:04.450> we're

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
Queen d4 so the first variation we're

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.630 
Queen d4 so the first variation we're
going<00:02:05.080> to<00:02:05.229> look<00:02:05.350> at<00:02:05.500> is<00:02:05.680> Queen<00:02:06.670> d4<00:02:07.509> and<00:02:08.640> this

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
going to look at is Queen d4 and this

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.750 
going to look at is Queen d4 and this
this<00:02:10.270> move<00:02:10.539> protects<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.470> knight<00:02:11.620> on<00:02:11.650> e5<00:02:12.340> and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
this move protects the knight on e5 and

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.110 
this move protects the knight on e5 and
also<00:02:13.390> puts<00:02:14.380> pressure<00:02:14.680> on<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:15.040> knight<00:02:15.310> on<00:02:15.459> e4<00:02:15.880> and

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
also puts pressure on a knight on e4 and

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.990 
also puts pressure on a knight on e4 and
the<00:02:16.239> mainline<00:02:16.630> goes<00:02:16.930> with<00:02:17.260> Queen<00:02:18.040> f6<00:02:18.610> and

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
the mainline goes with Queen f6 and

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.600 
the mainline goes with Queen f6 and
after<00:02:19.420> Queen<00:02:20.230> takes<00:02:20.440> e4<00:02:21.630> Queen<00:02:22.630> takes<00:02:22.870> e5<00:02:23.610> we

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
after Queen takes e4 Queen takes e5 we

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.500 
after Queen takes e4 Queen takes e5 we
get<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.940> exchange<00:02:25.510> where<00:02:26.760> White<00:02:27.760> has<00:02:28.150> a<00:02:28.180> nice

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
get the exchange where White has a nice

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.170 
get the exchange where White has a nice
space<00:02:28.840> advantage<00:02:29.260> which<00:02:29.950> can<00:02:30.340> be<00:02:30.489> crucial<00:02:30.760> to

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
space advantage which can be crucial to

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.130 
space advantage which can be crucial to
the<00:02:31.420> endgame<00:02:31.630> and<00:02:31.959> see<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.709> year<00:02:32.920> with<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.430> 92

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
the endgame and see a year with the 92

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.280 
the endgame and see a year with the 92
94<00:02:35.340> move<00:02:36.340> order<00:02:36.790> we<00:02:37.269> are<00:02:37.360> now<00:02:37.510> eliminating<00:02:38.140> one

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
94 move order we are now eliminating one

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.410 
94 move order we are now eliminating one
of<00:02:38.320> black's<00:02:38.620> pieces<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.400> it's<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.239> nice

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
of black's pieces and it's a nice

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.210 
of black's pieces and it's a nice
position<00:02:40.989> forward<00:02:41.230> with<00:02:41.500> a<00:02:41.620> nice<00:02:41.829> small

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
position forward with a nice small

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.380 
position forward with a nice small
advantage<00:02:43.049> so<00:02:44.400> it's<00:02:45.400> important<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.030> note<00:02:46.360> that

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
advantage so it's important to note that

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.390 
advantage so it's important to note that
after<00:02:46.959> Queen<00:02:47.440> d4<00:02:47.980> other<00:02:48.970> moves<00:02:49.540> such<00:02:49.930> as

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
after Queen d4 other moves such as

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.100 
after Queen d4 other moves such as
Knight<00:02:52.090> d6<00:02:52.930> can<00:02:53.909> give<00:02:54.909> white<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.390> nice<00:02:55.659> big

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
Knight d6 can give white a nice big

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.770 
Knight d6 can give white a nice big
advantage<00:02:56.739> since<00:02:57.579> the<00:02:57.879> pawn<00:02:58.090> structure<00:02:58.480> will

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
advantage since the pawn structure will

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.720 
advantage since the pawn structure will
be<00:02:58.810> damaged<00:02:59.290> and<00:02:59.739> blacks<00:03:00.510> D<00:03:01.510> pawn<00:03:01.840> is<00:03:02.170> now

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
be damaged and blacks D pawn is now

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.330 
be damaged and blacks D pawn is now
blocked<00:03:03.730> by<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.150> knight<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.689> the<00:03:05.069> bones<00:03:06.069> are

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
blocked by the knight and the bones are

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.940 
blocked by the knight and the bones are
doubled<00:03:06.760> and<00:03:07.829> also<00:03:08.829> other<00:03:09.340> moves<00:03:10.209> such<00:03:10.540> as

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
doubled and also other moves such as

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.599 
doubled and also other moves such as
Knight<00:03:11.950> takes<00:03:12.280> e5<00:03:12.780> now<00:03:13.780> white<00:03:14.530> space<00:03:15.099> move<00:03:15.430> in

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
Knight takes e5 now white space move in

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.509 
Knight takes e5 now white space move in
this<00:03:15.730> position<00:03:15.790> is<00:03:16.450> not<00:03:16.750> Queen<00:03:17.739> taxi<00:03:18.220> five

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
this position is not Queen taxi five

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.210 
this position is not Queen taxi five
because<00:03:19.420> it<00:03:19.450> will<00:03:19.750> lead<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:19.959> Queen<00:03:20.620> e7<00:03:21.069> and

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
because it will lead to Queen e7 and

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.140 
because it will lead to Queen e7 and
white<00:03:21.760> is<00:03:22.569> forced<00:03:23.049> to<00:03:23.140> exchange<00:03:23.440> Queens<00:03:24.150> sense

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
white is forced to exchange Queens sense

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.960 
white is forced to exchange Queens sense
if<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:25.959> Queen<00:03:26.200> moves<00:03:26.440> nasty<00:03:27.400> discovered

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
if the Queen moves nasty discovered

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.809 
if the Queen moves nasty discovered
chicks<00:03:28.359> or<00:03:28.629> white<00:03:28.870> White's<00:03:29.409> King<00:03:29.739> so<00:03:30.549> if<00:03:30.670> the

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
chicks or white White's King so if the

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.720 
chicks or white White's King so if the
Queen<00:03:31.090> takes<00:03:31.709> bishop<00:03:32.709> tags<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.190> now<00:03:33.459> if<00:03:33.609> you

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
Queen takes bishop tags and now if you

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.479 
Queen takes bishop tags and now if you
look<00:03:33.760> at<00:03:34.000> this<00:03:34.120> position<00:03:34.690> black<00:03:35.409> has<00:03:35.829> to

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
look at this position black has to

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.089 
look at this position black has to
develop<00:03:36.909> pieces<00:03:37.269> to<00:03:37.870> whites<00:03:38.079> none<00:03:38.379> so

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
develop pieces to whites none so

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.509 
develop pieces to whites none so
therefore<00:03:39.720> it's<00:03:40.720> not<00:03:40.870> Queen<00:03:41.319> takes<00:03:41.560> e5<00:03:41.980> but

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
therefore it's not Queen takes e5 but

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.929 
therefore it's not Queen takes e5 but
rather<00:03:42.760> Queen<00:03:43.180> takes<00:03:43.389> e4<00:03:43.959> and<00:03:45.000> of<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.959> Queen

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:47.939 
rather Queen takes e4 and of the Queen

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:52.410 
rather Queen takes e4 and of the Queen
e7<00:03:49.590> Bishop<00:03:50.590> e3<00:03:50.859> is<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.310> nice<00:03:51.609> flexible<00:03:52.060> move

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
e7 Bishop e3 is a nice flexible move

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.869 
e7 Bishop e3 is a nice flexible move
which<00:03:52.810> we<00:03:53.019> will<00:03:53.200> see<00:03:53.409> in<00:03:53.530> later<00:03:53.560> parts<00:03:54.189> in

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
which we will see in later parts in

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.530 
which we will see in later parts in
almost<00:03:55.239> all<00:03:55.660> variations<00:03:56.319> the<00:03:57.099> bishop<00:03:57.489> on<00:03:57.699> c1

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
almost all variations the bishop on c1

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.319 
almost all variations the bishop on c1
is<00:03:58.690> going<00:03:58.930> to<00:03:59.049> come<00:03:59.260> to<00:03:59.500> III<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:00.549> just<00:04:01.030> a<00:04:01.180> nice

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
is going to come to III and just a nice

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:06.539 
is going to come to III and just a nice
little<00:04:01.780> move<00:04:01.959> a<00:04:02.579> flexible<00:04:03.579> move<00:04:04.290> so<00:04:05.290> yeah<00:04:06.220> a

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
little move a flexible move so yeah a

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.449 
little move a flexible move so yeah a
good<00:04:07.060> variation<00:04:07.359> for<00:04:08.139> white<00:04:08.530> to<00:04:08.919> go<00:04:09.159> through

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
good variation for white to go through

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.180 
good variation for white to go through
and<00:04:09.699> it<00:04:10.090> has<00:04:10.120> lots<00:04:10.569> of<00:04:10.810> potential

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
and it has lots of potential

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.710 
and it has lots of potential
so<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.310> second<00:04:14.670> variation<00:04:14.880> we<00:04:15.270> are<00:04:15.390> going<00:04:15.600> to

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
so the second variation we are going to

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.300 
so the second variation we are going to
look<00:04:15.900> at<00:04:16.110> is<00:04:16.970> Queen<00:04:17.970> f3<00:04:18.959> putting<00:04:19.769> pressure<00:04:20.040> on

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
look at is Queen f3 putting pressure on

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.120 
look at is Queen f3 putting pressure on
the<00:04:20.459> knight<00:04:20.670> and<00:04:21.440> developing<00:04:22.440> a<00:04:22.590> queen<00:04:22.890> and

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
the knight and developing a queen and

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.450 
the knight and developing a queen and
putting<00:04:23.460> more<00:04:23.820> pressure<00:04:24.060> on<00:04:24.890> f7<00:04:25.890> so

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
putting more pressure on f7 so

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.730 
putting more pressure on f7 so
white/black<00:04:27.390> has<00:04:27.570> two<00:04:27.810> main<00:04:28.020> options<00:04:28.470> here

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
white/black has two main options here

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.800 
white/black has two main options here
queen<00:04:29.220> e7<00:04:30.120> or<00:04:30.300> Knight<00:04:31.110> f3<00:04:31.580> f6<00:04:32.580> which<00:04:32.820> I<00:04:33.630> won't

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
queen e7 or Knight f3 f6 which I won't

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.910 
queen e7 or Knight f3 f6 which I won't
be<00:04:33.990> covering<00:04:34.550> because<00:04:35.550> after<00:04:36.180> Knight<00:04:36.360> f6

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
be covering because after Knight f6

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.740 
be covering because after Knight f6
white<00:04:37.920> can<00:04:38.160> simply<00:04:38.580> capture<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.270> knight<00:04:39.450> and

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
white can simply capture the knight and

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.200 
white can simply capture the knight and
double<00:04:40.710> black<00:04:40.920> spawns<00:04:41.280> leaving<00:04:41.760> room<00:04:41.910> with<00:04:42.090> a

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
double black spawns leaving room with a

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.180 
double black spawns leaving room with a
nice<00:04:42.360> space<00:04:42.660> advantage<00:04:43.230> and<00:04:43.500> bone<00:04:43.830> structure

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
nice space advantage and bone structure

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:51.170 
nice space advantage and bone structure
so<00:04:45.170> after<00:04:46.940> Queen<00:04:47.940> is<00:04:48.180> 3<00:04:49.460> flex<00:04:50.460> pay<00:04:50.760> deposit

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
so after Queen is 3 flex pay deposit

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.990 
so after Queen is 3 flex pay deposit
beta<00:04:52.110> move<00:04:52.920> is<00:04:53.250> best<00:04:54.030> movies<00:04:54.480> Queen<00:04:55.020> e7<00:04:55.800> and<00:04:56.000> y

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
beta move is best movies Queen e7 and y

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.720 
beta move is best movies Queen e7 and y
can<00:04:57.270> continue<00:04:57.810> with<00:04:58.020> Queen<00:04:58.650> takes<00:04:58.830> e4<00:04:59.310> and<00:04:59.520> we

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
can continue with Queen takes e4 and we

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.550 
can continue with Queen takes e4 and we
can<00:04:59.940> transpose<00:05:00.480> into<00:05:00.840> the<00:05:01.200> earlier

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
can transpose into the earlier

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.190 
can transpose into the earlier
variations<00:05:02.220> where<00:05:03.000> White<00:05:03.420> has<00:05:03.690> a<00:05:03.720> lead<00:05:04.020> in

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
variations where White has a lead in

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.710 
variations where White has a lead in
development<00:05:04.710> Oh

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
development Oh

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.230 
development Oh
y<00:05:07.320> can<00:05:07.380> simply<00:05:08.340> play<00:05:09.260> Knight<00:05:10.260> takes<00:05:11.060> g6<00:05:12.060> and

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
y can simply play Knight takes g6 and

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.180 
y can simply play Knight takes g6 and
now<00:05:12.390> just<00:05:12.630> black<00:05:12.840> has<00:05:13.080> no<00:05:13.110> discovered<00:05:13.919> attack

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
now just black has no discovered attack

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.620 
now just black has no discovered attack
on<00:05:14.370> the<00:05:14.460> King<00:05:14.669> since<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.210> knight<00:05:15.390> will

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
on the King since the knight will

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:16.760 
on the King since the knight will
capture<00:05:16.080> the<00:05:16.350> Queen

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
capture the Queen

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.430 
capture the Queen
so<00:05:17.220> after<00:05:17.580> H<00:05:17.760> takes<00:05:18.230> now<00:05:19.230> white<00:05:20.160> can<00:05:20.190> play<00:05:20.460> the

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
so after H takes now white can play the

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.890
