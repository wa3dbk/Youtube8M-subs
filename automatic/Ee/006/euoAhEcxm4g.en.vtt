Stairmaster<00:00:49.840> alright<00:00:50.840> so<00:00:50.989> my<00:00:51.110> cardio<00:00:51.470> tip<00:00:51.680> for

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
Stairmaster alright so my cardio tip for

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.160 
Stairmaster alright so my cardio tip for
you<00:00:51.980> guys<00:00:52.190> is<00:00:53.440> track<00:00:54.440> your<00:00:54.649> cardio<00:00:56.170> by

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
you guys is track your cardio by

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.160 
you guys is track your cardio by
calories<00:00:58.040> burned<00:00:58.340> versus<00:00:59.180> by<00:00:59.660> time<00:01:00.790> now<00:01:02.170> it's

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
calories burned versus by time now it's

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.960 
calories burned versus by time now it's
going<00:01:03.410> to<00:01:03.440> be<00:01:03.620> more<00:01:03.800> accurate<00:01:04.070> doing<00:01:04.670> it<00:01:04.790> that

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
going to be more accurate doing it that

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:16.080 
going to be more accurate doing it that
way<00:01:05.740> because<00:01:07.060> of<00:01:08.060> a<00:01:08.240> couple<00:01:08.539> reasons<00:01:09.789> one

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.960 

there's<00:01:17.090> going<00:01:17.240> to<00:01:17.300> be<00:01:17.360> variants<00:01:17.899> if<00:01:17.990> you

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
there's going to be variants if you

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.270 
there's going to be variants if you
calculated<00:01:19.970> by<00:01:20.179> time<00:01:20.479> let's<00:01:21.229> for<00:01:21.649> example<00:01:21.679> 30

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
calculated by time let's for example 30

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.109 
calculated by time let's for example 30
minutes<00:01:22.640> say<00:01:22.959> you're<00:01:23.959> set<00:01:24.170> to<00:01:24.200> do<00:01:24.350> 30<00:01:24.619> minutes

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
minutes say you're set to do 30 minutes

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.990 
minutes say you're set to do 30 minutes
all<00:01:26.119> right<00:01:26.240> 30<00:01:26.479> minutes<00:01:26.840> is<00:01:26.959> going<00:01:27.080> to<00:01:27.170> vary

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
all right 30 minutes is going to vary

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.790 
all right 30 minutes is going to vary
based<00:01:29.000> on<00:01:29.149> your<00:01:29.270> intensity<00:01:29.690> in<00:01:29.990> type<00:01:30.590> of

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
based on your intensity in type of

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.380 
based on your intensity in type of
cardio

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.080 

yeah<00:01:38.390> so<00:01:38.660> 30<00:01:39.320> minutes<00:01:39.620> on<00:01:39.680> a<00:01:39.710> Stairmaster

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
yeah so 30 minutes on a Stairmaster

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.090 
yeah so 30 minutes on a Stairmaster
versus<00:01:41.090> 30<00:01:41.510> minutes<00:01:41.870> walking<00:01:42.500> on<00:01:42.590> an<00:01:42.710> incline

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
versus 30 minutes walking on an incline

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.260 
versus 30 minutes walking on an incline
on<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.400> treadmill<00:01:44.000> is<00:01:44.630> going<00:01:44.990> to<00:01:45.050> be

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
on the treadmill is going to be

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.600 
on the treadmill is going to be
different<00:01:47.890> you're<00:01:48.890> most<00:01:49.040> likely<00:01:49.340> going<00:01:49.550> to

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
different you're most likely going to

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.980 
different you're most likely going to
burn<00:01:50.470> more<00:01:51.470> calories<00:01:51.800> in<00:01:52.340> less<00:01:53.240> time<00:01:53.510> on<00:01:53.810> the

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
burn more calories in less time on the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.010 
burn more calories in less time on the
Stairmaster<00:01:54.620> because<00:01:55.310> it's<00:01:55.460> more<00:01:55.700> intense

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
Stairmaster because it's more intense

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.460 
Stairmaster because it's more intense
takes<00:01:57.020> more<00:01:57.230> effort<00:01:58.300> all<00:01:59.300> right<00:01:59.420> so<00:01:59.690> for

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
takes more effort all right so for

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.010 
takes more effort all right so for
instance<00:02:01.210> you're<00:02:02.210> probably<00:02:02.510> going<00:02:02.750> to<00:02:02.810> hit

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
instance you're probably going to hit

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.320 
instance you're probably going to hit
you<00:02:03.560> know<00:02:03.790> thread<00:02:04.790> your<00:02:04.820> calories<00:02:05.150> on<00:02:05.270> the

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
you know thread your calories on the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.840 
you know thread your calories on the
Stairmaster<00:02:05.840> Stairmaster<00:02:06.590> in<00:02:06.770> 30<00:02:07.610> minutes

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
Stairmaster Stairmaster in 30 minutes

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.450 
Stairmaster Stairmaster in 30 minutes
and<00:02:10.930> 30<00:02:11.930> minutes<00:02:12.260> on<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.410> treadmill<00:02:12.980> you're

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
and 30 minutes on the treadmill you're

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.360 
and 30 minutes on the treadmill you're
probably<00:02:13.610> about<00:02:13.820> hit<00:02:14.120> about<00:02:14.450> maybe<00:02:14.660> 250<00:02:15.370> does

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
probably about hit about maybe 250 does

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.430 
probably about hit about maybe 250 does
that<00:02:16.490> make<00:02:16.640> sense<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:19.730> if<00:02:19.940> you<00:02:20.060> track<00:02:20.450> your

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
that make sense so if you track your

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:29.980 
that make sense so if you track your
cardio<00:02:21.860> by<00:02:24.040> calories<00:02:25.060> versus<00:02:28.390> time<00:02:29.390> it's

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
cardio by calories versus time it's

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.480 
cardio by calories versus time it's
going<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.200> be<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:30.320> lot<00:02:30.440> more<00:02:30.500> accurate<00:02:31.100> you're

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
going to be a lot more accurate you're

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.190 
going to be a lot more accurate you're
going<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.670> be<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.790> lot<00:02:32.210> more<00:02:32.270> consistent<00:02:33.020> in

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
going to be a lot more consistent in

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:42.479 
going to be a lot more consistent in
your<00:02:33.230> program<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:38.800> if<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.940> don't<00:02:41.180> already

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489
