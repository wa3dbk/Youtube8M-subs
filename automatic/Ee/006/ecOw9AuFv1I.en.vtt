been working on this for three or four
years<00:00:01.770> and<00:00:01.979> just<00:00:02.939> some<00:00:03.570> things<00:00:04.110> I'd<00:00:04.230> like<00:00:04.290> to

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
show you these are sets up a four gig

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.650 
show you these are sets up a four gig
ram<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.680> their<00:00:08.099> tunnels<00:00:08.510> three<00:00:09.510> of<00:00:09.599> the

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
ram and their tunnels three of the

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.589 
ram and their tunnels three of the
tunnels<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.200> by<00:00:11.070> doing<00:00:11.309> so<00:00:11.429> you<00:00:12.179> create<00:00:12.360> an

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
tunnels and by doing so you create an

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.609 
tunnels and by doing so you create an
area<00:00:12.780> in<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.049> middle<00:00:13.349> which<00:00:13.710> can<00:00:13.920> be<00:00:13.980> used<00:00:14.160> for

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:15.619 
area in the middle which can be used for

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.810 
area in the middle which can be used for
socializing<00:00:16.619> we've<00:00:17.010> put<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.220> table<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.609> chairs

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
socializing we've put a table and chairs

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.290 
socializing we've put a table and chairs
to<00:00:17.970> give<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.150> an<00:00:18.480> idea<00:00:18.600> where<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.050> works<00:00:20.300> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
to give you an idea where that works the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.060 
to give you an idea where that works the
ground<00:00:21.750> chief<00:00:21.990> on<00:00:22.170> each<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.560> teepees<00:00:22.920> is

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
ground chief on each of the teepees is

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.849 
ground chief on each of the teepees is
sewn<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.970> fly<00:00:24.269> sheet<00:00:24.510> it's<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.560> really

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
sewn in to the fly sheet it's a really

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.580 
sewn in to the fly sheet it's a really
easy<00:00:25.920> put<00:00:26.279> together<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.779> partly<00:00:28.260> Patti

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
easy put together this is partly Patti

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.400 
easy put together this is partly Patti
we<00:00:28.980> have<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.570> eliminates<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.199> pole

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
we have and this eliminates a pole

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.620 
we have and this eliminates a pole
through<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.740> middle<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.099> tent<00:00:32.630> which

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
through the middle of the tent which

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.990 
through the middle of the tent which
gives<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.170> much<00:00:34.350> more<00:00:34.380> space<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.700> stays

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
gives you much more space and that stays

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.490 
gives you much more space and that stays
in<00:00:36.180> all<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.360> time<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.780> basically<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.320> takes

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
in all the time so basically it takes

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.810 
in all the time so basically it takes
about<00:00:37.620> eight<00:00:37.950> minutes<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.370> put<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.640> tape

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
about eight minutes to put the tape

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.180 
about eight minutes to put the tape
together<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.899> just<00:00:39.930> feed<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.739> poles<00:00:40.980> into

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
together you just feed the poles into

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.610 
together you just feed the poles into
slings<00:00:41.489> here<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:42.510> kind<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.840> pops<00:00:43.050> yourself<00:00:43.410> out

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
slings here it kind of pops yourself out

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.190 
slings here it kind of pops yourself out
and<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.610> stand<00:00:44.940> up<00:00:45.090> take<00:00:45.480> down<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.840> corners

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
and you stand up take down the corners

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.000 
and you stand up take down the corners
there<00:00:47.039> extra<00:00:47.309> guide<00:00:47.489> ice<00:00:47.760> for<00:00:48.149> more<00:00:48.390> support

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
there extra guide ice for more support

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.029 
there extra guide ice for more support

perfectly into the PTP floor plan and

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.930 
perfectly into the PTP floor plan and
one<00:02:29.380> for<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.620> tunnel<00:02:29.920> as<00:02:30.010> well<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.700> reason<00:02:30.880> I

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
one for the tunnel as well the reason I

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.460 
one for the tunnel as well the reason I
say<00:02:31.090> this<00:02:31.120> is<00:02:31.300> because<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.720> tunnel<00:02:32.050> is<00:02:32.140> also<00:02:32.440> a

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
say this is because the tunnel is also a

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.800 
say this is because the tunnel is also a
standalone<00:02:32.950> tent<00:02:33.400> at<00:02:34.030> skylights<00:02:34.540> which<00:02:34.690> I'll

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
standalone tent at skylights which I'll

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.900 
standalone tent at skylights which I'll
show<00:02:34.959> you<00:02:34.989> should<00:02:35.290> be<00:02:35.470> on<00:02:36.010> each<00:02:36.040> chain<00:02:36.370> and

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
show you should be on each chain and

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.610 
show you should be on each chain and
doorway<00:02:37.480> so<00:02:37.780> you<00:02:37.840> can<00:02:38.110> use<00:02:38.200> it<00:02:38.350> separately

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
doorway so you can use it separately

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.140 
doorway so you can use it separately
which<00:02:39.340> is<00:02:39.459> why<00:02:39.640> we're<00:02:39.820> sewing<00:02:40.000> them

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
which is why we're sewing them

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.780 
which is why we're sewing them
separately<00:02:40.600> as<00:02:40.690> well<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:42.250> connect<00:02:42.550> them<00:02:42.670> to

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
separately as well to connect them to

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.910 
separately as well to connect them to
the<00:02:42.880> tunnel<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.570> tent<00:02:43.810> rubber<00:02:44.020> it's<00:02:44.739> very

tie-downs at each end and the door each

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.100 
tie-downs at each end and the door each
end<00:03:12.549> which<00:03:13.090> once<00:03:13.420> again<00:03:13.630> they<00:03:13.750> can<00:03:13.930> both<00:03:14.080> be

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
end which once again they can both be

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.780 
end which once again they can both be
open<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.650> create<00:03:14.860> some<00:03:15.040> ventilation<00:03:15.580> through
