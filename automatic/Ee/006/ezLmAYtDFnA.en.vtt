man<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.840> I'm<00:01:30.840> kind<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.230> getting<00:01:31.320> used<00:01:31.440> to<00:01:31.770> it

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
man is I'm kind of getting used to it

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.970 
man is I'm kind of getting used to it
but<00:01:33.480> I<00:01:33.540> mean<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.870> is<00:01:34.050> like<00:01:34.080> so<00:01:34.620> slow<00:01:34.950> that

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
but I mean this is like so slow that

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.710 
but I mean this is like so slow that
like<00:01:35.250> regardless<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.820> how<00:01:35.910> used<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.540> get

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
like regardless of how used to it I get

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.130 
like regardless of how used to it I get
it's<00:01:36.930> still<00:01:37.170> not<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.380> practical<00:01:37.800> way<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.010> play<00:01:38.280> I

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
it's still not a practical way to play I

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.480 
it's still not a practical way to play I
think<00:01:40.140> seananners<00:01:40.560> only<00:01:40.890> plays<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.280> to

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
think seananners only plays on to

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:52.969 
think seananners only plays on to
sensitivity<00:01:43.340> which<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:45.200> medium

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.560 

why<00:01:53.979> did<00:01:54.159> I<00:01:54.220> trade<00:01:54.430> out<00:01:54.550> my<00:01:54.700> other<00:01:54.820> gun<00:01:55.090> I<00:01:55.360> just

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
why did I trade out my other gun I just

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.380 
why did I trade out my other gun I just
realized<00:01:55.930> that<00:01:56.140> that's<00:01:56.350> dumb<00:01:56.710> I<00:01:57.120> was<00:01:58.120> thinking

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
realized that that's dumb I was thinking

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.640 
realized that that's dumb I was thinking
for<00:01:58.510> a<00:01:58.540> second<00:01:58.780> like<00:01:58.840> I<00:01:58.930> can<00:01:59.080> upgrade<00:01:59.200> it<00:01:59.470> and

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
for a second like I can upgrade it and

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.410 
for a second like I can upgrade it and
use<00:01:59.979> the<00:02:00.010> the<00:02:00.520> pistols<00:02:00.940> but<00:02:01.090> there's<00:02:01.300> not<00:02:01.360> even

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
use the the pistols but there's not even

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.850 
use the the pistols but there's not even
a<00:02:01.660> doctor<00:02:01.810> flopper<00:02:02.350> so<00:02:02.530> that's<00:02:02.680> kind<00:02:02.830> of

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
a doctor flopper so that's kind of

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.990 
a doctor flopper so that's kind of
useless<00:02:04.680> as<00:02:05.680> far<00:02:05.890> as<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.130> shotgun<00:02:06.580> goes<00:02:06.790> I'm

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
useless as far as the shotgun goes I'm

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.400 
useless as far as the shotgun goes I'm
definitely<00:02:07.270> going<00:02:07.630> to<00:02:07.720> be<00:02:07.780> carrying<00:02:08.110> this<00:02:08.200> for

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
definitely going to be carrying this for

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.650 
definitely going to be carrying this for
a<00:02:08.440> long<00:02:08.590> time<00:02:08.700> because<00:02:09.700> with<00:02:10.209> such<00:02:10.390> a<00:02:10.420> low

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
a long time because with such a low

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.310 
a long time because with such a low
sensitivity<00:02:11.070> like<00:02:12.600> it<00:02:13.600> should<00:02:13.780> I'm<00:02:13.900> this<00:02:14.230> is

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
sensitivity like it should I'm this is

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.150 
sensitivity like it should I'm this is
just<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.560> easiest<00:02:14.890> way<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.250> get<00:02:15.520> kills

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.550 

actually<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:21.190> could<00:02:21.400> go<00:02:21.550> to<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.480> last<00:02:22.660> guy

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560
