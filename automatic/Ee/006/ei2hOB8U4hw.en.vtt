00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hi to all the boys and welcome to the 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.430
 ming gay welcome south east in this one 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.529
 brand new review review dedicated 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.150
 to the arms of the prison of the elders 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.340
 the weapon we're going to see today 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.349
 will be the chain of orbitz fed that is the 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.089
 machine gun I have to tell you 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.350
 for me it was love at first sight for 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.330
 better to say with the first shot with 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.850
 this weapon simply because it has some 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.460
 fantastic statistics and arms hand 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.439
 you can't not play well 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.570
 you simply can't do it at all 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.760
 legendary available at the moment is 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.230
 without a doubt one of the best 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.759
 especially among those that will have i 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.980
 perk that you can't change 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.110
 analyzing the chain statistics of 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.239
 orbitz fair will have an empty type damage 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.070
 a very good high cadence almost at 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.290
 maximum a good impact not the best 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.420
 impact bomber all in all better than 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.489
 other machine guns a low range 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.440
 but honestly you will not notice 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.180
 of this range here and in brackets 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.980
 can also be increased by i 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.600
 because you will not notice it for the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.430
 simple reason that for types of 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.870
 weapons this machine gun and much from 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.210
 close range is not one of those 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.350
 machine gun you will use from 160 meters 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.510
 and you will use it in spaces enough 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.010
 tastes and on the earth a lot the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.869
 combination of two very parameters 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.210
 balanced such as damage ie 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.280
 impact and cadence at a stability 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.630
 monstrous cones because it can come almost 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.640
 at most a recharge time 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.560
 rather long then a refill 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.570
 quite slow with loaders of 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.189
 40 shots that after all are not 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.689
 just as small as the category of 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.580
 machine gun will tell you that a hybrid 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.380
 hybrid between type and corrective maneuver 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.390
 who shouted very high and going 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.159
 rather low and the zolder hammer 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.020
 with a lower rate but a damage 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.670
 much higher here is a 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.079
 the hybrid and for this reason together 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.909
 also very good stability of the 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.920
 shippers that all in all are good 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.659
 44 shots are not for nothing but ne 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.640
 consider a weapon to be used in the 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.470
 medium short range exploiting very well 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.299
 the cadence covered with snow and the lousy damage 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.130
 fairly large loaders e 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.329
 extreme stability just to give you 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.130
 some numbers even if you see it 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.290
 great from the background gameplay in 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.810
 head a blow to the head makes 49 damage 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.280
 then 4 5 shots kill anyone with and 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.750
 the ray that you have with stability that 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.939
 he finds himself not at all difficult 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.500
 quickly eliminate the enemies you are there 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.570
 they will stand in front of talking 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.579
 instead of perks as usual will be 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.049
 two main two under power ups 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.819
 but one of the two main ones 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.470
 we say that it is not really a reason 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.800
 very versatile because it will work 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.600
 only against 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.100
 fallen I do not know why with 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.540
 these weapons have decided to put it 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.850
 as the main reason why not ad 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.680
 example for a seaside tour in the case of 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.390
 weapons that rota worked as damage 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.240
 secondary as a secondary effect 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.960
 in any case the first because it will be 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.850
 counterbalancing that as an effect 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.010
 it will greatly increase stability 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.360
 the basic weapon is not so fantastic 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.130
 as I presented it to you earlier 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.300
 beginning of this video but I assure you 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.860
 than with this because as soon as it is 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.540
 you will already unlock will be love 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.430
 the other skill in my case is the multi 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.810
 who gives me a chance to 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.550
 suppress the skills of the captains 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.500
 fallen if I am not mistaken, however, this ability 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.990
 it can be different different by choosing 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.490
 one of the 56 I don't remember how many 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.920
 only abilities that only have effects on 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.170
 fallen you will not be the one to choose barix 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.790
 from selling with this because the last 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.770
 once he sold it next time 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.480
 which will probably sell it 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.950
 will have another because or taking the 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.280
 random package I don't remember the 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.080
 first name 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.000
 if you were to find this year you can 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.950
 find it with another bonus and now that there 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.690
 I don't even know if it varies 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.340
 I found the random package in 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.840
 in any case the speech does not change 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.820
 as for the two below 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.920
 upgrades as a first tip without 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.480
 doubtful ballistics fluid and true others 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.400
 two bonuses would increase both the impact 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.200
 that the range but frankly I prefer 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.400
 have a good stability with this 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.200
 roma I found myself much better 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.580
 focus on stability and use it from 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.230
 a medium short range rather than 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.940
 concentrate on the impact and on me 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.890
 cast and increase the range of use 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.780
 in this case, however, I tell you 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.190
 how you find yourself better if you prefer 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.690
 have a little impact and thrown in 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.700
 more at the expense of stability than 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.440
 however, Mr. stability remains 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.730
 nothing to say are personal choices of 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.230
 gameplay this is one of those rare cases 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.760
 where there is not really a bonus 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.739
 better but it depends on the user 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.690
 of the weapon in the second branch instead 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.030
 you can choose between the extended magazine 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.040
 which will admit the 44 57 charger 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.020
 hammer tanning strokes that will increase 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.150
 Throw accuracy really increase 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.890
 from time to time and finally adjusted cash 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.570
 increase the stability of the weapon in 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.050
 this case are all three excellent 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.000
 bonus 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.070
 I for example the car was established either 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.690
 with the cane as you have seen before you are 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.489
 with rectified cash because I like it 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.200
 having this stable weapon in place that 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.820
 it doesn't come down a millimeter though 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.380
 they are tastes because in the end it is 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.239
 It could also opt for the 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.040
 more balanced statistics and therefore 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.450
 opt for forcing a hammer so 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.280
 to have thrown that stability 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.840
 pretty good above average anyway 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.310
 and therefore there was not that established in 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.169
 more to have more statistics 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.580
 rather versatile and more balanced 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.229
 which to focus on 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.580
 the fluid ballistics that gives you the 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.439
 stability and loaders 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.610
 increased to have more shots from 

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:32.259
 shoot anyway have a good one 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.090
 stability agitated that is not really 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:36.069
 the maximum, however, of the loaders 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.840
 more capacious or finally do as 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:39.099
 I did it was all about instability 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.900
 stability however obviously the 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:42.460
 combination you choose choose it 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.810
 wisely and you will not use the 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.460
 you will have almost fluid ballistics 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.050
 compulsory to choose the case 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.430
 rectified because otherwise the 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.229
 stability of the Rome will really be 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.460
 too small this small 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.199
 example, however, the Rome will be just fine 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.030
 with almost any combination you 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.729
 you will do as long as it is made with logic 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.289
 in conclusion a fantastic advice weapon 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.180
 anyone to buy it from various xvi 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.770
 as soon as it will be available without a doubt 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.780
 of the best machine guns present 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.310
 in destiny very versatile and that you can 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.930
 adapt to different styles of play 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.819
 so guys with regards to the 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.810
 orbitz file chain is all like at 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:12.490
