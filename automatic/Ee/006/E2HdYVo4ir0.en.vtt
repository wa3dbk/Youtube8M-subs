00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
they be good or bad they can they can

they be good or bad they can they can
spread<00:01:34.570> around<00:01:34.689> and<00:01:35.049> so<00:01:35.170> it's<00:01:35.350> kind<00:01:35.530> of<00:01:35.560> good

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740

abilities and they didn't like that they
didn't<00:03:06.069> want<00:03:06.280> that<00:03:06.519> because<00:03:07.120> they<00:03:07.360> wanted<00:03:07.569> to

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
didn't want that because they wanted to

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.870 
didn't want that because they wanted to
keep<00:03:07.810> it<00:03:07.930> old-school<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:08.799> so<00:03:09.340> I<00:03:09.370> think<00:03:09.489> that

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
keep it old-school and so I think that

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.430 
keep it old-school and so I think that
this<00:03:10.060> way<00:03:10.329> the<00:03:10.540> developers<00:03:11.019> are<00:03:11.170> sort<00:03:11.380> of

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
this way the developers are sort of

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.680 
this way the developers are sort of
catering<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.579> boast<00:03:12.790> audiences<00:03:13.480> they're

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
catering to boast audiences they're

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:14.640 
catering to boast audiences they're
saying<00:03:13.930> you<00:03:14.019> know<00:03:14.110> what<00:03:14.140> if<00:03:14.380> you<00:03:14.470> want

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
saying you know what if you want

saying you know what if you want
something<00:03:15.010> new<00:03:15.160> then<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:16.000> majority<00:03:16.390> the

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
something new then the majority the

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.839 
something new then the majority the
playlist<00:03:16.989> will<00:03:17.470> be<00:03:17.680> like<00:03:17.890> that<00:03:18.130> but<00:03:18.670> if<00:03:18.760> you

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
playlist will be like that but if you

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:20.339 
playlist will be like that but if you
don't<00:03:19.090> want<00:03:19.269> to<00:03:19.420> adapt<00:03:19.750> then<00:03:20.019> you<00:03:20.110> don't<00:03:20.290> have

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
bad thing about this game mode is a

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.250 
bad thing about this game mode is a
point<00:03:43.150> brought<00:03:43.329> up<00:03:43.450> by<00:03:43.569> thunder<00:03:43.930> and<00:03:44.019> i<00:03:44.049> felt

point brought up by thunder and i felt

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.229 
point brought up by thunder and i felt
that<00:03:44.350> it<00:03:44.440> was<00:03:44.530> a<00:03:44.560> pretty<00:03:44.739> valid<00:03:45.010> one<00:03:45.340> is<00:03:45.609> that

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
that it was a pretty valid one is that

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.569 
that it was a pretty valid one is that
this<00:03:46.510> game<00:03:46.810> and<00:03:47.109> these<00:03:47.260> maps<00:03:47.620> are<00:03:47.859> based

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
this game and these maps are based

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.400 
this game and these maps are based
around<00:03:48.819> the<00:03:49.150> exosuit<00:03:49.870> they're<00:03:50.109> not<00:03:50.200> like<00:03:50.380> a

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
around the exosuit they're not like a

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.740 
around the exosuit they're not like a
normal<00:03:50.500> call<00:03:50.980> duty<00:03:51.190> map<00:03:51.459> where<00:03:52.060> you<00:03:52.209> have<00:03:52.420> only

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
normal call duty map where you have only

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.140 
normal call duty map where you have only
one<00:03:53.079> level<00:03:53.700> verticality<00:03:54.700> I<00:03:54.819> might<00:03:55.000> as<00:03:55.060> well

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
one level verticality I might as well

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.849 
one level verticality I might as well
throw<00:03:55.239> that<00:03:55.480> word<00:03:55.630> in<00:03:55.810> there<00:03:55.989> because<00:03:56.530> it

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
throw that word in there because it

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:58.110 
throw that word in there because it
seems<00:03:57.040> like<00:03:57.130> during<00:03:57.430> the<00:03:57.459> reveal<00:03:57.790> that<00:03:57.970> was

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
seems like during the reveal that was

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.150 
seems like during the reveal that was
the<00:03:58.209> only<00:03:58.359> word<00:03:58.660> in<00:03:58.750> their<00:03:58.900> vocabulary<00:03:59.160> that

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
the only word in their vocabulary that

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.360 
the only word in their vocabulary that
was<00:04:00.220> above<00:04:00.489> like<00:04:00.760> four<00:04:01.090> syllables<00:04:01.569> so<00:04:02.370> yeah

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
was above like four syllables so yeah

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.069 
was above like four syllables so yeah
usually<00:04:03.549> called<00:04:04.060> lady<00:04:04.239> maps<00:04:04.450> are<00:04:04.599> you<00:04:04.989> know

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
usually called lady maps are you know

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.539 
usually called lady maps are you know
one<00:04:05.260> or<00:04:05.410> two<00:04:05.500> levels<00:04:05.859> but<00:04:06.010> if<00:04:06.130> you're<00:04:06.280> playing

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
one or two levels but if you're playing

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.640 
one or two levels but if you're playing
in<00:04:06.849> advanced<00:04:07.540> warfare<00:04:07.870> I<00:04:07.930> think<00:04:08.230> it<00:04:08.380> would<00:04:08.470> be

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
in advanced warfare I think it would be

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.729 
in advanced warfare I think it would be
more<00:04:08.889> multi-tiered<00:04:09.880> and<00:04:10.239> so<00:04:10.810> using<00:04:11.349> no

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
more multi-tiered and so using no

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.339 
more multi-tiered and so using no
exosuit<00:04:12.579> abilities<00:04:13.060> it<00:04:13.599> would<00:04:13.840> play<00:04:14.049> pretty

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
exosuit abilities it would play pretty

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:15.990 
exosuit abilities it would play pretty
slow<00:04:14.739> and<00:04:15.010> I<00:04:15.340> don't<00:04:15.489> really<00:04:15.579> think<00:04:15.669> it<00:04:15.940> would

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
slow and I don't really think it would

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.690 
slow and I don't really think it would
have<00:04:16.209> the<00:04:16.419> same<00:04:16.450> feel<00:04:17.380> to<00:04:17.620> it<00:04:17.650> but<00:04:18.489> like<00:04:18.579> i<00:04:18.669> said

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
have the same feel to it but like i said

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.029 
have the same feel to it but like i said
it<00:04:19.030> caters<00:04:19.359> to<00:04:19.479> both<00:04:19.570> audiences<00:04:19.959> i<00:04:20.440> might<00:04:21.010> try

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
it caters to both audiences i might try

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:22.680 
it caters to both audiences i might try
the<00:04:21.250> game<00:04:21.519> mode<00:04:21.669> out<00:04:21.820> if<00:04:21.940> I<00:04:22.060> don't<00:04:22.300> like<00:04:22.539> the

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
the game mode out if I don't like the

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.409 
the game mode out if I don't like the
exosuits<00:04:23.349> but<00:04:24.130> who<00:04:24.490> knows<00:04:24.669> only<00:04:24.910> time<00:04:25.180> will

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
exosuits but who knows only time will

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.420 
exosuits but who knows only time will
tell<00:04:25.450> and<00:04:25.930> I<00:04:26.260> think<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.950> majority<00:04:27.070> people

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
tell and I think the majority people

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.679 
tell and I think the majority people
still<00:04:27.789> play<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:28.060> normal<00:04:28.180> play

00:04:28.679 --> 00:04:28.689 
still play the normal play

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:30.539 
still play the normal play
but<00:04:29.289> for<00:04:29.439> the<00:04:29.529> few<00:04:29.769> who<00:04:29.979> don't<00:04:30.189> want<00:04:30.399> to

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:30.549 
but for the few who don't want to

00:04:30.549 --> 00:04:32.789 
but for the few who don't want to
migrate<00:04:30.819> over<00:04:31.269> to<00:04:31.389> the<00:04:31.479> exosuits<00:04:32.080> and<00:04:32.080> don't

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:32.799 
migrate over to the exosuits and don't

00:04:32.799 --> 00:04:34.679 
migrate over to the exosuits and don't
want<00:04:32.949> to<00:04:33.039> learn<00:04:33.159> them<00:04:33.459> they<00:04:34.029> still<00:04:34.330> have<00:04:34.539> that

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:34.689 
want to learn them they still have that

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:37.199

some<00:04:57.579> people<00:04:57.849> may<00:04:57.969> ask<00:04:58.179> why<00:04:58.419> you<00:04:58.479> play<00:04:58.689> kills

00:04:58.919 --> 00:04:58.929 
some people may ask why you play kills

00:04:58.929 --> 00:05:01.139 
some people may ask why you play kills
to<00:04:59.079> confirm<00:04:59.439> instead<00:04:59.769> of<00:04:59.860> TDM<00:05:00.249> and<00:05:00.549> the<00:05:00.999> reason

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:01.149 
to confirm instead of TDM and the reason

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:04.049 
to confirm instead of TDM and the reason
is<00:05:01.419> is<00:05:01.599> because<00:05:01.739> TDM<00:05:02.739> you<00:05:03.189> can<00:05:03.519> never<00:05:03.759> get

00:05:04.049 --> 00:05:04.059 
is is because TDM you can never get

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:05.939 
is is because TDM you can never get
streaks<00:05:04.419> unless<00:05:05.169> you<00:05:05.349> have<00:05:05.529> like<00:05:05.709> a<00:05:05.739> really

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
streaks unless you have like a really

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.609 
streaks unless you have like a really
good<00:05:06.610> team<00:05:06.849> and<00:05:07.059> really<00:05:07.209> bad<00:05:07.449> teammate<00:05:07.779> or<00:05:08.110> bad

00:05:08.609 --> 00:05:08.619 
good team and really bad teammate or bad

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:11.909 
good team and really bad teammate or bad
enemies<00:05:09.069> it's<00:05:09.369> almost<00:05:09.879> impossible<00:05:10.179> and<00:05:10.959> so

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
enemies it's almost impossible and so

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.949 
enemies it's almost impossible and so
I'd<00:05:12.429> like<00:05:12.489> to<00:05:12.669> see<00:05:12.819> arms<00:05:13.149> race<00:05:13.329> be<00:05:13.539> a<00:05:13.569> permanent

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:13.959 
I'd like to see arms race be a permanent

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:17.009 
I'd like to see arms race be a permanent
game<00:05:14.349> mode<00:05:14.619> or<00:05:15.069> at<00:05:15.189> least<00:05:15.309> change<00:05:15.669> TDM<00:05:16.119> to<00:05:16.329> 150

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:17.019 
game mode or at least change TDM to 150

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:18.719 
game mode or at least change TDM to 150
points<00:05:17.229> and<00:05:17.739> I<00:05:17.919> think<00:05:17.979> that<00:05:18.279> it<00:05:18.459> would<00:05:18.519> make<00:05:18.699> it

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
points and I think that it would make it

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:21.059 
points and I think that it would make it
more<00:05:18.999> fun<00:05:19.329> and<00:05:19.539> fast-paced<00:05:20.319> getting<00:05:20.889> more

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:21.069 
more fun and fast-paced getting more

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:23.129 
more fun and fast-paced getting more
scorestreaks<00:05:21.729> at<00:05:22.209> least<00:05:22.389> in<00:05:22.509> my<00:05:22.629> opinion<00:05:22.749> oh

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
scorestreaks at least in my opinion oh

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:24.869 
scorestreaks at least in my opinion oh
we<00:05:23.469> get<00:05:23.619> like<00:05:24.009> I'll<00:05:24.129> play<00:05:24.309> this<00:05:24.429> sniper<00:05:24.639> right
