00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.849
 we cook first course for two people 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.849
 very fast and practical we make 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.070
 fusilli in tonara sauce then what 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.310
 we need to make this fusilli dish 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.460
 very hard durum wheat semolina 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.890
 good then we will use tuna 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.300
 in oil of excellent quality a little 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.160
 chopped onion a teaspoon e 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.900
 enough a clove of garlic per 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.460
 give a bit of Rome 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.790
 inevitable parsley when there is the 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.550
 fish a little coarse salt oil 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.629
 extra virgin olive oil and double 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.239
 tomato concentrate 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.879
 then we begin to prepare the sauce 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.940
 actually I 've already thrown away the pasta 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.899
 in salt water it is already cooking 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.399
 then in a few minutes the will be ready 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.690
 today's salsa is really practical and 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.120
 fast 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.590
 we simply have to with a spoon 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.220
 of extra virgin olive oil add 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:09.600
 an onion tip so not too much 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:12.270
 just let it warm up to 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.520
 this point we add the double 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.330
 double tomato concentrate 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:24.869
 tomato paste from to this a 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:31.759
 this sauce color and structure we have 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:38.509
 two people then 4 tablespoons 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:42.000
 of concentrated pinch of salt 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:46.140
 well a clove of garlic then 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.360
 meanwhile we will remove the pasta and cook us 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.560
 we begin to prepare this sauce 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.740
 we stretch it I'm stretching it with a 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.429
 bit of vegetable broth but that's ok too 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.880
 the water the quantity 4 tablespoons then 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:06.030
 enough liquid to make more 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:10.019
 velvety the sauce because it is anyway 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.180
 concentrated then it must be diluted now 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.489
 mix all the ingredients first 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.340
 to add the tuna in oil 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:22.200
 right now we have a sauce made 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.579
 with practically cooked ingredients 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.379
 only two ingredients that do not cook 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:32.340
 we need them to flavor garlic sauce 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:35.340
 and the onion the pasta is cooking me 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.880
 I recommend cooking al dente 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:43.440
 in about a minute the pasta is ready 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.910
 we will have to dress it well 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.299
 tomato 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.599
 then add the tuna into pieces 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:55.330
 see very very fast we need it 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:03:00.480
 just boiling water 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:04.020
 beautiful pieces of tuna is already boiling 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.360
 let's see if the pasta is ready 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:13.150
 so we put it directly into the 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:15.130
 sauce to flavor beautiful because it is the 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.600
 sauce made with the double concentrate of 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:23.020
 tomato wrapped the pasta well, we said 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.680
 like all fish dishes 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.740
 we need the inevitable parsley and 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.560
 true I haven't chopped it yet though 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.350
 I can chop it quickly since the 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.260
 parsley for fish is better 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:45.220
 let it be a little coarse we have 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:47.380
 more flavor than rusticity that is that 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:53.160
 which we need for a fish for example 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.160
 like this a handful of parsley 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.489
 very well 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:05.569
 we mix well and prepare for 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.849
 implanting well we are ready to 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.629
 implanting of fusilli in tornar sauce 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.560
 we remember to remove the garlic 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.060
 we had put a clove of garlic there 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.150
 let us in until the last so 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.729
 leaves all its flavor good for 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.820
 avoid soiling the plate dishes 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:26.150
 warm is always remember the hot dish 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.479
 when we look at a few bits nor 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.760
 so here and there of tuna and I said for 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:35.090
 avoid getting dirty accompanies the 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.430
 scoop spoon travel of 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.110
 anything goes to the plate with a 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:43.729
 another saucer below that saves me 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:46.970
 the eventual beautiful enveloping sauce drops 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:49.639
 ideal for pasta and fast pasta 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:53.650
 practice look at fusilli with this 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.650
 fantastic perfect sauces
