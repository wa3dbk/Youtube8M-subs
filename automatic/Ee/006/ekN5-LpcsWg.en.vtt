00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
you set region to any this this works

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.630

room you can lag and the like will help
you<00:01:05.909> win<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:07.550> yeah<00:01:08.550> but<00:01:08.790> don't<00:01:09.060> set<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.840> rounds

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140

you win so yeah but don't set the rounds
to<00:01:10.259> one<00:01:10.470> set<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.550> to<00:01:11.670> five<00:01:12.140> this<00:01:13.140> works<00:01:13.409> because

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
to one set it to five this works because

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.950 
to one set it to five this works because
if<00:01:14.159> your<00:01:14.670> opponent<00:01:14.880> somehow<00:01:15.360> beats<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.869> in

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
if your opponent somehow beats you in

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.200

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.570 

and<00:02:36.350> again<00:02:36.620> we've<00:02:36.740> got<00:02:36.830> 10<00:02:37.010> seconds<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:37.370> choose

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
and again we've got 10 seconds to choose

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.000 
and again we've got 10 seconds to choose
a<00:02:37.610> map<00:02:37.820> so<00:02:39.130> deliberately<00:02:40.130> you<00:02:40.970> just<00:02:41.240> saw<00:02:41.860> go<00:02:42.860> on

a map so deliberately you just saw go on
every<00:02:43.430> map<00:02:43.640> thinking<00:02:44.390> about<00:02:44.570> which<00:02:44.780> one<00:02:44.960> to

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
every map thinking about which one to

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.770 
every map thinking about which one to
choose<00:02:45.970> but<00:02:46.970> I<00:02:47.030> mean<00:02:47.210> this<00:02:47.300> is<00:02:47.420> really<00:02:47.480> matter

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780

you just it's like an opponent again so
it's<00:02:50.360> chosen<00:02:50.540> jungle<00:02:51.020> for<00:02:51.200> us<00:02:52.810> now<00:02:53.810> it<00:02:53.900> looks

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
it's chosen jungle for us now it looks

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.620 
it's chosen jungle for us now it looks
like<00:02:54.170> we've<00:02:54.380> got<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:54.890> very<00:02:55.580> good<00:02:55.760> player<00:02:55.940> and

advanced form of newbury and now we

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.580 
advanced form of newbury and now we
can't<00:05:14.600> win<00:05:14.780> this<00:05:14.870> right<00:05:15.020> now<00:05:15.200> so<00:05:15.410> what<00:05:15.500> we're

press Y for dashboard and choose yes and

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.610 
press Y for dashboard and choose yes and
that<00:05:25.730> means<00:05:26.390> that<00:05:26.690> the<00:05:26.960> opponent<00:05:27.350> won't<00:05:27.410> get

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
that means that the opponent won't get

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.650 
that means that the opponent won't get
any<00:05:27.740> points<00:05:27.950> for<00:05:28.160> that<00:05:28.400> you<00:05:29.180> know<00:05:29.270> for<00:05:29.450> being<00:05:29.600> a

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
any points for that you know for being a

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.130 
any points for that you know for being a
scrub<00:05:30.880> so<00:05:31.880> effectively<00:05:32.510> we've<00:05:32.720> just<00:05:32.930> earned

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
scrub so effectively we've just earned

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.260 
scrub so effectively we've just earned
them<00:05:33.350> I<00:05:33.560> mean<00:05:34.370> we<00:05:34.490> don't<00:05:34.610> get<00:05:34.760> any<00:05:34.880> point<00:05:35.060> I

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
them I mean we don't get any point I

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.550 
them I mean we don't get any point I
think<00:05:35.330> we<00:05:35.510> lose<00:05:35.690> some<00:05:35.870> points<00:05:35.990> for<00:05:36.260> doing<00:05:36.350> that

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
think we lose some points for doing that

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.940 
think we lose some points for doing that
but<00:05:37.250> it's<00:05:37.370> worth<00:05:37.550> it<00:05:37.760> because<00:05:37.820> I<00:05:38.710> mean<00:05:39.710> you<00:05:39.800> saw

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
but it's worth it because I mean you saw

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.280 
but it's worth it because I mean you saw
how<00:05:39.980> like<00:05:40.220> I<00:05:40.340> was<00:05:40.490> playing<00:05:41.020> so<00:05:42.020> it's<00:05:42.080> like<00:05:42.260> a

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
how like I was playing so it's like a

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.080 
how like I was playing so it's like a
win-win<00:05:42.500> situation<00:05:42.650> either<00:05:43.400> we<00:05:43.640> win<00:05:43.850> points

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
win-win situation either we win points

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.770 
win-win situation either we win points
or<00:05:44.450> the<00:05:45.110> opponent<00:05:45.560> doesn't<00:05:45.830> win<00:05:46.070> any<00:05:46.220> points

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
or the opponent doesn't win any points

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.990 
or the opponent doesn't win any points
so<00:05:47.780> we're<00:05:48.170> either<00:05:48.320> rewarded<00:05:49.100> for<00:05:49.460> excellent

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
so we're either rewarded for excellent

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.170 
so we're either rewarded for excellent
play<00:05:50.380> or<00:05:51.380> the<00:05:51.440> opponent<00:05:52.040> is<00:05:52.070> not<00:05:52.430> rewarded<00:05:52.940> for

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
play or the opponent is not rewarded for

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.230 
play or the opponent is not rewarded for
scrubby<00:05:53.540> play<00:05:54.160> and<00:05:55.160> I<00:05:55.820> think<00:05:56.120> that<00:05:56.210> that's

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
scrubby play and I think that that's

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.480 
scrubby play and I think that that's
what<00:05:56.600> we<00:05:56.690> need<00:05:56.810> to<00:05:56.900> know<00:05:56.960> really<00:05:57.200> and<00:05:57.470> if<00:05:58.370> you

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
what we need to know really and if you

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.990 
what we need to know really and if you
do<00:05:58.670> that<00:05:58.700> on<00:05:58.880> every<00:05:59.300> game<00:05:59.480> you<00:05:59.720> will<00:06:00.440> become

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
do that on every game you will become

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.130 
do that on every game you will become

one of the best players in super street

tutorial I hope you learned something

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.000 
tutorial I hope you learned something
I've<00:06:11.840> just<00:06:12.080> realized<00:06:12.500> the<00:06:12.620> camera's<00:06:12.980> not

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.010 
I've just realized the camera's not

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.920 
I've just realized the camera's not
exactly<00:06:13.520> facing<00:06:14.240> the<00:06:14.330> TV<00:06:14.480> and<00:06:14.750> the<00:06:14.810> right

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
exactly facing the TV and the right

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:20.440 
exactly facing the TV and the right
angle<00:06:15.260> but<00:06:15.440> that's<00:06:15.620> ok<00:06:17.320> good<00:06:18.320> luck
