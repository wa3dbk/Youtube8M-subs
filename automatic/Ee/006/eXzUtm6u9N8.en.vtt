00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.429
 tag on dvd review because they are all first 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.679

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.630
 have seen there you can then first 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.940
 Find out why patrice is next to me 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.400
 sits what he does what a person does 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.800
 and we're looking at a second one now 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.460
 interview with the free bird with 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:28.369
 christian tramitz and oliver kalkofe 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:32.820
 hi this is come 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:35.520
 So either way we'll be together in here 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.630
 hotel was very chic initially 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.600
 I have to say I am very 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.280
 surprised as just before europe 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.809
 you actually saw them in yesterday 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.000
 his predecessor for the first time seen 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.860
 that's always how you always think when 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.390
 you have synchronized their 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.070
 coach and disney movie and you have to 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.690
 I do not know because you get it yes 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.629
 actually in the normal case always only this 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.520
 snippets that you talk about yourself 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.710
 you get the whole movie in the rarest 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.510
 then to see and there now 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.399
 just finished 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.799
 we have last night now we are 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.180
 complete factory seen yes but how 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.619
 then prepares you also something before it 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.360
 did not even give the original what 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.650
 you could have foreseen or is it 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.090
 really so klika script in hand 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.890
 next by says I like it 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.060
 I or your checkbook are fine 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.580
 or not or how it looks 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.680
 sheikh book sixth buddy unique 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.420
 no nonsense at all next high 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.159
 artistically it has good one here 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.850
 trailer has already seen people her 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.420
 eat and hear woody harrelson and it 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.220
 are not the worst 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.920
 actor and jan is great too 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.600
 and then you squat like that 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.439
 a little bit on it so try so too 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:42.810
 Sound like that because I like exactly how else 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:44.340
 Never does it sound so you look 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.829
 then also the facial expressions very closely 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.720
 and the animated truly outstanding 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.140
 is missing it easy not hard to 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.180
 do 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.759
 in the normal case the social it is in 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.680
 It was finally the facial expressions and 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.830
 first get used to it 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.510
 no, but that was usually the case 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.160
 synchronizes the movie is also yes 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.000
 most access original not even 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.860
 out and if you look at synchronously 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.140
 So there are companies that are the top secret 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.120
 Sometimes you only have films 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.740
 that the mouths can only be seen 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.850
 We can afford one another 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.160
 never see a picture because that's the way it is 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.170
 so secret is all that exists 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.000
 and that's why it's difficult and 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.380
 Here it is natural then in the beginning 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.360
 so the coach by the description 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.310
 proves again about when he speaks 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.650
 Anyway, what if I said something 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.540
 Well, for religious reasons, I can 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.770
 no egg or somehow so then 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.070
 you say okay, of course I have 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.780
 relish it because the normal case in the newly 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.060
 also a huge fun but how 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.140
 big is the influence on what is there 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.580
 is also spoken with me is 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.680
 noticed both versions so seen 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.209
 once the english original version and 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.340
 the Germans are a few, too 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.760
 word games have been changed then 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.959
 probably because it actually goes 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.360
 maybe these are just as a movie 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.830
 expert so i just had the british 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.360
 what the world for example what 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.770
 then comes 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.049
 an idea was to say we do it because 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.750
 to those this little dork 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.970
 and then and change the set times as a 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.320
 little bit around this is something is 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.600
 quite often so made the more 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.950
 variants also speak so that 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.980
 you have an idea but you do not know yet 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.930
 how is it when in the end in one 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.340
 summary quite often does yes 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.840
 another maybe just a saying 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.549
 one understands better here one does 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.080
 Anyone else gag a man 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.709
 has itself new proposal will be 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.720
 recorded 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.739
 which ends up in the film at the end 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.190
 is a surprise 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.100
 then I imagine very well to 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:35.850
 a little bit more cheerful a little bit 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.320
 james future therefore three versions in the 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.120
 principle, you already know which two 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.890
 make outfits is power 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.020
 easy application on the paper 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.690
 draufstehen 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.430
 in principle you do not have so much with you 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.750
 language and is only it is not that 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.490
 One says now with every sentence makes him 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.560
 So in five different emotions 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:55.310
 but you already know that 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.870
 what before yes it is already in sight and 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.430
 it is also now he tries as well as 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.560
 it is different than for example in the 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.090
 in the 70s where you just like that 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.920
 through the two and everywhere spencer 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.390
 Terence Hill just film something 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.960
 Other was synced than that 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.340
 original 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.590
 even if that will keep your mouth shut 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.180
 just talked etc now is for 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.830
 Many years will be careful that 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.660
 always the original as faithfully as only 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.230
 So it is possible that you both in the 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.350
 game 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.750
 stays similar and that too 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.760
 textually not something now somehow 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.290
 makes what was not intended 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.390
 there is now much more 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.860
 pay attention that is now but too 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.720
 so the movie itself is something very 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.460
 specifically American we have though 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.910
 also thanksgiving in europe also in 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.130
 Germany 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.690
 but there is another one so far 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.130
 we got out of america just like that 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.440
 so if you are just ahead 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.120
 thanksgiving how do you think that will be 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.800
 German audience we need to know 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.420
 that a big eating knowledge area 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.650
 Free the great shopping away our people 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.750
 bring around many playstation or 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.490
 However, how do you think you will become 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.380
 because such a thing will establish here 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.750
 the movie maybe that was also solid 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.770
 celebrated here as well as halloween 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.110
 of course the wrong way if you are 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:06.290
 the side now we do that 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:07.910
 but I think that too understand 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.130
 So a little self explain that it 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:13.610
 This will also be thanksgiving day 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.920
 I let it out properly it will 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.880
 yes also explains what that is enough 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.530
 in the whole movie 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.480
 that's why I do not think so 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.610
 Big problem that one in Germany 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.400
 that does not know because it is in the movie 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.110
 practically 100,000 mark chapman man 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.560
 understands but it is just like in such a way 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.389
 many things if you can not do it anyway 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.190
 has a little bit of background knowledge 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.470
 It is sometimes the first moment 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.210
 maybe a bit harder behind it 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.590
 come to understand that but they have 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.630
 ever learn something so learn the 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.310
 children at least where this needs 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.160
 comes and refrains profit and how 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.810
 for the first time the pilgrims and the 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.320
 Indian people came together and at least one 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.540
 little 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.180
 It's supposed to be completely 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.940
 nice if somewhere the children if at 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.169
 Maybe one or the other movie 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.540
 understanding about anything in the world 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.540
 is still being taught that is and also 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.530
 the eggs speak or so on the one hand 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.820
 can you come on his still 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.710
 by becoming vegetarian 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.090
 concludes again to your roles 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.550
 even a side very opposite 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.340
 So you are the smart one and you are 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:13.860
 I'm gonna tell turkey 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.510
 the big heart yes not all that 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.490
 the big heart but not with the 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.020
 big brain and that, as it were 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.940
 translator excited when they wanted so 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.160
 to get the order you 're up to something like that 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.470
 so mastered 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:29.220
 for example, if big hearts are no, then 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:31.410
 What's striking on this day is it 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:36.360
 it is clear after three minutes that 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:41.070
 but it's not exactly the brightest but 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:45.450
 he is somehow synchronously roll the one 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:49.200
 I like not actually in people 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:50.729
 definitely the corresponding i like 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.160
 that sometimes over 200 follow I say now 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:55.740
 not the name it was not nice though 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:59.070
 the name is just sympathetic because he is 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.680
 structured in a relatively simple way like me 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.760
 and that's why 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.560
 I am sometimes a bit 

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.630
 surprised as somewhere message 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.039
 I am always asked because I am 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:11.090
 working my way now actually down 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:13.320
 Of course I have a huge dkb 

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:16.830
 then I was somehow now ultimately 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:19.139
 somehow a big snail so it 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:21.289
 So revolutionary is it technically possible 

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:21.289
 back 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.760
 next is a very very smart one is all 

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.680
 that's right in a time machine and 

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.230
 I liked that too, so it's called 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.640
 But you do not say so tightly bound and 

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:34.350
 sync or my gesticulate so much 

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.090
 Do you have to take that as well then actually 

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:40.490
 really only everything would be but I have to 

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:42.570
 once he does not have any really great 

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:45.350
 absolutely pleasant when syncing 

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:47.160
 so to speak as the upper he could just like that 

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.610
 speak and you could go there and 

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.050
 herschieben 

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:51.300
 That's why it really worked for me 

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:52.860
 easier and faster than usual in 

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.220
 future only mature 

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.230
 bring 

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:57.330
 maybe I can specialize 

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.830
 on a new one of which lamps 

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.330
 days that there are certainly still 

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:02.450
 many eggs will definitely come as well 

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:04.500
 soon iphone dev 

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.940
 i will suggest you thank you 

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.690
 you for this interview and you can 

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.690
 you succeed a lot
