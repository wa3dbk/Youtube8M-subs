00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.910
 hello everybody review 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.189
 I already did a boxing at the moment is to wait and 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.550
 I installed but how can I get the ef 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.629
 140 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:37.559
 This is the cut version and lets 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:40.920
 want to see it and circulate this new 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.000
 The top line of force is from cures to 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.159
 cabinets 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.269
 this one is the aft 140 he has with the 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:54.449
 version that the performance version and the 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:56.879
 version quality the performance version eu 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.300
 I recommend to put on the air I lose law 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.719
 stayed as cury himself takes care of the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.630
 your processor support I recommend 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.929
 use the performance as in the cabinet 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.270
 I recommend the same ti father and if that 

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:13.979
 I used it as the exhaust fan goes 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.409
 draw the internal hot air from my 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:21.180
 office and play outside 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:24.119
 is the taboo before this one where 120 in the 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.229
 background of the cabinet now put the 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.579
 always a couple and cipullo and come open 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.579
 Here I am going to show you 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:45.409
 he does not have lighting, he's fine with 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:48.289
 Affection with resistor here from 33 lehmann 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:54.920
 that the connector it is 3 purposes and which 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:57.039
 this one it comes with certificate of 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.039
 Warranty 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:07.239
 advertising with some products that 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:10.340
 cabinets keyboards and such three rings 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:12.799
 because if you finish your 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:18.010
 vases and has a way of other things 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:18.010
 their white and in my case red 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:33.860
 on here 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:35.209
 notice that he is rubbery gray 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:41.959
 an eraser 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:46.600
 he has her in the 44 supports you 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:50.450
 can see that she screw through it 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:56.180
 through circular crack and screw 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:03:00.019
 on the black part and so it supports the 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.109
 pay it it's screwed into the black base 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:06.200
 even from curu 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:10.010
 only the rubber avoids the arm's 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:13.639
 jump right next to the cabinet here such a ring 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.889
 red I'm going to stop this time you 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:16.940
 can see he is the father from far away from 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:20.510
 fast 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:25.670
 The model looks like that car. 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:28.010
 mercedes the wheel of slr know who is 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:33.590
 Fan of game elapsed so thing goes 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:35.019
 remember iacc my computer is 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.599
 programmed when I am not using 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.730
 much much'm not with a 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.709
 high performance it is programmed to 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.780
 a lower rotation 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.890
 I do not think it increases 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:52.520
 here in his box reports that the 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:55.520
 rotation but speak I do chan voting 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:59.330
 it is 140mm the measure of the cooler 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:02.750
 and the rotation 1,150 remembering that the version 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.540
 performance is more than 2,000 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:11.690
 rotation and low noise here 24 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:17.269
 decibels only noise is low noise and 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:22.100
 high self and self-production of refrigerates 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:24.890
 well and here ok indicating that it comes with 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:28.760
 the three rings of different colors and here 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:30.890
 back shows the box is the box with the 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.320
 other models 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:36.800
 that has performance that even the 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:42.889
 same kuaite propeller pattern as the 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:46.100
 140mm version is and has the 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:51.110
 120 version of performance which this 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:55.100
 same standard and has the shock hype is high 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:57.950
 The pressure that is this blue here is to see that the 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:01.729
 different sdr is for daily high pressure 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:03.620
 so his rotation is much bigger and he has 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:07.130
 with the same model only the version 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:13.090
 kuaite with 1,400 rpm sure that the 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:16.610
 specifications ok 12 volts nÃ© 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:19.250
 conventional connector the three children 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:22.100
 so is here folks here an example of 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:26.210
 of some connections with it 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:29.750
 I found pretty much the model coli and 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:32.060
 and it is well and if it is quite heavy in sight 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:36.110
 nor compare with others will see the 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:38.360
 durability but until then I'm 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.690
 pleased liked the design combined with 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.510
 the video card does not have at the end 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.880
 so much detail if it is more to 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.800
 quality even ok 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.100
 big hug to the next one 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.100
 video
