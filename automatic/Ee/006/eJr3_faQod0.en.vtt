Hislop<00:00:09.660> Shaq<00:00:09.900> we<00:00:10.019> got<00:00:10.139> some<00:00:10.320> questions<00:00:10.410> for

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
Hislop Shaq we got some questions for

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.650 
Hislop Shaq we got some questions for
you<00:00:10.950> one<00:00:11.190> of<00:00:11.309> them<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.910> first<00:00:12.179> one<00:00:12.389> in<00:00:12.480> fact

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
you one of them the first one in fact

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.270 
you one of them the first one in fact
it's<00:00:12.750> about<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:12.960> goalkeeper<00:00:13.530> you<00:00:13.920> ready<00:00:14.070> for<00:00:14.250> it

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
it's about a goalkeeper you ready for it

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.849 
it's about a goalkeeper you ready for it
I<00:00:14.429> think<00:00:14.910> so<00:00:15.179> Chesney<00:00:15.780> says<00:00:16.049> Spurs<00:00:16.350> don't<00:00:16.680> have

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
I think so Chesney says Spurs don't have

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.800 
I think so Chesney says Spurs don't have
enough<00:00:17.160> quality<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.940> finish<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.330> top<00:00:18.420> 4

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
enough quality to finish in the top 4

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.140 
enough quality to finish in the top 4
does<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.350> arsenal<00:00:19.770> scored<00:00:20.039> have<00:00:20.220> more<00:00:20.490> well

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
does the arsenal scored have more well

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.150 
does the arsenal scored have more well
I'm<00:00:21.420> not<00:00:21.900> sure<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.320> they<00:00:22.410> actually<00:00:22.769> do<00:00:22.920> and

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
I'm not sure that they actually do and

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.009 
I'm not sure that they actually do and
first<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.760> all<00:00:23.850> Chesney<00:00:24.420> it's<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.750> little<00:00:24.900> bit

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
first of all Chesney it's a little bit

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.660 
first of all Chesney it's a little bit
of<00:00:25.080> gamesmanship<00:00:25.320> obviously<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.279> understand

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
of gamesmanship obviously you understand

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.169 
of gamesmanship obviously you understand
the<00:00:26.760> rivalry<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.170> history<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:29.179> boozing

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
the rivalry and the history of boozing

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.659 
the rivalry and the history of boozing
astelin<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.019> their<00:00:31.349> dislike<00:00:31.800> for<00:00:32.219> each<00:00:32.460> other

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
astelin and their dislike for each other

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.060 
astelin and their dislike for each other
so<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.210> think<00:00:33.780> he's<00:00:33.899> playing<00:00:34.140> up<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.770> and

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
so I think he's playing up to that and

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.459 
so I think he's playing up to that and
up<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.579> Arsenal<00:00:36.030> fans<00:00:36.270> quite<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> bit<00:00:36.960> but

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
up to the Arsenal fans quite a bit but

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.200 
up to the Arsenal fans quite a bit but
you<00:00:37.590> look<00:00:37.739> at<00:00:37.890> spruces<00:00:38.399> squad<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.120> think

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
you look at spruces squad and I think

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.630 
you look at spruces squad and I think
they<00:00:39.809> probably<00:00:40.050> have<00:00:40.440> as<00:00:40.680> much<00:00:40.890> qualities<00:00:41.399> as

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
they probably have as much qualities as

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.540 
they probably have as much qualities as
as<00:00:42.000> Arsenal<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.960> think<00:00:43.440> our<00:00:43.559> cell<00:00:43.800> despite<00:00:44.430> an

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
as Arsenal I think our cell despite an

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.819 
as Arsenal I think our cell despite an
inconsistent<00:00:45.300> season<00:00:45.660> are<00:00:45.930> probably<00:00:46.350> making

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
inconsistent season are probably making

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.639 
inconsistent season are probably making
a<00:00:47.100> better<00:00:47.340> job<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:48.020> this<00:00:49.020> year's<00:00:49.230> Premier

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
a better job of this year's Premier

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.220 
a better job of this year's Premier
League<00:00:49.770> campaign<00:00:50.570> but<00:00:51.570> because<00:00:51.899> you're<00:00:52.050> more

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
League campaign but because you're more

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.459 
League campaign but because you're more
experienced<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.829> think<00:00:53.190> as<00:00:53.280> suppose<00:00:53.670> grow<00:00:54.030> in

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
experienced I think as suppose grow in

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.439 
experienced I think as suppose grow in
experience<00:00:55.469> as<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.890> growing<00:00:56.219> confidence<00:00:56.610> I

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
experience as a growing confidence I

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.180 
experience as a growing confidence I
think<00:00:58.140> they'll<00:00:58.230> get<00:00:58.379> better<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> lot<00:00:59.129> more

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
think they'll get better and a lot more

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.099 
think they'll get better and a lot more
consistent<00:00:59.940> seeing<00:01:00.270> sure<00:01:00.510> though<00:01:00.690> they've

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
consistent seeing sure though they've

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.170 
consistent seeing sure though they've
had<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.379> rely<00:01:01.590> very<00:01:01.620> heavily<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:02.340> Gareth<00:01:02.969> Bale

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
had to rely very heavily on Gareth Bale

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.149 
had to rely very heavily on Gareth Bale
and<00:01:03.210> whether<00:01:03.539> he's<00:01:03.780> he's<00:01:04.229> earful<00:01:04.650> for<00:01:04.890> spurs

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
and whether he's he's earful for spurs

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.370 
and whether he's he's earful for spurs

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
next question with the battle for

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.380 
next question with the battle for
relegation<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.619> tight<00:01:14.010> our<00:01:14.280> 40<00:01:14.880> points<00:01:15.150> enough

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
relegation so tight our 40 points enough

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.450 
relegation so tight our 40 points enough
for<00:01:15.600> survival<00:01:16.110> I'm<00:01:16.350> not<00:01:16.680> absolutely<00:01:17.310> certain

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
for survival I'm not absolutely certain

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.039 
for survival I'm not absolutely certain
them<00:01:17.880> I'm<00:01:18.000> looking<00:01:18.210> down<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.630> bottom<00:01:18.780> of

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
them I'm looking down on the bottom of

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.590 
them I'm looking down on the bottom of
the<00:01:19.170> table<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.740> well<00:01:20.460> quite<00:01:20.939> cleanly<00:01:21.299> at

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
the table and well quite cleanly at

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.710 
the table and well quite cleanly at
Newcastle<00:01:22.080> United<00:01:22.470> 138<00:01:23.280> points<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.850> I'm

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
Newcastle United 138 points and I'm

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.690 
Newcastle United 138 points and I'm
thinking<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.290> even<00:01:25.470> 41<00:01:26.159> might<00:01:26.369> not<00:01:26.549> be

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
thinking that even 41 might not be

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.310 
thinking that even 41 might not be
enough<00:01:27.530> you<00:01:28.530> feel<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.750> 41<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.990> going<00:01:31.229> to

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
enough you feel that a 41 is going to

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.870 
enough you feel that a 41 is going to
have<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.590> sitting<00:01:31.799> rather<00:01:32.070> nervously<00:01:32.640> let's

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
have you sitting rather nervously let's

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.230 
have you sitting rather nervously let's
just<00:01:33.299> see<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.990> think<00:01:34.549> 42-year<00:01:35.549> you're<00:01:36.030> quite

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
just see I think 42-year you're quite

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.620 
just see I think 42-year you're quite
happy<00:01:36.570> with<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.900> position<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.439> you're<00:01:37.890> in

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
happy with the position that you're in

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.749 
happy with the position that you're in
but<00:01:39.630> I'm<00:01:40.200> taking<00:01:40.740> nothing<00:01:40.950> for<00:01:41.220> granted<00:01:41.280> down

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
but I'm taking nothing for granted down

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.580
