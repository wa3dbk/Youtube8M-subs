glass since the display is damaged very

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.009 
glass since the display is damaged very
much<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.620> there<00:02:23.250> are<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.489> lot<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:23.780> fragments<00:02:24.780> I

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
much and there are a lot of fragments I

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.740 
much and there are a lot of fragments I
decided<00:02:25.709> not<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.099> remove<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:27.000> glass<00:02:27.269> with<00:02:27.569> the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
decided not to remove the glass with the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.710 
decided not to remove the glass with the
wire<00:02:27.959> I'm<00:02:28.349> going<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.459> take<00:02:29.640> out<00:02:29.939> every<00:02:30.480> piece

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
wire I'm going to take out every piece

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.559 
wire I'm going to take out every piece
with<00:02:31.079> my<00:02:31.260> fingers<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:32.040> reduce<00:02:32.609> possible

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
with my fingers to reduce possible

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.920 
with my fingers to reduce possible
scratching<00:02:34.079> of<00:02:34.200> matrix<00:02:34.970> experience<00:02:35.970> shows<00:02:36.299> as

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
scratching of matrix experience shows as

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.949 
scratching of matrix experience shows as
the<00:02:37.379> matrix<00:02:37.950> has<00:02:38.280> scratches<00:02:38.819> already<00:02:39.540> before

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
the matrix has scratches already before

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.020 
the matrix has scratches already before
removing<00:02:40.470> because<00:02:41.129> the<00:02:41.250> display<00:02:41.579> is<00:02:41.730> large

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
removing because the display is large

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.460 
removing because the display is large
enough<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.799> pieces<00:02:43.799> of<00:02:43.950> glass<00:02:44.189> scratch<00:02:44.970> it

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
enough and pieces of glass scratch it

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:58.010 
enough and pieces of glass scratch it
even<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.680> small<00:02:47.010> deformation

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.170 

so<00:02:59.020> for<00:02:59.320> their<00:02:59.500> experiment<00:03:00.250> we<00:03:00.700> will<00:03:00.850> remove

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
so for their experiment we will remove

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.610 
so for their experiment we will remove
fragments<00:03:01.780> in<00:03:02.230> this<00:03:02.710> way<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:03.010> show<00:03:03.550> the

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
fragments in this way to show the

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.040 
fragments in this way to show the
polarization<00:03:05.620> film<00:03:06.130> is<00:03:06.850> scratched<00:03:07.390> not<00:03:07.810> by

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
polarization film is scratched not by

00:03:08.050 --> 00:04:05.490 
polarization film is scratched not by
the<00:03:08.110> wire<00:03:08.560> it<00:03:08.950> is<00:03:09.310> already<00:03:09.730> scratched

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.590 

if<00:04:06.040> anyone<00:04:06.490> tried<00:04:06.730> to<00:04:06.910> remove<00:04:07.150> balloons

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
capture all the films together so they

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.080 
capture all the films together so they
