00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.509
 hi i am a princess 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.010
 today will tell you about one way 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.559
 using which you can pass 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.480
 any night in the game fnaf 3 necessarily 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.450
 like friends if you want more 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.300
 video on this game and let's get started 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.699
 I will say right away this method only works 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.769
 on laptops and it lies in 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.769
 using one bug which 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.380
 lets go any night in cryo even 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.510
 I do not play the game itself this video decided 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.390
 write down because many of you write 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.160
 in the comments or in PM in about what 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.070
 they can't do this or that 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.989
 night after give advice or hint 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.290
 but any tips won't work 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.059
 as effectively as this small park in 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.730
 general friends if you wonder how 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.850
 you can go any night without even playing 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.010
 the game then listen carefully done 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.530
 all very easy run the game on 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.420
 laptop and began to include a new game or 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.140
 download that night you can't 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.149
 go after night started 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.159
 quickly turn off the game do it 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.180
 You can press the win or alt and 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.360
 tab simultaneously 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.310
 Further open the start and click on 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.210
 the arrow next to the end button 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.700
 work 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.700
 choose there hibernation and 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.110
 click on it as soon as your laptop 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.960
 turn off you need to wait about 7 8 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.170
 minutes and turn it on again after 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.420
 on the screen will display 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.640
 resumption of work and when it loads 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.909
 desktop well you can deploy 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.790
 the game 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.770
 having peeped guys on the vacation panel and how 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.350
 Once the game unfold listen 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.070
 baby voice and see the inscription 6 am 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.090
 on the screen that is, we ended and the hero 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.060
 survived 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.770
 this simple way you can go any 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.469
 at night in the game I will explain how it is 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.439
 You probably noticed that the game is not 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:59.560
 pauses, that is, even if you roll the game 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:02.110
 then it will continue to go from the printer will 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.600
 active but if you minimize the game and go 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.329
 in hibernation mode then all applications 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.340
 open you will remain included but 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:11.650
 will no longer be active as a laptop 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.530
 will be turned off accordingly and 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.849
 sprintrap will also be inactive and not 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.640
 can kill the main character 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:21.069
 however the timer itself that starts 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.220
 at activation of any night remains 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.590
 active even in hibernation mode therefore 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.530
 when the legs are off it only works 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.860
 timer and when you turn on the game after 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.290
 hibernation we already see the final tonight 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.510
 Here is such a simple way to 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.060
 passing any night to you today 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.319
