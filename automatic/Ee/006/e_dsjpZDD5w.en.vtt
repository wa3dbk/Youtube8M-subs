00:01:42.129 --> 00:01:42.139 
going to be quite an experience it's not

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:44.769 
going to be quite an experience it's not
just<00:01:42.499> the<00:01:42.619> walls<00:01:42.889> in<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.399> rear<00:01:43.579> wall<00:01:43.880> it's<00:01:44.240> the

just the walls in the rear wall it's the

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:46.749 
just the walls in the rear wall it's the
ceiling<00:01:45.259> it's<00:01:45.619> basically<00:01:46.039> a<00:01:46.159> hemisphere

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
ceiling it's basically a hemisphere

because<00:01:49.549> of<00:01:49.579> that<00:01:49.729> we<00:01:50.149> can<00:01:50.359> create<00:01:50.539> a<00:01:50.630> much

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
because of that we can create a much

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.620 
because of that we can create a much
more<00:01:50.869> immersive<00:01:51.349> environment

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630
