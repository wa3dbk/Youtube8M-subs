00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 all there cuts the tank say with what 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.290
 difficulties you faced and how much 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.900
 time spent on registration but in the past 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.290
 year 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.900
 but if you remember we 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.730
 at 70 and 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.580
 the liberation of the Luhansk region from 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:20.320
 fascist invaders 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.320
 2 yuri we took him from the pedestal and 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.580
 September 2 , he was ready to perform 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.070
 its task 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.020
 means 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.020
 complexity was very comfortable car 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:37.629
 Graduation 43 December 12, he was 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.309
 let the plant naturally everything came in 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:43.210
 worthlessness 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:46.870
 for 69 years then you understand with me 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.800
 everything was ruined beaten by corrosion and 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.379
 a plus 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.829
 our local vandals added it was 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.420
 flu killed all surveillance devices and 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.309
 - Alexander Nikolaevich picture there 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.050
 first penetrated when it opened 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.670
 here 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.570
 today you see where the cars are 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.700
 on the mountain 230 digits from on this level he 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.409
 the garbage was full of plan nicholas 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.569
 standing next to it can confirm 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.460
 sometimes there crawled there will be quiet horror 

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:17.350
 there are photos of it all 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.950
 so I think this is not a wonder not 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.479
 It was based on this of course I had to 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.420
 the car hastily do 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.490
 completely overhaul were removed 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.119
 all components and assemblies engine and gearbox 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.110
 gears 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.990
 side clutches 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.960
 these were the transfer of the caterpillar was all this 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.370
 moved including washed cleared 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.170
 shoulder strap towers for fat she could 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.220
 rotate accordingly all 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.160
 electrical wiring all electrical equipment 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.870
 also all were slaughtered all done but 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.760
 difficulties and what else 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.640
 all the wiring is completely nobody 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.979
 changed it all remains his own 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.229
 I think I bought limbs better 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.170
 overwhelmed by the possibility of this was not 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:03.700
 there real tank wiring find you 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.979
 because they themselves simply are not, and now we 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.000
 it turns out like a hostage to all this 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:12.610
 then there it locks the lock in general 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.400
 again the same difficulties us the forest 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.590
 happened this year this year when 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.390
 we took it off the pedestal brought it 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.940
 it is clear here and you just he was 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.510
 immobilized my and this time constantly 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.650
 pedestal he again no one else 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.650
 there was no temptation 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.830
 fully engine-transmission 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.810
 branch everything was packed with steam + and you 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.920
 tried to burn it on a pedestal 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.890
 formed sight 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.110
 there is a throw or a burning rag hope 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.000
 up to 300 there are seats and they flared 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.540
 but completely us so we seat 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.240
 took off just a year and burned there was put on 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.760
 this rag just burned and all but harm 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.680
 dealt big in that 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.580
 perfectly painted with the white color of the tower and 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.870
 everything turned into black oil 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.750
 so I had to wash it all again 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.400
 degrease dye here it gives 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.680
 unplanned that's all 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.860
 well , plus when I was almost ready to 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.409
 this time with test run 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.970
 engine engine jammed had to 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:19.970
 hastily literally a week ago 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.959
 again to remove all armor protection pull 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.030
 engine heads 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.400
 replay all all five recover 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:33.230
 repaired yesterday was all 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:36.470
 ok but as a result of running 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.170
 Now you can look for another question. 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.849
 say the tank is well in combat 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.639
 will catch and shoot he can or not me 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:53.739
 can not gun paladi military zone yet 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:57.010
 in 1907 on this basis he is a monument 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.010
 he has a weapon 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.959
 how do you know everything about tanks 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:12.340
 about myself i well how to tell you i am done with 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.820
 tank school in cern then you are their troops 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:20.160
 All my life I lived tank troops 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:25.900
 so this is my brainchild 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:31.330
 only machine so send it was 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:33.340
 your idea for renovation was not mine 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.210
 it came from 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:41.640
 or sandrine closed koffing is not the same 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:46.360
 This I think so It can be drowning 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:48.610
 tried how to create learned during 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.229
 celebrating tank day 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.490
 but you are now Cossacks in the eleventh 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.960
 year to the mayor turned veteran tank 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.539
 troop 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.699
 we asked if such an opportunity 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.840
 you all restore it why because 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.150
 what 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.930
 veterans look let's say Chelyabinsk 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:10.000
 Volgograd there Moscow and everything is easier here and 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.090
 someone removes the pedestal restores 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.800
 they participate in all activities 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.400
 parades and so on just then it was 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.960
 70th anniversary of the Battle of Stalingrad 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.889
 same same three foursome which of 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.040
 museum dachshund was restored by the same 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.360
 by restorers 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.210
 and participated in all events 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.900
 so the Russians headed the key 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.280
 delegation of the city who traveled for 70 years 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.410
 Stalingrad Battle 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.460
 Well, accordingly, I came there with such 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.470
 we have ideas too 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:42.760
 eyes must be honored to say that 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:46.750
 even that which Volgograd 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.220
 he is our museum from a pedestal tell me more 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.040
 here we have one question in luhansk 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.700
 two more English tanks are possible 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.700
 restore 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:00.300
 In my opinion professional as 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:02.550
 tankman their lawyer played name is 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.260
 October Revolution is necessary to 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:08.670
 put on the course here as well as this one 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:10.500
 year well to all disadvantage despite 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.340
 that everything was faulty but everything here 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.850
 was included 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.990
 and there it is not here there is neither 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.840
 engines 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:21.689
 everything that allows a tank to be 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.249
 tank and move therefore 

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:25.169
 I do not know how realistic to restore 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:27.360
 that's how they were left some 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:29.360
 modern engines don't make sense 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.419
 native engine 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:35.090
 Tishkin those who were on them I find 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:38.060
 I think it will not be possible but introduce yourself 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.680
 please oksana nikolaeva chairman 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:44.500
 government board
