00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:06.930
 woo 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:11.059
 I actually heard the concept I heard 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.059
 It's loud enough to make you feel better. 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.860
 Even if you listen in the field, it must be the sound of the Taiwanese house from abroad. 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.860
 I see 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:30.369
 I can not hear it. 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:30.369
 The roar that raided the peaceful evening lasted for three minutes. 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:40.400
 Eure dinner after a long time neighbors also gathered together and gave kkeutnabeo 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:44.930
 Oh yes I will Yes. So the window or he'll call the defendant requirements 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:48.129
 Not to do so in our house that month reversed loud when I lived here 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.129
 It was a pedal . 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:58.629
 If you use the scientific method, you can see the invisible sound. 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.629
 It means you can find the location where the sound is. 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.570
 At that time, the sound expert came to contact me. 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:13.940
 It's black. I found politics in the white house. 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.170
 I compared the sounds I could hear around me 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:21.400
 What to see straight through into the nose 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.400
 Stagnation in Finding Noise 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:30.460
 It's just getting the mixer working sound . 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:33.400
 There was more truth that sound experts found 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:37.570
 Yes I do rattling Features 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:41.230
 I've been recording and it's been repeating. 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:47.400
 It's evenly cracked. 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:47.400
 The recordings sound like a continuous mixer sound. 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:58.100
 So , after recording the sound of the blender, Yoon used the speaker or microphone to deliberately 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.100
 I mean, it's turning louder . 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.010
 I mean, I'm just doing a noise terror. 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.170
 That's it. 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.980
 Subterranean Serin Ix 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.600
 This requires ca 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:25.080
 After you do this, it raised more regal past'm weak in Korea 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:30.620
 I heard the second palace . 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:35.930
 It's because we have equipment installed to identify the epicenter. 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.610
 When analyzing the sound recording equipment Now you can know the exact source of the sound 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.470
 It is. 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:46.190
 But it was not just the sound of the camera . 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:51.230
 At 6 am 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:55.870
 Someone comes face to face with a fine opening 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:03:01.830
 It's the uc that lives in the white main house. 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.830
 Soon after she was 4, the problem began. 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.990
 The voice of bitterness breaking the noodles of residents 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:18.850
 It's getting bigger. 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:22.490
 Meomchudeo sounds that were put together lasting three minutes while you d to open the door at an angle 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:25.850
 As I have come through Yoon 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:32.120
 I wrote the mask as I heard it. 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:34.640
 She was very skinny with a mask on her pale face. 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:42.050
 But something is strange. 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:45.830
 Even though it's your own garden, it looks as though you are in a strange place. 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:51.470
 I looked around for a while. 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:53.780
 It's something that has evolved something that we've set up to record the sound 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:04:00.280
 It's a camera. 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:00.280
 Finding a camera that is not conspicuously placed and taking a picture 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:08.930
 When you enter the house again, look around and take care of the tax 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:15.140
 It's hiding. 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:20.720
 A sound expert found the scene when no sound was found on our equipment. 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:25.730
 When the roar coast there is no way to prove that rather than spreading at home one year 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:31.070
 The moment when the evidence is put in the hands of the suffering people 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:32.360
 Size over there. So if you keep pointing at only 1 3 points 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:38.500
 Grab 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.500
 Where is that sounded somewhat from Embrace sent straight to your room 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:47.540
 Analysis of body masses was clear that I am in exactly the White House gates 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:05:03.830
 As you can see, Yoon is making a big sound out of the recorded sound. 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:05.480
 How far took place things I do not usually get a little something to the whole capital 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.500
 The person who was there 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:12.640
 This is not a sudden action. 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.640
 Yee is the village
