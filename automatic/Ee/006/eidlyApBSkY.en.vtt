00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.970
 there are more than 8000 public schools in 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.009
 texas how do you know what is the 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.049
 academic achievement of your school 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.820
 compared to other schools in your 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:14.299
 community or in other parts of the state 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.609
 every year the texas education agency or 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.130
 we use a system of 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.619
 educational responsibility that evaluates 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.259
 the districts this system helps 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.970
 answer that question almost every 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.730
 schools have a classification 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.279
 met the standards or need 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.140
 easy to improve true but what is the 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.449
 secret formula behind these 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.879
 classifications there's really no 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:41.000
 no secret formula we focus on 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.280
 four basic areas first achievements 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.739
 student academics in a few 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.500
 words we refer to the results 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.000
 annual tests start we do not know 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.859
 that these tests do not tell us much 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.539
 about the participation of 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.120
 students in the band or the environment 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.160
 student however this is a 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.199
 fair way to assess the level of 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.390
 student use in 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.600
 the same test in all regions 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.820
 of the second state 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.979
 students are advancing the 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.080
 students in basic subjects such as 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.400
 math and reading from one year to another 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.960
 if this is the case then we are fine 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.479
 third we are decreasing the 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.710
 differences in academic achievement 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.770
 among the diverse populations of 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.190
 students each student 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.920
 regardless of your situation 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.140
 economic or ethnic origin must 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.180
 be having a good use and 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.909
 show progress when compared to the 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.369
 other students in their grade level 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.420
 finally the preparation for education 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.119
 higher 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.490
 that's index of graduation and diplomas 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.679
 granted also will soon be evaluated 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.929
 aspects such as how many students 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.720
 they took classes with double credit or what 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.069
 It fared so well in technical careers 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.039
 aspects that help to succeed 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:56.110
 after high school that is 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.060
 the secret formula and for those who 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.920
 they met the standards there are 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.080
 these seven honors we call them 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.509
 distinctions that a school can 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.700
 achieve in areas such as performance 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.920
 outstanding in reading and math 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.240
 preparing students to take 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.270
 the evidence is haiti 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:18.430
