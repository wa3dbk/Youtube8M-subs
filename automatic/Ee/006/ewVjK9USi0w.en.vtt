00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.599
 two 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.260
 how are we all have new question 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:35.690
 new mail what is the difference between 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:36.950
 kilocalories the calorie let 's go is a very 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.470
 good question 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.570
 an excellent time came rare mail me 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.250
 to ask this as soon as I got there I said 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.699
 I have to make a video because if it is 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.550
 very common that when we buy some 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:52.250
 food etc. on the table 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.030
 nutrimental always always turn around 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.690
 to see the calories 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.570
 more than anything when we have a diet or 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.299
 a diet based on calories that if 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.150
 I have to eat three thousand a day at 3,500 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.680
 calories or we just turn to see 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.350
 when it is sodium when it is 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.110
 fat but when you get the calories 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.110
 we always have that problem that fart 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.509
 because it says kilos because it says to be wrong 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.470
 because it does not just say calories 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:26.140
 or is that percentage of calories is for 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.399
 every I do not know how the example that then 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.130
 put now is for each cookie 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.440
 etcetera etcetera then I was made 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.899
 pretty good mail then here what 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.990
 I will explain in detail here is 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:41.979
 the image here we have the information 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.720
 nutrimental from one of a package of 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.750
 cookies here is telling us that the 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.880
 serving size are three cookies and 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.560
 then down we will say amount for 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.630
 eye portion 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.140
 check very well those bastards amount 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:59.380
 per serving or three cookies 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:03.390
 they will be about 10 and 600 kilos 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:07.150
 jules and then puts us in parentheses 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.759
 143 calories that's what we have to 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.909
 heeding 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:16.260
 three cookies equal 143 calories 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:18.959
 do the sum and see one for each cookie 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.000
 how many kilocalories are below brings us 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.890
 another one that is very rare to also tell 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.310
 but in this one if it brings it contain 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.579
 fat energy 214 kilos jules o 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.849
 salt is 41 kilocalories of fat 3 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:35.670
 treasonous fat cookies tried 51 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:38.579
 kilocalories sorry then what 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.319
 I go is the difference because there is no 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.930
 using calories are the same as 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.390
 kilocalories but they are called bad 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.340
 I would accelerate to call simply 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.889
 naughty kilocalories everything gives us roe 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.540
 and we like to reduce the words so as not 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.069
 tired click tongue 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.220
 then calories equals 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:59.370
 kilocalories an example 20 calories is 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.650
 equal to 20 kilo calories then 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.379
 we're in that now I'm going to explain the 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.690
 calorie or the small calorie is the 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.120
 amount of energy that is needed to 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.250
 raise the temperature of one gram of 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.730
 water to one centigrade 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.280
 the kilocalories or the large calorie is 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:21.290
 the official measure to measure energy 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.560
 who bring food to the body 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.760
 the energy contained in food 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.989
 before entering the body, 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.790
 expressed in kilos jules in having the 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.609
 energy contained in food 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.209
 before entering the body is expressed 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.470
 in kilos 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:42.049
 jules a kilocalorie equals 4 thousand 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:45.200
 185 kilos jules you can also 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:47.780
 find it with the abbreviation kyle with 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.000
 capital letters then kiel stories is 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.139
 Calorie equals kilocalories equals 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.230
 at 1000 calories for the right thing but at 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:04:00.500
 end the correct thing is to use kilo calories 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:04.939
 then as you see it is the same 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.159
 but if you take this into account, the 600 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:10.129
 kilos is the amount to which the 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.700
 temperature has to be the product 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:15.989
 be the lime 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:19.709
 is at the temperature at which they rise to 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:22.740
 make this product aware now what 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.440
 that we must take into account is 143 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.919
 kilocalories these are the calories that 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:33.110
 They bring 3 cookies from that tasty package 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.110
 you're about to fuck you 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:38.699
 then I hope I have answered you from 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:41.340
 correct way your question this was the 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:44.039
 review that was the answer about 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.610
 difference between kilocalories and calorie 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:50.510
 it's very fast to use it's a pretty subject 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.680
 quite 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:56.970
 then any questions any
