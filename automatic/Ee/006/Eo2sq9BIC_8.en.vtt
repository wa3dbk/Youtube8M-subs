thirty pounds about the pressure and

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.619 
thirty pounds about the pressure and
this<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.280> what<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:47.700> torque<00:00:48.120> wrench<00:00:48.360> will

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
this is what this torque wrench will

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.209 
this is what this torque wrench will
allow<00:00:48.870> us<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.020> do<00:00:49.230> we'll<00:00:49.440> tighten<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.890> nut

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
allow us to do we'll tighten that nut

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.790 

now<00:00:56.560> we<00:00:57.190> would<00:00:57.370> use<00:00:57.580> this<00:00:58.270> type<00:00:58.570> of<00:00:58.800> torque

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
now we would use this type of torque

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.650 
now we would use this type of torque
wrench<00:01:00.100> where<00:01:00.430> we<00:01:00.550> use<00:01:00.760> a<00:01:00.790> torque<00:01:01.120> wrench<00:01:01.360> if

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
wrench where we use a torque wrench if

now<00:01:26.140> in<00:01:26.380> order<00:01:26.650> to<00:01:26.680> do<00:01:26.860> that<00:01:26.979> I<00:01:27.040> place<00:01:27.340> my

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
now in order to do that I place my

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.790 
now in order to do that I place my
socket<00:01:27.790> on<00:01:28.660> the<00:01:29.229> torque<00:01:29.440> wrench<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:31.649> what<00:01:32.649> I<00:01:32.680> do

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
socket on the torque wrench so what I do

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.639 
socket on the torque wrench so what I do
is<00:01:33.070> I'll<00:01:33.220> put<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.580> socket<00:01:33.820> over<00:01:34.300> the<00:01:34.570> nut<00:01:36.479> now

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
is I'll put the socket over the nut now

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.400 
is I'll put the socket over the nut now
as<00:01:38.649> I<00:01:38.800> pull<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:41.110> torque<00:01:41.410> wrench<00:01:41.649> towards<00:01:42.220> me

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
as I pull the torque wrench towards me

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.600 
as I pull the torque wrench towards me
okay<00:01:44.410> it's<00:01:44.470> just<00:01:44.560> like<00:01:44.800> tightening<00:01:45.369> up<00:01:45.460> on

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
okay it's just like tightening up on

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.330 
okay it's just like tightening up on
that<00:01:45.759> with<00:01:46.119> a<00:01:46.149> socket<00:01:46.479> wrench<00:01:48.300> but<00:01:49.300> as<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:51.040> nut

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
that with a socket wrench but as the nut

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.580 
that with a socket wrench but as the nut
comes<00:01:51.729> under<00:01:52.090> tension<00:01:52.330> and<00:01:53.490> needle<00:01:54.490> moves<00:01:55.590> so

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
comes under tension and needle moves so

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.980 
comes under tension and needle moves so
needle<00:01:56.890> here<00:01:57.130> moves<00:01:57.550> I<00:01:57.970> don't<00:01:58.780> know<00:01:58.840> if<00:01:58.899> you

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
needle here moves I don't know if you

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.560 
needle here moves I don't know if you
can<00:01:59.080> see<00:01:59.320> but<00:01:59.619> the<00:02:00.460> needle<00:02:00.670> moves<00:02:01.000> within<00:02:01.450> this

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
can see but the needle moves within this

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.560 
can see but the needle moves within this
dial<00:02:01.900> here<00:02:02.250> when<00:02:03.250> it<00:02:03.369> hits<00:02:03.670> 30<00:02:04.060> I<00:02:04.510> know<00:02:06.570> that

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
dial here when it hits 30 I know that

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.430 
dial here when it hits 30 I know that
the<00:02:07.720> desired<00:02:08.170> talk

the<00:02:42.840> correct<00:02:42.870> talk<00:02:43.380> if<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:43.950> had<00:02:44.190> six<00:02:44.430> or<00:02:44.580> seven

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
the correct talk if I had six or seven

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.520 
the correct talk if I had six or seven
of<00:02:44.940> them<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.210> know<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.900> what<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.200> would<00:02:46.470> have

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
of them I know that what I would have

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.980 
of them I know that what I would have
bolted<00:02:46.980> would<00:02:47.730> be<00:02:47.880> exactly<00:02:48.330> under<00:02:48.870> the

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
bolted would be exactly under the

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.200 
bolted would be exactly under the
correct<00:02:49.200> tension<00:02:49.530> each<00:02:50.130> nut<00:02:50.550> will<00:02:51.090> be

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
correct tension each nut will be

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.640 
correct tension each nut will be
endlessly<00:02:51.600> technically<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.410> correct

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
endlessly technically the correct

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.010 
endlessly technically the correct
tension<00:02:52.860> that<00:02:53.550> is<00:02:53.700> why<00:02:54.180> we<00:02:54.420> use<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.690> torque

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
tension that is why we use a torque

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:01.220 
tension that is why we use a torque
wrench<00:02:59.270> maintain<00:03:00.270> torque<00:03:00.630> wrenches<00:03:00.990> make

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
wrench maintain torque wrenches make

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.290 
wrench maintain torque wrenches make
sure<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:01.800> they're<00:03:02.010> clean<00:03:02.190> make<00:03:02.940> sure<00:03:02.970> you

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
sure that they're clean make sure you

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.900 
sure that they're clean make sure you
can<00:03:03.450> see<00:03:03.720> exactly<00:03:04.790> what<00:03:06.680> what<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:08.190> dial<00:03:08.490> says

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
can see exactly what what the dial says

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.180 
can see exactly what what the dial says
and<00:03:09.240> make<00:03:09.420> sure<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:09.870> when<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.680> needle<00:03:10.980> moves

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
and make sure that when the needle moves

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.700 
and make sure that when the needle moves
you<00:03:11.400> do<00:03:11.550> it<00:03:11.640> gently<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:12.800> accurately<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:16.500> that

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
you do it gently and accurately and that

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.080 
you do it gently and accurately and that
is<00:03:16.950> how<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.190> use<00:03:17.610> a<00:03:17.880> torque<00:03:18.330> wrench<00:03:18.450> I<00:03:20.000> hope<00:03:21.000> you
