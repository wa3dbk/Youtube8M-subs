00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.840
 thanks 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.390
 at the hackenberg will be in these days 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.300
 Portuguese spoken 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.820
 vitor olivera the new entry from portugal 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.530
 was ebr with one of the fans 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.210
 big banner in its new role 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.210
 hockey home and in his 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.310
 native language welcomed 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.410
 olivera on the hope of the 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.030
 Remscheider had to rest the first 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.860
 ten minutes against the table leader 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.400
 However, from herringen from the bank 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.950
 look at 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.650
 the herringers throughout the season 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.950
 only had to take a draw came 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.990
 wide-breasted and she launches well 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.100
 After three minutes it rang 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.010
 in the remscheider box 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.490
 but the zero to one impressed 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.440
 Not 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.090
 the gea has been in the last few weeks 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.650
 brilliant performances 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.930
 and so had the protégés of 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.060
 coach andreas pure while respectful 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.850
 the primus of the league but they played 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.790
 still only seconds later 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.009
 met fabian seelbach for compensation in 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.580
 a match in which the audience still 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.860
 should be offered some hits 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.390
 the next one fell in the ninth minute 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.170
 markus wilk brought the remscheider in 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:06.110
 kevin karschau par excellence in the 16th 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.290
 minute then again from the ig 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.140
 continued to bid and fabian 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:15.590
 seelbach not only scored the 3 2 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.050
 but also new entry olivier with 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.260
 his hit for the 4 2 the remscheider 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.940
 further forward you saw in the 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.080
 hackenberger hall not only like 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.400
 looks southern jubilation but the 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.700
 table five sniffed at break 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.200
 also a sensation 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.700
 after the page change came the guests 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.220
 then better into the game 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.660
 it seemed like the coach had him 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:45.019
 powerfully washed his head 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:46.760
 in the 28 29 and 38 minute turned haring 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.420
 the game by the hits of kevin 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.460
 karschau whose brother lukas and robin 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.730
 schulz 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.820
 and remscheids portuguese that begrudged that 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.000
 Table leader does not succeed 5 5 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.040
 was only seconds later, 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.410
 herringer really seemed to be annoyed 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.540
 and they only took two minutes seriously 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.030
 needed the three just mentioned 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.010
 scorers to score three more hits 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.930
 achieve 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.110
 Three minutes before the end of the led 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.390
 table leader with three goals the number 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.660
 However, three did not seem to remember that 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.190
 to bring good luck if you are a spectator 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.890
 the remscheid games in the last 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.910
 have seen weeks know what 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.890
 the idea does not come up 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.770
 Marcinkowski scored the six to eight 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.610
 hit the jackpot and he wanted more 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:44.150
 in the 49 minute he even scored 72 8 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.400
 and then something came up 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.650
 top team like gentlemen in the 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.700
 last minute did not happen 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:55.430
 should there be the tenth teamfoul and 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.680
 that meant a direct one for the em 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.650
 only seconds before the end 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.320
 and because marcinkowski just fine in 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.840
 ride was and the number 3 this evening 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.730
 definitely a remscheid number was 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.480
 he grabbed the bullet and 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.910
 she sunk to the 88th 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.230
 everything else was overflowing with jubilation 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.080
 the point win against the table leader 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.780
 Hardly anyone expected that 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:23.230
 certainly not new access vitor 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.670
 olivera and captain markus wants 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.670
 Christian Kellermann spoke after the 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.840
 play with the two scorers 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.000
 he likes it quiet a super exciting 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.280
 play the first game for city directly 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.600
 Two goals were awarded to the team 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.370
 her husband to his performance 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.860
 yes we are definitely satisfied 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.360

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.010
 certainly there's 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.390
 potential for improvement because he has 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.830
 still one has still seen a lot 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.360
 Alone where made the walks of 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.410
 the co-players did not vote 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.030
 that he could not have guessed otherwise 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.670
 I think we are on a good one 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.650

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:42.349
 he could help his team 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:46.069
 not so good in the gameplay though 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:49.060
