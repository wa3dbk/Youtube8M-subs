choose power by type and this will power

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.320 
choose power by type and this will power
everything<00:01:23.100> up<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.460> nice<00:01:23.640> little<00:01:23.670> palace<00:01:24.210> here

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.899 
my movies my mp3s all those of night
nicely<00:01:37.140> organized<00:01:37.680> right<00:01:38.220> here<00:01:38.369> like<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:38.729> and

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
nicely organized right here like so and

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.550 
nicely organized right here like so and
I<00:01:38.970> can<00:01:39.119> click<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.450> them<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:40.229> scroll<00:01:40.500> through

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
I can click on them I can scroll through

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.170 
I can click on them I can scroll through
them<00:01:40.770> up<00:01:40.950> for<00:01:41.070> one<00:01:41.250> by<00:01:41.460> double<00:01:41.759> click<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.030> get

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
them up for one by double click I get

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.940 
them up for one by double click I get
this<00:01:42.270> kind<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.570> like<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> view<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.470> do<00:01:43.710> that

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
this kind of like a view I can do that

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.460 
this kind of like a view I can do that
and<00:01:44.420> just<00:01:45.420> like<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.020> can<00:01:46.170> still<00:01:46.320> do

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
and just like so you can still do

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.030 
and just like so you can still do
preview<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.329> everything<00:01:48.329> if<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.570> want<00:01:48.750> to

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
preview and everything if you want to

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.289 
preview and everything if you want to
and<00:01:50.040> also<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.399> do<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.520> search<00:01:50.729> like<00:01:51.180> that

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
and also you can do a search like that

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.730 
and also you can do a search like that
did<00:01:51.509> by<00:01:51.659> accident<00:01:51.689> there<00:01:52.170> but<00:01:52.350> also<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.619> can

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
did by accident there but also you can

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.740 
did by accident there but also you can
search<00:01:52.950> within<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.729> power<00:01:53.939> for<00:01:54.299> what<00:01:54.600> you're

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
search within the power for what you're

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.740 
search within the power for what you're
actually<00:01:54.869> looking<00:01:55.110> for<00:01:56.420> now<00:01:57.420> say<00:01:57.600> I'm<00:01:57.659> going

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
actually looking for now say I'm going

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.230 
actually looking for now say I'm going
to<00:01:57.840> undo<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.229> just<00:01:58.530> hit<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.829> undo<00:01:59.250> I'm

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
to undo that just hit that undo I'm

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.520 
to undo that just hit that undo I'm
gonna<00:02:00.360> have<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.570> go<00:02:00.630> back<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:00.990> little<00:02:01.170> bit<00:02:01.350> ways

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
gonna have to go back a little bit ways

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.310 
gonna have to go back a little bit ways
here<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:01.979> me<00:02:02.420> so<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.509> can<00:02:03.600> go<00:02:03.750> back<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.079> pretty

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
here and me so you can go back is pretty

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.709 
here and me so you can go back is pretty
much<00:02:04.409> an<00:02:04.560> infinite<00:02:05.340> undo<00:02:05.790> in<00:02:06.570> this

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
much an infinite undo in this

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.479 
much an infinite undo in this
application<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.500> now<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.649> got<00:02:07.890> back<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.310> where<00:02:08.459> I

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
application so now I got back to where I

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.800 
application so now I got back to where I
was<00:02:08.550> before<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:09.030> actually<00:02:09.179> piled<00:02:09.509> everything

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
was before I actually piled everything

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.930 
was before I actually piled everything
up<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.530> say<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.739> just<00:02:11.039> want<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.190> do<00:02:11.340> individual

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
up so say I just want to do individual

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.750 
up so say I just want to do individual
files<00:02:12.180> and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
files and

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.699 
files and
my<00:02:13.000> own<00:02:13.150> personal<00:02:13.599> stack<00:02:13.870> I<00:02:14.110> can<00:02:14.439> actually

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
my own personal stack I can actually

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.280 
my own personal stack I can actually
drag<00:02:14.950> this<00:02:15.250> great<00:02:15.879> little<00:02:16.030> circle<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.689> do

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
drag this great little circle and do

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.199 
drag this great little circle and do
like<00:02:17.500> this<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:17.860> make<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.069> pile<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.879> I<00:02:18.970> get<00:02:19.120> the

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
like this and make a pile and I get the

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.550 
like this and make a pile and I get the
option<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.569> make<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.780> little<00:02:20.049> power<00:02:20.230> for<00:02:20.439> this

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
option to make a little power for this

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.410 
option to make a little power for this
circle<00:02:20.890> right<00:02:21.010> here<00:02:21.069> I<00:02:21.400> can<00:02:21.790> drag<00:02:22.000> this<00:02:22.180> power

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
circle right here I can drag this power

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.420 
circle right here I can drag this power
anywhere<00:02:22.780> like<00:02:22.930> this<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.439> this<00:02:24.099> thing<00:02:24.250> has

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
anywhere like this and this thing has

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.800 
anywhere like this and this thing has
some<00:02:24.640> nice<00:02:24.760> little<00:02:25.060> physics<00:02:25.450> so<00:02:25.569> you<00:02:25.629> can

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
some nice little physics so you can

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.809 
some nice little physics so you can
throw<00:02:25.989> it<00:02:26.049> against<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.349> wall<00:02:26.409> like<00:02:26.799> so<00:02:27.040> you

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
throw it against the wall like so you

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.119 
throw it against the wall like so you
can<00:02:27.970> move<00:02:28.150> things<00:02:28.360> out<00:02:28.599> of<00:02:28.659> the<00:02:28.780> way<00:02:28.860> like<00:02:29.860> that

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
can move things out of the way like that

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.369 
can move things out of the way like that
haven't<00:02:30.760> gone<00:02:30.819> all<00:02:31.060> over<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.510> place<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:32.230> this

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
haven't gone all over the place so this

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.229 
haven't gone all over the place so this
is<00:02:32.409> definitely<00:02:32.709> has<00:02:33.099> no<00:02:33.280> purpose<00:02:33.579> at<00:02:33.790> all<00:02:33.849> just

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
is definitely has no purpose at all just

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.119 
is definitely has no purpose at all just
just<00:02:34.599> to<00:02:34.690> look<00:02:34.840> cool<00:02:35.079> and<00:02:35.709> they'll<00:02:35.980> have<00:02:36.099> a

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
just to look cool and they'll have a

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.280 
just to look cool and they'll have a
nice<00:02:36.459> little<00:02:36.579> effect<00:02:36.909> on<00:02:36.970> your<00:02:37.090> desktop<00:02:37.420> but

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
nice little effect on your desktop but

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.750 
nice little effect on your desktop but
anyway<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:38.560> got<00:02:38.739> this<00:02:38.829> file<00:02:39.069> right<00:02:39.099> here<00:02:39.310> and

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
anyway I got this file right here and

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
anyway I got this file right here and
this<00:02:39.819> application<00:02:40.299> does<00:02:40.420> work<00:02:40.629> with

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
this application does work with

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.990 
this application does work with
multi-touch<00:02:41.170> trackpad<00:02:42.129> so<00:02:42.670> if<00:02:42.730> you<00:02:42.790> have<00:02:42.909> this

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
multi-touch trackpad so if you have this

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.030 
multi-touch trackpad so if you have this
on<00:02:43.120> your<00:02:43.239> macbook<00:02:43.390> pro<00:02:43.780> your<00:02:44.049> macbook<00:02:44.470> or<00:02:44.680> you

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
on your macbook pro your macbook or you
