00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 and as I had anticipated in the review 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.870
 of the previous chapter became a reality 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.220
 this arch was an embole the chapter 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.780
 started with a call with the 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.550
 students of the class there are so that 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.469
 things march so that someone will 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.730
 deny that purpose and I have a reason 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.109
 so that some of the characters in 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.910
 turn finish turning over 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.740
 disclosures that equal the weight that 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.449
 had this bow to these evils the amount 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.220
 of words that said that character and that 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.779
 they end up importing three crap with one 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.609
 director who abandons the idea of ​​avoiding 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.930
 that they escape makes me shit 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.550
 ideology and the motivation that you 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.109
 they raised in the previous chapter with 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.120
 that of abducting for the purpose of 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.770
 keep education that same and the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.570
 fact that they could have exploited or 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.680
 touched some of the themes thoroughly like 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.360
 the fact that it seems that follows 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.129
 existing a government and see simply 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.309
 they go elements of study to have in 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.510
 tells the survival of the current world 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.309
 obviously there was not time for anything 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.379
 that but avoid the amount of details 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.030
 as much as possible that made this bow 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.789
 convert the poorest crossing of 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.870
 this series and if of course they pose 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.699
 that the redhead wants to destroy 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.109
 subjectively the world and sends you the 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.390
 little tip of what they are going to throw at you 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.010
 final session of the next chapters 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.290
 but that is linked to the topic that 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.780
 compete in this story well with 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.670
 conversations 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.229
 after a group of people who have 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.970
 distressed to refuse to leave so that 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.950
 few minutes later magically it 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.240
 join the cause to leave and loss 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.310
 of time in conversations that could 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.740
 have been taken advantage of by making 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.170
 lose precious moments just to see 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.300
 that could easily escape makes 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.220
 directly all this does not have in 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.840
 account in no other way than the 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.420
 added characters with future 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.009
 use without mentioning that despite the 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.180
 quality that is maintained they took the 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.190
 freedom to lighten a bit the 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.960
 budget neglecting a little 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.060
 characters and showing things like this 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.470
 this or this is a pity that 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.940
 waste the time of what they could 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.280
 have summarized in a chapter for 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.690
 leave some more time to orton alone 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.000
 I hope that this justifies what 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.100
 is coming for next week so be it 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.530
