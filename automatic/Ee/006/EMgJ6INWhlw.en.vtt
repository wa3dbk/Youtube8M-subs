the<00:03:19.970> heads<00:03:20.150> on<00:03:20.329> the<00:03:20.420> leg<00:03:20.599> and<00:03:20.870> then<00:03:21.049> this

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
the heads on the leg and then this

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.190 
the heads on the leg and then this
little<00:03:21.349> slot<00:03:21.680> here<00:03:22.299> you<00:03:23.299> plug<00:03:23.840> them<00:03:23.930> in<00:03:24.049> like

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
much glue I don't wanna risk breaking it

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.449 
much glue I don't wanna risk breaking it
but<00:03:41.510> it<00:03:42.290> looks<00:03:42.590> like<00:03:42.650> they're<00:03:42.980> connected<00:03:43.400> the

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
but it looks like they're connected the

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:44.379 
but it looks like they're connected the
same<00:03:43.639> way<00:03:43.760> and<00:03:43.910> he<00:03:43.970> should<00:03:44.120> have<00:03:44.269> some

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
same way and he should have some

same way and he should have some
rotation<00:03:44.870> but<00:03:45.049> not<00:03:45.590> seeing<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:46.459> here<00:03:46.760> on<00:03:47.120> the

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
rotation but not seeing it here on the

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:50.289 
rotation but not seeing it here on the
on<00:03:48.349> the<00:03:48.410> toy<00:03:48.799> itself<00:03:48.919> I<00:03:49.340> don't<00:03:49.819> like<00:03:49.849> set<00:03:50.120> it<00:03:50.209> on
