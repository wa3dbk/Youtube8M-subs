magnet system or even a 12-volt solenoid

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.480 
magnet system or even a 12-volt solenoid
and<00:01:20.300> then<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.590> lot<00:01:21.710> so<00:01:21.890> you<00:01:21.980> have<00:01:22.130> here<00:01:22.310> is<00:01:22.460> a

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
and then the lot so you have here is a

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.090 
and then the lot so you have here is a
gate<00:01:22.790> timing<00:01:23.210> a<00:01:23.360> lot<00:01:23.960> of<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:24.230> electromagnets

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
gate timing a lot of the electromagnets

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.280 
gate timing a lot of the electromagnets
out<00:01:25.280> there<00:01:25.490> have<00:01:25.700> different<00:01:26.360> discharge<00:01:26.960> times

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
out there have different discharge times

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.380 
out there have different discharge times
so<00:01:28.010> we<00:01:28.160> felt<00:01:28.400> it<00:01:28.490> was<00:01:28.550> important<00:01:29.120> for<00:01:29.240> you<00:01:29.300> to

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
so we felt it was important for you to

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.470 
so we felt it was important for you to
be<00:01:29.510> able<00:01:29.600> to<00:01:29.720> customize<00:01:30.650> the<00:01:30.890> timing<00:01:31.480> between

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
be able to customize the timing between

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.590 
be able to customize the timing between
the<00:01:33.470> fourth<00:01:33.920> tone<00:01:34.220> and<00:01:34.520> green<00:01:34.730> light<00:01:34.910> and<00:01:35.210> when

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
the fourth tone and green light and when

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.570 
the fourth tone and green light and when
the<00:01:35.720> gate<00:01:35.900> actually<00:01:36.290> drops<00:01:36.650> with<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.220> magnet

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
the gate actually drops with the magnet

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.910 
the gate actually drops with the magnet
so<00:01:38.060> with<00:01:38.420> this<00:01:38.630> you<00:01:38.840> can<00:01:38.990> adjust<00:01:39.320> that<00:01:39.410> timing

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
so with this you can adjust that timing

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.380 
so with this you can adjust that timing
and<00:01:40.070> get<00:01:40.190> it<00:01:40.280> right<00:01:40.490> on<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.730> money<00:01:40.850> so<00:01:41.240> your

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
and get it right on the money so your

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.880 
and get it right on the money so your
rider<00:01:41.630> has<00:01:41.900> perfect<00:01:42.350> experience<00:01:44.650> the<00:01:45.650> last

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
rider has perfect experience the last

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.650 
rider has perfect experience the last
thing<00:01:46.070> you'll<00:01:46.190> see<00:01:46.370> here<00:01:46.610> this<00:01:46.820> is<00:01:47.030> our<00:01:47.240> power

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
thing you'll see here this is our power

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.740 
thing you'll see here this is our power
port<00:01:48.080> and<00:01:48.500> I'll<00:01:49.220> explain<00:01:49.550> a<00:01:49.610> little<00:01:49.730> bit<00:01:50.030> on

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
port and I'll explain a little bit on

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.660 
port and I'll explain a little bit on
that<00:01:51.140> later<00:01:51.830> on<00:01:52.010> when<00:01:52.160> I<00:01:52.220> talk<00:01:52.400> about<00:01:52.490> the

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
that later on when I talk about the

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
sullenly so what I have here this is the

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:54.090 
sullenly so what I have here this is the
BSG<00:04:48.720> power<00:04:49.720> unit<00:04:50.140> right<00:04:50.890> it<00:04:52.470> our<00:04:53.470> power<00:04:53.740> port

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
BSG power unit right it our power port

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.360 
BSG power unit right it our power port
that<00:04:54.310> connects<00:04:54.670> from<00:04:55.590> here<00:04:56.590> to<00:04:56.980> the<00:04:57.070> side<00:04:57.250> of

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
that connects from here to the side of

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.990 
that connects from here to the side of
the<00:04:57.430> control<00:04:57.790> box<00:04:58.110> with<00:04:59.110> small<00:04:59.950> cable<00:05:00.310> we<00:05:00.820> can

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
the control box with small cable we can

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.580 
the control box with small cable we can
customize<00:05:01.450> that<00:05:01.690> length<00:05:01.960> for<00:05:02.200> whatever<00:05:02.350> you

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
customize that length for whatever you

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.110 
customize that length for whatever you
need<00:05:02.620> whatever<00:05:03.250> you<00:05:03.430> feel<00:05:03.580> you<00:05:03.700> need<00:05:03.880> the

need whatever you feel you need the

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.870 
need whatever you feel you need the
distance<00:05:04.480> you<00:05:04.570> want<00:05:04.690> between<00:05:05.080> them<00:05:05.230> and<00:05:05.880> it

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
distance you want between them and it

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
distance you want between them and it
also<00:05:07.090> has<00:05:08.520> your<00:05:09.520> choice<00:05:09.880> depending<00:05:10.360> on<00:05:10.480> on

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
also has your choice depending on on

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.080 
also has your choice depending on on
your<00:05:11.020> gate<00:05:11.230> system<00:05:11.500> we<00:05:12.250> have<00:05:12.400> direct<00:05:12.880> control

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
your gate system we have direct control

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.020 
your gate system we have direct control
or<00:05:13.540> reverse<00:05:14.200> control<00:05:14.620> basically<00:05:15.520> that<00:05:15.760> has<00:05:15.880> to

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
or reverse control basically that has to

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.540 
or reverse control basically that has to
do<00:05:16.180> with<00:05:16.360> when<00:05:16.930> the<00:05:17.320> power<00:05:17.500> is<00:05:17.680> on<00:05:17.860> is<00:05:18.220> the<00:05:18.370> gate

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
do with when the power is on is the gate

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.850 
do with when the power is on is the gate
up<00:05:18.730> or<00:05:19.120> is<00:05:19.210> the<00:05:19.270> gate<00:05:19.450> down<00:05:19.630> and<00:05:19.960> you<00:05:20.680> can

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
up or is the gate down and you can

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.840 
up or is the gate down and you can
switch<00:05:21.130> that<00:05:21.370> with<00:05:21.580> this<00:05:21.730> key<00:05:22.000> with<00:05:22.570> this<00:05:23.850> so

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
switch that with this key with this so

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.600 
switch that with this key with this so
simply<00:05:25.210> with<00:05:25.330> this<00:05:25.450> one<00:05:25.690> again<00:05:26.470> you<00:05:26.500> plug<00:05:27.430> this

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
simply with this one again you plug this

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.170 
simply with this one again you plug this
into<00:05:28.440> your<00:05:29.440> extension<00:05:29.980> cord<00:05:30.010> you<00:05:30.970> should

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
into your extension cord you should

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.350 
into your extension cord you should
probably<00:05:31.390> use<00:05:31.570> a<00:05:31.600> GFI<00:05:32.850> connection<00:05:33.850> when

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
probably use a GFI connection when

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.020 
probably use a GFI connection when
you're<00:05:34.480> outdoors<00:05:34.980> you<00:05:35.980> connect<00:05:36.310> this<00:05:36.490> into

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
you're outdoors you connect this into

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.660 
you're outdoors you connect this into
your<00:05:37.390> start<00:05:38.020> gate<00:05:38.200> to<00:05:38.590> the<00:05:38.710> solenoid<00:05:39.370> that

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.670 
your start gate to the solenoid that

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:46.220 
your start gate to the solenoid that
drives<00:05:40.570> your<00:05:40.750> gate<00:05:42.780> you<00:05:43.780> take<00:05:44.050> your<00:05:44.980> connector

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
drives your gate you take your connector

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:51.600 
drives your gate you take your connector
plug<00:05:47.230> it<00:05:47.320> in<00:05:47.410> there<00:05:47.850> and<00:05:49.350> then<00:05:50.350> you<00:05:50.890> plug<00:05:51.460> it

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
plug it in there and then you plug it

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.530 
plug it in there and then you plug it
into<00:05:52.680> the<00:05:53.680> control<00:05:54.040> system<00:05:54.490> now<00:05:54.700> when<00:05:55.390> you're

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
into the control system now when you're

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.630 
into the control system now when you're
using<00:05:55.570> when<00:05:56.470> you're<00:05:56.590> using<00:05:56.830> the<00:05:57.130> power<00:05:57.370> unit

using when you're using the power unit
you<00:05:58.240> do<00:05:58.480> not<00:05:58.690> need<00:05:58.930> to<00:05:59.080> connect<00:06:00.600> the<00:06:01.600> control

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
you do not need to connect the control

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.350 
you do not need to connect the control
box<00:06:02.230> to<00:06:02.530> a<00:06:02.560> 12<00:06:02.800> volt<00:06:02.950> power<00:06:03.130> supply<00:06:03.400> the<00:06:04.090> power
