00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.790 
head with a teapot so we decided we'd
sit<00:04:32.330> her<00:04:32.389> in<00:04:32.419> timeout<00:04:32.780> for<00:04:33.169> a<00:04:33.260> little<00:04:33.470> bit<00:04:33.590> and

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
sit her in timeout for a little bit and

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:40.150 
sit her in timeout for a little bit and
she's<00:04:34.070> really<00:04:34.430> mad<00:04:34.669> so<00:04:38.410> I<00:04:39.410> guess<00:04:39.889> we're<00:04:40.100> gonna

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
she's really mad so I guess we're gonna

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.670 
she's really mad so I guess we're gonna
take<00:04:40.490> pison<00:04:40.729> at<00:04:41.150> a<00:04:41.180> time<00:04:41.479> now<00:04:41.720> because<00:04:42.260> she's

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
take pison at a time now because she's

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.800 
take pison at a time now because she's
trying<00:04:43.039> to<00:04:43.310> climb<00:04:43.490> out<00:04:43.760> of<00:04:43.789> the<00:04:43.970> chair<00:04:44.330> and

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
trying to climb out of the chair and

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.020 
trying to climb out of the chair and
she's<00:04:45.650> been<00:04:45.860> sitting<00:04:46.070> there<00:04:46.220> for<00:04:46.669> all<00:04:46.789> about

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
she's been sitting there for all about

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.969 
she's been sitting there for all about
five<00:04:47.360> minutes<00:04:47.750> so<00:04:48.110> I<00:04:48.199> think<00:04:48.260> she<00:04:48.590> realized

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
five minutes so I think she realized

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:50.379 
five minutes so I think she realized
that<00:04:49.130> she<00:04:49.370> shouldn't<00:04:49.580> hit<00:04:49.789> her<00:04:49.880> sister<00:04:50.210> with<00:04:50.360> a

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
that she shouldn't hit her sister with a

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.289 
that she shouldn't hit her sister with a
teapot<00:04:50.660> anymore
