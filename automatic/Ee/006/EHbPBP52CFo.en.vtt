00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.290 

as<00:00:30.289> I<00:00:30.859> travel<00:00:31.220> around<00:00:31.310> teaching<00:00:31.699> woodworking

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
as I travel around teaching woodworking

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.580 
as I travel around teaching woodworking
one<00:00:32.480> of<00:00:32.599> the<00:00:32.689> things<00:00:32.900> that<00:00:33.050> I<00:00:33.140> really<00:00:33.350> enjoy

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
one of the things that I really enjoy

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.740 
one of the things that I really enjoy
doing<00:00:33.800> is<00:00:34.400> dispelling<00:00:34.970> this<00:00:35.239> myth<00:00:35.540> that

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
doing is dispelling this myth that

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.110 
doing is dispelling this myth that
dovetailing<00:00:36.260> is<00:00:36.620> reserved<00:00:37.550> only<00:00:37.760> for<00:00:37.910> those

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
dovetailing is reserved only for those

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.940 
dovetailing is reserved only for those
most<00:00:38.450> skilled<00:00:38.840> and<00:00:39.079> that<00:00:39.559> it<00:00:39.650> takes<00:00:39.770> a

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
most skilled and that it takes a

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.460 
most skilled and that it takes a
lifetime<00:00:40.220> of<00:00:40.640> practice<00:00:40.879> to<00:00:41.329> do<00:00:41.450> it<00:00:41.600> here's<00:00:42.290> how

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
lifetime of practice to do it here's how

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.340 
lifetime of practice to do it here's how
I<00:00:42.500> dispel<00:00:43.250> it<00:00:43.370> I<00:00:43.610> even<00:00:44.449> would<00:00:44.720> normally<00:00:45.110> teach

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
I dispel it I even would normally teach

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.049 
I dispel it I even would normally teach

workshop<00:00:47.600> and<00:00:47.840> my<00:00:48.170> formula<00:00:48.739> is<00:00:48.820> 70%<00:00:49.820> of<00:00:49.879> your

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
workshop and my formula is 70% of your

workshop and my formula is 70% of your
ability<00:00:50.420> to<00:00:50.510> cut<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:50.809> joint<00:00:51.080> are<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:51.800> tools

ability to cut the joint are the tools
you're<00:00:52.190> using<00:00:52.540> 20%<00:00:53.540> is<00:00:53.629> the<00:00:53.750> technique<00:00:54.110> and

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
you're using 20% is the technique and

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.650 
you're using 20% is the technique and
only<00:00:54.500> 10%<00:00:54.710> is<00:00:55.070> practice<00:00:55.550> how<00:00:56.030> can<00:00:56.180> I<00:00:56.269> prove<00:00:56.480> it

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
only 10% is practice how can I prove it

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.500 
only 10% is practice how can I prove it
well<00:00:57.260> after<00:00:57.410> a<00:00:57.589> four<00:00:57.890> hour<00:00:58.040> session<00:00:58.190> out<00:00:59.059> of<00:00:59.210> 12

well after a four hour session out of 12
individuals<00:01:00.220> usually<00:01:01.220> will<00:01:01.370> find<00:01:01.640> three<00:01:01.940> or

mine it's not always easy to get their
samples<00:01:12.950> but<00:01:13.250> occasionally<00:01:13.700> I<00:01:13.790> do<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.240> here's

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689

today<00:01:36.830> now<00:01:37.430> there<00:01:37.610> are<00:01:37.730> those<00:01:37.910> that<00:01:38.120> will

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
today now there are those that will

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.640 
today now there are those that will
argue<00:01:38.600> with<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.840> way<00:01:38.960> I<00:01:38.990> do<00:01:39.110> things

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
argue with the way I do things

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.260 
argue with the way I do things
that's<00:01:40.040> fine<00:01:40.340> everyone<00:01:40.730> is<00:01:40.850> entitled<00:01:41.090> to
