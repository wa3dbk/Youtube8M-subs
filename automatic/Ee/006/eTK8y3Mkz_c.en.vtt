or something who again at the last stage
and<00:03:09.060> obviously<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.209> thing<00:03:10.420> to<00:03:10.510> avoid<00:03:10.660> doing

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
and obviously the thing to avoid doing

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.410 
and obviously the thing to avoid doing
is<00:03:11.470> overcooking<00:03:12.100> it<00:03:14.190> so<00:03:15.190> that<00:03:15.400> covers<00:03:15.700> whole

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
is overcooking it so that covers whole

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.050 
is overcooking it so that covers whole
prawns<00:03:16.989> and<00:03:17.500> basically<00:03:18.310> these<00:03:18.670> are<00:03:18.880> pretty

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
prawns and basically these are pretty

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.789 
prawns and basically these are pretty
economical<00:03:19.720> these<00:03:20.170> are<00:03:20.320> rather<00:03:20.470> more

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
economical these are rather more

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.100 
economical these are rather more
expensive<00:03:21.459> these<00:03:21.880> are<00:03:22.150> an<00:03:22.209> arm<00:03:22.360> and<00:03:22.540> a<00:03:22.570> leg<00:03:22.600> job

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
expensive these are an arm and a leg job

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.970 
expensive these are an arm and a leg job
I<00:03:23.350> think<00:03:24.220> that<00:03:24.549> we<00:03:25.180> sell<00:03:25.420> batters<00:03:25.810> up<00:03:25.959> we<00:03:26.739> sell

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
I think that we sell batters up we sell

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.240 
I think that we sell batters up we sell
those<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:27.579> porns<00:03:28.120> as<00:03:28.299> a<00:03:28.360> pack<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:29.769> basically

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
those to porns as a pack and basically

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.009 
those to porns as a pack and basically
you've<00:03:30.489> got<00:03:30.519> it's<00:03:31.000> almost<00:03:31.269> like<00:03:31.510> having<00:03:31.660> two

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
you've got it's almost like having two

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.979 
you've got it's almost like having two
small<00:03:32.170> lobsters<00:03:32.799> and<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:34.269> price<00:03:34.510> is<00:03:34.540> pretty

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
small lobsters and the price is pretty

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.380 
small lobsters and the price is pretty
similar<00:03:35.230> to<00:03:35.350> buying<00:03:35.620> a<00:03:35.799> lobster<00:03:36.220> now<00:03:37.000> we<00:03:37.060> also

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
similar to buying a lobster now we also

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:44.759 
similar to buying a lobster now we also
sell<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.470> same<00:03:38.680> Proms<00:03:39.549> peeled<00:03:42.329> so<00:03:43.329> this<00:03:44.019> is

that one cooked it comes out a little
bit<00:04:07.870> smaller<00:04:08.200> because<00:04:08.320> the<00:04:08.470> prawn<00:04:08.799> shrinks<00:04:09.250> a

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
bit smaller because the prawn shrinks a

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.649 
bit smaller because the prawn shrinks a
bit<00:04:09.519> when<00:04:09.700> you<00:04:09.850> cook<00:04:10.060> it<00:04:10.269> very<00:04:10.900> nice<00:04:11.890> to<00:04:12.100> eat

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
it's got a good crunch and these are
