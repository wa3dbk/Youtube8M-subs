 or a way of how to pose before a 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.770
 camera really if they search the internet 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.140

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.730
 different images later where are we going 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.920
 to find geometric shapes like 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.920
 pictures triangles ovals 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.410

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.450
 part of your body perfect and even 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.030
 Even your hair knows how to move when walking 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.310
