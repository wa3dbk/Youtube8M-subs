the power with a polar bear grip with

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.660 
the power with a polar bear grip with
the<00:00:20.640> convenience<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.570> polar<00:00:21.779> bear<00:00:21.990> cub<00:00:22.670> when

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
the convenience of a polar bear cub when

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.279 
the convenience of a polar bear cub when
the<00:00:23.760> intended<00:00:24.119> target<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.510> small<00:00:24.779> simply

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
the intended target is small simply

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.900 
the intended target is small simply
remove<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.650> handle<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.130> use<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.760> cub<00:00:28.910> built

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
remove the handle and use the cub built

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.790 
remove the handle and use the cub built
with<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.240> same<00:00:30.269> high-quality<00:00:31.050> steel<00:00:31.380> as<00:00:31.619> the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
with the same high-quality steel as the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:40.209 
with the same high-quality steel as the

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.819 

when<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.370> weed<00:00:41.550> or<00:00:41.820> tree<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.420> larger<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.079> will

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
when the weed or tree is larger and will

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.470 
when the weed or tree is larger and will
need<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.129> extra<00:00:44.430> pulling<00:00:44.730> power<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.239> grip

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
need the extra pulling power of the grip

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.490 
need the extra pulling power of the grip
all<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.410> do<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:47.129> simply<00:00:47.430> slip<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.600> longer

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
all you do is simply slip the longer

grip don't be fooled by the beautiful
yellow<00:00:55.379> flowers<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:56.129> these<00:00:56.520> trees<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.239> bushes

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
yellow flowers on these trees and bushes

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.720 
yellow flowers on these trees and bushes
it's<00:00:58.140> called<00:00:58.350> Scotch<00:00:58.680> broom<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.579> an

invasive species

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.740 
invasive species
now<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.280> you've<00:01:02.399> attached<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.090> longer

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
now that you've attached the longer

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.090 
now that you've attached the longer
handle<00:01:05.960> you<00:01:06.960> will<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.530> extra<00:01:07.890> leverage

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
handle you will have the extra leverage

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:16.360 
handle you will have the extra leverage
needed<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.790> uproot<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.420> larger<00:01:09.720> plant

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.250 

after<00:01:17.370> removed<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:17.940> larger<00:01:18.570> plant<00:01:18.810> smaller

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
after removed this larger plant smaller

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.800 
after removed this larger plant smaller
saplings<00:01:19.800> are<00:01:19.979> now<00:01:20.130> exposed<00:01:20.550> and<00:01:20.909> now<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.510> can

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
saplings are now exposed and now you can

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.149 
saplings are now exposed and now you can
go<00:01:21.930> back<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.440> cub

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.309 

removing<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.149> handle<00:01:30.329> reduces<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> weight

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319 
removing the handle reduces the weight

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:33.380 
removing the handle reduces the weight
of<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.530> tool<00:01:31.710> by<00:01:31.920> almost<00:01:32.189> 6<00:01:32.429> pounds<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:33.329> is

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
of the tool by almost 6 pounds this is

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.389 
of the tool by almost 6 pounds this is
important<00:01:34.049> if<00:01:34.289> there's<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.619> long<00:01:34.890> day<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.130> wheat

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
important if there's a long day of wheat

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:45.870 
important if there's a long day of wheat
pulling<00:01:35.729> ahead

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.819 

as<00:01:45.939> you<00:01:46.659> can<00:01:46.780> see<00:01:46.960> it<00:01:47.200> takes<00:01:47.350> just<00:01:47.590> five

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
as you can see it takes just five

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.950 
as you can see it takes just five
seconds<00:01:48.310> to<00:01:48.430> switch<00:01:48.640> from<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:48.939> grip<00:01:49.180> to<00:01:49.899> the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
seconds to switch from the grip to the

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.080 
seconds to switch from the grip to the
cub<00:01:50.200> and<00:01:50.409> then<00:01:51.009> back<00:01:51.219> again<00:01:53.490> it's<00:01:54.490> just<00:01:54.640> that
