00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 how to store video packets are not on at the 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.370
 mommies we canal can store them here 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.670
 in a way like in principle we used to be and 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.280
 did give them a whole box but they became 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.160
 require even more space so with 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.060
 the transformation happened to them 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.720
 and everyone was happy now with us 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.840
 bags are complicated like this 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:30.029
 triangles that do not fall apart 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:34.530
 very convenient to take them with you in your purse 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:39.110
 and store very convenient how is it 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.110
 done take a bag 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:47.090
 fold in half along 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:50.430
 and even in half such a narrow striped 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:55.379
 start folding from the end 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.539
 where there is no handle corner turned later 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.059
 side of the triangle then by 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.899
 hypotenuse 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.189
 then rolled down again at how there 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.250
 triangle so it and fold 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.200
 became when we have upstairs 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.680
 bag pocket 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.140
 then bend the rest slightly 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.560
 package so that it was not very long 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.520
 and make it out of it too 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.369
 triangle turned out two identical 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.909
 triangle one freely enters 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.420
 other 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:35.780
 and it turns out such a strong triangle 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.780
 one more time to fix 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.780
 we fold 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.850
 then triangles we shake 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:53.310
 pocket remains here bend the handle 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.500
 we fold the same triangle ok a 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.870
 the second side and push through 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.390
 one triangle with another and now you can 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.610
 make a collection of such bags 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.360
 stay mommy channels us soon 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.750
 will knit 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.750
 until
