00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.770
 the Bible is a really fat book when you look at it Hausen 400 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:09.499
 pages 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:12.859
 "He blasphemes Miley's father to depth the Augsburg 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:16.489
 I want to explain to them for ten minutes why they have this thick book at all 

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:18.429
 It's not so difficult to do that 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:20.519
 the message that basically the 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:25.619
 God is good and God, out of free will, created an earth which 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.439
 in sight was good and beautiful 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.460
 and the crown of creation should be a Wefers saying that God is his whole 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.230
 Credit crunch the bidders would have preferred 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.129
 the people 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.120
 as a special person is the Korth 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.329
 has given free will to these beings has association with free will 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.550
 to say yes or no to God 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.600
 the problem is that people have voluntarily decided no to 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.370
 To say goodbye to God is enough to say and to evil 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.960
 and because of the supremacy of man because of the particular would 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.810
 of the human 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.129
 this should be the case of man 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.299
 negative effects on the whole creation and the whole 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:03.750
 Had human history 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.379
 but that was not the end 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.720
 God has decided 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.760
 with those people who did not care for him who ran away 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.300
 by him 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.340
 to get in touch and he has made contact with a person whom I have 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.420
 but have 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.590
 but if one has as ancestor of the people of the Jews the people is this choice and 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.830
 God has tried with this one 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.860
 to come in contact and show how free Wiegand is already 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.170
 he showed that he is good 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.220
 lovingly this is very fascinating as the Sacred Heart 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.630
 but from that he also claims Hoppes that's absolutely interested in that 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.090
 we as people live our lives 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.290
 he wanted us as humans 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.620
 literally also with good manners with our time with us and with money 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.430
 our language with our sexuality these are the concrete things inside 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.130
 bypass 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.970
 and the whole history of the Old Testament 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.119
 marked by a drama 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.320
 namely, God's attempt to reveal himself to the people was three 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.600
 but at the same time the realization that his people are his beloved people 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.770
 keeps running away from him 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.389
 the tragic end 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:12.639
 and it seems that this is king kingdom is free of strangers 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:17.489
 Powers were occupied and destroyed and get into this situation and themselves 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:18.959
 Capus looked like he did 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.419
 God was happy, but he is loosing this people 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:26.690
 runs away from him and and does not understand God in this situation 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.650
 in an almost incredible happens and it marks the transition from old to old 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.859
 New Testament 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:35.919
 and we believe that Christians have decided there 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:39.210
 in a human being to be sorry 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.790
 something similar looks like if I had Aquarium would like to fish then 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:43.930
 he talks to the fish 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.780
 I would have to look heavy then because I can honestly put my head under water 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.559
 say hello here I am and so 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:52.499
 the fish would only be able to understand a message if I introduce myself 

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:55.709
 Fish would compare it to the example and Bevern 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.259
 Weidlich - rightly 

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:02.869
 God becomes man in Jesus Christ and a Jew to people of Nazareth and 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:04.029
 he shows 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:06.780
 in his life and in his teaching 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.839
 how God is and how we should live 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:12.360
 Jesus actually only has one message and that message is 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.229
 love 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:14.710
 the message is first 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.250
 God is the love of God's consuming love he is one 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.630
 passionate lover of people who will get in touch 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.550
 who would do anything for it 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.559
 un-member year and with me 

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:29.950
 to get into conversation in personal contacts of friendship 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.590
 and second, Jesus says that's the only one 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.400
 what God actually really of our world not quite a few filmed 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.670
 a lot of religious duty fulfills any there men 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.880
 especially what he really cares about is love 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.169
 in interpersonal trade 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:47.999
 that we 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:51.989
 Other people love roads since the day of Jesus but that will be offered 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.909
 also rivets in the order 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:58.040
 that in the first place God besides that build up his relationship with him and 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.480
 out of this power 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.589
 maybe we will love ourselves and our fellow human beings 

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:03.829
 the problem is 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.159
 Jesus us with this fair CEP Patzelt against the Zeitgeist of that epoch 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.109
 He ran directly to the right place 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.209
 though he has done signs &amp; wonders the 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.160
 He was arrested and executed and was seen by whole people 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.450
 crucified in the most cruel way 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.319
 we could ever be executed on topics 

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:25.050
 the incredible message of Christianity is 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.140
 this is 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.050
 total failure 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.930
 the best man who ever lived the man who was God Himself 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.900
 that this total failed 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.029
 became the turning point of the whole of human history 

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:39.189
 because he stepped 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:41.250
 loved us humans so much 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.680
 that Sam became human 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.740
 ourselves the bitterest dead 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.740
 out of love she eats and for me Staab and so on 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.039
 the accumulated misery 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:56.999
 that sin had come to guide and transform itself 

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:58.110
 Spohn I think 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.870
 this god does not demand that we hear quality is any 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.080
 first climb us to accept 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.270
 but the message of Jesus Christ 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.070
 that is a gift 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.180
 In the free gift of the book can accept that is nothing that can earn 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.870
 Rethem hands do not deserve 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.069
 Jesus Christ died on the cross 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:18.110
 for sinners 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.160
 To make DiTech and the Met fair and in this connection to Poland he 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:26.560
 God has always dreamed of Bolt from the boss from the beginning 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.150
 the end of the Bible the last books 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.879
 show how the first Christians lived to show that 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:39.569
 as the Holy Spirit entered into people on the day of Pentecost 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:42.689
 enable us to live as we have lived in unbelievable ways 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.290
 lives 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.250
 he emphasizes it 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.419
 to accomplish the works 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.970
 which Jesus did to transform Maneth and his character 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:53.630
 Holy Spirit of the DAX other 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.189
 but the cadres man 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:57.000
 through supernatural gifts 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.059
 and also through 

00:05:58.059 --> 00:06:00.939
 but its fruits change our behavior 

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:04.200
 At the same time we also see how the young Kathrin Krampf 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.220
 against the evil not against people and unbelievers 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.460
 against IK that negative against this way against the devil against the fashion that 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.850
 we are called biggest 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.369
 have died after the Jesus and risen is inhabited since death 

00:06:18.369 --> 00:06:20.099
 we stand between 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:22.169
 the area everyone between situation 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:24.949
 between Jesus' resurrection and ascension 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:26.440
 and when he comes again 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.220
 Jesus said daily to come back to this hostel 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:30.830
 to rule 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.139
 around this earth 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:35.979
 to bring renewed under reference of my father but pale 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:39.840
 in Ferlach life comes with a break 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.189
 where are parts of his reign television 

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:45.380
 we can see here change our lives we can keep ourselves 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.380
 but at the same time, the world still has plenty of time left 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.180
 not only that 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.180
 where we praise what are the costs to change 

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:57.769
 we see that in the early church that did that but the bunderat the 

00:06:57.769 --> 00:07:01.059
 Outlook in the last book of the Bible and thus come at the end 

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:02.840
 the end of this short performance 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.380
 how do you see the end? 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.379
 Jesus comes again 

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:09.260
 to judge the bad ones to reward the good ones and one 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.360
 to create a kingdom of peace and glory 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.350
 and partly that you can use our own power by here 

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:17.639
 politically perfect 

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:21.659
 Raise Things Year We are called Mazda Barton a better world 

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:25.839
 but in the end, we believe that Jesus will come back to make everything new 

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:28.080
 to comfort the mourners 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.680
 Down reaches of peace and justice 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.010
 that is the whole Bible explained a few minutes 

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.840
 Have fun reading Traub
