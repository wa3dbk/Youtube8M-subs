sort<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.870> new<00:00:54.989> experiment<00:00:55.620> with<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.800> team

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
sort of new experiment with this team

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.610 
sort of new experiment with this team
was<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.489> vascular<00:00:57.180> which<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.140> like<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.289> choice

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
was the vascular which is like a choice

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.639 
was the vascular which is like a choice
scarf<00:00:58.949> aunt<00:00:59.219> Eileen<00:00:59.579> vascular<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.500> figured<00:01:01.500> it

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
scarf aunt Eileen vascular I figured it

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.020 
scarf aunt Eileen vascular I figured it
would<00:01:01.739> make<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> good<00:01:02.070> lead<00:01:02.309> because<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.850> does

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
would make a good lead because it does

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.539 
would make a good lead because it does
get<00:01:03.180> mold<00:01:03.449> breaker<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.100> waterfall<00:01:05.100> obviously

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
get mold breaker and waterfall obviously

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.990 
get mold breaker and waterfall obviously
so<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.840> know<00:01:06.960> nine<00:01:07.680> times<00:01:07.710> out<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.189> ten<00:01:08.250> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
so you know nine times out of ten the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.520 
so you know nine times out of ten the
leaf<00:01:09.210> Pokemon<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.689> gonna<00:01:09.840> be<00:01:09.960> weak<00:01:10.170> against

and<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.170> go<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.290> sound<00:01:43.649> true<00:01:44.030> now<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.210> was<00:01:45.390> kind

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
and I go to sound true now this was kind

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.240 
and I go to sound true now this was kind
of<00:01:45.570> awkward<00:01:45.720> because<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.229> think<00:01:46.409> he<00:01:46.680> has<00:01:46.770> like<00:01:47.009> I

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
of awkward because I think he has like I

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.190 
of awkward because I think he has like I
think<00:01:47.970> it's<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.149> vault<00:01:48.420> turn<00:01:48.600> thing<00:01:48.869> going<00:01:49.110> on

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
think it's a vault turn thing going on

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.580 
think it's a vault turn thing going on
with<00:01:49.439> electrode<00:01:50.399> plus<00:01:50.759> swellow<00:01:51.590> obviously

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
with electrode plus swellow obviously

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.770 
with electrode plus swellow obviously
going<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.159> outspeed<00:01:53.490> my<00:01:53.700> entire<00:01:54.000> team<00:01:54.270> both<00:01:54.600> of

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
going to outspeed my entire team both of

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.109 
going to outspeed my entire team both of
them<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.549> kind<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.579> got<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.790> work<00:01:56.939> around

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
them so I kind of got to work around

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.639 
them so I kind of got to work around
this<00:01:57.390> try<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.659> get<00:01:57.840> some<00:01:58.020> momentum<00:01:58.140> back<00:01:58.619> in

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
this try and get some momentum back in

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.570 
this try and get some momentum back in
my<00:01:58.860> favor

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
my favor

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.670 
my favor
so<00:02:00.120> I<00:02:00.150> got<00:02:00.330> him<00:02:00.420> Inferno<00:02:00.870> hoping<00:02:01.440> he<00:02:01.560> doesn't

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
so I got him Inferno hoping he doesn't

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.650 
so I got him Inferno hoping he doesn't
go<00:02:01.950> for<00:02:01.980> sleep<00:02:02.340> powder<00:02:02.550> which<00:02:02.880> he<00:02:03.300> doesn't

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
go for sleep powder which he doesn't

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.590 
go for sleep powder which he doesn't
which<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.900> great<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.550> could<00:02:05.550> go<00:02:05.700> fire<00:02:06.030> punch<00:02:06.270> but

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
which is great I could go fire punch but

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.380 
which is great I could go fire punch but
I<00:02:06.780> think<00:02:07.290> he<00:02:07.500> has<00:02:07.710> something<00:02:08.100> to<00:02:08.460> take<00:02:09.240> that

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
I think he has something to take that

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.120 
I think he has something to take that
pretty<00:02:09.630> well<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:10.170> forget<00:02:10.649> what<00:02:10.740> he<00:02:10.860> has<00:02:10.950> left

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
pretty well I forget what he has left

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.100 
pretty well I forget what he has left
but<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.430> double<00:02:11.760> out<00:02:11.850> Tabasco<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.420> expecting

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
but I double out Tabasco and expecting

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.530 
but I double out Tabasco and expecting
one<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.190> walls<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.580> come<00:02:14.760> in<00:02:14.880> maybe<00:02:15.450> you

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
one of the walls to come in maybe you

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.770 
one of the walls to come in maybe you
like<00:02:15.690> mr.<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:16.770> us<00:02:16.860> or<00:02:17.010> something<00:02:17.510> but<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.600> turns

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
like mr. of us or something but it turns

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.710 
like mr. of us or something but it turns
out<00:02:18.870> he<00:02:19.020> randomly<00:02:19.200> goes<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.680> electrode<00:02:20.160> which

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
out he randomly goes to electrode which

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.840 
out he randomly goes to electrode which
either<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:21.990> was<00:02:22.110> like<00:02:22.230> an<00:02:22.410> amazing<00:02:22.850> super

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
either that was like an amazing super

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.480 
either that was like an amazing super
prediction<00:02:24.300> there<00:02:24.480> or<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:24.990> just<00:02:25.110> felt<00:02:25.380> like

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
prediction there or you just felt like

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.040 
prediction there or you just felt like
electrode<00:02:26.490> was<00:02:26.610> worth<00:02:26.820> you<00:02:27.480> know<00:02:27.510> taking<00:02:27.870> a

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
electrode was worth you know taking a

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.000 
electrode was worth you know taking a
hit<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.440> then<00:02:29.100> retaliating<00:02:29.670> back<00:02:30.000> but<00:02:31.010> yeah

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
hit and then retaliating back but yeah

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.830 
hit and then retaliating back but yeah
whatever<00:02:32.310> go<00:02:32.460> back<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.730> grumpig<00:02:33.180> now<00:02:33.690> of

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
whatever go back to grumpig now of

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.750 
whatever go back to grumpig now of
course<00:02:33.960> it<00:02:34.140> goes<00:02:34.230> back<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.500> swell<00:02:34.860> oh<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:35.250> you

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
course it goes back to swell oh so you

course it goes back to swell oh so you
know<00:02:35.880> we're<00:02:36.150> back<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.450> square<00:02:36.480> one<00:02:36.900> pretty

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140

which<00:03:42.989> is<00:03:43.019> gonna<00:03:43.920> be<00:03:44.010> pointless<00:03:44.420> so

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
which is gonna be pointless so

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.650

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
and now it's basically just he could you

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.440 
and now it's basically just he could you

do your work you know do you think I

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.700 
do your work you know do you think I
don't<00:04:57.630> have<00:04:57.870> to<00:04:57.960> worry<00:04:58.169> about<00:04:58.260> predictions

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
don't have to worry about predictions

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.850 
don't have to worry about predictions
because<00:04:59.690> there's<00:05:00.690> no<00:05:01.140> need<00:05:01.350> to<00:05:01.380> protect<00:05:01.710> at

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
because there's no need to protect at

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.250 
because there's no need to protect at
the<00:05:01.950> moment<00:05:02.280> Tybalt<00:05:03.150> that<00:05:03.330> that's<00:05:04.080> going<00:05:04.200> to

the moment Tybalt that that's going to

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.830 
the moment Tybalt that that's going to
go<00:05:04.380> down<00:05:05.180> Roselia<00:05:06.180> might<00:05:06.419> be<00:05:06.570> a<00:05:06.600> problem

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
go down Roselia might be a problem

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.320 
go down Roselia might be a problem
because<00:05:07.080> Roselia<00:05:07.770> is<00:05:07.919> probably<00:05:08.330> special

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
because Roselia is probably special

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.390 
because Roselia is probably special
defensive<00:05:09.810> and<00:05:10.530> even<00:05:10.800> though<00:05:10.890> i<00:05:10.919> can<00:05:11.130> probably

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
defensive and even though i can probably

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.790 
defensive and even though i can probably
