00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.380
 10 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.670
 lacerda marcio that the same has 900 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.860
 so today's only multi-player in 1981 the ministers the best 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.860
 around here temperature digitally 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.679
 the first of these words if someone there remembers to say that today 900 is 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:26.599
 very expensive minimizing processor just tried to be get close little girl 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.140
 Let's wait and if we had total 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.280
 it is necessary to make very clear in this shootout exactly a mobile 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.060
 in fact an innocent is a small computer with the ability to make and 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.580
 receive calls 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.920
 but okay ls a phone but let's say that person over a year from among 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.230
 the many functions of this apparent 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.500
 it must be said that I think I'm going to shake hands 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.240
 the experience of common use and is not exposed much more satisfactory than 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.380
 I could imagine 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.230
 even the resistive screen had a performance much higher than expected 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.230
 exempting even the canteen incentives that comes embedded 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.380
 but going by parts 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.310
 it's great to have to say sab that portability is not your best 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.350
 quality 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.890
 place in addition to all dark with a 3-point 5-inch ball resistant to 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:15.730
 scratchs 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.650
 sliding until they appear a complete qwerty keyboard that has small people 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.700
 but that even harder legislation is achieved 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.950
 the only one however 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.290
 is that to achieve the Portuguese language situation you need to ignore 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.910
 the placement of some letters seats these walls 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.000
 this Friday it will take some time until you 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.690
 get accustomed to running up with additional left 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.540
 it is an end point 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.080
 or the letter k as an essential characteristic to have an interrogation 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.550
 for example 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.750
 the back is that we are running behind the 5 megapixel camera 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.350
 protected by a sliding lid an interesting detail is that the buttons 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.970
 sides are all positioned on a single side 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.369
 because the n900 this because for you to watch videos 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.660
 with the apparatus was analyzed 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.640
 it has audio output 3d millimeter connection microusb and pixote 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.170
 to SD card up to August 16 as it already comes with an internal memory of 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.240
 32 giga the innocent can reach up to 48 giga bytes of storage especially 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.810
 now with processor cortex cortex a8 of 600 thousand reais without memory work 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.509
 the maemo operating system is open and based on a video platform 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:33.640
 I can not explain exactly how this happens but it's true 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.789
 is that the combination of rugged with operating system was successful 

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:42.550
 - if we can be multitasking without losing speed and more importantly 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.250
 without writing applications to May there are still no numbers similar to 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.590
 February for app or android 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.099
 but according to the note the software development with this miami heat market is 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.829
 consensus are in companies manage to deliver to them in just a week 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.730
 according to him I do not know if it is quite simple and allows the creation of up to 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.159
 four custom screens walking much smaller if we can live everything 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.770
 like the screen of a computer including Indians and here the calls 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.070
 it is obvious that he did not have 3g access 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.929
 but several of them 

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:21.129
 the photos of the n900 are very good for both viewing here on the ride 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:23.369
 pass the big ones like the accountant 

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:26.829
 the negative surprise was because of its combat area beyond 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.069
 you can send photos directly to social networks like facebook 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.429
 but surprisingly 

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:35.329
 you can not understand that nobody travels from ms 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:36.589
 we never live 

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:41.230
 to compensate for these minor flaws - felt capable of more advanced things 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.200
 if you handle programming eg you get information 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.980
 enough on the site husband told his mother 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.270
 for miguel and locals from limeira four countries unfortunately 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.029
 before this everyone lives but if you sell programming 

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:58.169
 you can still do wonders 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:02.249
 was a greater risk there is always the possibility of generating games 

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:05.449
 illegal immigrants already fit to ride is not innocent 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:09.239
 Of course office functions like word processors spreadsheets 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.720
 calendar of appointments and synchronization of emails 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.279
 are contemplated 

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:17.789
 the battery lasts two days of advice there is very good andrew was 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:18.939
 still 

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:21.359
 check out more information is a pirate product 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.930
 another point with br
