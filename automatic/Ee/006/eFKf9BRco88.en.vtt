00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
lesson the fact that to hear but are you

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.030 
lesson the fact that to hear but are you
accepting<00:03:15.000> too<00:03:15.420> much<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:16.200> know<00:03:16.350> if<00:03:16.799> you<00:03:16.920> can't

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
accepting too much you know if you can't

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.039 
accepting too much you know if you can't
stand<00:03:17.370> up<00:03:17.579> for<00:03:17.640> something<00:03:17.910> you'll<00:03:18.329> fall<00:03:18.720> for

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
stand up for something you'll fall for

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.319 
stand up for something you'll fall for
anything<00:03:19.109> you<00:03:20.100> know<00:03:20.250> what<00:03:20.730> what<00:03:20.940> are<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.090> just

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
anything you know what what are you just

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.650 
anything you know what what are you just
putting<00:03:21.900> up<00:03:22.049> with<00:03:22.230> what<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.530> tolerate<00:03:23.660> next

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
putting up with what you tolerate next

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.780 
putting up with what you tolerate next
think<00:03:25.049> about<00:03:25.350> that<00:03:25.890> so<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.220> problem<00:03:26.519> is<00:03:26.730> that

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
think about that so the problem is that

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.789 
think about that so the problem is that
the<00:03:27.180> problem<00:03:27.390> is<00:03:27.630> that<00:03:27.660> we<00:03:27.930> just<00:03:27.959> accept<00:03:28.680> too

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
the problem is that we just accept too

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.220 
the problem is that we just accept too
much<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.190> other<00:03:29.489> problem<00:03:29.910> is<00:03:30.329> that<00:03:31.019> we

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
much the other problem is that we

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.349 
much the other problem is that we
actually<00:03:31.440> can<00:03:32.010> get<00:03:32.190> arrogant<00:03:32.609> and<00:03:32.910> think<00:03:33.180> we

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
actually can get arrogant and think we

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.890 
actually can get arrogant and think we
control<00:03:34.140> it<00:03:34.560> all<00:03:34.950> we<00:03:35.459> don't<00:03:35.820> these<00:03:36.299> things<00:03:36.690> we

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
control it all we don't these things we

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.930 
control it all we don't these things we
just<00:03:36.930> can't<00:03:37.200> control<00:03:37.829> for<00:03:38.280> example<00:03:38.700> other

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
just can't control for example other

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.970 
just can't control for example other
people's<00:03:39.570> reactions<00:03:40.170> other<00:03:40.470> people's

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
people's reactions other people's

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.460 
people's reactions other people's
emotions<00:03:41.549> other<00:03:41.790> people's<00:03:42.359> feelings<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.049> if

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
emotions other people's feelings and if

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.080 
emotions other people's feelings and if
we<00:03:43.590> control<00:03:43.980> freaks<00:03:44.459> another<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.790> little<00:03:44.970> bit

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
we control freaks another a little bit

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.420 
we control freaks another a little bit
of<00:03:45.150> that<00:03:45.269> in<00:03:45.329> all<00:03:45.540> of<00:03:45.690> us<00:03:45.810> then<00:03:46.500> we<00:03:47.010> get<00:03:47.220> very

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
of that in all of us then we get very

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.030 
of that in all of us then we get very
upset<00:03:47.700> that<00:03:48.239> things<00:03:48.630> didn't<00:03:49.049> go<00:03:49.230> our<00:03:49.260> way<00:03:49.500> when

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
upset that things didn't go our way when

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.099
