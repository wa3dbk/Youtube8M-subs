00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
opponents range pretty much always so we

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.510 
opponents range pretty much always so we
fire<00:01:13.220> $18.00<00:01:14.220> for<00:01:14.250> value<00:01:15.920> he<00:01:16.920> makes<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.280> call

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
fire $18.00 for value he makes the call

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.679 
fire $18.00 for value he makes the call

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
really worrisome card at all he checks

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.749 
really worrisome card at all he checks
we're<00:01:25.049> gonna<00:01:25.140> bet<00:01:25.380> our<00:01:25.530> hand<00:01:25.710> for<00:01:25.799> value<00:01:26.310> he's

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759

we're gonna bet our hand for value he's
gonna<00:01:26.939> do<00:01:27.119> what<00:01:27.270> he<00:01:27.360> always<00:01:27.509> does<00:01:27.869> because

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
gonna do what he always does because

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.469 
gonna do what he always does because
he's<00:01:28.259> loose<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.710> he's<00:01:28.799> passive<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.460> he<00:01:29.549> likes

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
he's loose and he's passive and he likes

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.910 
he's loose and he's passive and he likes
the<00:01:30.659> call<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.290> he<00:01:31.799> calls<00:01:33.259> River<00:01:34.259> comes<00:01:34.530> queen

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
the call so he calls River comes queen

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.620 
the call so he calls River comes queen
he<00:01:35.369> checks<00:01:36.079> we<00:01:37.079> have<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.290> pretty<00:01:37.710> obvious<00:01:38.630> bet

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
he checks we have a pretty obvious bet

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.300 
he checks we have a pretty obvious bet
on<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.900> river<00:01:40.020> here<00:01:40.320> we<00:01:40.439> have<00:01:40.530> top<00:01:40.770> two<00:01:41.009> pair

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
on the river here we have top two pair

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.130 
on the river here we have top two pair
he<00:01:42.150> probably<00:01:42.479> has<00:01:42.899> an<00:01:43.110> ace<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:44.780> so<00:01:45.780> we<00:01:45.960> just

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
he probably has an ace and so we just

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.080 
he probably has an ace and so we just
stick<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.860> all<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.250> since<00:01:47.490> he's<00:01:47.670> loose<00:01:47.909> and

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
stick it all in since he's loose and

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.609 
stick it all in since he's loose and
he's<00:01:48.180> passive<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:49.020> doesn't<00:01:49.229> matter<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.439> we

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
he's passive it doesn't matter that we

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.080 
he's passive it doesn't matter that we
over<00:01:49.860> bet<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.040> little<00:01:50.340> bit<00:01:50.460> if<00:01:50.579> he<00:01:50.610> has<00:01:50.820> an<00:01:50.939> ace

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
over bet a little bit if he has an ace

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.240 
over bet a little bit if he has an ace
he's<00:01:51.780> gonna<00:01:51.960> be<00:01:52.140> showdown<00:01:52.560> bound<00:01:52.860> no<00:01:53.070> matter

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
he's gonna be showdown bound no matter

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.609 
he's gonna be showdown bound no matter
what<00:01:53.579> he<00:01:54.060> thinks<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.600> if<00:01:54.840> he<00:01:54.930> has<00:01:55.049> ace<00:01:55.290> 10

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
what he thinks that if he has ace 10

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.469 
what he thinks that if he has ace 10
then<00:01:55.950> he's<00:01:56.070> probably<00:01:56.189> gonna<00:01:56.610> chop<00:01:56.969> because<00:01:57.360> of

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
then he's probably gonna chop because of

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.230 
then he's probably gonna chop because of
the<00:01:57.600> Queen<00:01:57.899> if<00:01:58.439> he<00:01:58.590> has<00:01:58.740> any<00:01:59.100> ace<00:01:59.399> he's<00:01:59.729> calling

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
the Queen if he has any ace he's calling

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.139 
the Queen if he has any ace he's calling

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.850 
value bet you dictate when you take free
cards<00:02:42.209> you<00:02:42.810> have<00:02:42.959> complete<00:02:43.290> control<00:02:43.320> of<00:02:43.680> the

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
so isolate them get into a lot of pots

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.550 
so isolate them get into a lot of pots
with<00:02:47.880> them<00:02:48.000> in<00:02:48.120> position<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:48.690> just<00:02:49.260> impose

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
with them in position and just impose

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.720

your<00:02:49.709> will<00:02:49.770> on<00:02:49.920> them<00:02:51.020> so<00:02:52.020> he<00:02:52.200> checks<00:02:52.550> we<00:02:53.550> bet

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
your will on them so he checks we bet

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.910

for<00:03:20.940> us<00:03:21.180> if<00:03:21.390> he<00:03:21.540> has<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.690> flush<00:03:22.049> draw<00:03:22.080> he

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
for us if he has a flush draw he

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.370 
for us if he has a flush draw he
obviously<00:03:22.680> just<00:03:22.980> got<00:03:23.310> there<00:03:23.660> so<00:03:24.660> we<00:03:25.230> have<00:03:25.320> to

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
obviously just got there so we have to

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.610 
obviously just got there so we have to
worry<00:03:25.620> about<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:26.070> he<00:03:27.000> checks<00:03:27.330> and<00:03:27.660> we<00:03:28.440> bet

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
worry about that he checks and we bet

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.920 
worry about that he checks and we bet
all-in<00:03:28.920> because<00:03:29.360> though<00:03:30.360> there's<00:03:30.600> a<00:03:30.690> flush

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
all-in because though there's a flush

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:08.129 
but does that mean we shouldn't bet if

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:10.700 
but does that mean we shouldn't bet if
her<00:05:08.219> value<00:05:08.580> when<00:05:08.699> he<00:05:08.759> checks<00:05:09.029> no<00:05:09.840> we<00:05:10.500> should

00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:40.379 
we beat probably not he probably has

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:43.879

passive player shows aggression you

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.679 
passive player shows aggression you
probably<00:05:46.620> should<00:05:46.919> tend<00:05:47.189> to<00:05:47.339> listen<00:05:48.300> to<00:05:48.479> them

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:48.689
