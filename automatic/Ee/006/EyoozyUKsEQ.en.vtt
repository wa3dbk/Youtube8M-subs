00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.690
 hello everyone welcome to the channel 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.650
 your in china and today we will have 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:20.920
 unpacking the yellow box she reached for 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.990
 24 days by China Post rated at 15 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.960
 dollars and it is written that there signal 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.960
 booster and there should be a gsm amplifier 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.949
 let's start right away what is there in 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:51.729
 bundled in general is a gsm amplifier on 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:55.870
 900 megahertz is intended in principle for 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:58.449
 signal amplification primarily for 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.289
 folders with and for calls 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:05.560
 That is, the Internet at 3g speeds you are here 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:09.250
 don't get need a standard 1800 megahertz 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.460
 They have different specifically this bought 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:16.030
 so much for calls and sms will only help 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.770
 if there is a network but weak if there is no network 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.659
 Actually this thing you do not wash 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.610
 in general, complete with it goes cell 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.460
 is understood the antenna which it 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.830
 wind up 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.570
 may we all be with him 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:38.970
 screw hard thing not looked 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:44.590
 how much weighs on the parcel as on 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.360
 The instruction in the pimple is rolled up like this 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:51.640
 by itself this 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:54.720
 gsm amplifier looks like metal 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.540
 some kind of aluminum or something like that 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:07.539
 alloy I do not know now at hand is a magnet 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:10.200
 they will find yes 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:14.400
 fortification goes to the wall and 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:20.110
 screwed mobile antenna is written and 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:22.180
 bts on the one hand do not understand with 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.980
 some with some of them we read 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.010
 instruction 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.470
 screwed is this external antenna 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.610
 which also comes bundled declared 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:38.410
 that there should be 10 meters of cable 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:41.709
 coaxial slim mount 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.660
 there is no there is a two-way 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.209
 Scotch can be used like this 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.459
 Here the antenna is wound 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:54.340
 this small 30 centimeters 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:59.370
 also thin iron age she 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.370
 this antenna is wound up here and 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:08.920
 which is rough this jetsam grout and here 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.700
 then here the antenna reception goes here 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.209
 gain 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.190
 the game is an antenna for delivery stated 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:19.269
 what is the maximum area 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.730
 which will cover the device is 2000 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:25.560
 square meter and enhancing it 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:29.799
 mat written 65 decibels 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:33.450
 Well , in principle, and instructions on it and 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:37.090
 it says the same thing here 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:42.910
 70 decibels visible 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:45.930
 40 for some reason, this is gain 5550 65 70 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:50.640
 plus minus 3 dB 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:53.110
 some kind of boosting 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:59.620
 down frequency 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:03.489
 I understand who else in the kit about 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:07.120
 nutrition here and so looks pupum 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:10.599
 as far as at 12 volts 2000 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.760
 milliampere hours 12 volts so if 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:19.030
 burn I think it's not difficult to find some 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:20.709
 replacement device did not go to me that's why 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.729
 so about 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.860
 review I will not promise anything yet 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:29.860
 special city line somewhere to check 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.220
 we have good gsm networks everywhere 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:36.520
 developed will be installed in the village 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.490
 and then later it will be possible to make 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.030
 review will come to visit them may not be 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.250
 I will do a review on this thing 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.320
 I hope you and why exactly this 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:51.100
 because I read forums 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:54.130
 if you believe the forum users different then 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:58.060
 This is how this model works. 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:00.880
 I ordered it, I hope it to you 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.700
 liked the review so put the likes 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.700
 subscribe to the channel thank you all 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.700
 until
