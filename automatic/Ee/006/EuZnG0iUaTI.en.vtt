choose but they didn't have the things
that<00:03:06.180> I<00:03:06.270> liked<00:03:06.540> so<00:03:07.040> Carrodus<00:03:08.570> this<00:03:09.570> is<00:03:09.780> a

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
that I liked so Carrodus this is a

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.810 
that I liked so Carrodus this is a
tomato<00:03:11.490> sauce<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:12.920> cheese<00:03:13.920> so<00:03:14.430> you<00:03:14.520> can<00:03:14.670> see

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
tomato sauce and cheese so you can see

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.910 
tomato sauce and cheese so you can see
the<00:03:14.910> tomato<00:03:15.210> sauce<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.870> cheese<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:16.500> then

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
the tomato sauce the cheese and then

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.740 
the tomato sauce the cheese and then
this<00:03:17.130> is<00:03:17.340> an<00:03:17.459> egg<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:18.000> omelette<00:03:18.330> and

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
this is an egg and omelette and

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.620 
this is an egg and omelette and
underneath<00:03:19.200> is<00:03:19.470> rice<00:03:19.740> I<00:03:20.330> think<00:03:21.330> it's<00:03:21.450> going<00:03:21.600> to

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
underneath is rice I think it's going to

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.530 
underneath is rice I think it's going to
be<00:03:21.750> pretty<00:03:21.990> good<00:03:22.760> seven<00:03:23.760> eleven<00:03:23.940> standard<00:03:24.420> is

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
be pretty good seven eleven standard is

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.640 
be pretty good seven eleven standard is
pretty<00:03:24.720> good<00:03:24.990> and<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:26.040> idea<00:03:26.400> of<00:03:26.640> this<00:03:26.910> meal<00:03:27.209> is

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
pretty good and the idea of this meal is

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.260 
pretty good and the idea of this meal is
also<00:03:28.650> okay<00:03:28.980> so<00:03:29.370> I<00:03:29.400> think<00:03:29.550> together<00:03:30.030> they're

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
also okay so I think together they're

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.820 
also okay so I think together they're
going<00:03:30.390> to<00:03:30.480> be<00:03:30.570> really<00:03:30.870> really<00:03:31.230> good<00:03:33.740> you<00:03:34.740> have

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
going to be really really good you have

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.110 
going to be really really good you have
to<00:03:34.890> figure<00:03:35.010> out<00:03:35.130> how<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.370> rip<00:03:35.610> off<00:03:35.760> all<00:03:35.970> the

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
to figure out how to rip off all the

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:47.150 
to figure out how to rip off all the
deep

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.190 

so<00:03:47.730> you<00:03:47.880> can<00:03:48.030> see<00:03:48.210> down<00:03:48.420> here<00:03:48.480> is<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.870> rice<00:03:49.020> and

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
so you can see down here is the rice and

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:56.950 
so you can see down here is the rice and
it's<00:03:49.320> actually<00:03:49.680> like<00:03:49.710> a<00:03:49.860> fried<00:03:50.220> rice<00:03:50.490> with

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.290 

chicken<00:03:57.740> or<00:03:57.950> pork<00:03:58.160> I<00:03:58.550> can<00:03:58.880> never<00:03:59.000> tell<00:03:59.150> the

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
chicken or pork I can never tell the

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.190 
chicken or pork I can never tell the
difference<00:04:01.330> it's<00:04:02.330> a<00:04:02.390> little<00:04:02.750> bit<00:04:02.840> of<00:04:02.930> tomato

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
difference it's a little bit of tomato

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.200 
difference it's a little bit of tomato
sauce<00:04:03.440> a<00:04:03.500> little<00:04:03.770> bit<00:04:03.920> of<00:04:04.100> egg<00:04:04.280> a<00:04:04.700> little<00:04:04.910> bit

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210 
sauce a little bit of egg a little bit

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:12.670 
sauce a little bit of egg a little bit
of<00:04:05.300> cheese<00:04:05.510> a<00:04:06.220> little<00:04:07.220> bit<00:04:07.310> of<00:04:07.370> rice<00:04:11.680> its

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
of cheese a little bit of rice its

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.450 
of cheese a little bit of rice its
stellar<00:04:13.010> it's<00:04:13.910> really<00:04:14.300> really<00:04:14.510> good

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
stellar it's really really good

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.550 
stellar it's really really good
the<00:04:16.460> egg<00:04:16.760> is<00:04:16.790> a<00:04:17.000> little<00:04:17.420> bit<00:04:17.570> strange<00:04:17.960> because

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
the egg is a little bit strange because

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.130 
the egg is a little bit strange because
it's<00:04:18.860> all<00:04:19.100> yellow<00:04:19.610> and<00:04:20.620> it<00:04:21.620> looks<00:04:21.830> kind<00:04:22.130> of

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
it's all yellow and it looks kind of

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.040 
it's all yellow and it looks kind of
plasticy<00:04:24.400> but<00:04:25.400> it's<00:04:26.060> convenient<00:04:26.630> store<00:04:26.840> food

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
plasticy but it's convenient store food

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.410 
plasticy but it's convenient store food
it's<00:04:27.560> probably<00:04:27.950> not<00:04:28.070> the<00:04:28.220> best<00:04:28.250> egg<00:04:28.640> they<00:04:28.820> had

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.770 

but<00:04:32.420> these<00:04:32.780> are<00:04:33.110> the<00:04:33.380> best<00:04:33.560> eggs<00:04:34.420> if<00:04:35.420> you<00:04:35.600> know

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
but these are the best eggs if you know

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.470 
but these are the best eggs if you know
what<00:04:35.990> this<00:04:36.140> is<00:04:36.380> it's<00:04:36.770> heaven<00:04:37.340> this<00:04:38.120> is<00:04:38.300> called

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
what this is it's heaven this is called

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.340 
what this is it's heaven this is called
Tom<00:04:39.080> ogle<00:04:39.230> and<00:04:39.610> it<00:04:40.610> is<00:04:41.210> a<00:04:41.240> special<00:04:41.810> Japanese

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
Tom ogle and it is a special Japanese

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.020 
Tom ogle and it is a special Japanese
way<00:04:42.800> I<00:04:42.830> think<00:04:43.070> it's<00:04:43.340> a<00:04:43.430> Japanese<00:04:43.820> Way<00:04:44.000> of

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
way I think it's a Japanese Way of

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.360 
way I think it's a Japanese Way of
cooking<00:04:44.660> eggs<00:04:45.110> where<00:04:45.740> they<00:04:45.830> basically<00:04:46.190> just

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
cooking eggs where they basically just

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.060 
cooking eggs where they basically just
lay<00:04:46.820> eggs<00:04:47.180> on<00:04:47.450> eggs<00:04:47.690> on<00:04:47.930> eggs<00:04:48.170> on<00:04:48.380> eggs<00:04:48.620> on<00:04:48.860> eggs

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
lay eggs on eggs on eggs on eggs on eggs

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.670 
lay eggs on eggs on eggs on eggs on eggs
on<00:04:49.310> eggs<00:04:49.520> on<00:04:49.730> eggs<00:04:50.000> forever<00:04:50.660> like<00:04:50.990> it<00:04:51.170> takes<00:04:51.350> to

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
on eggs on eggs forever like it takes to

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.790 
on eggs on eggs forever like it takes to
make<00:04:51.860> this<00:04:52.270> probably<00:04:53.270> took<00:04:53.540> 20<00:04:53.900> minutes<00:04:53.930> like

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
make this probably took 20 minutes like

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.620 
make this probably took 20 minutes like
just<00:04:55.100> frying<00:04:55.520> an<00:04:55.730> egg<00:04:55.820> and<00:04:56.090> then<00:04:56.180> putting<00:04:56.360> more

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
putting more egg on top of it I want to

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.300 
putting more egg on top of it I want to
make<00:04:59.780> it<00:04:59.990> at<00:05:00.080> home<00:05:00.110> but<00:05:00.770> you<00:05:00.920> have<00:05:01.070> to<00:05:01.160> have<00:05:01.280> a

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
make it at home but you have to have a

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.020 
make it at home but you have to have a
special<00:05:01.730> pan<00:05:01.910> so<00:05:02.570> at<00:05:02.990> the<00:05:03.170> moment<00:05:03.500> I<00:05:03.790> have<00:05:04.790> to

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
special pan so at the moment I have to

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.250 
special pan so at the moment I have to
deal<00:05:05.840> with<00:05:05.900> just<00:05:06.140> getting<00:05:06.650> it<00:05:06.770> from<00:05:06.890> 7-eleven

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
deal with just getting it from 7-eleven

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.920 
deal with just getting it from 7-eleven
which<00:05:09.260> is<00:05:09.550> not<00:05:10.550> a<00:05:10.580> bad<00:05:10.790> idea<00:05:10.970> at<00:05:11.300> all<00:05:11.390> it<00:05:11.660> just

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
which is not a bad idea at all it just

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.230 
which is not a bad idea at all it just
tastes<00:05:12.350> like<00:05:12.470> heaven

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
tastes like heaven
