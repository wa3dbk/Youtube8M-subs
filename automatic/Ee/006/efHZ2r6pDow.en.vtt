00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
some over a salad the other day and they

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.260 
some over a salad the other day and they
were<00:04:50.650> delicious<00:04:50.890> and<00:04:51.430> I<00:04:51.820> know<00:04:51.880> that<00:04:52.090> they're

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
were delicious and I know that they're

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.270 
were delicious and I know that they're
really<00:04:52.450> good<00:04:52.600> for<00:04:52.750> detoxing<00:04:53.380> because<00:04:54.040> they

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
really good for detoxing because they

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.360 
really good for detoxing because they
when<00:04:54.490> they<00:04:54.610> get<00:04:54.760> wet<00:04:54.790> they're<00:04:55.330> kind<00:04:55.630> of<00:04:55.750> like

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
when they get wet they're kind of like

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.290 
when they get wet they're kind of like
clingy<00:04:57.370> so<00:04:58.120> um<00:04:58.900> I<00:04:59.830> guess<00:05:00.160> they<00:05:00.520> like<00:05:00.700> cling<00:05:01.120> to

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
clingy so um I guess they like cling to

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.150 
clingy so um I guess they like cling to
the<00:05:01.390> toxins<00:05:01.810> in<00:05:01.930> your<00:05:01.960> body<00:05:02.080> and<00:05:02.440> then<00:05:02.740> when
