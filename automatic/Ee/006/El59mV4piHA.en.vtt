 seize the afternoon after reading 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.270
 several comments yesterday saying that since 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.940
 that we started the strength routine my 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.500
 friend and I have been about four months 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.270
 are five we already know that the technique does not 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.890
 is perfect at all but if it will start 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.340
 to get better 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.880
 It takes two months so 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.610
 invoke the pull-ups and everything 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.930
 well he did not try to justify me since the 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.940
 technique and I know it's not quite 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.740
 perfect but good based on practicing 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.990
 it will end up getting 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.930
