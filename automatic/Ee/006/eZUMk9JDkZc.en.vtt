your volume of eggs and increase the
fluffiness<00:01:25.290> if<00:01:26.290> you<00:01:26.440> wanted<00:01:26.650> to<00:01:26.740> use<00:01:26.860> that<00:01:26.890> but

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160

long<00:02:23.650> like<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:24.740> said<00:02:24.920> we<00:02:25.040> started<00:02:25.370> with<00:02:25.459> a

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
long like I said we started with a

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.900 
long like I said we started with a
medium-low<00:02:26.930> fire<00:02:27.550> now<00:02:28.550> we're<00:02:28.670> going<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:28.820> be

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
medium-low fire now we're going to be

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.000 
medium-low fire now we're going to be
