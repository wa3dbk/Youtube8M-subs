00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.619
 let's look at a techniques 

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:15.439
 to correct wrinkles ok to disguise them a bit 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:19.070
 and for the purpose of this video the pearl chair 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.189
 exaggerating a bit the av source 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.259
 in the image according to try to correct already they will see 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:28.649
 is this 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:30.470
 friendly digital 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.110
 it's like we can see fight with Argentina look like wrinkles 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.430
 and let's look 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.680
 how can we try to hide the 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.260
 I know that soon the change does not have to be too obvious in this image since 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.420
 there are many areas to correct 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.289
 but 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.780
 the cancer to try to correct a little 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.320
 these wrinkles 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.360
 So the first thing we have to do is create a new layer 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.660
 but we're not going to do it from the new layer icon but we're going to go to the 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.660
 Ies 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.410
 yes so that this dialogue does not appear I could have seemed to them with 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.400
 quick access 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.100
 but 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.249
 rasra then wedding wedding place percent by name 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.780
 settings 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.070
 i in the mode let's change the normal 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.070
 on the ico lu2 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.710
 and we are going to click on this box that I made the pri has as its goal 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.690
 messi 4 percent of the current price gray 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.690
 click on it we click on cocaine 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.780
 now about this adjustment layer is that we're going to perform 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.050
 our these changes 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.020
 so 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.889
 As a spa, make sure that white is not the main thing 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.810
 and depending before the resolution of lehman collapse working the kind of 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.549
 image to adjust the opacity in this case happens what this tip percent 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.180
 percent then 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.620
 adapting a 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.560
 mckinsey him 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.549
 its size 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:20.519
 above the size of the pineapples on the forehead to correct we will start to 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.039
 do our strokes if you can see right click go adjusting the diameter 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:27.879
 15 pixels for this image this well 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.969
 Let's get started, then 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:33.549
 to trace over the areas to correct 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:38.409
 and this is a technique that requires several strokes 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:41.310
 we have to work 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.179
 by the different areas that the image we want to disguise 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:47.149
 what we want to correct 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:51.049
 to treat this law years a person 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.550
 and competitive bou 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.449
 a nitro 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:58.739
 the person would be quite grateful 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.129
 so 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.479
 we continue making our strokes on these lucas 

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:07.220
 we will go like lead 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.220
 of the brush I have it 100% 

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:13.109
 and we go on 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.859
 giving several strokes 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:20.040
 This is a technique that allows us a little more control 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.370
 and because many will be saying ah but over time the 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.120
 here is just a single click matte that creates new layer I do not have to do 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.549
 nothing simply click and correct 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:30.869
 It is true 

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:35.369
 but but not some do not know what he is doing is who bros do not know 

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:40.409
 what is happening because the changes because there were more things disappear and because 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.439
 why per hundred the stains is removed 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.799
 then sometimes it gives us unexpected results 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.750
 all with this technique we south control 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.349
 percent 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.969
 a little better these changes that are going to happen about the expert randomness that 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:03:59.879
 we try to correct 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:04.049
 many were already saying that they are not foolishly watching anything is that the person 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:04.809
 luce 

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:07.809
 perfectly equal 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.009
 to apply this important technical impact 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.850
 to correct and if not the images then we will look at our image 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.069
 how was I before 

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:24.439
 I burn the bike to the adjustment layer 

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:29.770
 because you can bring it to see what we are disguising the calugas t this 

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:35.180
 person we are leaving it a little milder without eliminating subsidies all 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:39.120
 then you know how to apply this technique 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.130
 very easy i quite effective
