00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.760
 hello guys with you jed and 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.859
 weekly show 3 in form of on this 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.869
 week I played with this composition 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.529
 the link he will have as usual in 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.210
 description 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.250
 First of all I want to say that this 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.469
 the composition is not particularly dragged 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.840
 I can not recommend you to collect it 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.520
 but since the village to such a very 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.579
 difficult nationality for hybrid 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.950
 so I had to assemble the composition 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.559
 so let's get down to it 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.210
 k told about each of the three forms 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.000
 represented in this composition 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.879
 and 1 com I'll tell it just a novel 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.789
 Eremenko is a Moscow CSKA player who 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.899
 he got the form for just a gorgeous match 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.780
 in the championship of Russia 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.260
 I tried his card and I can not 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.880
 say i was very impressed 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.250
 game novel eremenko hi-fi 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.600
 but given the fact that I did discount on 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.430
 the fact that he did not play his own 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.549
 positions still nsp 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.630
 his whole talent could not be revealed when 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.299
 all my desire 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.080
 look at his status is very good 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.939
 long shot and you can evaluate it yourself in 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.070
 one of the moments i put in 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.439
 cutting very good vision very 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.009
 You see good pass on his card 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.409
 written 82 but coupled with vision 86 is 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.780
 gives it a very good long groove and 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.640
 that is, I have it in the middle of the field guys are not 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.560
 was a stranger at a very good speed 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.630
 principle stat is very balanced on 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.970
 card as you can see with 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.340
 given the fact that he apnuli stars 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.770
 he now has 4 special stars 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.079
 tricks everyone can recommend this 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.360
 player guys buy especially if you 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.610
 fan of the Moscow csk or just 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.200
 Russian football especially if you are not 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.500
 played for the usual novel card 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.979
 It is a very good reason 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.560
 to try 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.200
 I gave him this player seven 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.599
 half a point out of ten 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.879
 still because he did not become the main 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.480
 protagonist center field in my 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.670
 composed 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.129
 but this estimate is certainly subject to 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.670
 that he was playing in my wrong position 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:23.099
 if he played in the scheme let's say 4 1212 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.599
 if he were the only dad there I 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.360
 I am sure that he would have revealed much 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.030
 more well and so estimate 7 and a half but 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.629
 In general, I repeat once again that I 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.430
 I can recommend this player to you and 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.110
 the second I will tell you 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.900
 Ali Ji is exactly right 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.610
 pronounce his first and last name what I want 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.920
 tell sleep guys you can 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.290
 look at the stats was a terrible control 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.030
 bad long shot and bad finish young 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.900
 for a player in position 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.080
 attacker 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.769
 his card is redone from lv vst and 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.080
 this 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.060
 I want to say it did not do him good three 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.400
 stars skill moves three stars of the century food 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.690
 all he has is acceleration 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.000
 sprint speed 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.980
 by the stats we actually see it on 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.890
 it's really easy for guys 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.650
 runner he can run though i would 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.989
 didn't even say he was so fast 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.390
 run on how much is written here 87 x and 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.760
 decide there are players who run much 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.099
 faster than him the same beats on my 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.610
 glance runs several times faster than 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:25.349
 This Belgian can say that I do not 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.780
 enjoyed playing for him despite 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.959
 what food head gives him a bist rating 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.879
 88 i don't know maybe this fans 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.840
 lily voted for him or 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.849
 Belgians 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.580
 but when looking at the card is really 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:42.360
 You can probably think that he is very 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.940
 good, he just gorgeous and electronics RC 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.849
 and put on it the price range up to 50 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.830
 thousand I don't know on what grounds 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.950
 but these guys put him to bentec 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.989
 300,000 so let's not get harsh on them 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.150
 apparently not very good 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:00.810
 head over training people is not good 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.790
 laugh in general diva college bad 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.909
 player guys I never once 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.099
 I liked him 6 points out 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:11.099
 I do not recommend anyone to buy it 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.510
 I wanted to put him five but I 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.879
 he added for the fact that 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.400
 he helped me bounce in one of the matches 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:19.680
 from the center of the field ran away and scored 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.049
 Generally it is only for this I and yes he fell 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.790
 because he helped me drag one of 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.490
 but so many matches 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.100
 unrealized moments that we saw 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.840
 already at his bad finish ingu very 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.449
 bad card do not advise you to spend 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.120
 on him their coins and finally came 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:38.789
 turn to talk about benoit tremulinas a 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.180
 this is the left back and seville and this 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:45.090
 guys yes look at his stats this 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:48.210
 wife is just gorgeous physique 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.750
 him for a defender it's just something with 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.470
 something 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:55.020
 and this guy is worth almost kxl look 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.479
 84 statues on his statuary are equal 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.910
 even 81 canopies are very good for 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.919
 flank defender it's just just 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.280
 gorgeous left foot 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:07.530
 endurance 93 well all you need for 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.660
 advocate he has and after i 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.090
 played for this guy i can say 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.110
 that here are all these stats they have him 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.720
 justified 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.669
 Feels like in the game, his stats should 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.830
 to be even better because guys 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:21.840
 this is my new favorite left back in 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.820
 the game he has everything for the left 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.240
 protector, I do not even know what you can him 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.490
 still say very good interception and for 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.979
 through your speed and your stamina 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.669
 he can catch up with all sorts of fast and 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:37.710
 struggle and things like that take them away 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:42.539
 ball due to its physics which 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:45.240
 written 76 force 68 don't know guys i don't 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:47.160
 I remember that at least I have this guy 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.660
 lost in general fight one to one 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.940
 and if they remember it means most likely 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.979
 this was not I will not spend too much time 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.539
 guys i put that guy nine with 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:56.970
 half a point out of ten 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:06:00.090
 I do not know what I lowered well, half a point if 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:02.729
 honestly i just hope and believe that there is 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.840
 better than him defenders just i still 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:06.840
 I did not play for them 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.909
 but so guys would highly recommend to buy 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.669
 to spanish league 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:13.620
 This defender is in my opinion perfect but 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:16.530
 even better than any hordi alba 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.720
 well, in my opinion well, well on this 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.490
