really<00:01:19.970> and<00:01:21.610> different<00:01:22.610> I<00:01:22.850> didn't<00:01:23.119> think<00:01:23.360> I

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
really and different I didn't think I

it's got a lot more pink in it and then
the<00:01:31.310> I<00:01:31.610> think<00:01:31.850> there<00:01:32.030> was<00:01:32.210> oh<00:01:32.450> my<00:01:32.570> gosh<00:01:32.720> what

the I think there was oh my gosh what
was<00:01:32.960> it<00:01:33.110> called<00:01:33.229> from<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:33.800> other<00:01:33.950> color<00:01:34.220> Club

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
was it called from the other color Club

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.030 
was it called from the other color Club
halo<00:01:35.210> hue<00:01:35.450> set<00:01:35.720> there's<00:01:36.440> one<00:01:36.710> that's<00:01:36.830> like<00:01:37.009> a

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
halo hue set there's one that's like a

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.740 
halo hue set there's one that's like a
nude<00:01:37.340> color<00:01:37.580> but<00:01:37.790> this<00:01:37.940> one's<00:01:38.180> got<00:01:38.360> a<00:01:38.390> lot<00:01:38.570> more

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750

nude color but this one's got a lot more
pink<00:01:38.990> in<00:01:39.290> it<00:01:39.470> I<00:01:40.210> think<00:01:41.210> that<00:01:41.270> woman<00:01:41.479> was<00:01:41.690> called

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
pink in it I think that woman was called

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.960 
pink in it I think that woman was called
like<00:01:41.990> cherubic<00:01:42.680> or<00:01:42.920> something<00:01:43.250> like<00:01:43.369> that

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
like cherubic or something like that

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.380 
like cherubic or something like that
and<00:01:44.630> I<00:01:45.380> also<00:01:45.560> have<00:01:45.890> a<00:01:46.100> video<00:01:46.460> of<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:47.180> other

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
and I also have a video of the other

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.760 
and I also have a video of the other
color<00:01:47.690> club<00:01:47.899> so<00:01:48.050> you<00:01:48.110> guys<00:01:48.259> can<00:01:48.470> check<00:01:48.619> that

color club so you guys can check that

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.249 
color club so you guys can check that
one<00:01:48.920> out

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
one out

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:58.210 
one out
and<00:01:51.550> here's<00:01:52.550> the<00:01:52.789> swatch<00:01:56.860> so<00:01:57.860> you<00:01:57.950> can<00:01:58.039> see

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
and here's the swatch so you can see

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.070 
and here's the swatch so you can see
it's<00:01:58.369> very<00:01:58.610> subtle<00:01:59.330> so<00:01:59.479> if<00:01:59.840> you<00:01:59.930> don't

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
it's very subtle so if you don't

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.410 
it's very subtle so if you don't
anything<00:02:00.410> like<00:02:00.590> crazy<00:02:01.070> I<00:02:01.670> would<00:02:01.820> probably<00:02:02.030> get

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
anything like crazy I would probably get

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:12.800 
anything like crazy I would probably get
this<00:02:02.690> one

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.830 

okay<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:16.030> this<00:02:16.450> next<00:02:16.510> one<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:19.000> called<00:02:19.330> Beyond

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
okay so this next one is called Beyond

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.940 
okay so this next one is called Beyond
and<00:02:20.610> this<00:02:21.610> one<00:02:21.820> is<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.000> dark<00:02:22.660> charcoal<00:02:23.650> gray

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
and this one is a dark charcoal gray

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.550 
and this one is a dark charcoal gray
color<00:02:25.020> almost<00:02:26.020> black<00:02:26.830> but<00:02:27.130> not<00:02:27.670> quite<00:02:28.560> and

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
color almost black but not quite and

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.820 
color almost black but not quite and
then<00:02:29.830> this<00:02:29.980> one<00:02:30.160> reminds<00:02:30.580> me<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:30.790> lot<00:02:31.000> of<00:02:31.060> the

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
then this one reminds me a lot of the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.790 
then this one reminds me a lot of the
Leila<00:02:32.910> hologram<00:02:33.910> effects<00:02:34.570> polish<00:02:35.020> in<00:02:35.260> flash

two coats and it would have been just
fine<00:02:53.320> with<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.740> one<00:02:54.040> but<00:02:54.490> I<00:02:54.730> like<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.209> do<00:02:55.330> two

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510
