00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.670
 a few days ago a meeting talking 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:08.330
 with one person I was shocked by the 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.759
 way to complain about that human being if 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.519
 it was 10 minutes that we talked 8 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.469
 were complaints that if his wife did 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.890
 his children that if the work that if the 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:21.260
 neighbor that good good to complain 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.170
 these kinds of people have complaints that 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.270
 about everything that surrounds them generally 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.240
 it is due to the fundamental fact that 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.940
 are dissatisfied or dissatisfied with 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.989
 their personal lives like dealing with a 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.280
 plaintive three steps 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.030
 not going to be that you saw with one of 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.620
 its one I heard your concerns 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.150
 sometimes it is not enough 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.489
 solve the problem which is being 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.200
 complaining that person has a need 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.680
 psychological that someone is listening 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.690
 you recognize your concerns to 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.330
 Sometimes he despairs because he wants 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.010
 try to fix him his problem but he 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.440
 he does not want to be fixed by him 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.850
 what he wants is to be heard 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.759
 listen and recognize what they have to 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.619
 saying that is the most important step to me 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.990
 - to keep talking until all 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.100
 his frustrations are thrown out and 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.380
 besides this is like discomfort 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.840
 stomach while you were not doing it your 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.899
 stomach will continue the discomfort number 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.300
 two empathize with them imagine 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.640
 walking in your shoes and try to see 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.320
 the situation from his perspective the 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.880
 empathy is an important tool 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.009
 that you can use to facilitate the 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.410
 cooperation let them know that you 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:34.280
 understand your situation and make it feel 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:36.740
 comfortable or important sometimes doing 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.950
 feel important though shoulders or what 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.460
 makes analyze its own act and everything 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.070
 what is he saying 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.290
 and last ask him what he wants 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.420
 do already after he complained to him 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.130
 what are you going to do in most of the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.409
 cases you will already know what the person 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.420
 he wants but ask him because sometimes 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.430
 that way he faces his very 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.780
 complaints and says hey well I do not gain anything with 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.970
 send me complaining because I can not do 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.380
 nothing and that way you can say I'm going 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.200
 to pay a little bit to this whole amount 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.820
 of expressions based on the complaint not 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.369
 Do you think they are very 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.509
 simple that you can use the same 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.509
 courage until next time
