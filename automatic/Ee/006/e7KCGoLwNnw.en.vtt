00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 hello to all i will tell you today how 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:10.490
 make the float ordinary know and 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:16.969
 so we need the main branch 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.969
 on which we attach the 100 threshold 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:36.660
 so did the threshold now put on 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:40.940
 carabiner swivel in practice 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.940
 and again we dress that threshold 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.560
 so dressed 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.370
 Now 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:19.460
 We attach this carbine pot to the 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:22.330
 helped snap fastens here we 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.330
 such construction turned out 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:34.280
 now but you stand there on this edge 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:39.979
 will tie a hook with any knot I 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:42.490
 I will make one leash jump 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.490
 make two 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:54.910
 I tie the most fishing knot 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.910
 common knot among fishermen 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:07.070
 such now here does not play rhizo 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.180
 we have such a construction 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.920
 hook 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.230
 between 100 parks swivel with carabiner 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.900
 carbine 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:42.330
 fasten the float ok now we 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:45.650
 you need one load we take such a load 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.650
 4 grams 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:54.860
 edit from centimeters hook 5 6 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.860
 we hook it 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.640
 horseshoes with you push 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:12.530
 here it turned out because float 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:16.130
 tackle is very simple 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:22.790
 here move these 100 batches 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.790
 we adjust the depth at which to catch 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:32.130
 it's all very simple 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.700
 Thanks for watching your tail 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.780
 scratch not 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.780
 good luck everyone
