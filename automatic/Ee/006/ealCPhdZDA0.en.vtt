00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
really it starts late Friday night I'd

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.619 
really it starts late Friday night I'd
say<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.040> main<00:02:42.250> window<00:02:42.489> for<00:02:42.909> the<00:02:43.000> snow<00:02:43.209> showers

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
say the main window for the snow showers

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.610 
say the main window for the snow showers
will<00:02:43.659> be<00:02:43.959> from<00:02:44.200> about<00:02:45.690> midnight<00:02:46.690> Friday<00:02:47.349> night

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
will be from about midnight Friday night

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.400 
will be from about midnight Friday night
until<00:02:48.160> maybe<00:02:48.640> six<00:02:49.060> o'clock<00:02:49.390> Saturday<00:02:49.989> evening

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
until maybe six o'clock Saturday evening

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.610 
until maybe six o'clock Saturday evening
and<00:02:50.879> with<00:02:51.879> snow<00:02:52.180> showers<00:02:52.629> there<00:02:52.959> convective

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
and with snow showers there convective

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.170 
and with snow showers there convective
it's<00:02:53.769> kind<00:02:53.950> of<00:02:53.980> like<00:02:54.099> the<00:02:54.280> rain<00:02:54.519> showers<00:02:55.030> in

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
it's kind of like the rain showers in

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.080 
it's kind of like the rain showers in
the<00:02:55.239> summer<00:02:55.510> afternoon<00:02:56.640> they'll<00:02:57.640> be<00:02:57.760> kind<00:02:58.000> of

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
the summer afternoon they'll be kind of

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.819 
the summer afternoon they'll be kind of
scattered<00:02:58.540> but<00:02:58.720> where<00:02:58.959> they<00:02:59.079> do<00:02:59.140> form<00:02:59.590> that

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
scattered but where they do form that

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.410 
scattered but where they do form that
there<00:03:00.010> could<00:03:00.160> be<00:03:00.190> a<00:03:00.310> brief<00:03:00.640> burst<00:03:00.940> of<00:03:01.150> heavier

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
there could be a brief burst of heavier

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.720 
there could be a brief burst of heavier
snow<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.049> that<00:03:02.709> might<00:03:03.010> make<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.430> ground

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
snow and that might make the ground

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.119 
snow and that might make the ground
white<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:04.359> grass<00:03:04.690> in<00:03:05.049> spots<00:03:05.410> and<00:03:05.709> maybe<00:03:05.859> up<00:03:06.099> to

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
white and grass in spots and maybe up to

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.509 
white and grass in spots and maybe up to
one-half<00:03:06.609> inch<00:03:07.470> so<00:03:08.470> we'll<00:03:08.829> maintain<00:03:09.069> that

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
one-half inch so we'll maintain that

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.270 
one-half inch so we'll maintain that
chance<00:03:09.910> of<00:03:10.060> a<00:03:10.150> dusting<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:11.379> one-half<00:03:11.829> inch<00:03:12.069> on

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
chance of a dusting the one-half inch on

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.979 
chance of a dusting the one-half inch on
the<00:03:12.400> grass<00:03:12.700> don't<00:03:13.090> expect<00:03:13.390> anything<00:03:13.629> on<00:03:13.900> the

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
chance of the you know one half inch

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.129
