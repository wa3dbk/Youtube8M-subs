00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.189
 So we have gigantic 

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.509
 audience figures at the same time but we 

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:08.029
 lose before the young audience 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.459
 Introducing turi is already correct 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.839
 the gap must be closed 25 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.849
 minutes 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:15.799
 is that really so popular and 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.359
 have of course seen as the other day 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.359
 we want new science fiction series 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:25.550
 but makes quite nice your tin cans 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:30.339
 robots not against monster I want 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:34.280
 that is produced by our director 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:36.289
 are we in it you are the advice yet 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.620
 not because it has the wrong shape and 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:41.449
 sprinklers go off when it gets hot 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.780
 he has canceled very friendly series 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.340
 kisses a not so friendly cancellation 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.739
 none of this is thank you 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.210
 even they will fit perfectly nobody will 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.649
 can escape from him that is the 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.649
 gods and today double 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.539
 Quiet 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.250
 I need the inner one on the spot 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.989
 the seven did a lot 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.090
 exhausting woman after that they have me 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:13.479
 from men is here is their 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:16.259
 stupidly satisfied i am whole and 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.259
 not at all satisfied 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.390
 in which dimension I'm not straight 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.280
 I would like to know that 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.299
 behave like a producer 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.840
 They find a way to do it all 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.670
 create 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.560
 or if you can not cope with it 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.429
 you will need any help you need 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.890
 can get 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:35.320
 she has far exceeded the budget 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.390
 what does it just send you dr 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.190
 the deathblow exactly what I am 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.350
 wanted to avoid absolutely worthless 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.119
 you already know that science fiction 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.080
 they want me to turn them all over 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:49.630
 again I'm afraid they know 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.030
 I've never had this in my life 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.550
 made something big with so much pressure 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.840
 and so many are turning to it 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.840
 Darn heard I'm happy for you 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.840
 promised 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.810
