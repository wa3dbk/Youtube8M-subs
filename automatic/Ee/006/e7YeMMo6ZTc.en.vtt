 say that we are going to find a browser 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.150
 very similar to what is google chrome 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.129
 obviously with options 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.750
 different personalization and some 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.970

 People who want to try a 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.010
 different browser that they want to put 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.019
 a new alternative as this is a 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.390
 excellent option so without further 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:00.000
 preambles let's start with the first step 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.360
 of this video tutorial 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.360
 ah 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.690
 in the description of this youtube you can 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.210
 find a link so you can 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.530
 download this browser once 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.870
 everything is click on that basic limit 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.790
 directly to their page to the 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.080
 creators of this browser here 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.090
 we're just going to find the 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.100
 different platforms for which 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.900
 is this browser in this case 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.760
 let's give this option click 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.960
 where it says windows if you also want it 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.760
 try for andres since you can 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.680
 select android if you want it to 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.360
 You can select it depending on 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.070
 the platform that you want but in this 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.320
 chance let's click on where it says 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.820
 windows once we do it itself 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.009
 we are in the google browser with in the 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.229
 bottom left will start 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.940
 load and will continue the download as well 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.040
 that once the 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.680
 download that will be the file that we are going to 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.540
 find and here we have it once 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.280
 has been downloaded with my case 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.560
 on the desk we will have this 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.930
 browser installer which carries 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.550
 its respective logo which is like a 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.410
 primer so it will simply be 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.050
 question of double-clicking on it and 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.940
 start with what would be the installation 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.980
 well this is the window that appears 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.720
 really customizable and pretty 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.430
 striking now let's click on this 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.440
 option is where this pinion appears 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.540
 to be able to verify other options 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.250
 before installation so once 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.870
 let's click on that function we will 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.460
 appear these in this case we can 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.930
 change the location where it's going to 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.520
 install the browser in this case the 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.530
 I'm going to leave there where he comes for 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.150
 defect but I'm going to unmark this 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.540
 second option not to mention 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.040
 belong to this type of to send 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.930
 anonymous accounts and all that kind of 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.250
 things so I'll select it 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.440
 we're just going to leave the last 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.940
 option where we agree and accept 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.950
 the license agreements to install 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.630
 this browser so once we have 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.670
 this will simply be to click on 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.920
 where it says install and let's wait 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.920
 a few seconds cute is installed this 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.200
 browser well one already culminates 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.550
 install this browser we will be able to 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.160
 find that already on the desk I 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.930
 there is a direct access to the browser as well 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.240
 that now we are going to execute it and we are going to 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.680
 see who we are going to find a 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.210
 Once we execute it, it is in the interface 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.440
 that we are going to find we are going to be able 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.940
 see your browser as I say 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.560
 similar to what is google chrome 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.420
 but with different options of 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.530
 personalization which personally I 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.330
 he has called quite 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.740
 attention the first thing we're going to 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.840
 find if we do not go to the first 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.540
 option that opens us once we open this 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.150
 browser is let's click on that 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.040
 part of when you say nauta style and 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.870
 they are going to give us two options like you 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.870
 want either this function to put 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.580
 all these these shortcuts to 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.530
 different types of pages or the second 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.209
 option as they appear in those in the form of 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.920
 bubble well in this case I'm going to 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.690
 choose this next option you 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.010
 they should choose the one you want in 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.630
 this case I'm going to click on where 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.069
 says to apply let's wait for some 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.540
 seconds and let's see how well it has 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.400
 applied ie the shortcuts to 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.380
 different types of pages as per 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.000
 example youtube tables simply be 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.640
 click on it and let's see what is going to 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.580
 redirect automatically to YouTube 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.709
 there as we can see it well 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.959
 this is the next option among others 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.190
 functions that we will find as they 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.750
 I say the option to customize what 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.580
 pretty fast for that we 're going to 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.810
 direct to the top right of the 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.940
 browser on the top where 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.370
 an icon appears as a t-shirt 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.260
 a shirt which is put on by the mouse 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.180
 tells us to change the subject so 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.370
 just let's give this we click 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.380
 will open a new window and we will 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.860
 can find different types of 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.810
 themes 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.519
 what you obviously want in 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.410
 this case we are going to select one at 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.440
 randomly and let's click on where it says 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.560
 apply anything to start customizing 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.990
 a little more this browser then once 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.520
 already this topic has been applied this is the 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.530
 interface that we are going to find now of the 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.240
 browser in this topic you can 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.430
 choose the different types of topics and 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.530
 it's quite pretty nice to the 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.240
 seen in terms of speed I'm going to 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.550
 try some time ago and it seems to me that 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.260
 it really goes well and like google 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.750
 chrome that really is also one of 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.760
 my favorites but really in the 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.380
 'tests' according to you are almost the same 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.660
 in terms of speed, it will be 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.210
 question of you if you want to try it or 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.530
 not the functions to change has 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.780
 many functions but the functions 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.700
 By default, the browser will be 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.020
 this part of here the icon we are going to 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.910
 click and let's get us 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.740
 explain different types of functions 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.450
 between them as always they open one 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.790
 new window to navigate in a way 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.070
 incognita we have the function for 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.930
 extensions in the function to search and 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.730
 the options here where it says 6 and we 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.440
 we will be able to modify different types 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.080
 of things at that time the browser will 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.100
 found in English but I think the 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.930
 updates for new ones 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.790
 in different types of languages ​​they are already 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.020
 appear promptly for the time being 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.060
 they are not available but 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.010
 it really is not very difficult to be guided 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.440
 in these interfaces but here we are going to 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.910
 to be able to change as always for example 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.920
 you have to change the home page 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.740
 simply here where they say net &amp; 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.930
 space simply has to put the 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.030
 url of the page that we want 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.170
 have functions of the tables also 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.450
 a function that has called me quite 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.460
 attention and in the hot cakes is that 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.260
 allows us to see the operations that 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.270
 can do with the keyboard like 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.430
 also that the managements that can be 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.560
 do with the mouse so for example 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.320
 if we move here we can refresh 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.880
 the page all this really is 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.620
 pretty pretty customizable this 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.540
 browser that I leave to you so that 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.880
 you will see it little by little 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.830
 friends then this is the video tutorial of 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.300
 this time the people as I say yes 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.160
 They want to try a new function 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.960
 here they have to download this 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.160
 new browser and take out their own 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.120
 conclusions 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.500
 I would like you in the 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.300
 comments on this video tell me if I already 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.950
 they knew him or if they have not known him then 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.960
