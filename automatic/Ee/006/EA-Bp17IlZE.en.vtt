00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
at all and this is a method that is

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.839 
at all and this is a method that is
actually<00:00:07.529> suitable<00:00:07.950> for<00:00:08.160> thinner<00:00:08.429> hair

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
actually suitable for thinner hair

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.600 
actually suitable for thinner hair
because<00:00:09.660> often<00:00:10.170> when<00:00:10.290> you<00:00:10.410> try<00:00:10.679> equals<00:00:11.370> waves

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
because often when you try equals waves

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.700 
because often when you try equals waves
like<00:00:12.090> overnight<00:00:12.450> curling<00:00:13.019> methods<00:00:13.410> are<00:00:13.530> just

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
like overnight curling methods are just

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.620 
like overnight curling methods are just
heatless<00:00:14.070> curling<00:00:14.429> methods<00:00:14.790> they<00:00:15.240> involve

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
heatless curling methods they involve

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.200 
heatless curling methods they involve
braiding<00:00:16.230> or<00:00:16.440> twisting<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.340> hair<00:00:17.550> which

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
braiding or twisting of the hair which

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.609 
braiding or twisting of the hair which
is<00:00:18.240> doesn't<00:00:18.570> work<00:00:18.779> for<00:00:18.990> thinner<00:00:19.199> hair<00:00:19.410> because

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
is doesn't work for thinner hair because

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.470 
is doesn't work for thinner hair because
you<00:00:19.710> end<00:00:19.859> up<00:00:19.949> with<00:00:20.070> tiny<00:00:20.310> little<00:00:20.520> crimps<00:00:20.970> but

they'll<00:01:47.939> hold<00:01:48.360> really<00:01:48.720> well<00:01:48.869> but<00:01:49.049> bobbins

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
they'll hold really well but bobbins

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.319 
they'll hold really well but bobbins
work<00:01:49.770> just<00:01:49.979> as<00:01:50.130> well<00:01:50.310> then<00:01:50.850> I'm<00:01:50.939> going<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.210> do

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
work just as well then I'm going to do

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.999 
work just as well then I'm going to do
the<00:01:51.420> same<00:01:51.600> thing<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.110> other<00:01:52.350> section<00:01:52.829> and

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
the same thing to the other section and

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.090 
the same thing to the other section and
it<00:01:53.250> doesn't<00:01:53.520> really<00:01:53.610> matter<00:01:53.850> what<00:01:54.630> um<00:01:55.040> way<00:01:56.040> you

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
it doesn't really matter what um way you

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.399 
it doesn't really matter what um way you
twist<00:01:56.549> them<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.630> just<00:01:57.899> alternates<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
twist them in that just alternates the

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.800 
twist them in that just alternates the
direction<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.159> waves<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.850> I<00:02:00.149> kind<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.570> go

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
direction of the waves so I kind of go

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.149 
direction of the waves so I kind of go
back<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.079> forth<00:02:01.290> between<00:02:01.560> twisting

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
back and forth between twisting

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.600 
back and forth between twisting
backwards<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.759> forwards<00:02:04.070> I'm<00:02:05.070> going<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.430> pin

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
backwards and forwards I'm going to pin

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.550 
backwards and forwards I'm going to pin
that<00:02:05.640> down<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:06.119> my<00:02:06.210> head<00:02:06.390> as<00:02:06.509> well<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:07.110> then<00:02:07.500> I

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
that down to my head as well and then I

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.109 
that down to my head as well and then I
can<00:02:07.740> just<00:02:07.920> start<00:02:08.069> working<00:02:08.220> on<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.610> top<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.970> my

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
can just start working on the top of my

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.639 
can just start working on the top of my
hair<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.509> this<00:02:09.810> I'm<00:02:10.050> going<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.319> divide<00:02:10.500> into

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
hair and this I'm going to divide into

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.229 
hair and this I'm going to divide into
three<00:02:11.039> sections<00:02:11.280> because<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.670> have<00:02:11.790> more<00:02:12.000> hair

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
three sections because I have more hair

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.370 
three sections because I have more hair
on<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.510> top<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:12.900> have

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
on the top that I have

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.330 
on the top that I have
autum<00:02:15.320> so<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.440> procedure<00:02:16.800> is<00:02:16.950> same<00:02:17.310> just

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
autum so the procedure is same just

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.300 
autum so the procedure is same just
spray<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.210> down<00:02:18.330> with<00:02:18.570> salty<00:02:18.900> water<00:02:19.070> so<00:02:20.070> I<00:02:20.100> sit

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
spray it down with salty water so I sit

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.960 
spray it down with salty water so I sit
around<00:02:20.400> my<00:02:20.670> hand<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.120> pin<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.510> down<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:22.970> for

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
around my hand and pin it down and for

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.850 
around my hand and pin it down and for
the<00:02:24.000> front<00:02:24.270> section<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:24.930> want<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.260> pay<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.560> little

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
the front section I want to pay a little

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.770 
the front section I want to pay a little
bit<00:02:25.980> more<00:02:26.070> attention<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.580> risk<00:02:26.850> because<00:02:27.180> this

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
bit more attention to risk because this

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.330 
bit more attention to risk because this
is<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.230> part<00:02:28.470> that<00:02:28.530> kind<00:02:28.800> of<00:02:28.890> frames<00:02:29.190> your

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
is the part that kind of frames your

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.670 
is the part that kind of frames your
face<00:02:29.400> it's<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:29.970> most<00:02:30.150> noticeable<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:31.320> this

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
face it's the most noticeable so this

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.740 
face it's the most noticeable so this
I'm<00:02:31.890> going<00:02:32.100> to<00:02:32.280> rap<00:02:32.490> backwards<00:02:33.240> so<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.540> it

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
I'm going to rap backwards so that it

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.320 
I'm going to rap backwards so that it
have<00:02:33.870> swoops<00:02:34.230> away<00:02:34.530> from<00:02:34.770> my<00:02:34.920> face<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.490> I'm

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
have swoops away from my face and I'm

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.750 
have swoops away from my face and I'm
going<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.690> pin<00:02:36.930> this<00:02:37.310> with<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.430> curls

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
going to pin this with the curls

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.460 
going to pin this with the curls
standing<00:02:39.150> up<00:02:39.330> instead<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:39.870> lying<00:02:40.230> down

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
standing up instead of lying down

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.610 
standing up instead of lying down
against<00:02:40.950> my<00:02:41.100> head<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:42.780> yet<00:02:42.960> this<00:02:43.230> just<00:02:43.440> gives

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
against my head and yet this just gives

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.080 
against my head and yet this just gives
a<00:02:43.710> little<00:02:43.740> bit<00:02:43.950> more<00:02:44.160> volume<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:44.730> like<00:02:44.910> that

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
a little bit more volume and I like that

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.520 
a little bit more volume and I like that
in<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.270> front<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:45.660> I'm<00:02:45.750> going<00:02:46.020> to<00:02:46.050> pin<00:02:46.320> this

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
in the front so I'm going to pin this

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.000 
in the front so I'm going to pin this
down<00:02:46.590> like<00:02:47.070> this<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:48.620> then<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:49.710> should<00:02:49.860> end

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
down like this and then you should end

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.470 
down like this and then you should end
up<00:02:50.040> with<00:02:50.130> something<00:02:50.580> like<00:02:50.670> this<00:02:50.730> so<00:02:51.120> I'm<00:02:51.240> going

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
up with something like this so I'm going

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.900 
up with something like this so I'm going

through<00:03:12.240> and<00:03:12.390> through<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.720> other<00:03:12.750> thing<00:03:13.320> you

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
through and through the other thing you

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
through and through the other thing you
can<00:03:13.560> do<00:03:13.740> is<00:03:14.270> sleep<00:03:15.270> on<00:03:15.450> this<00:03:15.830> that's<00:03:16.830> the

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
can do is sleep on this that's the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.700 
can do is sleep on this that's the
preferred<00:03:17.790> method<00:03:18.240> I<00:03:18.390> would<00:03:18.600> say<00:03:18.840> because<00:03:19.170> the

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
preferred method I would say because the

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.340 
preferred method I would say because the
longer<00:03:19.890> your<00:03:20.370> hair<00:03:20.700> is<00:03:20.910> in<00:03:20.940> this<00:03:21.420> curl<00:03:21.720> the

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
longer your hair is in this curl the

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.780 
longer your hair is in this curl the
longer<00:03:22.710> the<00:03:22.830> curl<00:03:22.980> will<00:03:23.190> last<00:03:23.430> when<00:03:23.700> you

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
longer the curl will last when you

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.760 
longer the curl will last when you
actually<00:03:23.940> take<00:03:24.330> it<00:03:24.510> out<00:03:24.630> you<00:03:25.320> just<00:03:25.530> kind<00:03:25.680> of

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
actually take it out you just kind of

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.340 
actually take it out you just kind of
enforce<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.730> shape<00:03:27.360> into<00:03:27.690> your<00:03:27.840> hair<00:03:28.110> so

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
enforce that shape into your hair so

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.350 
enforce that shape into your hair so
sleeping<00:03:28.800> on<00:03:28.890> it<00:03:28.980> is<00:03:29.100> the<00:03:29.220> best<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:29.970> may<00:03:30.150> want

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
sleeping on it is the best you may want

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.000 
sleeping on it is the best you may want
to<00:03:30.390> cover<00:03:30.630> your<00:03:30.810> hair<00:03:31.020> up<00:03:31.170> with<00:03:31.380> some<00:03:31.650> kind<00:03:31.860> of
