let's take a quick walkthrough on what I

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.509 
let's take a quick walkthrough on what I
did<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.780> machine<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.980> most<00:00:11.130> notable

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
did to the machine the most notable

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.360 
did to the machine the most notable
feature<00:00:11.639> is<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.330> raised<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.230> top<00:00:13.500> playfield

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
feature is I raised the top playfield

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.369 
feature is I raised the top playfield
glass<00:00:14.670> three<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.240> five-eighths<00:00:15.660> inches<00:00:16.109> and

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
the back box three and 5/8 inches and I

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.490 
the back box three and 5/8 inches and I
added<00:00:20.490> hinges<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.270> back<00:00:21.539> box<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.380> can

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
added hinges to the back box so it can

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.620 
added hinges to the back box so it can
fold<00:00:22.740> down<00:00:22.830> for<00:00:23.340> easy<00:00:23.640> transport

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
fold down for easy transport

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.170 
fold down for easy transport
this<00:00:25.140> makes<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.500> cabinet<00:00:25.949> much<00:00:26.430> closer<00:00:26.760> to

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
this makes the cabinet much closer to

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.230 
this makes the cabinet much closer to
the<00:00:27.390> modern<00:00:28.340> involved<00:00:29.340> cabinet<00:00:29.730> dimensions

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
the modern involved cabinet dimensions

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.630 
the modern involved cabinet dimensions
it<00:00:31.019> also<00:00:31.170> allows<00:00:31.529> me<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.890> have<00:00:32.040> room<00:00:32.279> under<00:00:32.520> the

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
it also allows me to have room under the

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.200 
it also allows me to have room under the
playfield<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.300> add<00:00:33.420> some<00:00:33.690> items<00:00:34.850> first<00:00:35.850> item

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210

playfield to add some items first item
that's<00:00:36.360> obvious<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.440> mirrored<00:00:37.950> playfield

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
that's obvious is the mirrored playfield

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.220 
that's obvious is the mirrored playfield
this<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> see-through<00:00:42.120> mirror<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:43.170> I

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
this is a see-through mirror that I

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.340 
this is a see-through mirror that I
added<00:00:43.469> on<00:00:43.710> top<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.100> playfield<00:00:45.110> you<00:00:46.110> see

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
added on top of the playfield you see

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.680 
added on top of the playfield you see
that<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> addition<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.219> see-through

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
that the addition of a see-through

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.100 
that the addition of a see-through
mirror<00:00:48.690> adds<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:50.610> reflection<00:00:51.149> for<00:00:51.329> depth<00:00:51.570> but

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
mirror adds the reflection for depth but

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.869 
mirror adds the reflection for depth but
it<00:00:52.140> also<00:00:52.350> makes<00:00:52.739> for<00:00:52.829> disappearing<00:00:53.340> inserts

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
it also makes for disappearing inserts

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.410 
it also makes for disappearing inserts
or<00:00:54.149> invisible<00:00:54.930> inserts<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.879> call<00:00:56.879> those<00:00:57.059> in

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
or invisible inserts I call those in

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.560 
or invisible inserts I call those in
bibs<00:00:58.640> when<00:00:59.640> they're<00:00:59.789> on<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.120> can<00:01:00.239> see<00:01:00.420> them

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
bibs when they're on you can see them

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.560 
bibs when they're on you can see them
when<00:01:01.050> they're<00:01:01.140> off<00:01:01.320> they<00:01:01.800> disappear<00:01:02.420> so<00:01:03.420> what

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
when they're off they disappear so what

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.770 
when they're off they disappear so what
you<00:01:03.690> see<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.580> monolithic<00:01:05.580> mirror<00:01:06.299> playfield

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
for the lower play field I added a

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.919 
for the lower play field I added a
skill-shot<00:02:05.130> ramp<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:06.300> I<00:02:06.420> call<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.659> launch

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
area it's covered and then it opens up

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.960 
area it's covered and then it opens up
into<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.440> skill-shot<00:02:16.739> where<00:02:17.340> if<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.760> do<00:02:17.940> a

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
into a skill-shot where if you do a

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.130 
into a skill-shot where if you do a
partial<00:02:18.300> plunger<00:02:19.069> pull<00:02:20.069> it<00:02:20.519> will<00:02:21.110> fall<00:02:22.110> down
