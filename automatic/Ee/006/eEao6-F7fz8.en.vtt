hello this is presto occur in a previous

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.690 
hello this is presto occur in a previous
video<00:00:04.170> I<00:00:04.529> showed<00:00:04.560> you<00:00:05.069> how<00:00:05.220> you<00:00:05.279> can<00:00:05.430> do<00:00:05.549> the

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
video I showed you how you can do the

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.639 
video I showed you how you can do the
times<00:00:05.970> table<00:00:06.420> from<00:00:06.629> six<00:00:06.960> through<00:00:07.200> ten<00:00:07.379> on<00:00:07.589> your

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
times table from six through ten on your

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.430 
times table from six through ten on your
fingers<00:00:08.189> in<00:00:08.400> this<00:00:09.090> video<00:00:09.360> I'll<00:00:09.570> explain<00:00:09.599> why

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
fingers in this video I'll explain why

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.680 
fingers in this video I'll explain why
this<00:00:10.889> works<00:00:13.160> the<00:00:14.160> method<00:00:14.580> begins<00:00:14.759> by

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
this works the method begins by

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.990 
this works the method begins by
numbering<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.289> fingers<00:00:16.740> on<00:00:16.920> your<00:00:16.949> hands<00:00:17.550> six

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
numbering the fingers on your hands six

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.160 
numbering the fingers on your hands six
through<00:00:18.300> ten<00:00:18.949> to<00:00:19.949> do<00:00:20.130> seven<00:00:20.730> times<00:00:21.119> eight<00:00:21.420> we

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
through ten to do seven times eight we

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.320 
through ten to do seven times eight we
line<00:00:22.470> up<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.980> finger<00:00:23.400> four<00:00:23.580> seven<00:00:24.000> on<00:00:24.150> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
line up the finger four seven on the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.720 
line up the finger four seven on the
left<00:00:24.539> hand<00:00:24.869> with<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.859> finger<00:00:26.160> four<00:00:26.340> eight<00:00:26.519> on

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
left hand with the finger four eight on

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.990 
left hand with the finger four eight on
the<00:00:26.910> right<00:00:27.090> hand<00:00:27.980> we<00:00:28.980> then<00:00:29.160> count<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.550> number

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
the right hand we then count the number

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.389 
the right hand we then count the number
of<00:00:30.029> fingers<00:00:30.800> including<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.890> fingers<00:00:32.219> which

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
of fingers including the fingers which

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.970 
of fingers including the fingers which
are<00:00:32.489> touching<00:00:32.930> that<00:00:33.930> are<00:00:34.079> below<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.440> fingers

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
are touching that are below the fingers

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.030 
are touching that are below the fingers
which<00:00:35.160> are<00:00:35.280> touching<00:00:36.710> there<00:00:37.710> were<00:00:37.829> five

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
which are touching there were five

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.440 
which are touching there were five
fingers<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:38.879> figure

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
fingers in this figure

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.069 
fingers in this figure
these<00:00:40.379> are<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.770> TENS<00:00:41.070> units<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.690> becomes

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
these are the TENS units so this becomes

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.190 
these are the TENS units so this becomes
50<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:43.910> the<00:00:44.910> left<00:00:45.120> hand<00:00:45.390> there<00:00:45.719> are<00:00:45.809> three

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
50 on the left hand there are three

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.170 
50 on the left hand there are three
fingers<00:00:46.649> above<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.219> touching<00:00:47.610> fingers<00:00:47.969> and

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
fingers above the touching fingers and

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.970 
fingers above the touching fingers and
on<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.450> right<00:00:48.629> hand<00:00:48.840> there<00:00:49.110> are<00:00:49.140> two<00:00:49.469> fingers

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
on the right hand there are two fingers

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.600 
on the right hand there are two fingers
above<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.000> fingers<00:00:51.390> touching<00:00:51.660> we<00:00:52.559> multiply<00:00:53.190> 3

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
above the fingers touching we multiply 3

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.150 
above the fingers touching we multiply 3
&amp;<00:00:53.730> 2<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.090> get<00:00:54.210> 6<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.440> gets<00:00:55.680> us<00:00:55.829> our<00:00:56.010> answer

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
&amp; 2 to get 6 and that gets us our answer

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.639 
&amp; 2 to get 6 and that gets us our answer
of<00:00:56.399> 56<00:00:57.149> but<00:00:57.960> why<00:00:58.140> does<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.559> method<00:00:58.800> work<00:01:00.649> I'll

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
of 56 but why does this method work I'll

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.500 
of 56 but why does this method work I'll
try<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.190> explain<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.640> problem<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.210> another

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
try and explain the problem in another

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.760 
try and explain the problem in another
way<00:01:04.070> let's<00:01:05.070> try<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.519> do<00:01:05.670> 10<00:01:06.180> minus<00:01:06.570> 3<00:01:06.600> times<00:01:07.470> 10

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
way let's try and do 10 minus 3 times 10

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.840 
way let's try and do 10 minus 3 times 10
minus<00:01:08.159> 2<00:01:09.320> this<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.680> same<00:01:10.890> problem<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.430> 7

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
minus 2 this is the same problem of 7

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.969 
minus 2 this is the same problem of 7
times<00:01:12.060> 8<00:01:12.299> but<00:01:12.630> we'll<00:01:12.780> think<00:01:12.810> about<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.470> as<00:01:13.619> 10

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
times 8 but we'll think about it as 10

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.390 
times 8 but we'll think about it as 10
minus<00:01:14.340> 3<00:01:14.369> times<00:01:15.180> 10<00:01:15.450> minus<00:01:15.780> 2<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:17.189> left

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
minus 3 times 10 minus 2 on the left

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.179 
minus 3 times 10 minus 2 on the left
hand<00:01:17.670> we<00:01:17.880> rotate<00:01:18.479> three<00:01:19.290> fingers<00:01:19.799> from<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
hand we rotate three fingers from the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.420 
hand we rotate three fingers from the
pinky<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> right<00:01:21.420> hand<00:01:21.630> we<00:01:22.400> line<00:01:23.400> up

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
pinky and on the right hand we line up

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.289 
pinky and on the right hand we line up
two<00:01:23.939> fingers<00:01:24.420> from<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.810> pinky<00:01:25.790> we<00:01:26.790> then<00:01:27.000> count

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
two fingers from the pinky we then count

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.819 
two fingers from the pinky we then count
the<00:01:27.479> number<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.780> fingers<00:01:28.200> which<00:01:28.380> are<00:01:28.500> below

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
the number of fingers which are below

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.670 
the number of fingers which are below
the<00:01:28.860> fingers<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.850> are<00:01:29.970> touching<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.320> 10

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
the fingers that are touching this is 10

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.429 
the fingers that are touching this is 10
minus<00:01:32.189> 3<00:01:32.220> on<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.119> left<00:01:33.329> hand<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.810> then<00:01:34.290> we

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
minus 3 on the left hand and then we

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.190 
minus 3 on the left hand and then we
subtract<00:01:34.860> 2<00:01:35.130> for<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.790> fingers<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:37.079> are

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
subtract 2 for the fingers that are

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.630 
subtract 2 for the fingers that are
above<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.409> touching<00:01:37.920> fingers<00:01:38.220> on<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.460> right

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
above the touching fingers on the right

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.179 
above the touching fingers on the right
hand<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.689> what<00:01:39.810> we're<00:01:39.990> doing<00:01:40.020> here<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.680> 10

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
hand so what we're doing here is 10

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.670 
hand so what we're doing here is 10
times<00:01:41.880> 10<00:01:42.119> minus<00:01:42.299> 3<00:01:42.689> minus<00:01:42.810> 2<00:01:43.170> which<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.470> 50<00:01:45.680> now

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
times 10 minus 3 minus 2 which is 50 now

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.200 
times 10 minus 3 minus 2 which is 50 now
we<00:01:46.740> count<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.220> number<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.490> fingers<00:01:47.909> which<00:01:48.090> are

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
we count the number of fingers which are

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.569 
we count the number of fingers which are
above<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.689> touching<00:01:49.229> fingers<00:01:49.590> there's<00:01:50.189> three

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
above the touching fingers there's three

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.539 
above the touching fingers there's three
on<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.850> left<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.329> two<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.899> right<00:01:52.340> we<00:01:53.340> then

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
on the left and two on the right we then

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.170 
on the left and two on the right we then
multiply<00:01:53.850> these<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:55.110> get<00:01:55.290> 6<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.939> once

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
multiply these to get 6 and that once

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.399 
multiply these to get 6 and that once
again<00:01:57.479> gives<00:01:57.960> us<00:01:58.170> 56<00:01:59.600> so<00:02:00.600> now<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.780> can<00:02:01.049> see<00:02:01.229> why

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
again gives us 56 so now you can see why

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.889 
again gives us 56 so now you can see why
the<00:02:01.469> process<00:02:01.799> works<00:02:02.280> in<00:02:02.549> general<00:02:02.759> we'll<00:02:03.659> think

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
the process works in general we'll think

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.289 
the process works in general we'll think
about<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.229> algebraically<00:02:05.159> what<00:02:05.909> we're<00:02:06.060> really

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
about it algebraically what we're really

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.839 
about it algebraically what we're really
doing<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:07.140> we're<00:02:07.920> multiplying<00:02:08.750> 10<00:02:10.220> minus<00:02:11.220> a

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
doing is we're multiplying 10 minus a

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.739 
doing is we're multiplying 10 minus a
ten<00:02:13.390> minus<00:02:14.290> B<00:02:14.620> where<00:02:15.579> a<00:02:15.819> is<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.359> number<00:02:16.659> of

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:16.749 
ten minus B where a is the number of

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:20.160 
ten minus B where a is the number of
fingers<00:02:17.969> above<00:02:18.969> the<00:02:19.209> touching<00:02:19.599> fingers<00:02:19.989> or

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
fingers above the touching fingers or

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.949 
fingers above the touching fingers or
from<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.889> pinkie<00:02:21.249> and<00:02:21.370> B<00:02:22.120> is<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.450> same

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
from the pinkie and B is the same

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.160 
from the pinkie and B is the same
quantity<00:02:23.680> on<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.249> right<00:02:24.430> hand<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.989> two

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
quantity on the right hand the two

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.500 
quantity on the right hand the two
fingers<00:02:26.590> were<00:02:26.739> touching<00:02:27.609> we<00:02:27.760> label<00:02:28.120> as<00:02:28.209> ten

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
fingers were touching we label as ten

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.140 
fingers were touching we label as ten
minus<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:29.019> and<00:02:29.170> ten<00:02:29.379> minus<00:02:29.739> B<00:02:29.950> now<00:02:30.879> how<00:02:31.090> many

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
minus a and ten minus B now how many

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.089 
minus a and ten minus B now how many
fingers<00:02:31.540> are<00:02:31.870> below<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.379> touching<00:02:32.739> fingers

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
fingers are below the touching fingers

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.399 
fingers are below the touching fingers
while<00:02:33.700> we<00:02:33.819> subtract<00:02:34.239> a<00:02:34.389> fingers<00:02:34.930> on<00:02:35.079> the<00:02:35.200> left

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
while we subtract a fingers on the left

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.440 
while we subtract a fingers on the left
and<00:02:35.620> B<00:02:35.859> fingers<00:02:36.250> on<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.489> right<00:02:36.670> from<00:02:37.060> ten<00:02:37.269> in

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
and B fingers on the right from ten in

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.959 
and B fingers on the right from ten in
total<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:38.620> this<00:02:38.769> becomes<00:02:39.159> ten<00:02:39.459> times<00:02:39.489> ten

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:39.969 
total so this becomes ten times ten

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:43.949 
total so this becomes ten times ten
minus<00:02:40.389> a<00:02:40.540> minus<00:02:41.049> B<00:02:41.879> we<00:02:42.879> then<00:02:43.090> multiply<00:02:43.659> the<00:02:43.719> a

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
minus a minus B we then multiply the a

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.500 
minus a minus B we then multiply the a
and<00:02:44.379> B<00:02:44.530> fingers<00:02:44.950> which<00:02:45.129> are<00:02:45.280> above<00:02:45.519> to<00:02:45.939> get<00:02:46.090> a<00:02:46.269> B

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
and B fingers which are above to get a B

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.050 
and B fingers which are above to get a B
and<00:02:46.750> this<00:02:47.439> is<00:02:47.620> why<00:02:47.799> the<00:02:47.859> reason<00:02:48.189> works<00:02:48.549> we're

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
and this is why the reason works we're

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.720 
and this is why the reason works we're
essentially<00:02:49.510> doing<00:02:50.049> the<00:02:50.409> foil<00:02:50.709> method<00:02:51.069> of<00:02:51.489> ten

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
essentially doing the foil method of ten

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.449 
essentially doing the foil method of ten
minus<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.209> times<00:02:52.480> 10<00:02:52.719> minus<00:02:52.900> B<00:02:53.199> but<00:02:53.919> using<00:02:54.340> our

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
minus a times 10 minus B but using our

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.559 
minus a times 10 minus B but using our
fingers<00:02:54.939> in<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.750> concrete<00:02:56.019> method<00:02:57.329> so<00:02:58.329> it's

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
fingers in a concrete method so it's

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.689 
fingers in a concrete method so it's
totally<00:02:58.840> valid<00:02:59.500> technique<00:02:59.680> and<00:03:00.159> it's<00:03:00.459> pretty

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:00.699 
totally valid technique and it's pretty

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:02.939 
totally valid technique and it's pretty
cool<00:03:00.909> that<00:03:00.969> it<00:03:01.209> works<00:03:01.419> I<00:03:01.689> hope<00:03:02.530> you<00:03:02.680> liked<00:03:02.829> this
