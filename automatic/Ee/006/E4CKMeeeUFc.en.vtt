just so much going on in any single
moment<00:03:29.860> I<00:03:30.160> really<00:03:30.520> think<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:30.790> focus<00:03:31.150> of<00:03:31.270> this

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
moment I really think the focus of this

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.210

event though from what I've seen is the
stand-up<00:03:34.120> paddleboarding<00:03:34.600> events<00:03:34.930> for<00:03:35.440> the

it with the stand up paddle sprint is

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.290 
it with the stand up paddle sprint is
the<00:03:59.260> sub<00:03:59.620> cross<00:03:59.920> and<00:04:00.340> that's<00:04:00.820> a<00:04:00.910> much<00:04:01.090> shorter

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
the sub cross and that's a much shorter

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.990 
the sub cross and that's a much shorter
distance<00:04:01.870> and<00:04:02.250> most<00:04:03.250> of<00:04:03.340> them<00:04:03.430> use<00:04:03.580> shorter

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
distance and most of them use shorter

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.330 
distance and most of them use shorter
inflatable<00:04:04.510> boards<00:04:04.720> for<00:04:04.870> that<00:04:05.020> and<00:04:05.230> sub<00:04:06.100> cross

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
inflatable boards for that and sub cross

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.430 
inflatable boards for that and sub cross
is<00:04:06.550> basically<00:04:06.970> just<00:04:07.030> all-out<00:04:07.390> chaos<00:04:08.170> where

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
is basically just all-out chaos where

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.050 
is basically just all-out chaos where
these<00:04:08.530> guys<00:04:08.710> are<00:04:08.770> all<00:04:09.130> really<00:04:09.550> close<00:04:09.820> together

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
these guys are all really close together

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.180 
these guys are all really close together
there's<00:04:10.930> a<00:04:10.990> lot<00:04:11.110> of<00:04:11.140> randomness<00:04:11.590> going<00:04:11.950> on<00:04:12.070> but

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
there's a lot of randomness going on but

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.520 
there's a lot of randomness going on but
you<00:04:12.250> can<00:04:12.340> also<00:04:12.460> see<00:04:13.050> incredible<00:04:14.050> amounts<00:04:14.530> of

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
you can also see incredible amounts of

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.500 
you can also see incredible amounts of
skill<00:04:14.950> as<00:04:15.100> well<00:04:15.130> I<00:04:15.340> mean<00:04:15.580> the<00:04:15.790> the<00:04:16.060> cream<00:04:16.330> is

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
skill as well I mean the the cream is

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.910 
skill as well I mean the the cream is
definitely<00:04:16.840> rising<00:04:16.960> to<00:04:17.230> the<00:04:17.320> top<00:04:17.350> on<00:04:17.739> these

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
definitely rising to the top on these

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.680 
definitely rising to the top on these
myself<00:04:18.670> personally<00:04:18.850> I'm<00:04:19.060> pretty<00:04:19.239> excited<00:04:19.330> to

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690
