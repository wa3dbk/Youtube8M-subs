00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.189
 I'm not going to say exact measurements here but 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.980
 I'll say more or less like you. 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.440
 should do on a base here I have 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.969
 more or less two cups of sweet 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.039
 milk the dulce de leche that I am 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.430
 putting here is the dulce de leche 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.560

 for you to make your cake 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.200
 only so if you can cook the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.140
 her condensed canned milk in the 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.780
 pressure cooker for 40 minutes 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.230
 open your pan 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.300
 after you finish cooking leave 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.550
 to cool naturally passes without 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.949
 Hurry to understand, does something like this? 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.319
 slowly slowly puts the kitchen 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.690
 there four cans let cook for 40 

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:51.600
 minutes cover well with water and leave 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.010
 cool you can take all cool 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.469
 premiere all the liquid you have inside 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.199
 can you take it out and what are you going to do? 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.780
 This is what I'm talking about here for you. 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.209
 to take advantage of your pressure cooker and 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.049
 Fire, if you want to spend yourself 

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:05.760
 gas 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.430
 I think it fits a little more 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.259
 depending on the pot with large pot 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.280
 but it does not exaggerate also because it does not leave 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.039
 to be dangerous 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.539
 just do not mess with it hot on hypothesis 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:16.829
 none other than that I know it 's a 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:18.659
 farm near you 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:21.060
 well let's go in our recipe so with 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.939
 my industrial sweetmeat bought me 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.640
 I have here the grated coconut 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.810
 This is what I'm going to put like, like me. 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.210
 I think there's too much that I'm not going to 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.670
 put the amount of those who have that I 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.619
 I'll make it here now with chantilly chile 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.450
 you will buy chile if the normal 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.100
 box and will hit also has no 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.960
 because I say that there is no measure 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.560
 why are you going to do it according to 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.479
 its like remembering that the cake can not 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.130
 be extremely sweet 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.140
 if you put that sweet that pure 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.700
 born on your goal will personal like a 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.950
 little piece will not want more 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.509
 so if it's for you to resell you have 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.770
 that make the customer come back then you 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.049
 always have to do 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.600
 as you experience that you do not 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.240
 be very sweet for this whipped cream 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.249
 will cut the candy in your dulce de leche 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.020
 right and then you put the 

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:11.340
 Chantilly 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.200
 according to the taste of her that you perceive 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.880
 which leaves him with more sugar coming 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.770
 others not less sugar depends on the brand 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.130
 that you 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:23.130
 take that your sweet is not so good 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.780
 signs in the pocket is nice when you 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.990
 put on the cake will that thing stay 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.050
 soft sweet will not get nauseous 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.170
 active understand the staff will want more 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.850
 There is no secret, that's all. 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.250
 stuffing is that it can a little more stay 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.350
 out of the refrigerator understood why 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.830
 usually what they use in the team 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.010
 because they use in markets is sweet from 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.070
 milk and whipped cream then understood a case 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.980
 here you can leave out the refrigerator 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.040
 the others who will ride natura will not 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.420
 can it be older cakes cakes yes 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.640
 Let's see this here has no continuum that 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.820
 we looked at condensed milk and 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.610
 Milk is one more goal that can not go 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.580
 to stay out of the refrigerator and are not 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.900
 fillings that can stay is is used without 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.700
 american plate 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.890
 those of fruit can not be that 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.690
 be all industrialized not if the cake 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.310
 will sour will implement from the inside 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:22.380
 when kaka has a beautiful american passport 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.360
 secretary will do it because I can 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.490
 also be doing the following here 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.190
 In this recipe you can put the 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.180
 milk besides whipped cream because the 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.190
 Chantilly 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.260
 depending on the brand you buy it 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.480
 is to continue sweet will decrease the 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.300
 amount of sugar but will continue 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.900
 sweet because with dulce de leche 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.030
 extremely sweet the chile already comes sweet from the 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.490
 like that you will put less sweet 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.410
 milk and will add a little more 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.930
 people read to cut the 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.240
 What you can do to help 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.270
 you see that his profitability is very 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.640
 good for you to sell is excellent only 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.500
 have the following if you mix 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.770
 milk in your in your 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.500
 How am I going to make the cream here? 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.390
 I made it here, I got the 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.140
 Sour cream open just right 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.180
 what happens if he is exposed here 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.520
 it will help because of the cream of 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.280
 right milk I have to do as 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:23.070
 I said it's filling for cake to stay 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.290
 in the sour cream refrigerator will help 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.730
 get the sugar too that will not stir 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.860
 in my texture of my stuffing 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.440
 I could put it in the fridge. 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.940
 stay steady and will not stick with candy 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.010
 so a cool tip only 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.060
 remembering that as I said can not 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.060
 stay out of the fridge
