00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.700
 local 9 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.100
 we are trying to recover the 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.500
 players wait until the last moment 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.000
 in these 24 hours they have had a good 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.270
 evolution 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.830
 and beyond that if they can play or not 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.080
 can do we already have delineated the 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.510
 team if you have to give everything to be able 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.370
 happen 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.260
 If I remember correctly, you have 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.120
 colo colo memory won the regular phase 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.670
 we are classified one cup 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.489
 South American team was the least 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.769
 defeated and the most goalscorer and in football 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.470
 have there are these missteps this goes up and 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.020
 The Spanish language that I know until the 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.710
 last two dates was not classified 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.990
 now we grab it by raising the other and 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.090
 to the process of the match in 1 to 0 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.670
 we could have increased at some point 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.850
 in 10 minutes they did not score two goals 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.590
 there we were media to the minute just 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.810
 starts the second stage is by nation 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.360
 another goal for a mistake and then 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.819
 an even match I already said that there was 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.170
 situations for both sides we 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:36.440
 we have all the confidence for the day 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.049
 may be able to reverse because they are 90 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.409
 minutes so the goals always 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.990
 count are two goals it is important 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.420
 difference and it is not for what it can 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.759
 give my player I have full confidence 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.700
 what in being able to reverse this situation 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:56.310
 and be able to reach the final because we have 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.490
 made many sacrifices 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.380
 We have the pressure from the first day 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.610
 we know that these are the last 90 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.369
 minutes we have to give everything for 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.110
 the whole thing for that I thank all the 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.209
 people of colo colo that will fill the 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.000
 stadium I appreciate all the support that 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.819
 we are having not only for the 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.900
 coach spit his coaching staff 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.970
 but for all the players because 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.890
 they value everything that was done in 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.500
 these six months of course 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.800
 we being in this institution do not 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.180
 we want to crown playing the final and 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.450
 from there to win championships 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.569
 we reach the semifinals and hope to be able to 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.299
 pass it we have the group very well not 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.530
 we are fallen in any way then 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.299
 what we need the public not to 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.239
 come encourage as I have done 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:45.450
 throughout this semester with all 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.860
 the inconveniences we had because to 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.420
 Sometimes there seems to be a bad memory 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.310
 for some things where we saw the 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.319
 advantages not being able to play with our 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.780
 local public in a lot of 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.310
 situations so today we have the 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.700
 campus beyond some lessons 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.720
 that we will try to replace them 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.850
 thank all the public for colo 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.540
 colo for all that trust and 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.760
 faith that deposit 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.950
 here because surely with the silt 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.599
 total and the push that we are going to have is 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.000
 advance of the energy is that we are going to 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.500
 have also to be able to dump it in the 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.900
 game and win the game we are going to 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.390
 leave until the last drop of sweat as 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.189
 to give this joy to us 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.019
 themselves and all the people I have 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:24.329
 planned for the preseason to 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.269
 start the 27 and always in water banking 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:31.379
 he talked talked to Juan Gutierrez is 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:33.719
 spoken with all this is normal I 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:36.930
 I trust in the work you do in 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:38.730
 that I surely did what grieves me that 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.909
 they are cataloging me for a little problem 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.560
 that I had extra football that 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.959
 course at the time more than one is going 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.569
 to have to be accountable to everything 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.790
 this kind of thing I assume the mistakes 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.500
 but one thing is that one has 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.150
 wrong and that I assumed something else that 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.659
 they are judging me so sporting 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.790
 that we in that aspect with the people 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:03.209
 I had to talk about the upper echelons of 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.609
 club handle me with sincerity drive me 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.530
 what is my position and why today 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:09.359
 we have already planned the preseason 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.530
 for the 27th of December we are going 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.330
 boot the web sleeve 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.650
 I had no doubt at any time 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.470
 first because I have a current contract 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:20.880
 and because second because of everything in everything 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.950
 moment the club has given me its support of 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.780
 soon if you want support from 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.580
 to go out and say something when I had 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.139
 the extra soccer problem 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.120
 Nor did it belongs as such 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.730
 they as an institution have omar 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.160
 labruna trainer and omar labruna if 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.680
 send a macana that manages not 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.330
 They told me that, but it seems to me 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.340
 more logical and so I did everything I 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.740
 had to do in that aspect when 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.330
 I went to testify and when I manifested and 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.740
 now I see that the subject was clarified and 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.000
 they have not given it that much either 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.800
 capable transcendence that at the moment 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.540
 that was all the impersonate installed 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.060
 It was more important to give the 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.130
 transcendence to omar labruna so I 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.540
 nothing taking it extra football what 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:03.180
 football here in the club we have 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.830
 all the objectives and everything the future 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.630
 very clear that tomorrow we are going to work 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.460
 because today's players 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.919
 they finished doing a regenerative 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.569
 we had but imagine a few talks and the 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:16.259
 tomorrow we call 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:18.330
 to work thinking about the game a 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:22.020
 little bit in the 20-30 minutes what am I going to 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:24.209
 do it practically to be able to employ and 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.099
 prepare the party to be able to break 

00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:27.990
 to the Spanish but we trust 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:30.779
 our power and offensive that already 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.209
 we show throughout the tournament and 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:35.520
 good to have the regularity and we know 

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:37.379
 that we have 90 minutes to reverse a 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.449
 situation so nothing with all the 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:42.990
 tranquility the campus is very well 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:44.819
 is with all the trust intact not 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.259
 only the last goal at the last moment 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:52.139
 because that hits but beyond that has 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:54.899
 fallen a confidence to be able to reverse the 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:56.990
 result for that we are if not no longer 

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:59.819
 it would deliver very we would play so 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.099
 I see the boys very well that this 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:03.719
 at the time affected and because 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:05.459
 nobody likes that they are talking about their 

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:07.580
 coach things that are said so many 

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:10.789
 others 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:13.550
 so nothing I tried to always leave 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:16.729
 on the margin all these things but sometimes 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:19.400
 It's not so easy, not because everyone 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:20.900
 it is reported everyone reads all the 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.430
 world does not know what's true of 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.219
 certain things and I can not be all 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.379
 the days go out to clarify all the issues 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:30.349
 I already took my time to clarify it 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:33.680
 and what I always told you in a 

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:36.680
 private talk to my players is what 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.360
 what I think how I handle imagine and 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.169
 try as long as they leave 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.389
 separating a bit from the things that 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:45.639
 our mentality is in this but that 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:48.729
 we have had some ups and downs in the 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:50.259
 football and this I do not say it is 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:53.349
 normal because I do not like that we 

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:56.349
 happen but in today's football about 

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:57.909
 about those errors or failures we try 

00:06:56.349 --> 00:07:02.999
 we will try not to happen again and 

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:02.999
 get the worst and the best things
