00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.620
 the number in 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.440
 a good man 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.919
 the typical of ct 

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:11.539
 of ap as results 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:14.959
 the number points 2 two digits 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.400
 2 the team potiguar time 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.400
 do not want this number and that number it 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:22.689
 it would be this 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.720
 2 2 2 pointless motive 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.929
 directed by seth 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.659
 yesterday 30 11 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:35.100
 whoever wins this with this property 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.530
 when is building union 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.560
 the study organism 52 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.670
 run by seven would give something amazing 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.000
 in this case it would have to have instance let's go then 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.200
 here we have it 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.100
 the number 2 with the seven not given in t2 group is with 22 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.890
 22 due to 7/3 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.890
 3 17 to 21 for 22 1 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.019
 the side and the rest 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:03.730
 so you have to continue 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.520
 then I'll have to have another 1 2 hectare 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.520
 quickly download it would have 12 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.070
 twelve lived by seven of the board 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.130
 there were 17 10 7 for 12 5 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.100
 the stepfather 50 years old was so I'm going to put 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.100
 more a sad 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.550
 given that this has been effective 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.870
 would have 52 due process and give certainty 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.510
 1 707 from apparent 9 to 52 3 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
 still did not give the answer was so have to have another 2 the team 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.570
 8 participants 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.490
 32 Â° C give 4 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.790
 4 and 7 from 28 to 32 4 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.630
 It still does not have to rain so it has to have another two 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.710
 behind the scenes 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.380
 48 seven out of six 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.070
 the service is 42 to 42 nothing clothes plus 0 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.960
 therefore in brilliant style 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.630
 it's an idol in me 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.110
 wrote then 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.110
 silva gordini would be a number 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.019
 37 and the thousand 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.019
 746 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:21.029
 if you take the number 31 thousand seven hundred and forty-six 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.179
 the rivals find 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:26.809
 as a result of this product 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:32.179
 the number of points of the 52nd Cairo if it had from 42 to 42 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:40.370
 2 to 4 of seven spaces at 28 28 and 4 at 32 to day care 7 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.500
 of these 59 excerpts from 2005 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.129
 if it had 1 to 5 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:51.779
 exited 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:53.539
 if I had 21 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:56.489
 and an ex-pm website would then give that end 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.799
 the beginning and until then 1746 the sum of the figures 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.889
 uses a 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:05.239
 duch 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.059
 by another way 

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:11.209
 freshmen location 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.319
 then it would be 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.609
 the sum of the numbers 31 1 746 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.499
 would give 3 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:21.489
 a recession 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.869
 no more tst 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:26.139
 about 4 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.359
 in the recipe I'm a mother 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.459
 if it was equal to 3 more sling 4 4 7 11 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.029
 11 4 15 out of 21 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.599
 the action of the figures 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:40.829
 of this number 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.889
 31 1746 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.999
 is recurring in a river 

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:49.379
 then at the time when 1746 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.879
 they assume 21 correct opinion you find 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.879
 in the alternative of the letter c of house 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:57.859
 he brings 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:58.879
 Leave home
