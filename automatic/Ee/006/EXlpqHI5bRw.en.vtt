hi<00:00:33.700> I'm<00:00:34.700> Annessa<00:00:35.949> 2013<00:00:36.949> this<00:00:37.820> project<00:00:38.270> is<00:00:38.420> hope

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
hi I'm Annessa 2013 this project is hope

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.100 
hi I'm Annessa 2013 this project is hope
to<00:00:39.559> move<00:00:39.949> airport<00:00:40.460> again<00:00:40.790> using<00:00:41.329> the<00:00:41.449> mind<00:00:41.660> I

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
to move airport again using the mind I

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.930 
to move airport again using the mind I
use<00:00:42.800> as<00:00:43.070> a<00:00:43.100> main<00:00:43.370> device<00:00:43.780> EEG<00:00:44.780> from<00:00:45.500> LG<00:00:45.940> this

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
use as a main device EEG from LG this

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.360 
use as a main device EEG from LG this
president<00:00:47.449> can<00:00:47.629> read<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:48.320> signals<00:00:48.739> in<00:00:49.190> the

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
president can read the signals in the

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.530 
president can read the signals in the
rain<00:00:49.579> and<00:00:50.030> then<00:00:50.390> transferred<00:00:50.839> digitally<00:00:51.800> and

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
rain and then transferred digitally and

00:00:52.540 --> 00:01:07.649 
rain and then transferred digitally and
control<00:00:53.540> this<00:00:53.750> body

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.800 

so<00:01:08.200> let's<00:01:08.380> try<00:01:08.969> this<00:01:09.969> first<00:01:10.270> phase<00:01:10.479> of<00:01:10.539> the

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
so let's try this first phase of the

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.359 
so let's try this first phase of the
project<00:01:12.329> as<00:01:13.329> I<00:01:13.570> move<00:01:13.750> my<00:01:13.899> hand<00:01:14.170> there<00:01:15.159> what

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
project as I move my hand there what

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.020 
project as I move my hand there what
they<00:01:15.490> can<00:01:15.729> shoot<00:01:16.259> copied<00:01:17.259> all<00:01:17.409> my<00:01:17.560> movements

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
they can shoot copied all my movements

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.389 
they can shoot copied all my movements
let's<00:01:19.030> see<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.539> first<00:01:19.750> finger<00:01:20.229> second<00:01:21.189> finger

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
let's see the first finger second finger

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.340 
let's see the first finger second finger
third<00:01:21.820> finger<00:01:22.590> fourth<00:01:23.590> finger<00:01:23.950> this<00:01:24.670> finger

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
third finger fourth finger this finger

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:49.730 
third finger fourth finger this finger
right<00:01:26.350> all<00:01:27.189> close<00:01:27.549> open

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:02:07.169 

perfect

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.600 

after<00:02:08.179> presenting<00:02:08.509> of<00:02:08.959> the<00:02:09.080> EEG<00:02:09.410> now<00:02:10.310> it's

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
after presenting of the EEG now it's

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.630 
after presenting of the EEG now it's
time<00:02:10.789> to<00:02:11.030> try<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.410> software<00:02:12.410> that<00:02:13.250> I<00:02:13.280> did<00:02:13.519> in

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
time to try the software that I did in

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.240 
time to try the software that I did in
this<00:02:13.790> project<00:02:14.300> so<00:02:15.110> this<00:02:15.319> software<00:02:15.709> is<00:02:15.980> about

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
this project so this software is about

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.640 
this project so this software is about
to<00:02:16.489> collect<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:16.940> information<00:02:17.110> from<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.290> EEG

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
to collect the information from the EEG

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.220 
to collect the information from the EEG
process<00:02:19.640> it<00:02:19.879> and<00:02:20.030> then<00:02:20.090> send<00:02:20.750> it<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:20.989> robot

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
process it and then send it to the robot

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.509 
process it and then send it to the robot
the<00:02:21.470> Kenyan<00:02:23.140> now<00:02:24.140> that's<00:02:24.379> a<00:02:24.500> big<00:02:24.709> click<00:02:25.010> here

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
the Kenyan now that's a big click here

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.940 
the Kenyan now that's a big click here
in<00:02:25.640> activate<00:02:26.120> button<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:26.660> then<00:02:27.260> power<00:02:27.680> up

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
in activate button and then power up

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.190 
in activate button and then power up
there<00:02:28.310> what<00:02:28.519> they<00:02:28.640> can<00:02:28.849> now<00:02:29.540> I<00:02:29.810> would<00:02:30.170> think

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
there what they can now I would think

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:39.759 
there what they can now I would think
that<00:02:30.440> would<00:02:30.650> open<00:02:30.830> my<00:02:31.129> hand

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:54.619 

and<00:02:40.769> then<00:02:40.920> close<00:02:41.069> again<00:02:47.930> open<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:48.989> hand<00:02:53.629> and

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
and then close again open the hand and

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:26.770 
and then close again open the hand and
close<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:59.760> then<00:02:59.879> open

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.840
