00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.900
 two years 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.400
 and well just how about friends of 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.260
 youtube good here I bring you a new 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.810
 video and well then I bring you this one 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.970
 chapter more than one series that no longer 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.670
 I had climbed from minecraft that is about 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.439
 random tutorials or this glitches not 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.140
 be good here we are with the lord 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.450
 slime and this clips today is about how 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.770
 make it fly or is limiting what 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.840
 Gravel is coming and sand is not 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.489
 let's give the lever here and 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.430
 we have in front of our liked 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.850
 sx 458 and then let's let it 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.850
 present 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.289
 hi how are you I hope you are very 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.109
 well and that they subscribe then many 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.750
 thank you give them I want to tell you or 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.460
 report that giving them was the one that told me 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.280
 this is this trick and I wanted to invite him 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.190
 so that it came out in the video and that we 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.079
 will help him and I'll explain how to do it 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.000
 and well, the first thing we have to do 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.770
 to do is to notice where the south is east 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.979
 the west and all that not the points 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.270
 cardinal because we need to find 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.179
 what is being east and west 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.270
 to be able to place the rails that you see 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:21.479
 that if we put them in one direction 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:25.470
 seeing an object this affects 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.360
 our our box or our cube does not 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.459
 this for example if we put it looking at 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.890
 our earth cube will be seeing in 

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:33.119
 the vertical and if we put it looking towards 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.520
 the other side of the earth cube is 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.470
 looking horizontal ok that's very 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.470
 important and they need to check 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.520
 and well, seeing what is coming 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.280
 being the side 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.439
 next to this what we are going to do is 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.640
 let's put a piston here opposite 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:57.560
 of our from our of our rail 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.189
 down this other rail we will place you 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.110
 another one here and we'll cover this later 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.500
 This will bring out what has been 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.390
 subtract from here to be able to do right now 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.150
 two holes here opposite here to the 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.790
 side to one side of our piston leaving 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.349
 a space of a cube and then what 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.500
 we have to do is fill in these two 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.480
 cubes with torches of rest from the side 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.920
 left we will put a repeater and the 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.220
 right side we will put what comes 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.860
 being rest ok 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.480
 after the right side of the two 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.989
 holes 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.489
 in the bucket in the bucket exactly so 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.019
 we are not going to leave any cubes in the cube 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.909
 right let's put what comes 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.069
 being a piston and facing the piston 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:41.080
 we put any cube that already this 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.840
 that activates our our piston 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.849
 adhesive that we put on the rails 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.879
 then we will place a lever in the 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:52.090
 floor or you can put it in a bucket and a 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:55.810
 lever does not matter this later we're going to 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.450
 give him a levers and this will make 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.720
 what is coming our way 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:05.049
 piston and the sticky part disappears 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.450
 of the same and then we will place it 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:10.270
 that is being a dispenser 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.810
 that goes back to work again and 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.730
 that from this an invisible cube no longer 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.709
 have this invisible cube been generated what 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.120
 that we have to do well then we are going to 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.120
 let him help 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.310
 we are going to place two cubes and we are going to 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.510
 place the sand cubes on top of 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:32.450
 our piston and from the second bucket 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.970
 of sand this we will go placing sand 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.560
 until it until it until it 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.360
 fit more 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:44.270
 this this was that it looks and in any 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.849
 this moment will be floating our 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.200
 sand bucket and so we do it from 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.140
 two cubes to score 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:55.459
 this does not stay floating now this 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.530
 we can remove let's say the base 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.709
 of the sand cubes and then I would be 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.330
 floating not but yes we removed this already 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.660
 it would be floating what has been the 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.489
 ok sand cubes to unlock this 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.220
 or to remove our glitch the only thing 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:13.190
 we have to do is this because 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.380
 break this cube and we break the cube of 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.680
 down this will cause all the 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.989
 cubes of sand and be drawn what 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.150
 comes being the same cube so that 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.270
 stop being floating if you want 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.340
 do with a gravel bucket 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.220
 they have to be the same and they already know 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.110
 this is bursting the engraving cubes 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.320
 until you search 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.000
 and I show them so they can see how it looks 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.730
 we remove this here in all the cubes of 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.100
 gravel I say sand and it falls what 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.020
 is what we have floating not 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.420
 this if we want to put it back to 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.980
 restore without doing all this again 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.610
 crime the only thing we have to do is 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:55.150
 put the earth cube down from where 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.460
 there were the sand cubes and then it's 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.960
 to do the same again and if 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.660
 we want to do what has been with 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.850
 with gravel then and we're going 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.080
 putting no and well then I think this 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.900
 I would be everything I hope you liked it 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.610
 it's a little bit long explanation and 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.140
 Well thanks to our harness friend 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.800
 for not having helped us and 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.000
 accompanied and tell us this great linen 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.680
 well, as I repeat, I hope you have 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.060
 liked if you like it like 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.790
 subscribe for more videos and we 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.790
 goodbye with giving them x 458 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.910
 bye
