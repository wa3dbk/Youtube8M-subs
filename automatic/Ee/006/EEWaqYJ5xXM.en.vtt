00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.430 

you<00:02:28.880> can<00:02:29.030> also<00:02:29.180> use<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.690> program<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.170> select

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
you can also use the program to select

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.550 
you can also use the program to select
different<00:02:33.440> programs<00:02:33.890> and<00:02:34.220> I'll<00:02:34.370> say<00:02:34.670> a<00:02:35.290> B<00:02:36.290> C<00:02:36.530> or

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
different programs and I'll say a B C or

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:44.740 
different programs and I'll say a B C or
D<00:02:36.710> a<00:02:37.540> will<00:02:41.710> also<00:02:42.710> be<00:02:42.920> able<00:02:43.070> to<00:02:43.280> have<00:02:43.670> four<00:02:44.390> start

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
D a will also be able to have four start

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.330 
D a will also be able to have four start
times<00:02:45.080> oh<00:02:45.910> five<00:02:46.910> six<00:02:47.710> so<00:02:48.710> you<00:02:48.770> can<00:02:48.890> set<00:02:49.070> up<00:02:49.160> to

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
times oh five six so you can set up to

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.370 
times oh five six so you can set up to
six<00:02:49.550> start<00:02:49.820> times<00:02:50.060> on<00:02:50.360> this<00:02:50.660> controller<00:02:51.110> and

six start times on this controller and

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.400 
six start times on this controller and
then<00:02:52.250> we'll<00:02:52.760> turn<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.090> dial<00:02:53.300> to<00:02:53.540> set<00:02:53.900> station

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
then we'll turn the dial to set station

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.240 
then we'll turn the dial to set station
run<00:02:54.890> times<00:02:57.610> now<00:02:58.610> currently<00:02:59.060> for<00:02:59.300> rotor<00:02:59.510> zones

it<00:06:23.720> will<00:06:23.900> save<00:06:24.370> my<00:06:25.370> program<00:06:27.490> which<00:06:28.490> is<00:06:28.640> really

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820 
it will save my program which is really

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.660 
it will save my program which is really
important<00:06:29.480> to<00:06:29.660> do<00:06:29.830> in<00:06:30.830> case<00:06:31.100> you<00:06:31.220> get<00:06:31.340> a<00:06:31.400> lot<00:06:31.580> of

power outages and then if you ever want

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.180 
power outages and then if you ever want
to<00:06:36.760> like<00:06:37.760> here<00:06:38.090> let<00:06:38.240> me<00:06:38.560> change<00:06:39.560> something<00:06:39.920> in

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 
to like here let me change something in

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.020 
to like here let me change something in
there<00:06:40.400> but<00:06:41.330> if<00:06:41.420> you<00:06:41.540> ever<00:06:41.690> want<00:06:42.020> to<00:06:42.880> reset<00:06:43.880> it

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.340 
there but if you ever want to reset it
you<00:06:44.060> just<00:06:44.390> go<00:06:44.600> to<00:06:44.830> advanced<00:06:45.830> cycles<00:06:47.350> holding

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:48.350 
you just go to advanced cycles holding

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:55.170 
you just go to advanced cycles holding
both<00:06:48.560> arrow<00:06:48.830> keys<00:06:49.130> and<00:06:49.460> it<00:06:49.790> will<00:06:49.940> restore<00:06:50.390> and
