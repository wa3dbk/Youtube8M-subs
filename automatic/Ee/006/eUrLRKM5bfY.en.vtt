on the smallest t she could possibly

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.219

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
and I managed to glue it on now the rear

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.399 
and I managed to glue it on now the rear
bumper<00:01:53.149> as<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.360> can<00:01:54.479> see<00:01:54.630> what<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> mess<00:01:55.170> that

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
bumper as you can see what a mess that

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.319 
bumper as you can see what a mess that
is<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:57.630> rear<00:01:57.810> bumper<00:01:58.020> doesn't<00:01:58.560> really<00:01:58.710> fit

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
is the rear bumper doesn't really fit

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.630 
is the rear bumper doesn't really fit
100%<00:02:00.329> I'm<00:02:00.960> hoping<00:02:01.799> with<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.009> bit<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.219> primer<00:02:02.430> it

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
100% I'm hoping with a bit of primer it

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.319 
100% I'm hoping with a bit of primer it
won't<00:02:02.850> look<00:02:02.939> too<00:02:03.000> bad<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.990> gap<00:02:04.939> looked<00:02:05.939> crazy

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
won't look too bad the gap looked crazy

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.180

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
you know it's where I should have done

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.500 
you know it's where I should have done
it<00:02:11.430> slightly<00:02:11.670> differently<00:02:12.120> but<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.360> know

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
it slightly differently but you know

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.480 
it slightly differently but you know
lesson<00:02:12.720> learned

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
lesson learned

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.590 
lesson learned
as<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.610> can<00:02:14.730> see<00:02:14.880> one<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.150> wheels<00:02:15.330> is

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
as you can see one of the wheels is

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.150 
as you can see one of the wheels is
attached<00:02:16.050> move<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:16.920> box<00:02:17.190> out<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.520> way

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.260 

there<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.220> go<00:02:23.310> that's<00:02:23.520> how<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.940> sits<00:02:26.090> you<00:02:27.090> know

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
there you go that's how it sits you know

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.090 
there you go that's how it sits you know
out<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.810> box<00:02:28.020> because<00:02:28.440> it's<00:02:28.710> got<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.920> spring

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
out the box because it's got the spring

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.460 
out the box because it's got the spring
suspension<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.910> can<00:02:30.060> make<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.960> car<00:02:31.140> local<00:02:31.380> to

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
suspension you can make the car local to

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.980 
suspension you can make the car local to
sit<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.710> little<00:02:31.860> bit<00:02:31.980> lower<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.900> there<00:02:33.900> you

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
sit a little bit lower and there you

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.530 
sit a little bit lower and there you
have<00:02:34.020> it<00:02:34.550> I'm<00:02:35.550> going<00:02:35.790> for<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.000> sort<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.210> track

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
have it I'm going for the sort of track

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.830 
have it I'm going for the sort of track
look<00:02:36.810> on<00:02:36.960> this<00:02:39.230> now<00:02:40.230> here's<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.680> chassis<00:02:41.840> make

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
look on this now here's the chassis make

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.290 
look on this now here's the chassis make
a<00:02:42.870> blue<00:02:43.110> tacked<00:02:43.410> together<00:02:44.090> gold<00:02:45.090> bits

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
a blue tacked together gold bits

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.460 
a blue tacked together gold bits
completely<00:02:45.840> weathered<00:02:47.960> you'll<00:02:48.960> notice<00:02:49.230> here

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
completely weathered you'll notice here

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.680 
completely weathered you'll notice here
is<00:02:49.560> where<00:02:49.740> the<00:02:49.860> rear<00:02:50.190> diffuser<00:02:50.580> was<00:02:50.850> I<00:02:51.120> would

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
is where the rear diffuser was I would

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.990 
is where the rear diffuser was I would
recommend<00:02:52.290> building<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.220> chassis<00:02:53.580> but<00:02:53.760> not

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
recommend building the chassis but not

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.090 
recommend building the chassis but not
putting<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.690> rear<00:02:54.870> diffuser<00:02:55.260> on<00:02:55.440> until

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
putting the rear diffuser on until

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.370 
putting the rear diffuser on until
you've<00:02:56.220> completed<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.790> model<00:02:57.290> because<00:02:58.290> it

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
you've completed the model because it

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.440 
you've completed the model because it
makes<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.680> so<00:02:58.920> much<00:02:59.100> more<00:02:59.160> harder<00:02:59.820> to<00:02:59.970> fit<00:03:00.180> in

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
makes it so much more harder to fit in

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.700 
makes it so much more harder to fit in
the<00:03:00.600> body<00:03:00.780> shell<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:03.810> there's<00:03:04.050> just<00:03:04.560> the

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
the body shell and there's just the

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:10.670 
the body shell and there's just the
chassis<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:06.510> that's<00:03:06.660> what<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:06.960> is<00:03:07.880> fitted<00:03:09.680> it

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
chassis and that's what it is fitted it

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.490 
chassis and that's what it is fitted it
looks<00:03:10.860> super<00:03:11.010> low<00:03:11.280> really<00:03:11.580> cool<00:03:11.850> as<00:03:12.000> well<00:03:12.030> I

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
looks super low really cool as well I

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.110 
looks super low really cool as well I
would<00:03:13.500> recommend<00:03:13.740> slightly<00:03:14.520> sanding<00:03:15.000> the

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
would recommend slightly sanding the

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.320 
would recommend slightly sanding the
inside<00:03:15.420> of<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.600> arches<00:03:15.960> as<00:03:16.110> well<00:03:16.940> as<00:03:17.940> far<00:03:18.209> as

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
inside of the arches as well as far as

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.979 
inside of the arches as well as far as
the<00:03:18.420> kick<00:03:18.630> goes<00:03:18.660> together<00:03:19.020> it's<00:03:20.690> I'd<00:03:21.690> say

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
the kick goes together it's I'd say

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.790 
the kick goes together it's I'd say
completely<00:03:22.650> faultless<00:03:23.580> really<00:03:24.680> apart<00:03:25.680> from

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
completely faultless really apart from

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.820 
completely faultless really apart from
the<00:03:26.250> body<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.850> body<00:03:27.000> doesn<00:03:27.480> t<00:03:27.510> work<00:03:27.810> in<00:03:28.110> the

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
the body the body doesn t work in the

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.400 
the body the body doesn t work in the

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.490 
learned really now again I highly
recommend<00:03:54.209> the<00:03:54.300> kit<00:03:54.510> it's<00:03:55.050> just<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.350> body

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
recommend the kit it's just the body

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.509 
recommend the kit it's just the body
that<00:03:55.650> needs<00:03:55.800> a<00:03:55.860> little<00:03:56.040> bit<00:03:56.160> of<00:03:56.220> work<00:03:56.310> and

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
that needs a little bit of work and

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.190 
that needs a little bit of work and
don't<00:03:56.670> forget<00:03:57.000> just<00:03:57.630> to<00:03:57.750> make<00:03:57.870> your<00:03:57.930> life<00:03:57.989> a

don't forget just to make your life a

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.160 
don't forget just to make your life a
little<00:03:58.320> bit<00:03:58.440> easier<00:03:58.590> by<00:03:59.070> putting<00:03:59.660> the<00:04:00.660> rear

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
little bit easier by putting the rear

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.009 
little bit easier by putting the rear
diffuser<00:04:01.620> on<00:04:01.800> last<00:04:02.700> of<00:04:02.910> all<00:04:03.030> actually<00:04:03.780> last

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
diffuser on last of all actually last

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.720 
diffuser on last of all actually last
August<00:04:04.350> just<00:04:04.470> makes<00:04:04.680> it<00:04:04.769> so<00:04:04.980> much<00:04:05.100> harder<00:04:05.160> to

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
August just makes it so much harder to

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.070 
August just makes it so much harder to
put<00:04:05.880> the<00:04:05.940> chassis<00:04:06.269> in<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.450> body<00:04:07.790> but<00:04:08.790> ya<00:04:09.080> can't

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
put the chassis in the body but ya can't

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.600 
put the chassis in the body but ya can't
fault<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.410> kit<00:04:10.590> apart<00:04:10.860> from<00:04:10.980> that<00:04:11.160> the

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
fault the kit apart from that the

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.530 
fault the kit apart from that the
interior<00:04:12.060> just<00:04:12.090> goes<00:04:12.360> together<00:04:12.510> very<00:04:12.720> nicely

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
interior just goes together very nicely

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.440 
interior just goes together very nicely
and<00:04:15.540> that<00:04:15.900> is<00:04:16.230> all<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.739> tell<00:04:16.950> you<00:04:17.100> really<00:04:17.450> so
