foods unlimited I'm good meant to them
and<00:00:31.250> yeah<00:00:32.250> he's<00:00:32.489> got<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:32.969> really<00:00:33.600> nice

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
and yeah he's got this really nice

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.350 
and yeah he's got this really nice
aluminium<00:00:35.399> framed<00:00:36.290> enclosure<00:00:37.290> like<00:00:37.680> black

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
aluminium framed enclosure like black

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.310 
aluminium framed enclosure like black
aluminium<00:00:39.890> black<00:00:40.890> coated<00:00:41.219> aluminium<00:00:41.309> and

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
aluminium black coated aluminium and

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.889 
aluminium black coated aluminium and
yeah<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.710> frame<00:00:44.370> will<00:00:44.579> be<00:00:44.750> this<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.809> what

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
yeah so the frame will be this is what

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.840 
yeah so the frame will be this is what
I'm<00:00:46.079> thinking<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.710> frame<00:00:46.920> will<00:00:47.070> be<00:00:47.100> aluminium

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
I'm thinking the frame will be aluminium

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.069 
I'm thinking the frame will be aluminium
and<00:00:48.120> then<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.050> will<00:00:49.140> be<00:00:49.289> glass<00:00:49.920> inserts<00:00:51.079> so

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
and then it will be glass inserts so

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.490 
and then it will be glass inserts so
kind<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.340> but<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.780> yeah<00:00:54.780> yeah<00:00:55.440> you

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
kind of like this but the yeah yeah you

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.720 
kind of like this but the yeah yeah you
get<00:00:55.739> what<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:55.890> mean<00:00:56.449> and<00:00:57.449> then<00:00:57.980> it'll<00:00:58.980> be<00:00:59.129> three

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
get what I mean and then it'll be three

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.970 
get what I mean and then it'll be three
foot<00:00:59.969> long<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.539> it's<00:01:00.750> like<00:01:00.899> perfect<00:01:01.500> length<00:01:01.680> so

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
foot long so it's like perfect length so

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.690 
foot long so it's like perfect length so
from<00:01:02.219> here<00:01:02.809> to<00:01:03.949> just<00:01:04.949> before<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.430> light

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
from here to just before this light

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.630 
from here to just before this light
switch<00:01:06.030> here<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.510> like<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.770> over<00:01:08.130> three<00:01:08.369> foot

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
switch here is like just over three foot

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.940 
switch here is like just over three foot
so<00:01:08.760> it's<00:01:08.909> perfect

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
so it's perfect

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.580 
so it's perfect
and<00:01:11.220> then<00:01:11.580> we'll<00:01:12.060> have<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.540> probably<00:01:13.140> two<00:01:13.380> foot

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
and then we'll have it probably two foot

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.969 
and then we'll have it probably two foot
high<00:01:14.900> I'm<00:01:15.900> not<00:01:16.080> too<00:01:16.200> sure<00:01:16.350> on<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> height<00:01:16.740> yet

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
high I'm not too sure on the height yet

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.590 
high I'm not too sure on the height yet
because<00:01:17.549> what<00:01:18.180> we're<00:01:18.330> gonna<00:01:18.420> do<00:01:18.720> is

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
because what we're gonna do is

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.969 
because what we're gonna do is
underneath<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.810> enclosure<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.530> going<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.799> be

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
underneath the enclosure is going to be

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.910 
underneath the enclosure is going to be
an<00:01:23.310> open<00:01:24.270> covered<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.840> kinda<00:01:25.380> just<00:01:25.530> like<00:01:25.680> that

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
an open covered so kinda just like that

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.100 
an open covered so kinda just like that
just<00:01:26.340> there<00:01:26.549> there<00:01:27.119> just<00:01:27.270> be<00:01:27.360> an<00:01:27.450> open<00:01:27.810> space

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
just there there just be an open space

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.469 
just there there just be an open space
and<00:01:28.680> what<00:01:28.799> we're<00:01:28.950> gonna<00:01:29.040> do<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.790> put<00:01:30.240> this

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
and what we're gonna do is put this

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.859 
and what we're gonna do is put this
enclosure<00:01:30.990> like<00:01:31.579> in<00:01:32.579> there<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.390> like<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
enclosure like in there and in like the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.690 
enclosure like in there and in like the
open<00:01:34.740> space<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:36.350> then<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.619> enclosure<00:01:38.220> I'm

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
open space so then in that enclosure I'm

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.469 
open space so then in that enclosure I'm
thinking<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.360> getting<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.229> snake<00:01:41.090> so<00:01:42.090> obvious

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
thinking of getting a snake so obvious

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.179 
thinking of getting a snake so obvious
obviously<00:01:43.320> it's<00:01:43.560> going<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.799> be<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> small<00:01:44.220> snake

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
obviously it's going to be a small snake

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.370 
obviously it's going to be a small snake
so<00:01:47.189> I'm<00:01:47.549> gonna<00:01:47.700> probably<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.200> what<00:01:49.290> I'm

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
so I'm gonna probably this is what I'm

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.510 
so I'm gonna probably this is what I'm
looking<00:01:49.470> at<00:01:49.680> I'm<00:01:49.770> looking<00:01:49.890> at<00:01:50.159> getting<00:01:50.340> an

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
looking at I'm looking at getting an

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.999 
looking at I'm looking at getting an
anthill<00:01:50.850> python<00:01:51.570> which<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.259> small<00:01:52.590> snake<00:01:52.860> in

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
anthill python which is a small snake in

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.100 
anthill python which is a small snake in
the<00:01:53.070> world<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.820> known<00:01:54.119> as<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.299> pygmy

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
the world like it's known as a pygmy

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.780 
the world like it's known as a pygmy
python<00:01:56.540> and<00:01:57.829> they're<00:01:58.829> actually<00:01:59.009> in<00:01:59.310> season

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
python and they're actually in season

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.709 
python and they're actually in season
now<00:02:00.649> but<00:02:01.759> obviously<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.850> don't<00:02:03.119> have<00:02:03.329> anything

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719

now but obviously I don't have anything
ready<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.740> think<00:02:05.219> I'm<00:02:05.579> gonna<00:02:05.729> get<00:02:05.939> one<00:02:06.000> next

my uh my parents to come

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:18.870 
my uh my parents to come
because<00:02:13.209> they're<00:02:13.620> not<00:02:14.620> really<00:02:17.550> okay<00:02:18.550> with<00:02:18.580> it

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
because they're not really okay with it
