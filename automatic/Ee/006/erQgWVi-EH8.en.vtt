00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
and let it sit uncover it for like three

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.140 
and let it sit uncover it for like three
days<00:02:42.170> in<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.620> fridge<00:02:42.860> that<00:02:43.340> way<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:43.940> salt

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
days in the fridge that way the salt

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.900 
days in the fridge that way the salt
will<00:02:44.300> penetrate<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:45.020> meat<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:45.790> it'll<00:02:46.790> just

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
will penetrate the meat and it'll just

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.820 
will penetrate the meat and it'll just
taste<00:02:47.120> like<00:02:47.209> super<00:02:47.630> concentrated<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.470> beefy
