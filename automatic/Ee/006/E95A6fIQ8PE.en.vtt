00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.540 

one<00:00:01.020> of<00:00:01.110> the<00:00:01.199> biggest<00:00:01.560> problems<00:00:01.979> out<00:00:02.159> here<00:00:02.399> is

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
one of the biggest problems out here is

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.210 
one of the biggest problems out here is
is<00:00:02.790> that<00:00:02.820> too<00:00:03.570> many<00:00:03.720> people<00:00:03.870> get<00:00:04.290> locked<00:00:04.589> in<00:00:04.920> to

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
is that too many people get locked in to

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.369 
is that too many people get locked in to
one<00:00:05.460> theory<00:00:05.940> and<00:00:06.359> don't<00:00:06.629> keep<00:00:06.810> an<00:00:06.990> open<00:00:07.200> mind

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
one theory and don't keep an open mind

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.330 
one theory and don't keep an open mind
and<00:00:08.220> if<00:00:09.090> it<00:00:09.929> doesn't<00:00:10.380> work<00:00:10.559> with<00:00:10.769> their<00:00:10.950> theory

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
and if it doesn't work with their theory

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.390 
and if it doesn't work with their theory
they're<00:00:12.330> not<00:00:12.780> taking<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.559> information<00:00:14.190> in

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
they're not taking the information in

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.580 
they're not taking the information in
and<00:00:14.670> therefore<00:00:15.630> they're<00:00:15.990> not<00:00:16.109> only<00:00:16.289> doing

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
and therefore they're not only doing

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.260 
and therefore they're not only doing
themselves<00:00:16.770> in<00:00:17.279> they're<00:00:17.760> gonna<00:00:17.850> find<00:00:18.150> out

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
themselves in they're gonna find out

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.500 
themselves in they're gonna find out
later<00:00:18.359> down<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.660> road<00:00:20.029> but<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.270> others

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
later down the road but the others

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.870 
later down the road but the others
around<00:00:21.810> them<00:00:22.220> have<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.369> keep<00:00:23.519> an<00:00:23.609> open<00:00:23.699> mind

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
around them have to keep an open mind

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.650 
around them have to keep an open mind
out<00:00:24.240> here<00:00:24.710> with<00:00:25.710> all<00:00:25.740> these<00:00:26.130> die<00:00:26.400> offs<00:00:26.660> it's

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
out here with all these die offs it's

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.839 
out here with all these die offs it's
unprecedented<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.769> I'm<00:00:29.189> telling<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.550> I've

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
unprecedented and I'm telling you I've

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.970 
unprecedented and I'm telling you I've
done<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.420> many<00:00:30.570> videos<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.230> time<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.830> time

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
done so many videos in time and time

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.790 
done so many videos in time and time
again<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.520> come<00:00:32.759> back<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.180> west<00:00:33.390> coast<00:00:34.700> why

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
again I come back to the west coast why

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.799 
again I come back to the west coast why

Fukushima<00:01:14.580> had<00:01:14.970> radiation<00:01:15.659> there's

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
Fukushima had radiation there's

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.499 
Fukushima had radiation there's
mutations<00:01:16.950> but<00:01:17.700> they've<00:01:17.880> specifically

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
mutations but they've specifically

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.820 
mutations but they've specifically
tested<00:01:18.840> these<00:01:18.990> animals<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.590> there's<00:01:19.710> no

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
tested these animals and there's no

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.700 
tested these animals and there's no
caesium<00:01:20.310> no<00:01:20.520> radiation<00:01:20.970> it's<00:01:21.509> not<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.930> when

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
caesium no radiation it's not that when

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.120 
caesium no radiation it's not that when
it<00:01:22.799> comes<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.280> specific<00:01:24.030> die-off<00:01:25.130> when

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
it comes to this specific die-off when

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.160 
it comes to this specific die-off when
we<00:01:26.250> know<00:01:26.450> Fukushima<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.509> taking<00:01:27.780> out<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.900> lot<00:01:28.020> of

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
we know Fukushima is taking out a lot of

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.950 
we know Fukushima is taking out a lot of
animals<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.740> killing<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.070> lot<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.220> things<00:01:31.400> but

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
animals and killing a lot of things but

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.539 
animals and killing a lot of things but
when<00:01:33.960> they're<00:01:34.110> not<00:01:34.140> finding<00:01:34.590> any<00:01:34.740> caesium<00:01:35.280> any

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
when they're not finding any caesium any

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.520 
when they're not finding any caesium any
radiation<00:01:35.939> whatsoever<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.960> something<00:01:37.350> else

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
radiation whatsoever and something else

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.810 
radiation whatsoever and something else
so<00:01:37.740> we<00:01:37.860> got<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.070> start<00:01:38.250> looking<00:01:38.369> at<00:01:38.579> something

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
so we got to start looking at something

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.319 
so we got to start looking at something
else<00:01:39.119> here<00:01:41.540> disease<00:01:42.540> they're<00:01:42.840> saying<00:01:43.110> or<00:01:44.329> just

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
else here disease they're saying or just

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.060 
else here disease they're saying or just
what<00:01:46.079> could<00:01:46.229> be<00:01:46.290> totally<00:01:46.979> healthy<00:01:47.310> animals

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
what could be totally healthy animals

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.450 
what could be totally healthy animals
would<00:01:50.070> seem<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.490> be<00:01:50.640> washing<00:01:51.299> up<00:01:51.420> on<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.600> beach

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
would seem to be washing up on the beach

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.980 
would seem to be washing up on the beach
with<00:01:53.460> no<00:01:53.670> explanation<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.479> just<00:01:54.720> dropping
