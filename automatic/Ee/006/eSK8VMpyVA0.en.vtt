00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 Hello everyone in this video I will tell 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.049
 how I managed to repair 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.269
 broken ceramic knife broke at 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.429
 several times he tried hard to kill 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.679
 in the kitchen but you still got it 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.920
 recover the first time he 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.970
 broke it him just broke off the spout 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.420
 there were 10 different forms of cheekbones and just 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.570
 polished a little on a stone on the machine I 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.490
 he could recover later 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.180
 broke off here even more here I am a little bit 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.510
 already leveled but I will still bring 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:39.989
 also during this time dropped out twice 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.930
 pen it is made in such a way that 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.200
 fixed on the glue like this 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.829
 somewhere around here she is 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.140
 comes to 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.930
 such a small corner is fixed 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.750
 glue the first time I just clarified on 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.579
 some kind of superglue here already 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.379
 a small chip on top that is, she is 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.510
 so about breaking down 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.140
 I restored just like that closed up 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.420
 the second time the handle broke here 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.210
 here got some damage on 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.210
 centimeter here and somewhere millimeter 4 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.020
 probably the reason for this vertically 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.890
 It turned out this part was broken out 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.890
 restored 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.490
 using two-component epoxy 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.490
 epoxy adhesive 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:34.320
 the easiest who found the sale 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:37.920
 and also i used shred plastic here 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.220
 I took the usual marker of this type 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.820
 there is plastic so fragile rubbed 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.040
 on a fine grater mixed pack mesh 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.899
 well, I have a little more of it 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.130
 but you need a frozen so here it is 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:56.689
 looked in working let's say so video i 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:00.649
 it was dissolved to degrease the inner 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:04.729
 part filled with epoxy glue 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:08.670
 fixed the handle here at the edges 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.600
 taped paint masking tape 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.310
 scotch tape 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.110
 Unfortunately the process did not take off I thought that 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.600
 nothing comes out well in principle 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.370
 it turned out but somehow it was already 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.720
 it's too late to shoot something 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.460
 such a video after repair means something 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.960
 there are around the edges I shaped here like 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:30.960
 here so that this here 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:34.050
 mass did not spread tightly shut up 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.300
 and in the process heated by a hair dryer and in the process 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.700
 how it dried up I still have a little finger 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.280
 its seal after and this 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.590
 the material dried up it probably passed 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.640
 hours 12 maybe more I neatly 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.770
 sandpaper file 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.570
 polished as you can see here if 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:58.050
 look closer at the color of the texture 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:05.880
 absolutely no different from material 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:08.550
 the handle itself well, that's only seen 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.570
 here here is a scuff before this scuff 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.850
 just shot 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.970
 soft touch coating i mean i can 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.710
 take it off with a fingernail 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.210
 It looks like pure plastic which foundation 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.210
 soft touch coated grip 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.330
 here actually so managed 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.980
 restore the knife which now 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.239
 enjoy the way in the kitchen to you all 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.110
 so liked 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.599
 well, he got the most 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.459
 because basically people who don't 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.140
 used a ceramic knife must 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.680
 understand that he is fragile is fragile 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.780
 material 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.239
 it cannot be used like this for a break 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.370
 and you can not every row of ice can not 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.010
 bones cut because the edge will 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.980
 to paint out and here it is also by the way already 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.629
 a little painted can be seen 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.310
 Well, it does not need to macro mode 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.260
 switch well how can you believe 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.359
 called but even with a micro such 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.140
 he painted very well 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:05.859
 cutting vegetables fruits meat 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:08.459
 that's the same way I think that's still to be equated 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.459
 this chip 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.820
 I'll take a little more on camera 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.820
 I will not present 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.110
 will be 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.110
 Here is a 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.180
 tip 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.909
 one more thing important i 'm betting 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:35.909
 used a turbo lighter 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:38.759
 the usual is not visible by itself 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:40.050
 the easiest to be a pity of course for 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:42.120
 to burn 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.669
 This is the material that I formed and 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.639
 plastic mixture of hellish epoxy and 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:51.060
 get the same structure as myself 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:54.330
 handle that is here if you look at it 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:57.539
 Now the key acres of plastic was not 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:01.830
 that's starting from here that's how many here 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:06.110
 3-4 millimeters never and then this one 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:08.069
 this is the limit where this centimeter 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.349
 approximately that is, there is such a wall 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:13.860
 absent after i 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:16.349
 formed and dried epoxy then 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.449
 have elapsed 12 hours with 

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:20.490
 lighters i burned the surface she started 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:22.050
 bubbling streets of some places along we 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.909
 even the beauty began i did it 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.919
 several times until I got it right 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:28.199
 result because without such 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:31.589
 processing turned out heterogeneous 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:34.349
 the material he was still more 

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:36.659
 like a mixture of grated plastic 

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:40.080
 as if even when it was polished 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:41.879
 a little visible such a structure after 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.560
 such treatment here seems to me 

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:46.860
 just the top of it is caked 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.460
 and it turned out so very good 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:52.009
 result 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.009
 Well , we have such an important moment. 

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:58.439
 that is, first we burn and then grind 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:07:02.430
 and polish of course you can turn even 

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:04.050
 better that is according to the texture color 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.139
 absolutely no different but here 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:09.330
 small such a shade due to the fact that 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:13.020
 while prices are still soft-touch coated 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:15.930
 as I said, here it is literally 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:20.300
 the topic can be spoiled she researched but 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:22.740
 there are such rubbing edges on this side 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.419
 since we keep the knife like this 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:28.169
 In principle, it is in this place more 

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:30.529
 just erased like this 

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:30.529
 box 

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:39.580
 you are such a tip and a formed 

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.580
 baumana 

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:54.770
 that's all thank you for your attention 

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:57.320
 use your ceramic knives 

00:07:54.770 --> 00:08:00.310
 carefully take care of them they are so fragile 

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.310
 all happy
