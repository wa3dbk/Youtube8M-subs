00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.950
 how to photograph a car not in a manner 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.870
 too different from a model in the sense 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.970
 which for both is what matters 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.980
 to exalt the beauty of the 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.080
 forces and grasp more details 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.480
 significant especially when the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.869
 subject and particular like the peugeot 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.760
 508 rxh the first hybrid car of the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.470
 police with a combined electric motor 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.800
 to the diesel engine and to the traction 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.800
 whole wheat 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.469
 in photography light plays a role 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.120
 very important 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.610
 that's why in a professional studio 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.800
 it is essential to be able to manage the sources 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.070
 luminous and to have under control i 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.070
 reflexes 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.320
 to photograph a car in the studio 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.300
 normally a study is used 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.990
 to egg a study that has no 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.970
 edges then you will see that there is not 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.850
 not even a corner this studio apart 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.860
 the door is done in such a way as to 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.380
 being able to use lights do not say 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.820
 theme of the reflected lights that go to me 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.820
 design the car 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.520
 technology on the other hand allows 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.530
 to evaluate the result in real time 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.390
 one click and immediately take action 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.950
 to make changes but not 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.070
 for this it has completely replaced 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.150
 the most artisan techniques or the 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.150
 photographer's sensitivity 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.690
 I start from a foundation that is 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.650
 that of photography photography that 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.510
 don't say light and write a little bit 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.030
 that to real photography is not so much 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.550
 shooting one can frame but in 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.110
 studio photography you want to draw 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.500
 the car 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.110
 I interpret this car in the 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.330
 my images like a reassuring car 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.000
 it must be a reassuring car it is 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.750
 a hybrid car a discreet car a car 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.030
 especially silent as it turns 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.160
 electric I don't feel like telling it 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.230
 as an aggressive car the concept is 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.170
 the little one of being reassuring for 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.530
 which must not have in the forcing of 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.450
 too extreme light for me 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.360
 it must be a car like that 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:39.070
 apparently very soft a lot 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:39.070
 descriptive few shadows a lot of light 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.840
 photographing in essence is a way to 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:52.480
 tell the reality to communicate a 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.480
 message can arouse emotions
