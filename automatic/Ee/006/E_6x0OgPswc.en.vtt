drawings inside of the wall here and

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.569 
drawings inside of the wall here and
that's<00:00:54.559> really<00:00:54.769> the<00:00:54.859> only<00:00:54.890> style<00:00:55.219> I<00:00:55.370> know<00:00:55.430> how

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
that's really the only style I know how

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.899 
that's really the only style I know how
to<00:00:55.640> do<00:00:55.820> its<00:00:56.719> pen<00:00:57.079> and<00:00:57.229> ink<00:00:57.379> and<00:00:57.559> I'd<00:00:58.489> never<00:00:58.699> done

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
to do its pen and ink and I'd never done

00:00:58.909 --> 00:00:59.729 
to do its pen and ink and I'd never done
a<00:00:58.940> girl<00:00:59.120> before

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
a girl before

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.349 
a girl before
and<00:01:00.739> so<00:01:01.010> another<00:01:01.370> one<00:01:01.519> of<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:01.729> reasons<00:01:02.300> that

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
and so another one of the reasons that

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.049 
and so another one of the reasons that
it<00:01:02.839> was<00:01:03.049> an<00:01:03.710> interesting<00:01:04.070> opportunity<00:01:04.759> for<00:01:04.789> me

it was an interesting opportunity for me
it<00:01:05.149> was<00:01:05.269> because<00:01:05.449> my<00:01:05.840> friends<00:01:06.619> over<00:01:06.830> early

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
it was because my friends over early

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.480 
it was because my friends over early
said<00:01:08.030> maybe<00:01:08.720> you<00:01:08.840> could<00:01:08.990> do<00:01:09.080> a<00:01:09.110> mural<00:01:09.380> in<00:01:10.340> our

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
gallery spaces to me I was immediately

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:17.889 
gallery spaces to me I was immediately
intrigued<00:01:16.039> but<00:01:16.250> also<00:01:16.369> kind<00:01:16.700> of<00:01:16.759> frightened<00:01:17.539> at

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
intrigued but also kind of frightened at

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.469 
intrigued but also kind of frightened at
the<00:01:17.960> prospect<00:01:18.200> of<00:01:18.890> having<00:01:19.550> the<00:01:19.819> first<00:01:20.000> mural

ever attempt to do something that

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.750 
ever attempt to do something that
service<00:01:22.360> looked<00:01:23.360> at<00:01:23.539> a<00:01:23.569> lot

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
service looked at a lot

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.540 
service looked at a lot
that<00:01:24.940> knowledge<00:01:25.630> that<00:01:26.440> many<00:01:26.800> people<00:01:27.070> will<00:01:27.340> see

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
that knowledge that many people will see

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.150 
that knowledge that many people will see
or<00:01:27.700> hear<00:01:27.940> the<00:01:28.150> things<00:01:28.360> that<00:01:28.510> you<00:01:28.570> do<00:01:29.160> presents

or hear the things that you do presents

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.890 
or hear the things that you do presents
an<00:01:30.370> interesting<00:01:30.550> challenge<00:01:30.940> in<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.540> process

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
an interesting challenge in the process

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.580 
an interesting challenge in the process
of<00:01:32.140> making<00:01:32.800> reading<00:01:33.280> song<00:01:33.520> or<00:01:34.530> painting<00:01:35.530> a

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
of making reading song or painting a

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.990 
of making reading song or painting a
picture<00:01:35.740> of<00:01:36.010> the<00:01:36.130> mural<00:01:36.520> whatever<00:01:36.760> you're

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
picture of the mural whatever you're

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.139 
picture of the mural whatever you're
doing<00:01:37.270> they<00:01:37.390> see

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
doing they see

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.099 
doing they see
because<00:01:38.780> it<00:01:39.229> ends<00:01:39.409> up<00:01:39.469> being<00:01:39.710> a<00:01:39.979> kind<00:01:40.250> of<00:01:40.460> noise

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:41.109 
because it ends up being a kind of noise

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:44.139 
because it ends up being a kind of noise
an<00:01:42.109> external<00:01:42.500> noise<00:01:42.649> that<00:01:43.039> can<00:01:43.670> inform<00:01:44.119> the

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
an external noise that can inform the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.490 
an external noise that can inform the
process<00:01:44.390> what<00:01:45.170> I've<00:01:45.289> always<00:01:45.469> tried<00:01:45.710> to<00:01:45.829> do<00:01:46.250> is

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
process what I've always tried to do is

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.649 
process what I've always tried to do is
tune<00:01:48.500> out<00:01:48.679> all<00:01:49.009> the<00:01:49.369> noise<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:49.880> listen<00:01:50.450> to

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
tune out all the noise and listen to

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.760 
tune out all the noise and listen to
more<00:01:51.079> of<00:01:51.140> a<00:01:51.369> singular<00:01:52.369> thing<00:01:52.609> that's<00:01:52.759> why<00:01:52.939> I

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
more of a singular thing that's why I

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.719 
more of a singular thing that's why I
don't<00:01:54.770> really<00:01:54.950> know<00:01:55.219> what<00:01:55.369> that<00:01:55.520> thing<00:01:55.670> is

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
don't really know what that thing is

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.179 
don't really know what that thing is
because<00:01:56.270> probably<00:01:56.600> what's<00:01:56.959> interesting

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
because probably what's interesting

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.710 
because probably what's interesting
about<00:01:58.189> the<00:01:58.640> process<00:01:59.090> of<00:01:59.149> creativity

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
about the process of creativity

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.090 
about the process of creativity
trying<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.050> pay<00:02:01.230> attention<00:02:01.440> to<00:02:01.710> something

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
trying to pay attention to something

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.860 
trying to pay attention to something
that<00:02:02.130> doesn't<00:02:02.400> find<00:02:02.730> it

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
that doesn't find it

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.509 
that doesn't find it
face<00:02:05.260> or<00:02:05.920> name<00:02:06.310> or

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.039 

somewhere<00:02:10.519> and<00:02:11.269> you're<00:02:11.390> kind<00:02:11.599> of<00:02:11.659> borrowing

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049 
somewhere and you're kind of borrowing

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:16.220 
somewhere and you're kind of borrowing
from<00:02:12.170> them<00:02:12.409> for

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230

Russia

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.270 

I<00:02:20.490> always<00:02:21.490> felt<00:02:21.880> like<00:02:22.150> it's<00:02:22.420> a<00:02:22.990> small<00:02:23.500> shift

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
I always felt like it's a small shift

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.610 
I always felt like it's a small shift
thanks<00:02:24.850> to<00:02:25.030> her<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.660> hard<00:02:26.260> part<00:02:26.470> is<00:02:26.590> that

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
thanks to her the hard part is that

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.350 
thanks to her the hard part is that
there<00:02:26.950> are<00:02:27.040> so<00:02:27.130> many<00:02:27.220> of<00:02:27.400> us<00:02:27.490> and<00:02:27.790> so<00:02:28.180> it's<00:02:28.330> a

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
there are so many of us and so it's a

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.180 
there are so many of us and so it's a
small<00:02:28.600> shift<00:02:28.810> needs<00:02:28.990> to<00:02:29.140> occur<00:02:29.380> and<00:02:29.680> it's<00:02:30.070> the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
small shift needs to occur and it's the

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.550 
small shift needs to occur and it's the
right<00:02:30.340> amount<00:02:30.580> of<00:02:30.610> people<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:31.750> sort<00:02:32.110> of<00:02:32.170> seems

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
right amount of people it sort of seems

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.870 
right amount of people it sort of seems
like<00:02:32.770> once<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.160> right<00:02:33.310> amount<00:02:33.550> of<00:02:33.580> people

like once the right amount of people
make<00:02:34.060> that<00:02:34.210> shift<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.540> everybody<00:02:34.930> kind<00:02:35.110> of

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
make that shift and everybody kind of

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.350 
make that shift and everybody kind of
inspection

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360
