00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:22.600 

what<00:01:16.800> am<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:16.950> like<00:01:17.100> it'll<00:01:17.790> be<00:01:17.820> like<00:01:17.970> mr.<00:01:18.210> olympia

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.440 

three<00:01:23.610> bones<00:01:25.520> then<00:01:26.520> had<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.790> just<00:01:27.000> hang<00:01:27.150> up<00:01:27.330> in

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
three bones then had to just hang up in

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.640 
three bones then had to just hang up in
the<00:01:27.540> middle<00:01:27.690> of<00:01:27.750> his<00:01:27.870> girth<00:01:28.110> for<00:01:28.380> me<00:01:28.440> I<00:01:28.530> don't

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
the middle of his girth for me I don't

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.380 
the middle of his girth for me I don't
know<00:01:28.710> what<00:01:28.830> he<00:01:28.890> was<00:01:28.980> talking<00:01:29.040> about<00:01:29.400> he<00:01:29.610> kept

know what he was talking about he kept
telling<00:01:30.570> me<00:01:30.720> how<00:01:30.810> easy<00:01:30.990> was<00:01:31.260> the<00:01:31.470> girth<00:01:31.680> is

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
telling me how easy was the girth is

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.350 
telling me how easy was the girth is
actually<00:01:32.190> very<00:01:32.220> simple<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.850> figure<00:01:33.030> out<00:01:33.240> all

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
actually very simple to figure out all

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.520 
actually very simple to figure out all
you<00:01:33.450> do<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.720> take<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.930> length<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.410> you

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
you do is you take the length and you

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.840 
you do is you take the length and you
double<00:01:34.830> that<00:01:34.860> by<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.130> smaller<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.550> the<00:01:35.700> height

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
double that by the smaller of the height

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.630 
double that by the smaller of the height
okay<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.240> got<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.450> go<00:01:36.480> get<00:01:36.840> another<00:01:37.050> call<00:01:37.640> yeah

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
okay I got to go get another call yeah

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:48.310 
okay I got to go get another call yeah
just<00:01:38.910> open<00:01:39.300> at<00:01:39.390> Tokyo

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.680 

I<00:01:48.580> figured<00:01:49.580> I<00:01:49.640> would<00:01:49.760> just<00:01:49.790> call<00:01:50.060> back<00:01:50.300> you

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.740 
I figured I would just call back you
know<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:50.960> just<00:01:51.050> make<00:01:51.350> up<00:01:51.530> some<00:01:51.740> numbers<00:01:52.750> let

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
know and just make up some numbers let

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.000 
know and just make up some numbers let
them<00:01:53.840> come<00:01:53.870> out<00:01:54.080> and<00:01:54.260> pick<00:01:54.380> them<00:01:54.560> up<00:01:54.650> if<00:01:54.860> it's
