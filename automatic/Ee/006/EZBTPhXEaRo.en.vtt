00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.450
 hi to all the clips on the guides 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.440
 game it's dylan attack 1660 and 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.510
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.269
 any new video on buried in 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.349
 zombies on the game black ops 2 then 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.210
 today I present you a whole 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.640
 new glide what did I do that I 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.840
 found yesterday but I present it to you 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.029
 today because I was lazy 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.020
 to put it in video in fact and so of 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.189
 blow i will introduce you now 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.900
 I made a lot of little videos 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.000
 edited because the time that I 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.080
 search in old maps and where 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.210
 you see that I did exactly 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.500
 many a lot of parts for 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.330
 find glitchs and ideas I have 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.860
 all too well and I put them on video edited 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.059
 so we 'll start it right away and 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.100
 I will explain how to do 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.820
 to achieve this magnificent glitz 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.820
 invincibility 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.930
 so for to realize this glitch I 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.430
 will tell you we can do it at 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.000
 several 1 2 3 and 4 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.650
 your allies will also be invincible 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.909
 you invincible also also because 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.619
 that it is you who make the glitch 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.479
 so here I pause 

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:01.519
 then it will take the propeller 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.680
 will have to take a weapon but 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.600
 preferably take the paralyze outeurs and 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.240
 then the double laser gun or 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.409
 simple laser gun to be sure of 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.659
 do a lot of sleeves 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.820
 so I started it up 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.170
 the sleeve 5 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.000
 because there are not many of its bilateral and 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.070
 then we do not do that I'm going a lot 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.750
 know for example they will run or 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.340
 ramps and others we did it at the 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.869
 sleeve 5 and show you how the 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.259
 to do and I explain to you right after 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.759
 how how to do it so well 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.850
 I 'll put that right away in 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.850
 action 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.810
 so it's a bit of a haste because 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.299
 I do not like to do at the beginning 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.829
 so here is where I pressed 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.350
 pause then it was pointed out that 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.789
 I placed the thruster one way 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.689
 very weird to lens the mines just at 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:50.420
 edge right at the edge of the window in 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.829
 the kind of wooden bars and like that 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.420
 we no longer see the kind of grid and 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.189
 sinks of weird stuff you'll see 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.869
 I put you back to singing after and with that 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.340
 it's going to be that there will be a bit of 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.590
 teachers who will overtake next to the 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.179
 box and saw that the end of thrusters 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.679
 exceeds the purpose of the box you ride 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.200
 the box very slowly but really 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.880
 very gently kita called papis 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.399
 grannies for him to do it but hey 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.659
 it does not matter we do not care 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.129
 you are all moments and you are going 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:13.540
 propel you dr teddy which is found 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.459
 just left there if you see to 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.840
 the screen and once that's done 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.250
 you quickly recognize the propeller otherwise 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.510
 it will propel you one of the two 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.879
 barriers and there you will die and 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.069
 you're going to have rabies and you're going 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.400
 die on everything and you will lose your 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.920
 ammunition 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.120
 then I rely on pause and you 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.920
 you put right between the two 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.200
 small pieces as you can see at 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.549
 the screen is appearing now I am 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.260
 between the little box where there are 10s 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.640
 the little box of traviole and that to 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.920
 to make sure that the zombies will come to 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.409
 block in front of you so that's done 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.760
 an invincibility ride I'll go 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.769
 explain the rest so that your friends 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.780
 be invincible also too 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.889
 so for your friends tonight at 26000 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.659
 the EU will have to go to the crates 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.769
 which is just left there at 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.400
 side of the light that you see at 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.440
 background of the room 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.970
 and then he goes there they will be 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.400
 invincible so I'm going to show you 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.599
 what does it do with a little bit of it 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.609
 director and then the two little ones that 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.799
 you see that zombies get me to 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:05.670
 cut short in front of me like autists and 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.670
 here 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.120
 you will notice that also we can 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.040
 so easily ammunition that 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.930
 could see on the screen just for 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.060

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.910
