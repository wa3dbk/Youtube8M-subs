00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.930 
bit of eyeliner and curling my lashes
with<00:02:29.440> some<00:02:29.739> mascara<00:02:30.040> this<00:02:30.250> usually<00:02:30.610> takes<00:02:30.819> me

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
with some mascara this usually takes me

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.640 
with some mascara this usually takes me
about<00:02:31.060> five<00:02:31.299> minutes<00:02:31.540> in<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.810> morning<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:32.380> I

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
about five minutes in the morning so I

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:45.640 
about five minutes in the morning so I
don't<00:02:33.160> really<00:02:33.310> do<00:02:33.430> anything<00:02:33.700> too<00:02:33.910> special

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.680 

I'm<00:02:46.650> usually<00:02:46.860> pretty<00:02:47.100> lazy<00:02:47.610> on<00:02:47.760> my<00:02:47.910> hair<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.330> I

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
I'm usually pretty lazy on my hair and I

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.300 
I'm usually pretty lazy on my hair and I
don't<00:02:48.900> always<00:02:49.050> have<00:02:49.140> time<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.500> style<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.280> I

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
don't always have time to style it so I

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.850 
don't always have time to style it so I
normally<00:02:50.730> just<00:02:50.910> leave<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.210> natural<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.860> this

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
normally just leave it natural and this

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.890 
normally just leave it natural and this
case<00:02:53.160> I'm<00:02:53.430> just<00:02:53.700> putting<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.120> like<00:02:54.420> half<00:02:54.690> up

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
case I'm just putting it like half up

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.480 
case I'm just putting it like half up
half<00:02:54.990> down<00:02:55.140> because<00:02:55.740> it's<00:02:55.920> just<00:02:56.130> out<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:56.400> my

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
half down because it's just out of my

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.090 
half down because it's just out of my
face<00:02:56.700> but<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.420> don't<00:02:57.900> really<00:02:58.080> tend<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.710> style<00:02:58.950> it

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
face but I don't really tend to style it

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.250 
face but I don't really tend to style it
too<00:02:59.250> much<00:02:59.400> in<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.670> morning<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.930> by<00:03:01.080> this
