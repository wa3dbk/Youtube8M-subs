00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:46.819 

C<00:00:43.340> okay<00:00:44.340> now<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:46.110> 6/8<00:00:46.559> time<00:00:46.590> signature

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
C okay now this is in 6/8 time signature

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.979 
C okay now this is in 6/8 time signature
which<00:00:47.730> means<00:00:48.000> there<00:00:48.149> are<00:00:48.210> six<00:00:48.420> beats<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.899> each

let's<00:00:55.980> get<00:00:56.129> started<00:00:56.430> with<00:00:56.550> learning<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
let's get started with learning the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:07.820 
let's get started with learning the
melody<00:00:57.590> starts<00:00:58.590> on<00:00:58.829> G<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.570> G<00:01:03.439> G<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.890> G<00:01:06.590> and<00:01:07.590> then<00:01:07.710> it

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
melody starts on G a G G a G and then it

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:16.130 
melody starts on G a G G a G and then it
jumps<00:01:08.130> up<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.600> D<00:01:09.860> D<00:01:10.860> D<00:01:12.590> si<00:01:13.790> si

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140

okay so let's take that again and this
time<00:01:18.810> let's<00:01:18.960> put<00:01:19.140> some<00:01:19.320> chords<00:01:19.350> with<00:01:19.800> it<00:01:19.980> we're

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
time let's put some chords with it we're

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.660 
time let's put some chords with it we're
gonna<00:01:21.030> do<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.420> C<00:01:21.870> major<00:01:22.080> chord<00:01:22.260> with<00:01:22.620> this<00:01:22.830> we

how heavy you want to be at the very

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.190 
how heavy you want to be at the very
start<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.260> this<00:01:32.360> mid-range<00:01:33.360> type<00:01:33.720> things<00:01:33.990> I'm

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
start of this mid-range type things I'm

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.440 
start of this mid-range type things I'm
gonna<00:01:34.350> start<00:01:34.560> down<00:01:34.710> here<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:35.729> got<00:01:36.000> octave

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
gonna start down here so we got octave

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.650 
gonna start down here so we got octave
C's<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.229> then<00:01:37.710> C<00:01:38.300> G<00:01:41.090> notice<00:01:42.090> how<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.300> played

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
that G as I was I'm gonna be kind of

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.420 
that G as I was I'm gonna be kind of
basically<00:01:46.050> rolling<00:01:46.290> my<00:01:46.560> notes<00:01:46.830> down<00:01:47.130> here

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
basically rolling my notes down here

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.670 
basically rolling my notes down here
creating<00:01:48.030> an<00:01:48.450> eighth<00:01:48.690> note<00:01:48.810> type<00:01:49.200> pattern<00:01:49.560> if

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
creating an eighth note type pattern if

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.560 
creating an eighth note type pattern if
you<00:01:49.800> will

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.300

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
so you notice all of that was still

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.960 
so you notice all of that was still
centered<00:01:56.670> around<00:01:56.820> those<00:01:57.210> notes<00:01:57.630> they're<00:01:58.970> all
