00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.589
 hola que tal como estan tell them that 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.169
 the system that affected the area 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:19.480
 central with major storms is 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:20.739
 fast displacement therefore for 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.750
 this Friday is expected to be 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:25.269
 affecting in the north of the littoral 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.800
 especially with storms and descent 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.619
 of the temperature of the minimum 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.589
 will be around 18 and 19 degrees and we will have 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.180
 maximum of up to 24 degrees while 

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:35.620
 both for the south of the littoral and in the 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.960
 province of córdoba in the cloudiness 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:42.280
 it will be variable with minima around 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.750
 of 16 degrees and maximums between 28 and 29 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.670
 degrees if the pampas plain will be 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.640
 affected by a new system that 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.379
 approaches slowly from patagonia 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.410
 therefore there will be instability with some 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.870
 minimum rainfall between 13 and 16 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.090
 degrees and maximums between 20 and 26 degrees 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.120
 for the provinces of which it is expected 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.489
 Partly cloudy sky 16 minimum 32 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.800
 the maximum temperature and in the northwest 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.990
 in general the sky will be partially 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.810
 cloudy has covered improving towards the 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.020
 late night somewhat unstable 1819 the 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.790
 minimum and the maximum will reach 29 and 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.310
 30 degrees and the wind blows 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.620
 from the northeast sector contributing 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.630
 humidity improving as we said towards the 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.190
 end of the week in general in the area 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.360
 central since with wind rotation 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.430
 stability will come and I tell you that in 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.860
 the patagonia along the mountain range 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.870
 a partially cloudy sky is expected 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.510
 covered in the south with minimums that 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.810
 will be around 6 and 9 degrees in maximum 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.970
 between 14 and 21 degrees on the coast 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.690
 Atlantic is expected good weather 13 the 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.450
 minimum maximum between 23 and 25 degrees and 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.580
 for malvinas 313 the values ​​finally 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.229
 as we said in the south of santa cruz and 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.810
 In the land of fire there will be covered heaven 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:00.490
 something unstable with a minimum of 6 degrees and 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:02.560
