00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.510 
was red I think one was blue and the
other<00:05:36.820> one<00:05:37.150> was<00:05:37.360> orange<00:05:37.960> and<00:05:38.460> depending<00:05:39.460> on

make<00:05:41.410> three<00:05:41.830> different<00:05:42.010> robots<00:05:42.610> in<00:05:42.820> each

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:43.390
