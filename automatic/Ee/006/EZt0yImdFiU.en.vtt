yeah it was just gonna take too long on
the<00:00:43.020> server<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.710> think<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.610> people<00:00:45.539> aren't

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
the server I think and people aren't

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.630 
the server I think and people aren't
online<00:00:46.079> at<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.500> same<00:00:46.530> time<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.309> yadda<00:00:47.489> yadda

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
online at the same time and yadda yadda

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.299 
online at the same time and yadda yadda
yadda<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.050> got<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.350> bit<00:00:49.559> bit<00:00:50.070> impatient

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
yadda and so I got a bit bit impatient

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.830 
yadda and so I got a bit bit impatient
wanted<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.940> see<00:00:51.120> what<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.390> would<00:00:51.449> look<00:00:51.510> like<00:00:51.600> if

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
wanted to see what it would look like if

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.130 
wanted to see what it would look like if
I<00:00:51.930> made<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.110> giant<00:00:52.649> chess<00:00:52.800> board<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.449> used

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
I made a giant chess board and so I used

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.889 
I made a giant chess board and so I used
a<00:00:58.010> map<00:00:59.010> edit<00:00:59.550> so<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.760> don't<00:01:00.120> remember<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.690> name

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
a map edit so I don't remember the name

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.490 
a map edit so I don't remember the name
of<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.230> program<00:01:02.180> but<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.539> Minecraft

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
of the program but it's on the Minecraft

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.210 
of the program but it's on the Minecraft
Wiki<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:04.979> one<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.220> those<00:01:05.339> ones<00:01:07.010> so<00:01:08.010> yeah<00:01:08.189> I

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
Wiki it's one of those ones so yeah I

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.320 
Wiki it's one of those ones so yeah I
used<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.909> map<00:01:09.090> editor<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:10.380> basically<00:01:11.330> put

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
used a map editor and I basically put

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.750 
used a map editor and I basically put
like<00:01:12.540> all<00:01:12.930> these<00:01:13.170> s<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.860> wool<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.460> didn't

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
like all these s of wool and I didn't

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.280 
like all these s of wool and I didn't
think<00:01:14.939> at<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> time<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.360> could<00:01:15.659> use<00:01:15.810> bike<00:01:16.020> walk

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
think at the time I could use bike walk

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.160 
think at the time I could use bike walk
so<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.560> was<00:01:16.650> gonna<00:01:16.740> do<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.100> all<00:01:17.509> myself<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.810> was

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
so I was gonna do that all myself I was

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.340 
so I was gonna do that all myself I was

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
like oh and so I did like six of the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.010 
like oh and so I did like six of the
black<00:01:23.100> squares<00:01:23.549> myself<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.570> was<00:01:24.689> just<00:01:24.869> like

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020

oh this is taking forever I thought oh
wait<00:01:27.840> there's<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.170> cloning<00:01:28.619> thing<00:01:28.740> on<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.920> my

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
wait there's a cloning thing on the my

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.969 
wait there's a cloning thing on the my
favorite<00:01:29.340> map<00:01:29.700> editor<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.750> when<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.560> went<00:01:31.740> on

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
favorite map editor and when I went on

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.830 
favorite map editor and when I went on
it<00:01:32.100> did<00:01:32.640> show<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.119> black<00:01:33.240> ones<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.720> was

it did show you the black ones I was
just<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.460> so<00:01:35.460> yeah<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.790> kind<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.390> then<00:01:36.930> filled

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
just like so yeah I kind of then filled

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.609 
just like so yeah I kind of then filled
in<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.650> black<00:01:37.799> squares<00:01:38.189> with<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.850> chrony<00:01:39.619> so

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
in the black squares with the chrony so

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.499 
in the black squares with the chrony so
yeah<00:01:41.630> although<00:01:42.860> it<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:44.250> theory<00:01:45.149> should<00:01:45.299> have

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
yeah although it in theory should have

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.179 
yeah although it in theory should have
just<00:01:45.659> taken<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:46.079> few<00:01:46.229> minutes<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.680> do<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:46.979> it

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
just taken a few minutes to do this it

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.580 
just taken a few minutes to do this it
actually<00:01:47.549> took<00:01:47.729> me<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> couple<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.270> days

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
actually took me a couple of days

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.380 
actually took me a couple of days
because<00:01:49.590> I'm<00:01:49.710> not<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.040> best<00:01:50.310> with<00:01:50.880> these

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
because I'm not the best with these

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.830 
because I'm not the best with these
tools<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.759> whatnot<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.000> took<00:01:54.390> me<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.630> while<00:01:54.780> to

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
tools and whatnot so took me a while to

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.580 
tools and whatnot so took me a while to
work<00:01:55.170> out<00:01:55.470> what<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.710> was<00:01:55.920> doing<00:01:57.140> so<00:01:58.140> yeah<00:01:58.560> I

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
work out what I was doing so yeah I

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.039 
work out what I was doing so yeah I
managed<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.670> make<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> giant<00:02:00.149> chess<00:02:00.479> board<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
managed to make a giant chess board and

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.649 
managed to make a giant chess board and
