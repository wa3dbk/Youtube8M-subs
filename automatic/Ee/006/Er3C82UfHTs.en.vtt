00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
character creation so don't think this

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.229 
character creation so don't think this
is<00:04:16.900> going<00:04:17.260> to<00:04:17.350> be<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:17.739> sort<00:04:18.039> of<00:04:18.190> I<00:04:18.459> use<00:04:19.060> the

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
fire it's possible but not very likely

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.610 
fire it's possible but not very likely
you're<00:04:25.360> better<00:04:25.570> off<00:04:25.630> setting<00:04:26.169> that<00:04:26.289> Whaley

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.820 
you're better off setting that Whaley
rags<00:04:26.890> on<00:04:27.190> fire<00:04:27.490> for<00:04:27.820> example<00:04:27.970> and<00:04:28.900> it

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
rags on fire for example and it

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.059 
rags on fire for example and it
shows<00:04:30.340> how<00:04:30.849> the<00:04:31.599> forces<00:04:31.870> of<00:04:32.259> darkness<00:04:32.500> don't

over<00:04:40.060> by<00:04:40.479> using<00:04:40.810> these<00:04:41.080> too<00:04:41.379> often<00:04:41.710> what<00:04:41.889> it

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
over by using these too often what it

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.510 
over by using these too often what it
allows<00:04:42.220> you<00:04:42.400> to<00:04:42.520> do<00:04:42.699> is<00:04:42.940> it<00:04:43.389> gives<00:04:43.659> you<00:04:43.840> sort<00:04:44.139> of

allows you to do is it gives you sort of
sort<00:04:45.520> of<00:04:45.669> a<00:04:45.789> nice<00:04:46.240> additional<00:04:47.020> edge<00:04:47.259> that<00:04:47.500> the

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
sort of a nice additional edge that the

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.529 
sort of a nice additional edge that the
mortal<00:04:47.889> characters<00:04:48.280> may<00:04:48.460> not<00:04:48.669> have<00:04:48.909> but<00:04:49.389> it's

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
mortal characters may not have but it's

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.540 
mortal characters may not have but it's
not<00:04:49.810> anywhere<00:04:50.229> near<00:04:50.409> as<00:04:50.620> overpowering<00:04:51.310> as<00:04:51.430> it

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
not anywhere near as overpowering as it

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.550 
not anywhere near as overpowering as it
could<00:04:51.729> have<00:04:51.819> been<00:04:51.970> I<00:04:52.180> think<00:04:52.750> the<00:04:52.870> best<00:04:53.289> analogy

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
could have been I think the best analogy

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.960 
could have been I think the best analogy
for<00:04:54.340> this<00:04:54.550> would<00:04:55.270> be<00:04:55.599> something<00:04:56.470> like<00:04:56.970> The

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
for this would be something like The

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.779 
for this would be something like The
Shining<00:04:58.979> Stephen<00:04:59.979> King's<00:05:00.190> The<00:05:00.250> Shining<00:05:00.490> where

Shining Stephen King's The Shining where

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:02.490 
Shining Stephen King's The Shining where
the<00:05:00.909> kid<00:05:01.120> is<00:05:01.150> pretty<00:05:01.539> clearly<00:05:01.840> a<00:05:01.960> psychic<00:05:02.379> with

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
the kid is pretty clearly a psychic with

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.050 
the kid is pretty clearly a psychic with
some<00:05:02.680> really<00:05:03.039> good<00:05:03.190> Second<00:05:03.639> Sight<00:05:03.789> and

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
some really good Second Sight and

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.899 
some really good Second Sight and
spiritual<00:05:04.990> medium<00:05:05.379> sorts<00:05:05.650> of<00:05:05.710> things<00:05:05.949> but<00:05:06.610> my

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:06.909 
spiritual medium sorts of things but my

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:08.850 
spiritual medium sorts of things but my
god<00:05:07.300> does<00:05:07.599> he<00:05:07.629> look<00:05:07.870> like<00:05:07.900> a<00:05:08.080> yummy<00:05:08.379> treat<00:05:08.740> to

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
god does he look like a yummy treat to

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.939 
god does he look like a yummy treat to
that<00:05:08.979> evil<00:05:09.430> evil<00:05:09.789> hotel<00:05:10.199> the<00:05:11.199> dead<00:05:11.440> zone<00:05:11.740> is

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
that evil evil hotel the dead zone is

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:14.129 
that evil evil hotel the dead zone is
another<00:05:12.400> really<00:05:12.940> good<00:05:13.090> example<00:05:13.150> of<00:05:13.750> how<00:05:13.930> these

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
another really good example of how these

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:15.869 
another really good example of how these
psychic<00:05:14.560> powers<00:05:14.889> don't<00:05:15.129> always<00:05:15.340> work<00:05:15.699> that

00:05:15.869 --> 00:05:15.879 
psychic powers don't always work that

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:18.990 
psychic powers don't always work that
well<00:05:16.120> for<00:05:16.150> you<00:05:16.539> in<00:05:16.719> a<00:05:17.379> sin<00:05:17.740> a<00:05:18.039> dark<00:05:18.759> fantasy

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
it probably has a more general use than

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.149 
it probably has a more general use than
tales<00:05:25.240> from<00:05:25.449> the<00:05:25.509> 13th<00:05:25.870> precinct<00:05:26.409> would<00:05:26.560> this
