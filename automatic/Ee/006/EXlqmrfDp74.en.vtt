let's<00:00:14.350> see<00:00:17.310> strumming<00:00:18.310> pattern<00:00:18.640> keep<00:00:18.820> it

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
let's see strumming pattern keep it

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:19.470 
let's see strumming pattern keep it
simple

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
simple

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.890 
simple
just<00:00:19.660> going<00:00:19.810> to<00:00:19.869> do<00:00:19.930> two<00:00:19.960> strums<00:00:20.680> for<00:00:21.160> each<00:00:21.220> bar

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
just going to do two strums for each bar

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:32.010 
just going to do two strums for each bar
so<00:00:22.900> it's<00:00:23.290> going<00:00:23.439> to<00:00:23.529> start<00:00:23.740> G<00:00:26.790> in<00:00:30.570> d2<00:00:31.570> lots<00:00:31.779> of<00:00:31.899> a

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
so it's going to start G in d2 lots of a

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:43.950 
so it's going to start G in d2 lots of a
point<00:00:36.960> back<00:00:37.960> to<00:00:37.989> G<00:00:40.260> do<00:00:41.260> you<00:00:41.320> get<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:43.660> tom

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
point back to G do you get this tom

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:52.650 
point back to G do you get this tom
carried<00:00:44.320> on<00:00:44.500> see<00:00:50.400> that<00:00:51.400> sequence<00:00:52.270> goes

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
carried on see that sequence goes

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.330 
carried on see that sequence goes
throughout<00:00:53.290> the<00:00:53.350> whole<00:00:53.440> song<00:00:53.829> that's<00:00:54.220> the

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
throughout the whole song that's the

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.310 
throughout the whole song that's the
whole<00:00:54.460> song<00:00:54.640> basically<00:00:55.150> I'll<00:00:55.870> play<00:00:56.050> around<00:00:56.230> a

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
whole song basically I'll play around a

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:30.850 
whole song basically I'll play around a
couple<00:00:56.500> of<00:00:56.590> times<00:00:56.800> just<00:00:56.950> to<00:00:57.340> hear

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.680 

that's<00:01:31.370> a<00:01:31.430> very<00:01:31.610> simple<00:01:32.000> pattern<00:01:32.180> just<00:01:32.450> two

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
that's a very simple pattern just two

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.830 
that's a very simple pattern just two
strums<00:01:33.080> for<00:01:33.320> each<00:01:33.380> chord<00:01:33.770> which<00:01:34.370> bar<00:01:34.750> you<00:01:35.750> can

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
strums for each chord which bar you can

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.590 
strums for each chord which bar you can
make<00:01:35.960> it<00:01:36.110> a<00:01:36.170> bit<00:01:36.260> busy<00:01:36.440> if<00:01:36.650> you<00:01:36.740> like<00:01:37.119> and<00:01:38.119> this

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
make it a bit busy if you like and this

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.590 
make it a bit busy if you like and this
is<00:01:38.869> basically<00:01:39.909> gonna<00:01:40.909> have<00:01:41.119> this<00:01:41.240> kind<00:01:41.479> of

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
is basically gonna have this kind of

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.210 
is basically gonna have this kind of
busy<00:01:41.780> a<00:01:41.900> pattern<00:01:42.229> for<00:01:42.409> each<00:01:42.440> chord<00:01:42.830> where<00:01:43.100> it

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
busy a pattern for each chord where it

00:01:43.220 --> 00:02:06.179 
busy a pattern for each chord where it
goes<00:01:43.840> down<00:01:44.840> down<00:01:45.470> down

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.620 

so<00:02:07.189> that's<00:02:07.399> a<00:02:07.490> slightly<00:02:07.729> busy<00:02:07.970> a<00:02:08.090> pattern<00:02:08.450> if

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
so that's a slightly busy a pattern if

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.280 
so that's a slightly busy a pattern if
you're<00:02:09.459> more<00:02:10.459> advanced<00:02:10.759> player<00:02:11.170> you<00:02:12.170> get

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
you're more advanced player you get

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.350 
you're more advanced player you get
another<00:02:12.500> song<00:02:12.770> for<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.700> price<00:02:13.910> for<00:02:14.090> this<00:02:14.180> one

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
another song for the price for this one

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.860 
another song for the price for this one
if<00:02:14.569> you<00:02:14.690> take<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:14.959> first<00:02:15.700> four<00:02:16.700> bars<00:02:16.910> you
