00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
note C show Swearengen so I pack up and

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.000 
note C show Swearengen so I pack up and
shows<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.460> screen<00:04:39.789> ago<00:04:40.000> hey<00:04:40.650> see<00:04:41.650> this<00:04:41.800> is<00:04:41.979> a

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
shows the screen ago hey see this is a

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.370 
shows the screen ago hey see this is a
screen<00:04:42.400> of<00:04:42.430> this<00:04:42.639> top<00:04:42.850> of<00:04:42.940> your<00:04:43.090> abs<00:04:43.330> one<00:04:44.169> not

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
screen of this top of your abs one not

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:52.620 
screen of this top of your abs one not
right<00:04:44.530> there<00:04:47.430> there<00:04:48.430> you<00:04:48.550> go<00:04:48.669> now<00:04:48.880> start<00:04:51.510> so<00:04:52.510> he

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
right there there you go now start so he

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.480 
right there there you go now start so he
starts<00:04:52.930> writing<00:04:53.229> something<00:04:54.479> um<00:04:56.160> you<00:04:57.160> can<00:04:57.310> just

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
starts writing something um you can just

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:09.470 
starts writing something um you can just
erase<00:04:57.760> all<00:04:58.060> that

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:22.409 

so<00:05:10.480> if<00:05:10.540> he<00:05:10.630> writes<00:05:10.810> EA<00:05:20.580> it<00:05:21.580> goes<00:05:21.730> to<00:05:21.910> draw<00:05:22.150> and

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
so if he writes EA it goes to draw and

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:27.450 
so if he writes EA it goes to draw and
you<00:05:22.570> can<00:05:22.750> do<00:05:22.960> into<00:05:23.500> text<00:05:26.310> somewhere<00:05:27.310> you're

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
you can do into text somewhere you're

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.760 
you can do into text somewhere you're
looking<00:05:27.760> for<00:05:28.210> yeah<00:05:28.570> it's<00:05:29.139> on<00:05:29.380> the<00:05:29.500> corner

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
looking for yeah it's on the corner

said dl shaker that's what he said and
now<00:05:59.740> do<00:05:59.800> a<00:05:59.949> math<00:06:00.190> question<00:06:00.430> 2<00:06:01.979> 302<00:06:03.990> 310<00:06:05.190> just<00:06:06.190> a

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
now do a math question 2 302 310 just a

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:13.200 
now do a math question 2 302 310 just a
simple<00:06:06.550> math<00:06:06.910> question<00:06:10.530> into<00:06:11.530> math<00:06:11.740> no<00:06:12.250> II<00:06:12.460> to

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
simple math question into math no II to

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:24.480 
simple math question into math no II to
math<00:06:15.000> 300-plus<00:06:16.000> time<00:06:21.479> no<00:06:22.479> shade<00:06:22.990> to<00:06:23.169> 300<00:06:23.830> +<00:06:24.039> 10

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
math 300-plus time no shade to 300 + 10

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:41.629 
math 300-plus time no shade to 300 + 10
+<00:06:24.849> as<00:06:25.750> being<00:06:25.960> away<00:06:36.060> and<00:06:37.060> then<00:06:37.180> type<00:06:37.509> into<00:06:38.139> math

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:45.689 

now<00:06:42.639> write<00:06:42.909> the<00:06:43.090> equation<00:06:43.690> there<00:06:44.009> 300<00:06:45.009> +<00:06:45.220> 10<00:06:45.460> in

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:45.699 
now write the equation there 300 + 10 in

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:48.180 
now write the equation there 300 + 10 in
there<00:06:46.000> in<00:06:46.210> the<00:06:46.449> words<00:06:47.199> of<00:06:47.320> the<00:06:47.440> right<00:06:47.620> hit

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:48.190 
there in the words of the right hit

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:57.570 
there in the words of the right hit
their<00:06:51.509> say<00:06:52.509> 300<00:06:54.330> just<00:06:55.330> type<00:06:55.539> in<00:06:55.690> 300<00:06:56.380> no<00:06:57.250> don't

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:57.580 
their say 300 just type in 300 no don't

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:05.339 
their say 300 just type in 300 no don't
type<00:06:57.789> it<00:06:57.970> drawn<00:06:58.240> 300<00:06:59.050> or<00:06:59.500> the<00:06:59.620> yellow<00:06:59.770> is<00:07:04.349> plus

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:05.349 
type it drawn 300 or the yellow is plus

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:12.510 
type it drawn 300 or the yellow is plus
10<00:07:09.719> looks<00:07:10.719> like<00:07:10.870> a<00:07:10.900> 900<00:07:11.500> so<00:07:11.650> it's<00:07:11.800> going<00:07:11.949> to<00:07:12.009> do

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.520 
10 looks like a 900 so it's going to do

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.390 
10 looks like a 900 so it's going to do
900<00:07:13.060> but<00:07:13.810> as<00:07:13.990> you<00:07:14.259> can<00:07:14.380> tell<00:07:14.530> because<00:07:14.949> it<00:07:15.250> sort

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:15.400 
900 but as you can tell because it sort

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.149 
900 but as you can tell because it sort
of<00:07:15.490> looks<00:07:15.639> like<00:07:15.729> a<00:07:15.820> 9<00:07:16.150> but<00:07:16.539> so<00:07:17.199> it's<00:07:17.380> 900<00:07:17.949> plus

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:18.159 
of looks like a 9 but so it's 900 plus

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:21.800 
of looks like a 9 but so it's 900 plus
town<00:07:18.430> and<00:07:18.580> when<00:07:18.699> you<00:07:18.789> did<00:07:18.969> a<00:07:19.000> five<00:07:19.270> on<00:07:19.479> X<00:07:20.190> so

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:21.810 
town and when you did a five on X so

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.729 
town and when you did a five on X so
that<00:07:22.810> is<00:07:23.020> it<00:07:23.259> and<00:07:23.590> see<00:07:24.219> you<00:07:24.310> next<00:07:24.460> time
