00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
your main colors but I like the idea of

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.440 
your main colors but I like the idea of
not<00:01:57.070> having<00:01:57.340> to<00:01:57.369> repaint<00:01:57.759> the<00:01:57.909> base<00:01:58.090> of<00:01:58.299> my

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
not having to repaint the base of my

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.969 
not having to repaint the base of my
nail<00:01:58.600> as<00:01:58.840> it<00:01:59.049> grows<00:01:59.259> this<00:01:59.649> is<00:01:59.829> why<00:01:59.950> I

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
nail as it grows this is why I

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.950 
nail as it grows this is why I
recommended<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:00.789> new<00:02:00.969> color<00:02:01.240> of<00:02:01.390> nail<00:02:01.539> polish

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
recommended the new color of nail polish

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.810 
recommended the new color of nail polish
so<00:02:02.170> that<00:02:02.289> you<00:02:02.439> can<00:02:02.590> have<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:02.799> natural<00:02:03.340> base<00:02:03.549> look

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
so that you can have a natural base look
