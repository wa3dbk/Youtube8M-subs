00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:09.639
 good look at the beauty that I have today a 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:12.669
 as a fire r9 290 of the latest generation 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:16.600
 video card video chipset 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:20.690
 DVD that includes 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:27.200
 4 gb of the ran which is a memory 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:30.380
 of 512 bits and that is ddr5 is 92 90 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.170
 is the younger sister of the one 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.920
 they initially launched that is the 92 90 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.920
 x which is currently the top of the line 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:43.990
 for all amd chips 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.010
 and incorporate the new 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.010
 The new technology 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.760
 the new technology sn the new 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.770
 architecture and good the other things that 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.290
 I was already using md like it was 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.700
 eyefinity and all these things 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.750
 this is a video card for 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.900
 those who are wondering 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:12.950
 to compare it is a card 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:17.390
 video that can be compared with one in 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:21.920
 the range of giffords with a gtx 780 e 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:24.520
 there are even some reviews where the 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:29.290
 come to compare with video cards 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:33.150
 gtx 780 t and gtx titans also 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:36.950
 good but I la jolla 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.150
 I would pigeonhole it together with some 780 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.630
 although this one 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.220
 all the good comments 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.270
 has is that it has an excellent 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.149
 performance 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.609
 with a very low cost because it is not very 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:55.479
 bass is a gamma video card 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:58.179
 high however to have the 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.600
 performance that you have is a card that 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:03.579
 worth at least $ 100 more though 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.250
 that has been affected a bit by everything 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:09.640
 this of the scarcity that has been in 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.160
 all the chipset of r9 because of the a 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.349
 the computers that are doing for 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.650
 mining and we have the card as such 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:22.000
 pretty heavy let's look at the 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:25.500
 accessories that this scam brings to her 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.440
 9 290 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.710
 good we have 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.490
 the quick guide install a disk of 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.700
 drivers 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:41.530
 we have the record of this fire a 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.520
 converter of two moles to 8 pins 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.120
 pci-express 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.810
 to further feed the card 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.530
 the battlefield 4 promotion is 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.470
 edition goes to 2004 and here comes the 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:01.280
 instructions to get the game 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:04.280
 although I think that by now it is 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.860
 fire closed the delivery of these 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.340
 video games that came free with the 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:14.810
 290 cards finally a cable comes 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.810
 hdmi inside of what we have in 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.709
 the accessories and let's look at the 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.709
 card as such 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.150
 here we have the card this is like the 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.800
 version 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.370
 so to speak, standard uses the 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:38.580
 dissipator the dissipator very similar to the 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.420
 3 stoke sink that put md to 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.060
 this card and 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:48.430
 is a is a heatsink that only keeps 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:51.879
 a fan in the back 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.260
 what I have read is that this card to 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:56.980
 despite having a very good performance 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.319
 it's pretty pretty noisy and that 's 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.150
 something that you have to take into account the 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.150
 time to choose the one you have the best 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.400
 price / performance ratio in the range 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.700
 high but 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.980
 is this version that comes from stock them 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.680
 is going to make noise suddenly if that is a 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.079
 something important for you is better to go 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.449
 for a model that has for example in 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.820
 sa fire we find the ex try that comes 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:26.300
 in three fans 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.330
 in asus we find the manager 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.340
 and different heatsinks that use 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.430
 the manufacturers to improve the 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.500
 cooling and lower the noise level 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:42.100
 here we have the output ports two 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:45.810
 dvi and displayport and in half a hdmi 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.360
 the connections 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:52.800
 for the power source the two pci 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:56.190
 express we have a pci-express of 6 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:01.050
 pins in this part and we have a 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:03.860
 pci-express of 8 pins in this in this 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:08.730
 other side the system requirements 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:11.310
 you need a power source of 750 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.620
 watts 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.270
 it has to be obviously real is this 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.950
 card can consume 300 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.230
 watts alone 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:24.040
 and if we are already talking about crossfire 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:28.090
 with several cards we would have to look 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.830
 power sources already 1000 1200 watts 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.300
 depending on the arrangement that is 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:39.210
 doing then 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:42.419
 good 4gb memory works at 5000 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:46.289
 megahertz is a bandwidth of 512 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:49.650
 bits has an incredible bandwidth 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:51.860
 this the transfer of data from the 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:55.979
 memory of this is renewed so much nador 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:59.460
 92 90 x is extraordinary thanks to those 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:02.669
 512 bits so it's also very good 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.770
 card for the professional part for 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:07.680
 rendering and all this for that width of 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:12.150
 band ready that was all that was the 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:14.490
 radio r 9 290 of scam with the 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.069
 stock fan I hope you have them 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.750
 liked the video that you like the channel 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:21.090
 and if you have not subscribed yet please 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.979
 subscribe see you in the next let 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:26.039
 your comments about this card or 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:28.610
 other cards where they are 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:28.610
 interested
