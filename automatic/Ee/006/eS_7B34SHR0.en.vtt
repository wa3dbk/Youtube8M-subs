00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.610
 paul strand 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.600
 and the installation folder will appear 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.600
 the program grows 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.170
 how do you see friends 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.170

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.930
 all right 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:30.049
 since the installation of the 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:31.980
 soloist saint james and the second that 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:36.180
 we were driving 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:41.050
 Scotland which we manage the cold habal 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:45.010
 and here we give Greece whatever 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:47.550
 they almost give me here and they're going to ask 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:51.330
 same as win to sadam 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.330
 they already have it 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.450
 then very well that we already have everything 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.990
 this all programmed 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:05.090
 let's download magic 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:08.030

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:13.030
 normal as if I had a writer 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.030

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.370
 but for 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.050
 well 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.720
 with the 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.950
 I bet this is the charge of rage 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:10.590
 so I better go 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.590
 my internet is very low 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.470

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:24.230
