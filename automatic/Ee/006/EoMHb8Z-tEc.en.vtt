jack<00:04:20.720> the<00:04:21.440> lanyard<00:04:21.830> hole<00:04:22.100> on<00:04:22.550> the<00:04:23.060> left<00:04:23.300> side

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
jack the lanyard hole on the left side

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.340 
jack the lanyard hole on the left side
and<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:24.500> volume<00:04:25.100> rocker<00:04:25.310> here

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
and the volume rocker here

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.550 
and the volume rocker here
so<00:04:27.350> that's<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:28.010> Samsung<00:04:28.640> Galaxy<00:04:28.790> S<00:04:29.390> duos<00:04:29.780> 2<00:04:30.290> on

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
so that's the Samsung Galaxy S duos 2 on

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.650 
so that's the Samsung Galaxy S duos 2 on
the<00:04:30.860> sides<00:04:31.130> and<00:04:31.400> the<00:04:31.490> front<00:04:31.520> over<00:04:32.180> the<00:04:32.300> back

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
the sides and the front over the back

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.320 
the sides and the front over the back
you<00:04:32.900> have<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.340> 5<00:04:34.340> megapixel<00:04:34.520> camera<00:04:34.850> the

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
you have the 5 megapixel camera the

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.450 
you have the 5 megapixel camera the
single<00:04:35.630> LED<00:04:35.960> flash<00:04:35.990> and<00:04:36.410> the<00:04:36.650> speaker<00:04:36.680> and<00:04:37.190> the

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
single LED flash and the speaker and the

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:43.950 
single LED flash and the speaker and the
Samsung<00:04:37.940> logo<00:04:38.120> let's<00:04:38.930> quickly<00:04:39.230> open<00:04:39.710> this<00:04:39.830> up

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.350 

so<00:04:44.960> over<00:04:45.800> at<00:04:45.890> the<00:04:45.980> back<00:04:46.130> you<00:04:46.400> can<00:04:46.550> see<00:04:46.760> that<00:04:46.790> it

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
so over at the back you can see that it

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.590 
so over at the back you can see that it
has<00:04:47.440> two<00:04:48.440> SIM<00:04:48.680> card<00:04:48.950> slots<00:04:49.280> stacked<00:04:49.940> on<00:04:50.180> top<00:04:50.240> of

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
has two SIM card slots stacked on top of

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.650 
has two SIM card slots stacked on top of
each<00:04:50.870> other<00:04:51.080> so<00:04:51.350> you<00:04:51.800> can<00:04:52.210> insert<00:04:53.210> two<00:04:53.450> SIM

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
each other so you can insert two SIM

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.070 
each other so you can insert two SIM
cards<00:04:53.990> here<00:04:54.290> and<00:04:55.280> of<00:04:55.640> course<00:04:55.730> you<00:04:56.360> already<00:04:56.870> saw

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
cards here and of course you already saw

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.730 
cards here and of course you already saw
the<00:04:57.110> micro<00:04:57.560> SD<00:04:57.830> card<00:04:58.010> slot<00:04:58.070> on<00:04:58.490> the<00:04:58.520> side<00:04:58.640> here

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
the micro SD card slot on the side here

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.070 
the micro SD card slot on the side here
so<00:05:00.740> that's<00:05:01.010> the<00:05:01.250> back<00:05:01.520> and<00:05:01.790> the<00:05:02.240> insides<00:05:02.780> of

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
new matte plastic back on the Samsung

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.820 
new matte plastic back on the Samsung
here<00:05:30.760> it's<00:05:31.760> quickly<00:05:32.360> set<00:05:32.930> this<00:05:33.080> up<00:05:33.290> you<00:05:33.650> can

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
here it's quickly set this up you can

here it's quickly set this up you can
hear<00:05:33.980> the<00:05:34.160> bloop<00:05:34.400> bloop<00:05:34.610> sounds<00:05:35.060> there<00:05:35.270> so

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
hear the bloop bloop sounds there so

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.810 
hear the bloop bloop sounds there so
quickly<00:05:36.470> letting<00:05:37.340> you<00:05:37.430> know<00:05:37.550> what<00:05:37.790> the

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
quickly letting you know what the

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.680 
quickly letting you know what the
differences<00:05:38.450> are<00:05:38.660> between<00:05:38.690> this<00:05:39.290> and<00:05:39.530> the

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
differences are between this and the

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.010 
differences are between this and the
Samsung<00:05:41.690> Galaxy<00:05:41.810> S<00:05:42.290> duos<00:05:42.560> of<00:05:43.010> the<00:05:43.780> last<00:05:44.780> year

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
Samsung Galaxy S duos of the last year

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.270 
Samsung Galaxy S duos of the last year
so<00:05:45.650> this<00:05:45.920> one<00:05:46.190> has<00:05:46.760> extra<00:05:47.420> RAM<00:05:47.800> 768<00:05:48.800> MB<00:05:49.070> of<00:05:49.100> RAM

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
so this one has extra RAM 768 MB of RAM

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.880 
so this one has extra RAM 768 MB of RAM
and<00:05:49.640> it<00:05:50.420> has<00:05:50.600> an<00:05:50.780> upgraded<00:05:51.170> processor<00:05:51.380> there's

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:53.890 
and it has an upgraded processor there's

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.800 
and it has an upgraded processor there's
1.2<00:05:54.890> gigahertz<00:05:55.220> 200<00:05:55.940> megahertz<00:05:56.210> increase

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
1.2 gigahertz 200 megahertz increase

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.470 
1.2 gigahertz 200 megahertz increase
than<00:05:57.350> before<00:05:58.060> previously<00:05:59.060> it<00:05:59.120> was<00:05:59.240> 1

00:05:59.470 --> 00:05:59.480 
than before previously it was 1

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.330 
than before previously it was 1
gigahertz<00:05:59.720> processor<00:05:59.930> but<00:06:00.650> that's<00:06:01.040> about<00:06:01.280> it

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
gigahertz processor but that's about it

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.180 
gigahertz processor but that's about it
nothing<00:06:01.790> much<00:06:02.120> else<00:06:02.450> the<00:06:03.140> memory<00:06:03.650> card<00:06:03.860> can

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
nothing much else the memory card can

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.540 
nothing much else the memory card can
now<00:06:04.430> accommodate<00:06:05.320> 64<00:06:06.320> gigabytes<00:06:06.710> of<00:06:07.010> data

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
now accommodate 64 gigabytes of data

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.390 
now accommodate 64 gigabytes of data
before<00:06:08.090> it<00:06:08.330> used<00:06:08.720> to<00:06:08.900> be<00:06:08.990> 32<00:06:09.440> gigabytes<00:06:09.830> so

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
before it used to be 32 gigabytes so

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.760 
before it used to be 32 gigabytes so
that's<00:06:10.640> the<00:06:10.880> major<00:06:11.060> changes<00:06:11.750> in<00:06:11.990> terms<00:06:12.590> of

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
that's the major changes in terms of

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.310 
that's the major changes in terms of
hardware<00:06:13.100> in<00:06:13.430> terms<00:06:13.700> of<00:06:13.880> software<00:06:14.150> you<00:06:15.110> can

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
hardware in terms of software you can

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.790 
hardware in terms of software you can
note<00:06:16.010> in<00:06:16.790> a<00:06:16.910> moment<00:06:17.270> that<00:06:17.720> it<00:06:18.020> runs<00:06:18.230> on<00:06:18.440> Android

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800
