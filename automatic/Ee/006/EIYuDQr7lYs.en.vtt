 it plays both in historical terms and 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.369
 infrastructures for the city of Milan 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.890
 it is an imposing structure la 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.630
 larger than the type in Italy starts at 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.460
 being operational in the 30's was 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.160
 realized within a larger one 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.800
 arrangement reorganization plan 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.500
 Milan railway for these 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.990
 two days on this facility are 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.060
 more than thirty historic locomotives have flowed 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.460
 that belong to the historical register of 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.470
 fs Italian and trenord the visit 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.920
 inside the system also allows 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.900
 to understand how these vehicles come 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.250
 maintained in order and restored by care 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.500
 of a series of associations of 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.530
 volunteers who in collaboration with 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.720
 Trenitalia 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.250
 within this structure it exercises 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.560
 a series of operations on the locomotives 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.760
 just to keep them and bring them back like this 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.760
 as they were originally 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.649
 the milan notables association 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.119
 sorting and does its job 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.950
 inside the garage in flood 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.720
 collaboration with the cardo structure 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.660
 trenitalia which physically manages 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.070
 the plant in this period is work on 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.440
 what is called the restoration of 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.680
 free effectively or is the team 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.380
 which puts the exterior back in order 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.400
 so not only painting but also 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.100
 grouting work from body shops in 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.300
 practice on locomotive linings 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.040
 to bring them back to their former glory 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.830
 in the historical aspect they could have 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.959
 a few decades ago the gem is not missing 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.480
 the jewel that the recovery of a 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.270
 835 series steam locomotive 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.820
 we are using as a kind of 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.320
 our demonstration yard and on which by 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.970
 many years working for recovery 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.920
 structural the functional recovery coupe 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.780
 and this is our jewel that 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.310
 we hope with difficulty with collection of 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.350
 funding can circulate again 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.610
 because here there was a time in this 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.610
 stop as a shunting locomotive 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.459
 we talked about the workshop but the 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.930
 day you go on you go out you arrive 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.819
 in the platform space of the 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.959
 roundabout which is particular because at the 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.519
 best moment for fans 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.360
 of the railway but also for families 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:18.060
 children a series of dozens of 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.310
 historic machines that are 60 70 years old 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.069
 a series of steam locomotives the 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.290
 our 625 percent Italian machines 38 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.140
 80 the smallest machine for tents 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.629
 at 685 which is la reggina then there is the 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.700
 br50 that with its massive grandeur 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.859
 brings us back to the German machines that 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.590
 they were the protagonists of a story 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.129
 of railway in europe good bit of 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.840
 decades ago 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.060
 this morning the little one arrived 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.190
 north that in addition to ours 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.109
 Italians served to make these runs 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.000
 which lead to the joy of all 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:50.129
 some old carriages from the parking lot 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.379
 entry to a service track 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.909
 inside forward back to try 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.970
 the thrill of a journey by train a 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:55.970
 vapor 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.370
 the roundabout was the 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.180
 stage of this heritage 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.800
 historical to which the railways hold 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.350
 they keep it because it is the living testimony 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.740
 of an uninterrupted technical evolution 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:37.830
 which led from the littorina to the tr 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:41.850
 1000 which will operate from 2014 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:44.970
 the railways have put in the right place 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.430
 the historical heritage of the people 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.640
 Italian because it describes the evolution 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:53.070
 of the company and will soon place it 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.220
 in a foundation that was established 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.590
 March 6 and the railway foundation 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.190
 of the Italian state that will serve the purpose 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.610
 precise to preserve intact and 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:09.510
 deliver to future generations 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:12.060
 locomotives carriages facilities they have 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:15.710
 crossed by the Alps up to 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.710
 sicily our beautiful country
