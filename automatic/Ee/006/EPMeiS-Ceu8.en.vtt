fat<00:00:42.000> string<00:00:42.559> down<00:00:43.559> two<00:00:44.550> frets<00:00:47.030> now<00:00:48.030> we<00:00:48.090> can

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
fat string down two frets now we can

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.630 
fat string down two frets now we can
check<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.719> against<00:00:49.199> the<00:00:49.260> third<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.160> fourth

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
check it against the third the fourth

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.020 
check it against the third the fourth
string<00:00:50.910> because<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.239> count<00:00:51.449> from<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.629> bottom

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030

now<00:01:09.420> I'm<00:01:09.630> going<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.870> make<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.799> first<00:01:11.040> string

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
now I'm going to make the first string

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.200 
now I'm going to make the first string
sound<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.790> same

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
so I identified about three strings and

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.960 
so I identified about three strings and
they're<00:01:23.310> already

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
they're already

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
now I'm going to make a second string to

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:42.399 
now I'm going to make a second string to
phrase<00:01:35.510> down<00:01:35.720> as<00:01:35.960> well

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.859 

which<00:01:42.979> actually<00:01:43.549> become<00:01:43.880> more<00:01:44.360> than<00:01:44.539> being<00:01:44.750> a

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
which actually become more than being a

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.499 
which actually become more than being a
baby<00:01:45.250> just<00:01:46.250> be<00:01:46.430> coming<00:01:46.759> back<00:01:49.119> now<00:01:50.119> I'm<00:01:50.390> gonna

baby just be coming back now I'm gonna

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.950 
baby just be coming back now I'm gonna
make<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:51.649> search<00:01:51.860> string<00:01:53.530> one

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.660 

so<00:01:57.960> what<00:01:58.110> I've<00:01:58.200> actually<00:01:58.350> done<00:01:58.590> I've<00:01:59.460> tuned

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
play the slide with the rhythm so really

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.090 
play the slide with the rhythm so really
you<00:02:33.540> need<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.780> keep<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.080> rhythm<00:02:34.230> going<00:02:34.380> while

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
you need to keep the rhythm going while

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.400 
you need to keep the rhythm going while
you're<00:02:35.250> playing<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.640> slide<00:02:35.880> so<00:02:36.840> fragments

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
you're playing the slide so fragments

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:48.500 
you're playing the slide so fragments
sake<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:38.130> got<00:02:38.310> rhythms<00:02:38.670> like<00:02:47.090> then<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.180> go<00:02:48.450> to

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
sake you got rhythms like then you go to

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.720 
sake you got rhythms like then you go to
the<00:02:48.750> fifth<00:02:48.930> fret<00:02:49.100> but<00:02:50.100> your<00:02:50.220> whole<00:02:50.310> finger

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
the fifth fret but your whole finger

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.530 
the fifth fret but your whole finger
across<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:53.190> have<00:02:53.520> a<00:02:53.550> on<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.209> second

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
across it and have a on the second

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:03.890 
across it and have a on the second
string<00:02:58.190> back<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.220> open

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:17.570 

number<00:03:04.799> seven<00:03:05.159> fret<00:03:09.409> back<00:03:10.409> slope<00:03:15.110> right<00:03:16.580> so

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
number seven fret back slope right so

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.539 
number seven fret back slope right so
now<00:03:17.760> then<00:03:18.000> we<00:03:18.269> can<00:03:18.390> get<00:03:18.510> slide<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.980> we<00:03:23.400> can

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
now then we can get slide and we can

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:24.930 
now then we can get slide and we can
keep<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.849> rhythm<00:03:24.000> going

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
keep the rhythm going

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:42.580 
keep the rhythm going
