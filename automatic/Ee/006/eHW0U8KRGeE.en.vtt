 they should start in the Eifel 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.680
 but first of all glad that we are there this year 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.849
 That also means that his most important thing starts again 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.149
 "We will have a very nice winter in Germany 

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:16.689
 Euro and are now very happy that it starts 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.220
 of course with the Meyer 9 squad that we thrown here at the ring and 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.989
 into fire 8 2 6 4 and the programs - vehicles 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.449
 if you like 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.060
 Last year you are happy when it's over 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.840
 Niklas Wangler lowers the lower court

 the weather conditions in Brenos closely thank you I say 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.110
 Of course that is very different because there 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.020
 but that's nice 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.130
 Absolute Motorsport Friz everything about the here are and I like that too 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.130
 dogged respect for us said okay 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.070
 Maybe this personal track is no longer in demand all over 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.220
 opposite 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.050
 just like Leader last year, now working hand in hand with the 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.410
 relatively small cut since we have everything under control 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.520
 or three words «super type» 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.200
 the long distance above defaults stood out that they completely 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.160
 there are special trends but we have to be quite blue so that 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.450
 Super 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.240
 after the long winter sports clubs against Pooth and the starting field that 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.240
 first in the time race of the 2010 season 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.430
 in addition to many well-known faces in the pit lane when the countless 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.980
 Battles windows 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.980
 Vehicles like never before wondered » 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.210
 first time in combat 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.820
 offered with it 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.820

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.650
 Tip the teams from Kellberg 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.080
 "Just sit and have a beer 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.230

 and celebrate the best time in training almost like a small overall victory yes I am 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.570
 I simply drove on the neck all the time 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.979
 I just want to be overjoyed that in the end it will even be the consequences of 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.060
 Feuers is still staying that way 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.539
 Israel practiced percent cheaper to 40 percent 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.649
 The amount will be reported as an incredible case over the budget 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:17.139
 But we are not one hundred percent involved in everything and every goal counts 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:20.980
 and to leave it all up or Johannes Rupprechter super riots 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:24.859
 May still cold Eifel conditions has come the long awaited 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.859

 Beckstein numerous visitors to the track with every minute the Danes 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.829
 he proved 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.979
 then it is one 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:10.519
 a field of 163 gt and touring cars against the four hours hard over the 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.439
 Nordschleife 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:16.439
 he looks at worlds 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:21.009
 and avoid their risks behind it 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.009
 the shortage on the 7th 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.369
 already at the beginning of the second round, he must pay attention Yukon market 

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:33.369
 in experienced 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:37.349
 2003 supercup winner Frank Stippler 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.349
 dominated from now on 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.759
 not only excited at the top of the field 

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:50.239
 exciting positional battles 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.669
 also in the over 30 different classes of calendars 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:56.669
 the first run is also a new stand 

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:05.939
 After two and a half hours, Stückler suffered what can be thought of was in 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.349
 Leadership lying a technical defect 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.359
 but the ETA have another iron in the fire 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:15.469
 the long-distance specialist manually per year and twice the topics as 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:18.209
 Masked Ekström take the lead 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.489
 but for a long time they should not enjoy the first position 

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:28.059
 not least the box-stop strategy with countless long-hauls 

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:31.829
 It is at the end of the battles filed to the Russian woman 

00:04:31.829 --> 00:04:33.590
 first wm-run 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.590
 which again sets the tipping on the scales 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.650
 behind the Porsche, the remaining car comes to the finish 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.909
 BMW can 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:48.270
 Ulan also on a podium finish 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.270

 but we know where we just vote ballot is completely new car 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.120
 All in all a bit of a dad was a welder you never bask 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.430
 Super and there are no technical problems, the game ever for the car and 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.129
 that we have won and also been more in third place 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:22.409
 Sailing is satisfied 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:27.239
 Hornungs but that you want the Travelstar 42 percent off right there 

00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:30.389
 Power steering, or indeed a supply line of the way 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:34.489
 so call for a very early closing time for all you are now very Rome 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.940
 Aladag also to see something who will of course accompanied with everything 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.120
