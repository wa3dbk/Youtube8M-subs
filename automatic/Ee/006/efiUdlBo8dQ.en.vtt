00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
difficulties defending corners are

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.230 
difficulties defending corners are

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:19.040 
first I will show you a video where I

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.340 
first I will show you a video where I
defend<00:00:19.460> a<00:00:19.550> corner<00:00:19.940> and<00:00:20.120> then<00:00:20.660> I<00:00:20.690> will<00:00:20.960> split<00:00:21.140> it

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
defend a corner and then I will split it

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.170 
defend a corner and then I will split it
into<00:00:21.530> three<00:00:21.650> parts<00:00:22.040> and<00:00:22.400> show<00:00:22.820> you<00:00:22.880> what

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
into three parts and show you what

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.400 
into three parts and show you what
exactly<00:00:23.660> you<00:00:23.810> have<00:00:23.960> to<00:00:24.140> do<00:00:24.290> at<00:00:24.590> which<00:00:25.040> time<00:00:25.369> in

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
exactly you have to do at which time in

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.170 
exactly you have to do at which time in
this<00:00:27.410> clip<00:00:27.680> you<00:00:27.860> can<00:00:27.920> see<00:00:28.279> how<00:00:28.490> I<00:00:28.520> defender<00:00:29.060> the

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
this clip you can see how I defender the

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.650 
this clip you can see how I defender the
corner<00:00:29.570> here<00:00:30.470> my<00:00:30.680> defender<00:00:31.130> gets<00:00:31.340> up<00:00:31.580> ads<00:00:31.970> the

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
corner here my defender gets up ads the

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.940 
corner here my defender gets up ads the
ball<00:00:32.840> out<00:00:33.080> and<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:33.860> situation<00:00:34.460> is<00:00:34.610> cleared

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.820 

so<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:38.000> first<00:00:38.270> thing<00:00:38.390> you<00:00:38.690> have<00:00:38.720> to<00:00:38.900> do<00:00:39.170> is<00:00:39.380> to

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:39.830 
so the first thing you have to do is to

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.060 
so the first thing you have to do is to
get<00:00:39.980> in<00:00:40.160> front<00:00:40.400> of<00:00:40.610> the<00:00:40.760> attacker<00:00:41.120> and<00:00:41.890> at<00:00:42.890> this

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
get in front of the attacker and at this

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.180 
get in front of the attacker and at this
clip<00:00:43.370> you<00:00:43.820> can<00:00:43.880> see<00:00:44.270> how<00:00:44.480> my<00:00:44.630> defender<00:00:45.140> gets<00:00:45.920> to

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
clip you can see how my defender gets to

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.790 
clip you can see how my defender gets to
the<00:00:46.310> attacker<00:00:46.670> so<00:00:47.360> that<00:00:47.600> he<00:00:47.960> is<00:00:48.170> in<00:00:48.350> front<00:00:48.590> of

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
the attacker so that he is in front of

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.569 
the attacker so that he is in front of
him<00:00:48.980> or<00:00:49.160> the<00:00:49.730> ball

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
him or the ball

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.119 
him or the ball
the<00:00:52.420> second<00:00:52.780> step<00:00:52.989> is<00:00:53.199> that<00:00:53.440> you<00:00:53.589> have<00:00:53.739> to<00:00:53.769> stay

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
the second step is that you have to stay

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.639 
the second step is that you have to stay
in<00:00:54.309> front<00:00:54.550> of<00:00:54.760> him<00:00:54.940> when<00:00:55.839> the<00:00:55.960> ball<00:00:56.170> is<00:00:56.199> in<00:00:56.379> the

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
in front of him when the ball is in the

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:59.219 
in front of him when the ball is in the
air<00:00:56.679> and<00:00:57.039> you<00:00:57.609> should<00:00:57.789> also<00:00:57.969> try<00:00:58.239> to<00:00:58.750> get<00:00:59.019> to

00:00:59.219 --> 00:00:59.229 
air and you should also try to get to

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:01.289 
air and you should also try to get to
the<00:00:59.350> yellow<00:00:59.620> mark<00:00:59.890> which<00:01:00.489> indicates<00:01:01.030> where

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:01.299 
the yellow mark which indicates where

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:05.369 
the yellow mark which indicates where
the<00:01:01.329> ball<00:01:01.570> will<00:01:01.750> go

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.889 

and<00:01:06.369> finally<00:01:07.030> you<00:01:07.210> will<00:01:07.329> have<00:01:07.509> to<00:01:07.659> press

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
and finally you will have to press

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:10.740 
and finally you will have to press
either<00:01:08.140> X<00:01:08.590> or<00:01:08.740> a<00:01:08.920> to<00:01:09.729> hit<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:10.030> ball<00:01:10.149> out<00:01:10.360> of<00:01:10.450> the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
either X or a to hit the ball out of the

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:20.210 
either X or a to hit the ball out of the
penalty<00:01:10.960> room<00:01:11.380> and<00:01:11.590> clear<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:12.070> situation

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.360 

you

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.970 

so<00:01:22.970> to<00:01:23.060> recap<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.900> most<00:01:24.110> important<00:01:24.590> thing<00:01:24.770> is

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
so to recap the most important thing is

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.280 
so to recap the most important thing is
the<00:01:25.160> correct<00:01:25.520> positioning<00:01:26.120> so<00:01:26.750> that<00:01:26.930> you<00:01:27.080> stay

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
the correct positioning so that you stay

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.500 
the correct positioning so that you stay
in<00:01:27.470> front<00:01:27.710> of<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.070> attacker<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:28.700> have<00:01:29.330> the

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
in front of the attacker and have the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.830 
in front of the attacker and have the
chance<00:01:29.780> to<00:01:30.020> head<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.500> ball<00:01:30.530> out<00:01:31.690> but<00:01:32.690> of

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
chance to head the ball out but of

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.650 
chance to head the ball out but of
course<00:01:33.140> you<00:01:33.230> can't<00:01:33.560> defend<00:01:33.860> all<00:01:34.100> headers

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
course you can't defend all headers

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.540 
course you can't defend all headers
because<00:01:35.660> in<00:01:35.840> some<00:01:36.050> situations<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:37.190> attacker

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
because in some situations the attacker

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.910 
because in some situations the attacker
might<00:01:37.970> be<00:01:38.180> a<00:01:38.210> much<00:01:38.450> better<00:01:38.480> header<00:01:39.020> or<00:01:39.440> just

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
might be a much better header or just

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.060 
might be a much better header or just
much<00:01:40.130> taller<00:01:40.460> than<00:01:40.700> you

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
much taller than you

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.550 
much taller than you
but<00:01:43.030> with<00:01:43.210> some<00:01:43.450> practice<00:01:43.600> you<00:01:44.050> can<00:01:44.200> highly

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
but with some practice you can highly

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.710 
but with some practice you can highly
reduce<00:01:44.890> their<00:01:45.460> heading<00:01:45.760> goals<00:01:46.000> you<00:01:46.270> receive

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
reduce their heading goals you receive

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.469 
reduce their heading goals you receive
and<00:01:46.990> as<00:01:47.830> a<00:01:47.860> special<00:01:48.100> trip<00:01:48.580> i'll<00:01:48.790> show<00:01:49.090> you<00:01:49.150> in

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.690 
and as a special trip i'll show you in
this<00:01:49.630> clip<00:01:49.930> or<00:01:50.110> you<00:01:50.530> can<00:01:50.740> defend<00:01:51.040> corners<00:01:51.490> more
