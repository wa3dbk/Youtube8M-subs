00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
the lid a little bit but you go to as

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.610 
the lid a little bit but you go to as
far<00:01:24.860> as<00:01:25.159> possible<00:01:25.670> and<00:01:25.909> just<00:01:25.970> lightly<00:01:26.600> as<00:01:27.140> thin

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
strokes and just do it as much as you

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.500 
strokes and just do it as much as you
can<00:01:33.710> control<00:01:34.190> it<00:01:34.400> and<00:01:34.640> then<00:01:34.850> you<00:01:35.120> know<00:01:35.240> you<00:01:35.330> can

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
can control it and then you know you can

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.789 
can control it and then you know you can
stop<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:36.049> then<00:01:36.170> start<00:01:36.890> again<00:01:38.229> so<00:01:39.229> I<00:01:39.260> just<00:01:39.620> do

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
stop and then start again so I just do

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.450 
stop and then start again so I just do
short<00:01:40.430> strokes

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.210 

and<00:01:46.460> I<00:01:47.030> get<00:01:47.270> thicker<00:01:47.890> as<00:01:49.240> I<00:01:50.240> come<00:01:50.480> across<00:01:51.220> but

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
and I get thicker as I come across but

00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:08.190 
and I get thicker as I come across but
not<00:01:52.460> too<00:01:52.790> much<00:01:52.820> just<00:01:53.060> gradually<00:01:53.950> get<00:01:54.950> thicker

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.380 

so<00:02:08.830> if<00:02:08.950> I<00:02:09.069> just<00:02:09.250> want<00:02:09.429> something<00:02:09.610> basic<00:02:10.179> that

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
so if I just want something basic that

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.360 
so if I just want something basic that
it<00:02:10.539> will<00:02:10.690> look<00:02:10.869> like<00:02:10.899> this<00:02:11.260> so<00:02:11.860> if<00:02:12.069> I<00:02:12.160> want<00:02:12.340> to

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
it will look like this so if I want to

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.250 
it will look like this so if I want to
wing<00:02:12.550> it<00:02:12.580> out<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.819> little<00:02:13.060> bit<00:02:13.180> like<00:02:13.330> this<00:02:13.540> the

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
wing it out a little bit like this the

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.750 
wing it out a little bit like this the
markers<00:02:14.620> are<00:02:14.800> really<00:02:15.099> good<00:02:15.310> for<00:02:15.459> that<00:02:15.580> because

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
markers are really good for that because

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.150 
markers are really good for that because
it's<00:02:16.060> really<00:02:16.360> easy<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.720> just<00:02:17.019> do<00:02:17.230> it<00:02:17.410> I<00:02:17.590> don't

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
it's really easy to just do it I don't

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.740 
it's really easy to just do it I don't
like<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.489> know<00:02:18.610> draw<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:18.940> line<00:02:19.180> out<00:02:19.360> and<00:02:19.599> then<00:02:19.720> a

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
like you know draw a line out and then a

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.259 
like you know draw a line out and then a
triangle<00:02:20.260> back<00:02:20.379> in<00:02:20.620> or<00:02:21.069> do<00:02:21.640> anything<00:02:21.940> fancy

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
triangle back in or do anything fancy

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.229 
triangle back in or do anything fancy
with<00:02:22.480> it<00:02:22.720> as<00:02:22.870> seriously<00:02:23.410> just<00:02:24.060> swooped<00:02:25.060> out

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
with it as seriously just swooped out

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.479 
with it as seriously just swooped out
and<00:02:25.630> I<00:02:26.230> think<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.530> marker<00:02:26.800> makes<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.130> easier

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
and I think the marker makes it easier

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.440 
and I think the marker makes it easier
because<00:02:27.790> i<00:02:27.940> know<00:02:28.060> sometimes<00:02:28.420> with<00:02:29.130> liquid<00:02:30.130> and

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
because i know sometimes with liquid and

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.699 
because i know sometimes with liquid and
pencils<00:02:31.450> it<00:02:31.720> just<00:02:31.900> makes<00:02:32.080> it<00:02:32.200> kind<00:02:32.440> of<00:02:32.500> thick

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
pencils it just makes it kind of thick

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.699 
pencils it just makes it kind of thick
and<00:02:32.920> gross<00:02:33.069> looking<00:02:33.400> so<00:02:34.330> for<00:02:35.080> me<00:02:35.200> this<00:02:35.440> works

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
and gross looking so for me this works

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.140 
and gross looking so for me this works
really<00:02:35.830> well<00:02:36.299> and<00:02:37.299> I<00:02:37.420> just<00:02:37.599> take<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:38.819> and<00:02:39.819> just

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
really well and I just take it and just

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:56.660 
really well and I just take it and just
kind<00:02:40.989> of<00:02:41.080> draw<00:02:41.230> it<00:02:41.349> out<00:02:41.440> like<00:02:41.680> that

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.670 

okay<00:02:57.450> so<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.959> will<00:02:58.080> look<00:02:58.110> something<00:02:58.349> like<00:02:58.530> this

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
okay so it will look something like this

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.309 
okay so it will look something like this
and<00:03:01.790> it's<00:03:02.790> pretty<00:03:02.970> simple<00:03:03.330> to<00:03:03.599> do<00:03:03.750> if<00:03:03.989> you<00:03:04.140> like

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
and it's pretty simple to do if you like

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.140 
and it's pretty simple to do if you like
practice<00:03:04.800> a<00:03:04.920> while<00:03:05.069> if<00:03:05.700> it's<00:03:05.910> kind<00:03:06.120> of

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
practice a while if it's kind of

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.610 
practice a while if it's kind of
difficult<00:03:06.330> at<00:03:06.569> first<00:03:06.599> just<00:03:06.989> get<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.200> marker<00:03:07.590> and

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
difficult at first just get a marker and

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.250 
difficult at first just get a marker and
do<00:03:07.980> some<00:03:08.160> practicing<00:03:08.700> like<00:03:08.940> get<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.599> cheap

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
do some practicing like get a a cheap

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.010 
do some practicing like get a a cheap
marker<00:03:10.620> eyeliner<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.550> do<00:03:12.450> some<00:03:12.630> practicing

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
marker eyeliner and do some practicing

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.110 
marker eyeliner and do some practicing
with<00:03:13.170> it<00:03:13.319> and<00:03:13.530> after<00:03:14.520> a<00:03:14.550> while<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:14.940> should

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
with it and after a while it should

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.729 
with it and after a while it should
become<00:03:15.360> a<00:03:15.390> lot<00:03:15.630> simpler<00:03:16.020> she'll<00:03:16.500> get<00:03:16.620> more

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
become a lot simpler she'll get more

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.890 
become a lot simpler she'll get more
used<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.069> doing<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.610> and<00:03:17.819> I<00:03:18.300> find<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:18.600> this<00:03:18.720> is

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
used to doing it and I find it this is

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.510 
used to doing it and I find it this is
probably<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.230> easiest<00:03:19.290> way<00:03:19.800> for<00:03:19.830> me<00:03:20.069> to<00:03:20.160> do<00:03:20.370> it

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
probably the easiest way for me to do it

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.880 
probably the easiest way for me to do it
and<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.880> bottom<00:03:21.180> have<00:03:21.300> already<00:03:21.540> got<00:03:21.890> my
