 Where is it You're the country was made anywhere in 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:27.700
 Who is the United States of America is a dairy company 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:33.940
 So adverse effects of the vaccine for 5 Facilities 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:34.750
 That big problem but it was another of today's theme but is Kotonan of milk 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:42.370
 so 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:45.280
 America is a country called Japan but was found in the war won in the war in Japan 1945 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:50.800
 How good a country compared to the United States 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:54.740
 Toka MacArthur fact that one nation that the Japanese were superior to or than Americans 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:01:02.180
 Roosevelt's 1945 stage of 1955 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:06.770
 It is not know this time the Japan of the excellent and culture is going to use also the second of the Pearl Harbor attack is received 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.600
 It may come to receive a gallery To do it, it is necessary to deteriorate the Japanese 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.710
 should not 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:16.040
 That was helps the most in terms of deteriorating 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:22.190
 My eldest son is a mother-child notebook for 1,900 yen 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:25.430
 National Dairy Council is made to the United States in 15 people 15 years 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:30.110
 The government and the dairy industry are in conflict 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:36.590
 That in 1930 in order to spread it 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:39.980
 Maternal and Child's notebook do dairy company has made does not the United States government made 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:46.370
 So that when it won the war for 30 years 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:52.610
 From 1915 to 45, so many diseases spread to the US 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:55.460
 The mother-to-child notebook that failed in the United States is to degrade the Japanese people also ethnicity began to deteriorate 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.460
 That the mom it is sufficient used in Japanese 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.820
 1900 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.420
 I'm using still from 45 years 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:10.380
 Because it is the American one, what was written in English 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:16.450
 Battle ãƒ¼ I've been opening Japanese after Showa 23, and I've been using Japanese for 70 years. 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:19.569
 The other this is in the United States been discarded a long time ago and is not suitable for child care 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:25.420
 It is only Japan that uses such voices 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:31.239
 I am sorry to say long, but it will take many years to the end of the Maternal and Child Handbook at that time 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:35.010
 Showa you know if to see the end of the use is to have maternity passbook from 23 years

 It is written that you should do this kind of vaccination 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:43.349
 We have not been vaccinated in Japan until 1955 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:48.959
 The root cause is 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:50.400
 The fact that I'm in the mother-to-child notebook everyone's who is firmly know to tell it to the children and grandchildren 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.950
