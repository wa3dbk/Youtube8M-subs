00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:31.500
 First, because I can let the rest 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.649
 First of all, I'm one 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.180

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.750

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.930
 fact is already in the first year rkz whole 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.930
 exactly 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:21.000
 flank the down to load 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:29.380

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:31.210
 maybe the sauna and little 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:37.530
 assume that this is pretty loud 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:40.959
 and now I have done 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.049
 What should I change? I have it 

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:47.189
 That's why I'll leave it alone first 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.189
 span my made 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.509
 I have for a long time it looks already 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.950
 pretty good and there the double 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:09.369
 feature now rather in the direction 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:16.030
 Again, going to quarters happens to me 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:19.379
 but pretty good, what 's up now 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.379
 There is something down here actually 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.360
 the thing is going to blow up 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.190
 with opened again normally 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.190

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.960

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.769

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.329
 Conclusion is really up you have to 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.329

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.939
 steal 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.810
 the opponent 

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:04.749
 Ducking is still somewhere else 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:13.030

 stormy to the back of shit say 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.500

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:54.800

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.770
 last garbage so no fast now what 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:05.600
 I have to change here was that you feed 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:09.850
 I would like to print as expected 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.850
 that women here 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:19.060

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:24.250

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.250

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:31.810

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:34.720
 that we're running down here again 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.580
 long will be the control for 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.760
 between picture carrier anna wolf here 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.110
 easy and over 100 ps I get what 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.270
 Of course, pretty cool that further 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:48.640
 already much better to be optimized 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:51.040
 Battlefield 4 then like that 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.000
 of course, in the final version is the 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.480
 is always another time 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.480
 question 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.340

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:16.600
 okay you have to go back to the first 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.040
 been all that I have so high I 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.440
 i do not always play battlefield that 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.860
 all low because then less 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:26.130
 Lighting effects often just 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.520
 annoy 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:33.900
 the lazy is still 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.900
 it is probably set directly 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.730
 I am the mastermind 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:51.340
 That's why I have a switch now 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.340

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:02.870

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:14.080
 Shit again from behind her 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:23.960
 I have that now somehow 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:24.530

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.040
 nobody 

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:35.120
 I'll put it here so I never 

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:38.690
 I'll get there again now 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:41.860
 again that the one knows 

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:46.820
 Actually put it somewhere else or 

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:58.220
 hates you can make clever right away 

00:07:46.820 --> 00:08:03.650

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:06.280

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.280

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.550
 Certainly at the top of the roof was 

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.550
