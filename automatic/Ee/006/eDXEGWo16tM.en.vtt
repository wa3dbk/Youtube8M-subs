00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
don't really agree with half the stuff

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.689 
don't really agree with half the stuff
they're<00:00:51.750> staying<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.309> first<00:00:53.520> one

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
they're staying so this is the first one

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.240 
they're staying so this is the first one
that<00:00:53.730> they<00:00:54.149> put<00:00:54.449> up<00:00:54.570> probably<00:00:55.199> two<00:00:55.980> or<00:00:56.010> three

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
that they put up probably two or three

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.430

days<00:00:56.280> ago<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.570> essentially<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.140> it's

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440

it would be you know either like an
accolade<00:01:06.390> like<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.960> multiplayer<00:01:07.500> or<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.770> a

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
prestige emblem or something and I just

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.570 
prestige emblem or something and I just
I<00:01:12.780> don't<00:01:12.900> see<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.530> happening<00:01:13.710> just<00:01:14.220> because

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
I don't see that happening just because

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.050 
I don't see that happening just because
zombies<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.540> don't<00:01:16.229> see<00:01:16.799> them<00:01:17.280> taking<00:01:17.520> zombies

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
zombies I don't see them taking zombies

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.660 
zombies I don't see them taking zombies
to<00:01:18.570> like<00:01:19.080> multiplier<00:01:19.560> status<00:01:20.100> as<00:01:20.220> far<00:01:20.400> as<00:01:20.520> with

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
to like multiplier status as far as with

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.090 
to like multiplier status as far as with
like<00:01:20.850> ranks<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.570> accolades<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.590> all<00:01:22.860> that

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
like ranks and accolades and all that

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.620 
like ranks and accolades and all that
stuff<00:01:23.280> just<00:01:23.610> because<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.240> feel<00:01:24.390> like<00:01:24.420> that

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
stuff just because I feel like that

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.539 
stuff just because I feel like that
would<00:01:24.689> completely<00:01:25.380> undermine<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.250> entire

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
would completely undermine the entire

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.249 
would completely undermine the entire
like<00:01:27.049> what<00:01:28.049> zombies<00:01:28.290> zombies<00:01:29.220> essentially<00:01:29.790> is

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
like what zombies zombies essentially is

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.719 
like what zombies zombies essentially is
something<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.380> at<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.740> surface<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.460> very

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
something that at the surface is very

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.910 
something that at the surface is very
very<00:01:32.970> simple<00:01:33.560> when<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.710> add<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.579> know<00:01:35.729> like

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
very simple when you add you know like

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.450 
very simple when you add you know like
just<00:01:37.920> ranks<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:40.040> challenges<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.280> things

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
just ranks and challenges and things

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.480 
just ranks and challenges and things
like<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:42.180> just<00:01:42.450> kind<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:44.159> doesn't

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
like that it just kind of it it doesn't

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.249 
like that it just kind of it it doesn't
sit<00:01:44.700> well<00:01:44.729> with<00:01:44.909> me<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.240> puts<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.810> bad<00:01:45.960> taste<00:01:46.110> in

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
sit well with me it puts a bad taste in

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.700 
sit well with me it puts a bad taste in
my<00:01:46.320> mouth<00:01:46.850> but<00:01:47.850> what<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.750> think<00:01:49.350> this<00:01:49.470> stuff

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
my mouth but what I do think this stuff

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.050 
my mouth but what I do think this stuff
is<00:01:49.890> our<00:01:50.210> perks<00:01:51.210> now<00:01:52.140> they<00:01:52.740> they<00:01:53.100> probably<00:01:53.520> are

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
is our perks now they they probably are

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.300 
is our perks now they they probably are
the<00:01:54.659> older<00:01:55.110> perks<00:01:55.409> because<00:01:55.710> you'll<00:01:56.040> see<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
the older perks because you'll see the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.069 
the older perks because you'll see the
other<00:01:56.430> one<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.759> second<00:01:57.090> actually<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.780> this

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
other one in a second actually this this

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.859 
other one in a second actually this this
is<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.350> other<00:01:58.439> one<00:01:59.180> that<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.390> looks<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.750> lot

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
is the other one that that looks a lot

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.510 
is the other one that that looks a lot
more<00:02:00.930> like<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.259> perk<00:02:01.530> than<00:02:01.890> an<00:02:02.009> emblem<00:02:02.399> or

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
more like a perk than an emblem or

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.819 
more like a perk than an emblem or
really<00:02:02.850> anything<00:02:03.119> else<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.600> me<00:02:03.719> uh<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.740> it

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
really anything else to me uh and it

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.800 
really anything else to me uh and it
looks<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.070> lot<00:02:05.189> like<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.579> speed<00:02:06.270> go<00:02:06.420> let's

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
looks a lot like the speed go let's

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.330 
looks a lot like the speed go let's
light<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:06.990> hand<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.890> think<00:02:08.099> they're<00:02:08.280> just

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
light a hand and I think they're just

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.530 
light a hand and I think they're just
updating<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.509> emblem

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.289 

the<00:02:12.959> emblems<00:02:13.409> for<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:14.489> perks<00:02:14.760> because<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.150> mean

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
the emblems for the perks because I mean

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:16.520 
the emblems for the perks because I mean
when<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:15.510> think<00:02:15.569> about<00:02:15.719> it<00:02:15.870> we've<00:02:16.170> had<00:02:16.379> the

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
when you think about it we've had the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.569 
when you think about it we've had the
same<00:02:16.819> Juggernog<00:02:17.819> symbol<00:02:18.390> for<00:02:19.109> you<00:02:19.500> know<00:02:19.739> since

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
same Juggernog symbol for you know since

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.130 
same Juggernog symbol for you know since
World<00:02:20.790> War<00:02:20.909> was<00:02:21.269> at<00:02:21.450> like<00:02:21.540> three<00:02:21.780> years<00:02:21.959> ago

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
World War was at like three years ago

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.429 
World War was at like three years ago
you<00:02:23.129> got<00:02:23.489> upgrade<00:02:23.879> I<00:02:24.299> the<00:02:25.109> other<00:02:25.260> thing<00:02:25.409> is

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439 
you got upgrade I the other thing is

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.229 
you got upgrade I the other thing is
maybe<00:02:25.739> they<00:02:25.950> could<00:02:26.069> be<00:02:26.129> pro<00:02:26.400> perks<00:02:26.640> but<00:02:26.969> I

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
maybe they could be pro perks but I

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.880 
maybe they could be pro perks but I
don't<00:02:27.390> see<00:02:27.480> them<00:02:27.629> adding<00:02:27.930> pro<00:02:28.140> perks<00:02:28.349> in<00:02:28.590> if

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
don't see them adding pro perks in if

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.349 
don't see them adding pro perks in if
they<00:02:29.159> don't<00:02:29.400> have<00:02:29.609> pro<00:02:29.879> perks<00:02:30.120> and

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
they don't have pro perks and

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.319 
they don't have pro perks and
multiplayer<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:31.200> seems<00:02:31.470> like<00:02:31.739> odd<00:02:32.280> if<00:02:32.849> they

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
multiplayer that seems like odd if they

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.479 
multiplayer that seems like odd if they
get<00:02:33.480> rid<00:02:33.599> of<00:02:33.659> one<00:02:33.959> why<00:02:34.200> bring<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.040> up<00:02:35.250> in<00:02:35.400> the

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
get rid of one why bring it up in the

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.339 
get rid of one why bring it up in the
other<00:02:35.609> but<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.239> could<00:02:36.390> be<00:02:36.540> but<00:02:37.140> essentially

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
other but it could be but essentially

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:38.599 
other but it could be but essentially
this<00:02:37.590> looks<00:02:37.829> like<00:02:37.920> sleight<00:02:38.129> of<00:02:38.159> hand<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.489> the

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
this looks like sleight of hand and the

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:39.949 
this looks like sleight of hand and the
other<00:02:38.639> one<00:02:38.939> that<00:02:39.030> we<00:02:39.090> just<00:02:39.120> saw<00:02:39.389> if<00:02:39.510> we<00:02:39.629> go<00:02:39.810> back

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
other one that we just saw if we go back

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.140 
other one that we just saw if we go back
to<00:02:40.019> that<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.590> I<00:02:40.829> think<00:02:41.129> is<00:02:41.250> dead<00:02:41.609> shot<00:02:41.879> maybe

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
to that that I think is dead shot maybe

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.259 
to that that I think is dead shot maybe
because<00:02:43.049> of<00:02:43.079> the<00:02:43.200> headshot<00:02:43.709> it<00:02:44.010> seems<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.120> make

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
because of the headshot it seems to make

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.899 
because of the headshot it seems to make
sense<00:02:45.500> I'd<00:02:46.500> like<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.040> know<00:02:47.189> you<00:02:47.250> as<00:02:47.489> your<00:02:47.790> guys

sense I'd like to know you as your guys

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.530 
sense I'd like to know you as your guys
opinion<00:02:48.450> but<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:49.019> I<00:02:49.799> I<00:02:50.579> don't<00:02:51.180> see<00:02:51.269> you<00:02:51.359> being

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540

anything<00:02:52.049> having<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:52.709> like<00:02:52.829> ranking<00:02:53.220> up

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
anything having to it like ranking up

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.929 
anything having to it like ranking up
and<00:02:53.609> stuff<00:02:54.799> really<00:02:55.799> at<00:02:55.919> all<00:02:56.069> just<00:02:56.669> because<00:02:56.909> i
