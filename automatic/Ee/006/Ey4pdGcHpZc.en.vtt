that's<00:04:21.769> and<00:04:22.340> lets<00:04:22.669> you<00:04:23.090> know<00:04:23.120> that<00:04:23.210> we're<00:04:23.750> able

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
that's and lets you know that we're able

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.110 
that's and lets you know that we're able
to<00:04:24.140> go<00:04:24.260> up<00:04:24.290> and<00:04:24.650> you<00:04:24.710> can<00:04:24.830> identify<00:04:24.919> that<00:04:25.340> by

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
to go up and you can identify that by

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.000 
to go up and you can identify that by
depending<00:04:26.870> where<00:04:27.050> it's<00:04:27.169> landing<00:04:27.650> how<00:04:27.830> it's

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
depending where it's landing how it's

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.710 
depending where it's landing how it's
landing<00:04:28.310> and<00:04:28.430> it's<00:04:28.550> like<00:04:28.669> sideways<00:04:29.150> and<00:04:29.360> it'll

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
landing and it's like sideways and it'll

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.719 
landing and it's like sideways and it'll
probably<00:04:29.930> get<00:04:30.229> you<00:04:30.380> up<00:04:30.560> there<00:04:30.740> and<00:04:30.979> if<00:04:31.550> it's

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
probably get you up there and if it's

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.270 
probably get you up there and if it's
sliding<00:04:32.510> a<00:04:32.600> little<00:04:32.630> then<00:04:33.530> you<00:04:33.620> can<00:04:33.800> tell<00:04:34.040> you

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
sliding a little then you can tell you

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.650 
sliding a little then you can tell you
can<00:04:34.430> just<00:04:34.580> go<00:04:34.700> right<00:04:34.729> through<00:04:35.270> so<00:04:35.390> let's<00:04:35.540> just
