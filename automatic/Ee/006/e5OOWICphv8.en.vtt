00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
a thick very decent amount of latex

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.890 
a thick very decent amount of latex
always<00:02:22.859> helps<00:02:24.530> also<00:02:25.530> as<00:02:25.859> the<00:02:26.310> rubber<00:02:27.060> latex<00:02:27.569> is

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
always helps also as the rubber latex is
