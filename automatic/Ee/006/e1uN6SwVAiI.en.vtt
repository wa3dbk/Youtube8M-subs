okay now let's use this story and add

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.430 
okay now let's use this story and add
some<00:02:18.830> numbers

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
some numbers

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.190 
some numbers
how<00:02:21.440> would<00:02:21.500> you<00:02:21.890> read<00:02:22.220> this<00:02:22.460> number<00:02:23.200> remember

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
how would you read this number remember

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.590 
how would you read this number remember
the<00:02:24.770> red<00:02:25.010> house<00:02:25.220> or<00:02:25.490> the<00:02:25.610> second<00:02:25.970> family<00:02:26.390> and

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
the red house or the second family and

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.690 
the red house or the second family and

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
the ones house have different last names

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.450 
the ones house have different last names
now<00:02:31.660> so<00:02:32.660> you<00:02:32.720> start<00:02:33.170> or<00:02:33.500> begin<00:02:33.620> by<00:02:34.040> reading<00:02:34.370> the

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
now so you start or begin by reading the

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.830 
now so you start or begin by reading the
numbers<00:02:34.760> in<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:34.970> house<00:02:35.120> farthest<00:02:35.660> to<00:02:35.780> the

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
numbers in the house farthest to the

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.500 
numbers in the house farthest to the
left<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.410> when<00:02:37.070> you<00:02:37.190> get<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.790> comma<00:02:38.150> which

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
left and when you get to the comma which

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.740 
left and when you get to the comma which
is<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.870> gate<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:39.950> say<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.610> last<00:02:40.910> name<00:02:41.150> of<00:02:41.690> the

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
is the gate you say the last name of the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.460 
is the gate you say the last name of the
family<00:02:42.290> so<00:02:43.190> for<00:02:43.430> example<00:02:43.970> you<00:02:44.180> would<00:02:44.210> say<00:02:44.690> two

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
family so for example you would say two

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.190
