it's<00:00:02.220> been<00:00:02.460> a<00:00:02.490> few<00:00:02.760> weeks<00:00:02.790> in<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.150> field<00:00:03.449> and

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
it's been a few weeks in the field and

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.389 
it's been a few weeks in the field and
classroom<00:00:04.350> learning<00:00:04.710> what<00:00:04.859> it<00:00:04.950> takes<00:00:04.979> to

00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:05.399 
classroom learning what it takes to

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:06.820 
classroom learning what it takes to
conduct<00:00:05.580> surveillance<00:00:06.090> and<00:00:06.479> reconnaissance

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:06.830 
conduct surveillance and reconnaissance

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.169 
conduct surveillance and reconnaissance
now<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:07.889> students<00:00:08.400> move<00:00:08.550> on<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.849> something

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
now the students move on to something

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.820 
now the students move on to something
really<00:00:09.480> difficult<00:00:09.719> they<00:00:10.379> have<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.679> get

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
really difficult they have to get

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.289 
really difficult they have to get

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
training exercises before they can

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.039 
training exercises before they can
graduate<00:00:14.339> but<00:00:15.150> this<00:00:15.329> time<00:00:15.599> they<00:00:15.749> don't<00:00:15.870> have

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
graduate but this time they don't have

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
any help they're on their own in the

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.410 
any help they're on their own in the

doing<00:00:25.920> what<00:00:26.100> they<00:00:26.250> do<00:00:26.310> best<00:00:26.520> but<00:00:27.510> if<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.780> can

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
doing what they do best but if you can

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.660 
doing what they do best but if you can
find<00:00:28.170> them<00:00:28.410> they<00:00:28.650> may<00:00:28.770> not<00:00:28.920> be<00:00:29.100> doing<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.520> right

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
find them they may not be doing it right

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.460 
find them they may not be doing it right
and<00:00:29.880> that's<00:00:30.240> exactly<00:00:30.360> what<00:00:30.930> these<00:00:31.020> students

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
and that's exactly what these students

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.139 
and that's exactly what these students
learn<00:00:31.650> during<00:00:32.040> their<00:00:32.309> final<00:00:32.610> field<00:00:32.969> exercise

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.680 

I<00:00:40.579> think<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.670> FTX<00:00:41.999> is<00:00:42.179> definitely<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
I think the FTX is definitely the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.000 
I think the FTX is definitely the
hardest<00:00:42.989> part<00:00:43.199> because<00:00:43.589> they're<00:00:43.710> out<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:43.859> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
hardest part because they're out in the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.099 
hardest part because they're out in the
field<00:00:44.070> they're<00:00:44.760> basically<00:00:45.480> living<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.870> holes

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:46.109 
field they're basically living in holes

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:48.709 
field they're basically living in holes
for<00:00:46.409> a<00:00:46.559> few<00:00:46.890> days<00:00:47.069> and<00:00:47.370> then<00:00:48.059> they<00:00:48.420> have<00:00:48.569> to

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
for a few days and then they have to

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.239 
for a few days and then they have to
take<00:00:48.899> everything<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.530> they<00:00:49.800> learned<00:00:50.100> in

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:50.249 
take everything that they learned in

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:52.849 
take everything that they learned in
phase<00:00:50.489> one<00:00:50.819> and<00:00:51.089> beginning<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.870> Phase<00:00:52.109> two<00:00:52.140> of

phase one and beginning of Phase two of
the<00:00:53.100> course<00:00:53.339> and<00:00:53.640> they<00:00:54.059> need<00:00:54.269> to<00:00:54.420> apply<00:00:54.780> it

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
the course and they need to apply it

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:56.450 
the course and they need to apply it
after<00:00:55.199> planning<00:00:55.890> using<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.280> military

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460

decision-making process the FTX begins

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:00.379 
decision-making process the FTX begins
when<00:00:59.309> students<00:00:59.699> are<00:00:59.789> inserted<00:01:00.239> via

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:00.389 
when students are inserted via

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:02.509 
when students are inserted via
fast-roping<00:01:01.139> into<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.530> scenario<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.309> then

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
fast-roping into the scenario and then

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.579 
fast-roping into the scenario and then
patrol<00:01:02.969> or<00:01:03.210> infiltrate<00:01:03.719> into<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.440> urban

conducting reconnaissance operations in

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.750 
conducting reconnaissance operations in
an<00:01:11.570> urban<00:01:11.780> environment<00:01:11.960> it's<00:01:12.860> a<00:01:12.980> something<00:01:13.610> to

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
an urban environment it's a something to

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.580 
an urban environment it's a something to
train<00:01:14.000> them<00:01:14.210> for<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:14.720> current<00:01:14.990> operational

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
train them for the current operational

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.530 
train them for the current operational
environment<00:01:16.010> overseas<00:01:16.370> as<00:01:16.580> well<00:01:16.760> it's

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
environment overseas as well it's

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.990 
environment overseas as well it's
basically<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.500> same<00:01:18.680> steps<00:01:19.400> that<00:01:19.610> we<00:01:19.700> do<00:01:19.850> in

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
basically the same steps that we do in

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.910 
basically the same steps that we do in
the<00:01:20.090> woods<00:01:20.210> but<00:01:20.870> we<00:01:20.930> just<00:01:21.260> do<00:01:21.350> it<00:01:21.380> in<00:01:21.560> buildings

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
the woods but we just do it in buildings

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.890 
the woods but we just do it in buildings
so<00:01:22.070> they<00:01:22.190> do<00:01:22.250> things<00:01:22.520> fundamentally<00:01:22.760> the<00:01:23.690> same

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
so they do things fundamentally the same

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.780 
so they do things fundamentally the same
but<00:01:24.560> they<00:01:24.710> actually<00:01:25.010> do<00:01:25.310> things<00:01:25.520> just<00:01:25.640> a

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
but they actually do things just a

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
but they actually do things just a
little<00:01:26.030> bit<00:01:26.150> different<00:01:26.480> inside<00:01:26.690> the

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
little bit different inside the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.080 
little bit different inside the
buildings<00:01:27.110> this<00:01:27.650> almost<00:01:27.950> 48-hour<00:01:28.640> Urban

exercise<00:01:29.600> throws<00:01:29.960> twists<00:01:30.410> into<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.740> training

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
exercise throws twists into the training

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.500 
exercise throws twists into the training
the<00:01:31.220> students<00:01:31.670> have<00:01:31.820> already<00:01:32.180> completed

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
the students have already completed

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.170 
the students have already completed
we're<00:01:33.290> used<00:01:33.500> to<00:01:33.680> operating<00:01:34.370> in<00:01:34.550> the<00:01:34.670> woods<00:01:34.880> and

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
we're used to operating in the woods and

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.730 
we're used to operating in the woods and
then<00:01:35.360> when<00:01:35.570> you<00:01:35.720> move<00:01:35.900> us<00:01:36.050> into<00:01:36.230> an<00:01:36.470> urban

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
then when you move us into an urban

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.530 
then when you move us into an urban
environment<00:01:36.890> we're<00:01:37.640> a<00:01:37.670> lot<00:01:37.850> closer<00:01:38.150> to<00:01:38.510> the

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
environment we're a lot closer to the

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.200 
environment we're a lot closer to the
enemy<00:01:39.170> a<00:01:39.320> lot<00:01:39.530> closer<00:01:39.710> to<00:01:39.890> our<00:01:40.070> objective<00:01:40.580> so

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
enemy a lot closer to our objective so

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.570 
enemy a lot closer to our objective so
we<00:01:41.390> have<00:01:41.510> to<00:01:41.660> be<00:01:42.410> a<00:01:42.440> lot<00:01:42.650> more<00:01:42.830> careful<00:01:43.100> a<00:01:43.340> lot

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
we have to be a lot more careful a lot

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.880 
we have to be a lot more careful a lot
more<00:01:43.790> stealthy<00:01:44.270> one<00:01:44.900> twist<00:01:45.230> is<00:01:45.410> something<00:01:45.770> you

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
more stealthy one twist is something you

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.010 
more stealthy one twist is something you
wouldn't<00:01:46.130> necessarily<00:01:46.790> think<00:01:47.030> of<00:01:47.450> if<00:01:47.660> they

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
wouldn't necessarily think of if they

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.510 
wouldn't necessarily think of if they
don't<00:01:48.260> want<00:01:48.440> to<00:01:48.530> be<00:01:48.590> discovered<00:01:48.890> and<00:01:49.340> they're

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
don't want to be discovered and they're

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.970 
don't want to be discovered and they're
communicating<00:01:50.180> by<00:01:50.360> electronic<00:01:51.020> device<00:01:51.050> then

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
communicating by electronic device then

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.700 
communicating by electronic device then
at<00:01:52.160> night<00:01:52.370> light<00:01:53.090> becomes<00:01:53.660> an<00:01:53.840> issue<00:01:53.990> so

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
at night light becomes an issue so

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.670 
at night light becomes an issue so
obviously<00:01:54.979> you<00:01:55.100> want<00:01:55.130> to<00:01:55.400> be<00:01:55.490> a<00:01:55.610> bathroom<00:01:56.680> you

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
obviously you want to be a bathroom you

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.040 
obviously you want to be a bathroom you
know<00:01:57.800> so<00:01:58.100> we<00:01:58.490> can<00:01:58.700> have<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.120> laptop<00:01:59.570> open<00:01:59.780> the

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
know so we can have the laptop open the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.640 
know so we can have the laptop open the
Toughbook<00:02:00.530> we<00:02:01.130> can<00:02:01.280> work<00:02:01.490> on<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.729> radio<00:02:02.650> it

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650
