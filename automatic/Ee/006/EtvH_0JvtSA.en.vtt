00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
year's e3 which was III 2011 and if you

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.120 
year's e3 which was III 2011 and if you
remember<00:00:27.539> that's<00:00:28.019> when<00:00:28.199> nintendo<00:00:28.590> officially

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
remember that's when nintendo officially

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.919 
remember that's when nintendo officially
announced<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.490> be<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.539> reason<00:00:30.869> why

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
announced to be you and the reason why

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.690 
announced to be you and the reason why
this<00:00:30.960> f-zero<00:00:31.289> game<00:00:31.710> didn't<00:00:32.040> get<00:00:32.160> made<00:00:32.369> is

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
this f-zero game didn't get made is

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.130 
this f-zero game didn't get made is
because<00:00:32.969> criterion<00:00:33.510> really<00:00:33.750> didn't<00:00:33.899> have<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
because criterion really didn't have the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.410 
because criterion really didn't have the
resources<00:00:34.290> at<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.980> time<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.550> nintendo<00:00:36.300> was

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
resources at the time a nintendo was

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.150 
resources at the time a nintendo was
kind<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.660> late<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.870> ask<00:00:37.110> them<00:00:37.500> they<00:00:37.829> asked<00:00:38.100> him

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
kind of late to ask them they asked him

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.100 
kind of late to ask them they asked him
in<00:00:38.280> 2011<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.090> have<00:00:39.210> something<00:00:39.420> ready<00:00:39.690> for<00:00:39.960> e3

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
in 2011 to have something ready for e3

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.200 
in 2011 to have something ready for e3
2011<00:00:40.590> since<00:00:41.399> they<00:00:41.520> wanted<00:00:41.790> such<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.940> quick

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
2011 since they wanted such a quick

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.150 
2011 since they wanted such a quick
turnaround<00:00:42.500> criterion<00:00:43.500> really<00:00:43.770> couldn't<00:00:44.040> do

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
turnaround criterion really couldn't do

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.500 
turnaround criterion really couldn't do
that<00:00:44.190> because<00:00:44.579> they're<00:00:44.850> already<00:00:45.120> hard<00:00:45.420> at

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
that because they're already hard at

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.910 
that because they're already hard at
work<00:00:45.570> making<00:00:45.930> need<00:00:46.260> for<00:00:46.440> speed<00:00:46.620> most<00:00:46.770> wanted

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
work making need for speed most wanted

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.069 
work making need for speed most wanted
and<00:00:47.520> before<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.090> say<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.539> didn't<00:00:48.870> happen

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
and before you say this didn't happen

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.680 
and before you say this didn't happen
the<00:00:49.500> founder<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:49.920> criterion<00:00:50.579> Alex<00:00:51.030> Ward<00:00:51.270> has

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
the founder of criterion Alex Ward has

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.630 
the founder of criterion Alex Ward has
verified<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.230> Nintendo<00:00:52.800> did<00:00:53.010> approach<00:00:53.370> them

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
verified that Nintendo did approach them

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.369 
verified that Nintendo did approach them
so<00:00:53.969> that's<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.390> story<00:00:54.600> about<00:00:54.780> how<00:00:55.050> we<00:00:55.110> didn't

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
so that's a story about how we didn't

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.439 
so that's a story about how we didn't
get<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.530> new<00:00:55.739> at<00:00:55.890> zero<00:00:56.190> with<00:00:56.670> fans<00:00:56.940> chomping<00:00:57.329> at

coming to North America he strongly

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.240

so<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.940> gist<00:02:16.180> of<00:02:16.300> what<00:02:16.480> Reggie<00:02:16.660> said<00:02:17.020> is<00:02:17.260> that

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
so the gist of what Reggie said is that

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.170 
so the gist of what Reggie said is that
he's<00:02:17.560> not<00:02:17.770> going<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.040> make<00:02:18.130> any<00:02:18.310> promises<00:02:18.940> but

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
he's not going to make any promises but

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.730 
he's not going to make any promises but
we<00:02:19.330> should<00:02:19.600> stay<00:02:19.870> tuned<00:02:20.140> because<00:02:20.170> some

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
we should stay tuned because some

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.280 
we should stay tuned because some
special<00:02:21.190> skews<00:02:21.550> might<00:02:21.820> pop<00:02:22.060> up<00:02:22.090> I<00:02:22.690> just<00:02:23.080> don't

special skews might pop up I just don't

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.810
