the<00:00:32.099> drive<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.989> then<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.110> found<00:00:34.350> out<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:35.180> down

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
the drive and then I found out that down

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.040 
the drive and then I found out that down
here<00:00:37.010> the<00:00:38.010> belt<00:00:38.399> actually<00:00:39.059> fell<00:00:39.329> off<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
here the belt actually fell off of the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.660 
here the belt actually fell off of the
front<00:00:40.829> pulley<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:42.379> I<00:00:43.399> didn't<00:00:44.399> know<00:00:44.460> much

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
front pulley and I didn't know much

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.139 
front pulley and I didn't know much
about<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.450> tractor<00:00:46.230> before<00:00:46.760> but<00:00:47.760> now<00:00:47.910> I've

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
about this tractor before but now I've

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.180 
about this tractor before but now I've
learned<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:49.020> there<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> bracket<00:00:49.890> that

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
learned that there is a bracket that

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.619 
learned that there is a bracket that
holds<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.850> belt<00:00:51.149> up<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.539> place<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:53.449> it<00:00:54.449> was

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
holds this belt up in place and it was

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.350 
holds this belt up in place and it was
broken<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.980> ordered<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> new<00:00:56.430> part<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.120> I'll

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
broken so I ordered a new part and I'll

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.389 
broken so I ordered a new part and I'll
show<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.600> what<00:00:57.750> that's<00:00:57.899> all<00:00:58.050> about

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.950 

alright<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.940> bracket<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.780> is

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
alright this is the bracket that is

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.160 
alright this is the bracket that is
meant<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.260> hold<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.650> John<00:01:04.920> Deere<00:01:05.869> belt<00:01:06.869> in

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
meant to hold that John Deere belt in

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.730 
meant to hold that John Deere belt in
place<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.090> actually<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.740> what's

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
place and this is actually the what's

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.010 
place and this is actually the what's
left<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> original<00:01:11.490> bracket<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.840> see

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
left of the original bracket and you see

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.510 
left of the original bracket and you see
half<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.350> its<00:01:13.530> missing<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.509> new

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
half of its missing and this is the new

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.880 
half of its missing and this is the new
replacement<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.479> an<00:01:18.600> OEM<00:01:18.930> part<00:01:19.170> it

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
replacement and this is an OEM part it

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.120 
replacement and this is an OEM part it
is<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.810> GX<00:01:21.810> 21<00:01:22.490> 5<00:01:23.490> 7<00:01:23.850> 7<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:25.229> think<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.680> John

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
is a GX 21 5 7 7 and I think that John

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.640 
is a GX 21 5 7 7 and I think that John
Deere<00:01:26.310> maybe<00:01:26.610> learned<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.420> lesson<00:01:27.650> because

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
Deere maybe learned a lesson because

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.950 
Deere maybe learned a lesson because
this<00:01:29.130> part<00:01:29.520> here<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.439> a<00:01:31.439> lot<00:01:31.770> thicker<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:33.720> the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
this part here is a lot thicker in the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.039 
this part here is a lot thicker in the
original<00:01:34.320> part<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.860> I'm<00:01:35.340> hopeful<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.869> this

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
original part and I'm hopeful that this

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.390 
original part and I'm hopeful that this
is<00:01:37.229> going<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.409> last<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.740> lot<00:01:37.799> longer<00:01:37.920> than<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
is going to last a lot longer than the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.090 
is going to last a lot longer than the
original<00:01:38.729> one<00:01:38.880> did<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.619> we'll<00:01:40.619> get<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.799> put

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
original one did so we'll get that put

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.770 
original one did so we'll get that put
on<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.460> show<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.119> what<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.360> looks<00:01:42.479> like<00:01:42.600> when

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780
