00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.429
 I am believe that I am the 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.200
 director of the collaborative initiative 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.089
 in nursing or mcgill and 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.880
 I am also the chairholder 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.990
 on a french in innovative practice in 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.490
 Nursing 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:27.599
 I am a researcher in 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.490
 health Thursday the india organization and 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.560
 care units and hospitals and 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.540
 I'm also studying the impact of politics 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.840
 on the interactions of 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.170
 patients and then from what I lived from 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.750
 the premium and experience we have the same 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.940
 issues in all health systems 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.750
 we want to offer quality services 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.100
 we want services that avoid 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.710
 adverse events 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.449
 we want to promote access to services 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.500
 to patients and then we also want 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.670
 keep a good cost-benefit ratio 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.640
 in care and then we want to answer 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.920
 to the real needs of the population 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.240
 I am at home the director at 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.229
 the school of nursing at 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.900
 McGill University there are several 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:15.180
 elements who who runs the system 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.740
 at this moment first perhaps the most 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.500
 the best known is the shortage 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.049
 nurses 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.330
 which continues to be a problem and 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.549
 who is who and who has an impact on 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.990
 everything that's going on actually in the 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.640
 health system 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.560
 other elements also this is a 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.930
 requirement that nurses do more 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.030
 it's something that is it 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.670
 become a solution to the scarcity of 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.369
 doctors too but it's in first 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.470
 line we have incredible needs the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.380
 population to be populations that 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.759
 nique cancon care care these are 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.670
 people who have clinical needs 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.230
 immediate and then with the large numbers 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.680
 students 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.450
 at the level of the bac until the doctorate they 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.040
 have learning needs too 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:08.010
 but it takes because we face 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.170
 challenges big enough enough to 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.970
 the future of the profession and 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.680
 health systems we need to move back 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.490
 a little we take a little time to 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.270
 reflect 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:21.960
 could you for to talk to each other for 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.330
 find 8 to explore solutions 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.790
 possible to do better with the 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.150
 resources in place so from day to day 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.500
 in their daily exercises and then 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.990
 in daily work with 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.830
 patients and for teachers and for 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.260
 the researchers they have another 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.050
 expulsion to them we do not always take the 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.700
 time to look good at this 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.970
 what we do and then the possibilities of 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.210
 do better and but the important thing is to 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.330
 find ways to reduce the 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:54.330
 barriers and then to offer to offer the 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.070
 possibility of people to people to 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.950
 talk and then offer resources 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.050
 for to really identify the 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.970
 issues of importance to find 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.600
 ways of studying these issues in 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.640
 depth 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:10.620
 and then for with the results obtained 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.989
 bring them back and put them into practice 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.020
 I believe that there is going to be us 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.100
 allow to admit more students to 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.050
 our programs 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.630
 to the master's program in particular 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.209
 and also at the level of Bachelor 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.770
 everything is connected 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.980
 all hoping a little more so at 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:32.430
 doctorate level but I think that's 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.709
 will help us do more have more 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.980
 of students to go deeper from 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.050
 books in projects brought 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.350
 different people from different 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.910
 disciplines for example that are going 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.280
 participate in this account in our 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.070
 projects then the idea is to grow 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.220
 our research projects to grow our 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:56.160
 innovation projects and to see more 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.709
 wide and when there is support for 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.140
 that we can free nurses from 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.680
 become part of this planning 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.329
 projects this is a real success 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.290
 participants in the activities of 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.180
 the initiative 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.680
 will work on two legs two 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.959
 questions the first question is 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.879
 any clinic that population 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.220
 clinics we are talking about 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:19.410
 cancer patients the 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.419
 parents of newborns we want 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.820
 always understand what is it 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:26.639
 exactly the real needs the 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.100
 real priorities of families and 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:32.100
 patients to be able to target our care 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.229
 and sometimes we have not we did not ask 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.050
 questions the right questions did not 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:39.870
 we did not hear them call back 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.699
 answers long enough enough then the 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.220
 two second yellow of question this is 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.810
 how can we use the 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.180
 resources in place how do we 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.070
 can be flexible a flexible in our 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.220
 ways of thinking look at things 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.380
 to reorganize how the 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.910
 nurses provide care in 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.740
 collaboration with other members of 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.300
 the team to really respond to his 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.770
 needs 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.530
 the impact of the collaborative is not going 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.740
 be directly in a patient that 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:10.460
 will be reflected by changes in 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.840
 practices inside the network of the 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.789
 health network 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.180
 different ways of approaching 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:20.880
 patients duration of their hospitalization 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.650
 the follow-up he defends to me is 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.400
 important to train people to think 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.349
 like that ii to train students at 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.849
 first cycle second 6 3rd cycle for 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:31.710
 really look at solutions to 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:34.139
 big problems to the great challenges of 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.930
 system but it's important sometimes 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.099
 also to offer expertise to people and 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.199
 then to release them 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.639
 from time to time to have that kind of 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.680
 discussions and get involved in this 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:47.220
 kind of project we hope it's 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:50.150
 we will increase the quality of care that 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:54.280
 are protected and also prevent 2 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:56.830
 accidents the incidents that happen 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.840
 regularly in systems 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.940
 when we look at both sides of the 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.980
 mountain in nursing there are 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.620
 forces on both sides we have links 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:09.020
 between partners or university and 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.120
 teaching hospitals we find 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.030
 not that in other countries we do not find 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.130
 not that in other parts of canada 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:19.100
 from the francophone sector to the university 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:21.590
 memorial and the other universities of 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.870
 Quebec are known for innovation in 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:27.020
 Francophone world in the training of 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.740
 nurses in the development of the 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.810
 profession 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.210
 and then in the development of 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.280
 Nursing Science Base 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.920
 nursing knowledge and 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.290
 we have a lot of links already in place there 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.640
 are partnerships already in place 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.430
 between the media the universities 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.890
 world and we will surely play on 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:49.220
 not only the links between 

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:51.500
 partners at mcgill but we're going 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.810
 work very soon with our 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.840
 colleagues on the other side of the mountain 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.520
 in realizing the objectives of the 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.940
 collaboration because it's there 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:04.880
 a lot of people in the teeth in the 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:07.730
 health system that have a lot 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:11.000
 many ideas if we strengthen their 

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:14.420
 ability to perform well with the help 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.510
 students help from a partnership with 

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:20.440
 another institution in the group is the 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:23.510
 possibilities team coordination 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.700
 that will help us a lot 

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:28.850
 I wish the world could see a 

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:31.390
 little success here in Quebec and in the 

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:34.940
 nursing profession in quebec in 

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:36.639
 offering quality services that 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.469
 researchers and 

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:41.710
 clinicians around the world in 

00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:43.719
 nursing can see more 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.419
 learn from what they did very 

00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:49.840
 well here and then but I would also 

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:51.629
 that can be adapted to draw lessons from 

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.650
 others from other communities 

00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:55.870
 nurses researchers from 

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:59.560
 managers around the world that can 

00:07:55.870 --> 00:08:01.270
 draw lessons adapt the best 

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:04.419
 components the best foods of 

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:07.539
 their success and then integrate them first 

00:08:04.419 --> 00:08:10.740
 in the reason me miguil and then after 

00:08:07.539 --> 00:08:10.740
 during the rest of the province
