the time you return to the first nail
the<00:03:06.379> reason<00:03:06.709> would<00:03:06.860> have<00:03:06.980> set<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:07.760> now<00:03:07.970> you

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
the reason would have set and now you

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:16.199 
the reason would have set and now you
can<00:03:08.269> cut<00:03:08.540> to<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.290> desired<00:03:09.650> length

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.030 

now<00:03:29.290> would<00:03:29.560> shape<00:03:29.800> the<00:03:29.980> nail<00:03:31.890> here<00:03:32.890> we<00:03:33.010> are

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
now would shape the nail here we are

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.600 
now would shape the nail here we are
starting<00:03:33.310> with<00:03:33.520> a<00:03:33.670> free<00:03:33.910> age<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:36.310> create

starting with a free age to create

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.030 
starting with a free age to create
almost<00:03:36.760> a<00:03:36.970> square<00:03:37.120> lock<00:03:37.450> or<00:03:37.660> a<00:03:37.690> client<00:03:38.040> it's

almost a square lock or a client it's

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.640 
almost a square lock or a client it's
imperative<00:03:39.310> that<00:03:39.580> the<00:03:39.790> side<00:03:40.030> walls<00:03:40.360> and<00:03:40.900> the

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
imperative that the side walls and the

therefore<00:03:45.459> you<00:03:45.550> may<00:03:45.670> want<00:03:45.910> to<00:03:45.940> reduce<00:03:46.239> this

therefore you may want to reduce this

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.440 
therefore you may want to reduce this
width<00:03:47.280> by<00:03:48.280> going<00:03:48.520> straight<00:03:48.850> up<00:03:49.030> and<00:03:49.180> down<00:03:49.239> the
