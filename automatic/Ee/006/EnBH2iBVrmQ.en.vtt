00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
into the paint itself as he had

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.500 
into the paint itself as he had

exhibited in his video here I here I'm
expressing<00:00:51.989> my<00:00:52.379> frustration<00:00:52.530> with<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> way

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
expressing my frustration with the way

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.279 
expressing my frustration with the way
that<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.149> art<00:00:54.360> world<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.870> his<00:00:55.050> pleasure

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
that the art world and his pleasure

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.229 
that the art world and his pleasure
arbitrary<00:00:55.800> hierarchical<00:00:56.579> form<00:00:56.910> such<00:00:57.120> as

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
arbitrary hierarchical form such as

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.630 
arbitrary hierarchical form such as
painting<00:00:57.719> over<00:00:58.170> forms<00:00:58.710> such<00:00:58.859> as<00:00:58.949> performance

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
painting over forms such as performance

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.080 
painting over forms such as performance
so<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.000> am<00:01:00.239> also<00:01:00.449> pained<00:01:01.410> by<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.710> way<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.609> was

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
so I am also pained by the way the was

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.149 
so I am also pained by the way the was
overtaking<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.750> new<00:01:03.870> portrait<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.379> myself<00:01:04.559> I

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
overtaking the new portrait of myself I

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.060 
overtaking the new portrait of myself I
had<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> same<00:01:05.820> way

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
had the same way

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.070 
had the same way
men<00:01:07.700> have<00:01:07.910> been<00:01:08.030> overtaken<00:01:08.360> art<00:01:08.660> history

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
men have been overtaken art history

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.520 
men have been overtaken art history
since<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:09.410> beginning<00:01:09.650> of<00:01:09.770> time

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
since the beginning of time

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.650 
since the beginning of time
so<00:01:12.530> I<00:01:12.770> integrated<00:01:13.520> Chinese<00:01:14.090> method<00:01:14.450> and

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
so I integrated Chinese method and

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.570 
so I integrated Chinese method and
bounce<00:01:15.050> mentality<00:01:15.650> and<00:01:15.890> brought<00:01:16.100> them<00:01:16.250> into<00:01:16.430> a

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
bounce mentality and brought them into a

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.600 
bounce mentality and brought them into a
federal<00:01:16.850> space<00:01:19.870> so<00:01:20.870> as<00:01:21.080> I<00:01:21.200> transition<00:01:21.770> into

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
federal space so as I transition into

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.370 
federal space so as I transition into
Shannon's<00:01:22.850> method<00:01:23.390> I<00:01:23.660> go<00:01:23.900> from<00:01:24.080> the<00:01:24.200> more

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
Shannon's method I go from the more

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.760 
Shannon's method I go from the more
vocal<00:01:25.100> expression<00:01:25.850> as<00:01:26.720> we<00:01:26.870> see<00:01:27.050> here<00:01:27.350> to<00:01:27.620> the

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
vocal expression as we see here to the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.590 
vocal expression as we see here to the
physical<00:01:28.280> expression<00:01:28.580> of<00:01:29.000> that<00:01:29.180> frustration

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
physical expression of that frustration

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.230 
physical expression of that frustration
with<00:01:30.440> the<00:01:30.560> status<00:01:30.890> quo<00:01:31.070> of<00:01:31.340> patriarchal<00:01:32.060> art

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
with the status quo of patriarchal art

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.510 
with the status quo of patriarchal art
culture<00:01:32.540> how<00:01:33.380> it<00:01:33.530> relates<00:01:33.830> to<00:01:33.920> a<00:01:34.010> capitalist

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
given a monetary value in such a way

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.780 
given a monetary value in such a way
that<00:01:39.950> performance<00:01:40.520> is<00:01:41.150> rarely<00:01:42.050> given<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:42.979> so<00:01:43.729> I

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
that performance is rarely given so so I

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.460 
that performance is rarely given so so I
was<00:01:43.910> speaking<00:01:44.120> my<00:01:44.270> own<00:01:44.300> experience<00:01:44.990> using<00:01:45.350> the

was speaking my own experience using the

was speaking my own experience using the
bomb<00:01:45.650> method<00:01:46.040> and<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.340> Shannon<00:01:46.670> method<00:01:46.940> would

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
bomb method and the Shannon method would

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.240 
bomb method and the Shannon method would
be<00:01:47.060> quite<00:01:47.330> liberating<00:01:47.690> but<00:01:48.260> only<00:01:48.770> once<00:01:49.010> I<00:01:49.100> had

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
be quite liberating but only once I had

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.650 
be quite liberating but only once I had
to<00:01:49.280> commanded<00:01:49.700> it<00:01:49.820> through<00:01:49.940> my<00:01:50.030> own<00:01:50.150> personal

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
to commanded it through my own personal

00:01:50.660 --> 00:02:01.120 
to commanded it through my own personal
method<00:01:50.870> and<00:01:51.380> made<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:51.979> process<00:01:52.250> truly

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.100 

in<00:02:01.729> a<00:02:01.850> position<00:02:02.090> of<00:02:02.299> power<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.630> practices

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
in a position of power the practices

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.760 
in a position of power the practices
public<00:02:03.500> you<00:02:04.369> know<00:02:04.490> when<00:02:04.670> I<00:02:05.229> showed<00:02:06.229> even

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
public you know when I showed even

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.359 
public you know when I showed even
posthumously<00:02:07.640> that<00:02:08.330> he<00:02:08.869> held<00:02:09.350> a<00:02:09.770> higher

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
posthumously that he held a higher

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.600 
posthumously that he held a higher
position<00:02:10.610> of<00:02:10.940> power<00:02:11.150> than<00:02:11.920> machine<00:02:12.920> and<00:02:13.100> did

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
position of power than machine and did

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.880 
position of power than machine and did
in<00:02:14.180> terms<00:02:14.450> of<00:02:14.569> performance<00:02:15.080> versus<00:02:15.470> painting

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
in terms of performance versus painting

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.520 
in terms of performance versus painting
so<00:02:16.160> we<00:02:16.760> see<00:02:16.940> Shannon<00:02:17.410> paying<00:02:18.410> the

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
so we see Shannon paying the

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.720 
so we see Shannon paying the
consequences<00:02:18.739> and<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:19.459> I<00:02:19.489> do<00:02:20.000> hope<00:02:20.390> that<00:02:21.730> you

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
consequences and I I do hope that you

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.940 
consequences and I I do hope that you
know<00:02:22.819> in<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.090> way<00:02:23.209> that<00:02:23.540> I<00:02:25.420> saw<00:02:26.420> her<00:02:26.569> did<00:02:26.720> the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
know in the way that I saw her did the

know in the way that I saw her did the

outside by not really asking permission
to<00:02:30.680> use<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.250> painting<00:02:32.350> before<00:02:33.350> taking<00:02:33.800> it

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
to use the painting before taking it

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.940 
to use the painting before taking it
from<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.040> studio<00:02:34.310> you<00:02:34.850> know<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.180> way<00:02:35.450> to<00:02:35.950> play

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
from the studio you know a way to play

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.130 
from the studio you know a way to play
upon<00:02:37.220> that<00:02:37.340> activist<00:02:37.940> mentality<00:02:38.480> that<00:02:38.780> artist

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
upon that activist mentality that artist
