00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.170
 and how are 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.810
 so or more nintendero the intro xd or the 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.460
 youtube people here I am back with 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.200
 a somewhat forgotten topic that are the 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.510
 portable generation consoles 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.640
 arriving at the fifth where nintendo in 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.580
 the last generation will win with gameboy 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.920
 and with nothing else to say it will initiate 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.809
 after losing with nintendo he tried 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.000
 happen to game gear but your problems 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.879
 economics for mega failures 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.860
 yields and gives me 32 x and that Saturn 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.989
 had just taken off they made the 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.970
 cheapest option was to put a 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.340
 small screen to a reduced version 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.920
 of legacy and see the device in question 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.229
 it was called nova had less autonomy than 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.420
 granger and the mega driver cartridge not 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.700
 it fit quite well and you could get out 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.100
 during the game he stayed in 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.380
 sad 500,000 units sold 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.330
 now I will talk about a device that was 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.880
 part of the childhood of the children of the 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.390
 90 that is the tamagotchi is a pet 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.490
 virtual created in 1996 by aqim there is 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.560
 and marketed by band and the 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.270
 tamagotchi is a device shaped like 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.610
 Egg of the size of the palm of the hand 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.950
 which has a black and white screen 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.510
 pixilated where you can see the pet 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.850
 virtue 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.560
 is a unique game that consists of the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.660
 user care and provide the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.610
 needs that allow the pet 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.470
 grow and develop and not die 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.880
 as long as possible 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.890
 This game caused a furore between 1996 and 1999 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.990
 and although he has currently lost 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.020
 popularity is already part of the acquis 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.940
 21st century cultural and popular games 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.130
 later like the simpsons nintendo 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.140
 that are nothing but an evolution of this 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.720
 small device of a single video game 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.729
 then followed him finger game dotcom is 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.620
 a portable video game console created by 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.640
 electronic scissors going on sale 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:14.250
 in September 1997 until 2000 the 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.230
 dotcom game a strange mix between 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.180
 console and one as features 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.160
 specials had a screen 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.710
 tactile thing that has not returned to have 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.780
 no laptop up to the nintendo ds a 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.000
 despite that it did not become very popular 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.800
 due to various hardware problems 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.990
 like the low resolution of your screen 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.820
 tactile what made it quite 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.800
 imprecise and that the discharge of your 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.959
 internal battery made them get lost 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.069
 all the data that I had stored in 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.709
 she subtracting 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.349
 very useful as an agenda or dresser 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.359
 They sold about 300 thousand units later 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.030
 is next the neo geo pocket is a 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:53.189
 portable snk console that was launched 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:55.469
 in Japan in 1998 and in 1999 the scarce 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:58.079
 acceptance that this model had made 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:59.909
 the following year snk opted to launch 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.639
 a neo geo pocket color version 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:04.169
 Color color version came out in this 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.450
 case his failure was due 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:08.579
 fundamentally to the practical absence 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.700
 of promotion and marketing that punished 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:13.409
 this interesting console ostracized 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.199
 some of his games were remarkable 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:18.719
 quality metal slug sound from geo pocket 

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:21.659

 colors and an infrared port and a 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.030
 processor plus the color boy game had 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:41.579
 compatibility with old games 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.060
 of the gameboy these were seen with something of 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.880
 color and also 2 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.849

 videogames between March 1998 and 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.050
 November 2002 now follows the game

 that went on sale only in Japan 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:10.360
 in 1997 it is about the same 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.099
 size that the game boy pocket and has 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.040
 a backlight for conditions of 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:17.380
 low light uses two batteries that they give 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.419
 approximately 20 hours of autonomy 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.790
 with the light off and 12 when it is 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.919
 lit the game boy light is the most 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.139
 rare of the saga game boy being able 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:29.919
 buy almost only by import 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.750
 from japan during 1997 it was the only 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.850
 nintendo console produced with 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.490
 illuminated screen until the exit of the 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.650
 game boy advance csp in 2003 has never been 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.020
 known because this console did not come out 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.060
 Nippon lands after band and continues 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.430
 wonders one is a portable console from 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.440
 16 bits of the band company and together 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.930
 blow and yoko and after leaving nintendo 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.570
 that was launched in Japan in 1900 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.850
 and 8 bands and it's always been very 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.800
 linked to manga and anime and about this 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.020
 console adaptations have been developed 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.539
 of many Japanese animation series 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.669
 the wonders one offered a reduced 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:06.520
 size a capacity of cartridges 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:09.220
 up to 128 megabytes and long duration with 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.080
 just a stack of 30 to 40 hours it 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.120
 only one that could be improved was his 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.460
 lack of color thing that was a matter of 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.440
 time and it began to solve taking out 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.600
 the wanders one color with identical 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.000
 benefits and full compatibility with 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.800
 his previous version then followed him 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.900
 band jon there's one color was born in the 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.810
 year 2000 after the moderate success of his 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.210
 predecessor obviously included screen 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.520
 in color and was completely compatible 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.139
 with one wanderers games are 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.150
 sold more even than the first 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:39.970
 version because he kept betting on 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.099
 games based on popular animes had 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.320
 a version called wanderes one crystal 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:46.210
 of identical characteristics now they 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.460
 I will talk about the first portable console 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.990
 from sony that spock station is a 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.419
 portable video game console 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.699
 created by sony that was focused to be 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.549
 a peripheral exclusively launched in 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:59.979
 Japan on January 23 

00:05:56.549 --> 00:06:02.859
 999 for the playstation contains a 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:05.019
 lcd screen speakers a clock 

00:06:02.859 --> 00:06:07.599
 Built-in real time and infrared 

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:09.549
 it was also used as a greeting 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:11.769
 memory for the video game console the 

00:06:09.549 --> 00:06:13.539
 games for this laptop came in the 

00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:15.549
 same cd-roms of the games of 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:18.249
 playstation in which it included 

00:06:15.549 --> 00:06:20.379
 new features could also be 

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:22.449
 get multiplayer video games for 

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:24.639
 her point although it was not marketed 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.739
 outside the Japanese market, the 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:28.749
 possibility that it started selling 

00:06:26.739 --> 00:06:30.699
 outside of their country of origin and to 

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:33.039
 finish I'll talk about the failure more 

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:35.469
 nintendo's big the virtual goal was the 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:38.589
 third video game console launched 

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:40.929
 in 1995 by nintendo who used a 

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:43.359
 projector style glasses to show 

00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:46.029
 the games in real 3d by means of 

00:06:43.359 --> 00:06:49.179
 a stereoscopic effect the price of 

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:51.459
 departure was around 180 dollars 

00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:53.859
 the console was designed by a crazy pay 

00:06:51.459 --> 00:06:55.749
 and creator of the nintendo game boy was 

00:06:53.859 --> 00:06:57.579
 an innovative semi-portable machine 

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:59.679
 similar to reality helmets 

00:06:57.579 --> 00:07:02.529
 Virtual of recreational salons in 

00:06:59.679 --> 00:07:02.889
 that then thanks to a double base it 

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:04.990
 situates 

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:07.030
 on a table and the player had 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.249
 to approach the viewers to 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.360
 appreciate a three-dimensional effect 

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:12.370
 thanks to each of its two 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.229
 screens showed a phase shift 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.270
 light thus creating an effect 

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:18.340
 pretty well done three-dimensional 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.529
 he had very few titles in his bookstore 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.389
 although they enjoyed good quality had 

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:24.069
 too many problems in terms of their 

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:25.810
 design making the players 

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:28.300
 had back and head pains 

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.550
 In addition, the manual recommended making 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.830
 breaks every so often to avoid 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.779
 eye damage and headaches it 

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:37.120
 that scared a little of the possible 

00:07:34.779 --> 00:07:38.770
 buyers point the console failure and 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.539
 so far the video I hope you have them 

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:43.029
 liked it was like that 

00:07:40.539 --> 00:07:44.620
 dale like comment and subscribe then without 

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:48.539
 nothing more to say see you in a 

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.539
 next video until next time
