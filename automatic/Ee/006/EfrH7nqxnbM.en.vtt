00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
the year but the base costs are pretty

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.430 
the year but the base costs are pretty
much<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.460> same<00:00:56.670> for<00:00:57.120> both<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:58.079> know<00:00:58.230> if

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
much the same for both and I know if

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.779 
much the same for both and I know if
you're<00:00:58.559> thinking<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:59.010> applying<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.699> that

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
you're thinking of applying and that

for the summer program so I'm sure

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.329 
for the summer program so I'm sure
there's<00:01:04.110> lots<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.409> people<00:01:04.619> thinking<00:01:05.070> about

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
there's lots of people thinking about

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.030 
there's lots of people thinking about
applying<00:01:05.519> at<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.880> moment<00:01:06.530> it's<00:01:07.530> good<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.799> know

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
applying at the moment it's good to know

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.240 
applying at the moment it's good to know
how<00:01:08.250> much<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> potentially<00:01:09.030> will<00:01:09.150> cost<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:10.250> so

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
how much a potentially will cost you so

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.210 
how much a potentially will cost you so
and<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:12.750> biggest<00:01:12.990> cost<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.799> you'll<00:01:13.890> have<00:01:13.920> to

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
and the biggest cost that you'll have to

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.219 
and the biggest cost that you'll have to
think<00:01:14.430> about<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.000> flight<00:01:15.390> that's

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
think about is the flight that's

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.100 
think about is the flight that's
normally<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.890> biggest<00:01:17.369> cost<00:01:17.810> flights<00:01:18.810> can

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
normally the biggest cost flights can

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.450 
normally the biggest cost flights can
vary<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.470> lot<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.799> depends<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.189> when<00:01:20.340> you're

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
vary a lot it depends on when you're

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.010 
vary a lot it depends on when you're
going<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:21.000> depends<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.330> how<00:01:21.479> far<00:01:21.720> ahead<00:01:21.840> you

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
going it depends on how far ahead you

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.630 
going it depends on how far ahead you
book<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.439> depends<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.920> their<00:01:23.070> sales<00:01:23.340> and

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
book it depends of their sales and

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.480 
book it depends of their sales and
things<00:01:23.729> like<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.380> for<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> CRP<00:01:26.009> I'm<00:01:26.220> going

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
things like that for the CRP I'm going

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.090 
things like that for the CRP I'm going
out<00:01:26.670> on<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.600> twenty-ninth<00:01:28.049> October<00:01:28.710> which<00:01:28.950> is

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
out on the twenty-ninth October which is

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.120 
out on the twenty-ninth October which is
a<00:01:29.130> really<00:01:29.369> quite<00:01:29.759> off-peak<00:01:30.479> time<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.110> fly<00:01:31.350> so

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
a really quite off-peak time to fly so

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.819 
a really quite off-peak time to fly so
my<00:01:32.579> flight<00:01:32.880> actually<00:01:33.240> only<00:01:33.329> costs<00:01:33.630> about<00:01:33.829> 330

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
my flight actually only costs about 330

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.240 
my flight actually only costs about 330
pounds<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.000> quite<00:01:36.210> cheap<00:01:36.890> in<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.040> past

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
pounds so it's quite cheap in the past

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.490 
pounds so it's quite cheap in the past
my<00:01:38.939> first<00:01:39.150> program<00:01:39.600> when<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.810> flew<00:01:40.110> out<00:01:40.290> I

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
on the twentieth of June

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.270 
on the twentieth of June
I<00:01:45.240> think<00:01:45.780> twenty-second<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.650> jeans<00:01:46.860> another

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
I think twenty-second of jeans another

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.630 
I think twenty-second of jeans another
and<00:01:48.020> that<00:01:49.020> flight<00:01:49.350> cost<00:01:49.560> me<00:01:49.710> more<00:01:49.830> like<00:01:49.980> 600

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
and that flight cost me more like 600

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.550 
and that flight cost me more like 600
pounds<00:01:51.030> now<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.750> was<00:01:51.900> a<00:01:51.930> return<00:01:52.350> flight

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
pounds now that was a return flight

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.710 
pounds now that was a return flight
whereas<00:01:53.160> my<00:01:53.310> CRP<00:01:53.790> flight<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.150> a<00:01:54.180> single

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
whereas my CRP flight is a single

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.630 
whereas my CRP flight is a single
because<00:01:55.050> they're<00:01:55.560> coming<00:01:55.740> back<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.280> long<00:01:56.580> time

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
because they're coming back a long time

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.220 
because they're coming back a long time
in<00:01:56.940> the<00:01:57.000> future<00:01:57.150> so<00:01:57.510> I<00:01:57.540> can't<00:01:57.840> look<00:01:57.990> at<00:01:58.110> my

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
in the future so I can't look at my

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.310 
in the future so I can't look at my
return<00:01:59.240> so<00:02:00.240> your<00:02:00.480> flight<00:02:00.720> could<00:02:00.930> cost<00:02:01.110> you

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
return so your flight could cost you

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.980 
return so your flight could cost you
basically<00:02:01.740> anywhere<00:02:02.190> between<00:02:02.570> 350<00:02:03.570> pounds<00:02:03.840> to

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
basically anywhere between 350 pounds to

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.950 
basically anywhere between 350 pounds to
650<00:02:04.950> pounds<00:02:05.090> depending<00:02:06.090> on<00:02:06.420> when<00:02:06.510> you<00:02:06.600> book<00:02:06.780> it

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
650 pounds depending on when you book it

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.400 
650 pounds depending on when you book it
so<00:02:07.620> that's<00:02:07.800> number<00:02:08.070> one<00:02:08.399> that's<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.820> big<00:02:08.970> cost

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
so that's number one that's the big cost

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.690 
so that's number one that's the big cost
in<00:02:10.410> addition<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:11.040> that<00:02:11.160> you've<00:02:11.310> got<00:02:11.490> to<00:02:11.580> have

in addition to that you've got to have

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.700 
in addition to that you've got to have
insurance<00:02:12.090> or<00:02:12.540> whatever<00:02:12.960> program<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.530> do

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
insurance or whatever program you do

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.800 
insurance or whatever program you do
you've<00:02:14.340> got<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.640> have<00:02:14.760> medical<00:02:15.120> insurance<00:02:15.210> and

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
you've got to have medical insurance and

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.949 
you've got to have medical insurance and
that's<00:02:16.260> normally<00:02:16.890> kind<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.459> linked<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.360> travel

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
that's normally kind of linked to travel

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.890 
that's normally kind of linked to travel

three months I booked it with a company

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.780 
three months I booked it with a company
that<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.690> have<00:02:39.810> my<00:02:39.900> car<00:02:40.140> insurance<00:02:40.290> with<00:02:40.830> which

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
that I have my car insurance with which

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.160 
that I have my car insurance with which
didn't<00:02:42.030> make<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.150> any<00:02:42.360> cheaper<00:02:42.570> through<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.930> box

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
didn't make it any cheaper through a box

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.230

and you they're a good company and I

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.699 
and you they're a good company and I

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
think it cost me around about 100 pounds

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.340 
think it cost me around about 100 pounds
for<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.190> whole<00:02:47.340> summer<00:02:47.550> this<00:02:48.540> time<00:02:48.870> I've<00:02:49.170> had

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
for the whole summer this time I've had

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.830 
for the whole summer this time I've had
to<00:02:49.410> book<00:02:49.620> four<00:02:49.890> months<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.250> insurance<00:02:50.840> which

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
to book four months of insurance which

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.810 
to book four months of insurance which
is<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.110> minimum<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:52.500> do<00:02:52.739> for<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.100> CRP<00:02:53.670> I

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
is the minimum you do for the CRP I

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.590 
is the minimum you do for the CRP I
think<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.630> cost<00:02:54.900> me<00:02:55.080> around<00:02:55.260> about<00:02:55.530> 150<00:02:56.250> pounds

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
think it cost me around about 150 pounds

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.660 
think it cost me around about 150 pounds
but<00:02:57.600> I<00:02:57.630> bought<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:58.110> with<00:02:58.380> my<00:02:58.620> flight<00:02:58.980> from<00:02:59.250> sta

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
but I bought it with my flight from sta

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.940 
but I bought it with my flight from sta
travel<00:02:59.790> so<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:00.780> got<00:03:01.050> a<00:03:01.080> bit<00:03:01.230> of<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.320> discount<00:03:01.769> and

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
travel so I got a bit of a discount and

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.070 
travel so I got a bit of a discount and
it's<00:03:02.790> all<00:03:02.910> kind<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.180> wrapped<00:03:03.420> up<00:03:03.540> in<00:03:03.660> one<00:03:03.780> cost

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
it's all kind of wrapped up in one cost

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.550 
it's all kind of wrapped up in one cost
but<00:03:04.380> i<00:03:04.410> think<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:04.680> was<00:03:04.739> 150<00:03:06.440> that'll<00:03:07.440> go

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
but i think it was 150 that'll go

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.140 
but i think it was 150 that'll go
through<00:03:07.860> for<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.280> first<00:03:08.310> four<00:03:08.580> month<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:09.030> my

four months of my program and then after

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.590 
four months of my program and then after
that<00:03:11.430> i<00:03:11.580> get<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.880> choice<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.300> whether<00:03:12.480> to
