carries all those kinds of attacks most
of<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.060> time<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:31.200> would<00:01:31.320> be<00:01:31.350> Swampert

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
of the time and that would be Swampert

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.450 
of the time and that would be Swampert
and<00:01:32.990> we<00:01:33.990> don't<00:01:34.110> have<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> heck<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.100> lot<00:01:35.130> to

and we don't have a heck of a lot to

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.789 
and we don't have a heck of a lot to
counter<00:01:36.000> Swampert<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.900> team<00:01:37.140> but<00:01:37.650> let's

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
counter Swampert on this team but let's

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.880 
counter Swampert on this team but let's
look<00:01:38.009> at<00:01:38.189> why<00:01:38.600> Swampert<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.780> very<00:01:40.140> effective

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
look at why Swampert is very effective

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.590 
look at why Swampert is very effective
against<00:01:41.220> our<00:01:41.340> team<00:01:41.579> because<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.240> carries<00:01:42.479> a

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
surf and waterfall so let's see how this

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.319 
surf and waterfall so let's see how this

aerodactyl are weak to ice type attacks

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:03.379 
aerodactyl are weak to ice type attacks
so<00:03:01.139> how<00:03:01.349> are<00:03:01.500> we<00:03:01.590> going<00:03:01.889> to<00:03:02.389> effectively

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
so how are we going to effectively

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.559 
so how are we going to effectively
create<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:03.930> counter<00:03:04.590> for<00:03:05.189> this<00:03:05.700> Swampert<00:03:06.359> on

our team alright we're going to look at
it<00:03:09.329> we<00:03:09.569> need<00:03:09.780> some<00:03:10.019> grass-type<00:03:10.620> moves<00:03:11.040> plain

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
it we need some grass-type moves plain

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.610 
it we need some grass-type moves plain
and<00:03:11.669> simple<00:03:11.730> we<00:03:12.269> only<00:03:12.389> have<00:03:12.569> one<00:03:12.599> Pokemon<00:03:13.439> with

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
and simple we only have one Pokemon with

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.020 
and simple we only have one Pokemon with
a<00:03:13.650> grass-type<00:03:13.950> move<00:03:14.370> at<00:03:14.519> this<00:03:14.669> point<00:03:14.939> and

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
a grass-type move at this point and

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.509 
a grass-type move at this point and
that's<00:03:15.120> tangrowth<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.200> if<00:03:16.829> it<00:03:17.069> gets<00:03:17.220> taken

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
that's tangrowth and if it gets taken

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.849 
that's tangrowth and if it gets taken
down<00:03:17.699> we<00:03:18.090> are<00:03:18.409> screwed<00:03:19.409> if<00:03:19.889> a<00:03:20.459> Swampert<00:03:21.000> gets<00:03:21.329> a

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
down we are screwed if a Swampert gets a

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.649 
down we are screwed if a Swampert gets a
rolling<00:03:22.859> on<00:03:23.010> our<00:03:23.190> team<00:03:23.430> so<00:03:23.639> what<00:03:24.150> are<00:03:24.269> some<00:03:24.299> of

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659 
rolling on our team so what are some of

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.009 
rolling on our team so what are some of
our<00:03:24.780> options<00:03:25.970> well<00:03:26.970> let's<00:03:27.449> take<00:03:27.629> a<00:03:27.690> look<00:03:27.810> at

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
our options well let's take a look at

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.559 
our options well let's take a look at
Infernape<00:03:28.560> right<00:03:28.829> now<00:03:29.180> I've<00:03:30.180> been<00:03:30.389> thinking

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
Infernape right now I've been thinking

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.420 
Infernape right now I've been thinking
about<00:03:30.900> making<00:03:31.290> in<00:03:31.560> front<00:03:31.799> of<00:03:31.889> a<00:03:32.040> mixed

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
about making in front of a mixed

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.280 
about making in front of a mixed
attacker<00:03:32.790> what<00:03:33.239> is<00:03:33.359> a<00:03:33.389> mixed<00:03:33.780> attacker<00:03:34.139> a

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
attacker what is a mixed attacker a

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.129 
attacker what is a mixed attacker a
mixed<00:03:34.680> attacker<00:03:35.040> is<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.780> Pokemon<00:03:36.780> that<00:03:36.930> has

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
mixed attacker is a Pokemon that has

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.659 
mixed attacker is a Pokemon that has
both<00:03:37.500> physical<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.459> special<00:03:39.180> type<00:03:39.540> attacks

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669 
both physical and special type attacks

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:44.360 
both physical and special type attacks
so<00:03:41.669> what<00:03:41.970> can<00:03:42.090> we<00:03:42.150> add<00:03:42.449> to<00:03:42.750> Infernape<00:03:43.370> that

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
so what can we add to Infernape that

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.399 
so what can we add to Infernape that
would<00:03:44.519> be<00:03:44.669> beneficial<00:03:44.909> for<00:03:45.569> taking<00:03:46.169> on<00:03:46.379> a

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:46.409 
would be beneficial for taking on a

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:50.089 
would be beneficial for taking on a
Swampert<00:03:47.159> and<00:03:47.900> we<00:03:48.900> are<00:03:49.049> going<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:49.680> go<00:03:49.709> with

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
Swampert and we are going to go with

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.449 
Swampert and we are going to go with
grass<00:03:50.609> not<00:03:51.000> it's<00:03:51.810> four<00:03:52.260> times<00:03:52.440> effective<00:03:53.159> on

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
grass not it's four times effective on

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.839 
grass not it's four times effective on
Swampert<00:03:54.359> and<00:03:54.540> it<00:03:54.690> is<00:03:54.870> a<00:03:55.010> guaranteed<00:03:56.010> one<00:03:56.430> hit

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
Swampert and it is a guaranteed one hit

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.649 
Swampert and it is a guaranteed one hit
KO<00:03:57.239> in<00:03:57.989> almost<00:03:58.349> all<00:03:58.590> situations<00:03:59.659> another

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
KO in almost all situations another

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:02.119 
KO in almost all situations another
thing<00:04:00.900> we<00:04:00.930> can<00:04:01.169> do<00:04:01.290> I've<00:04:01.500> been<00:04:01.680> thinking<00:04:02.010> about

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
thing we can do I've been thinking about

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.110 
thing we can do I've been thinking about
replacing<00:04:03.049> aerodactyl<00:04:04.049> on<00:04:04.260> this<00:04:04.500> team

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
replacing aerodactyl on this team

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.030 
replacing aerodactyl on this team
Aerodactyl<00:04:06.120> is<00:04:06.239> weak<00:04:06.449> to<00:04:06.840> ice<00:04:07.079> as<00:04:07.530> well<00:04:07.709> as<00:04:07.889> the

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
Aerodactyl is weak to ice as well as the

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.069 
Aerodactyl is weak to ice as well as the
water<00:04:08.310> type<00:04:08.639> attacks<00:04:09.090> that<00:04:09.359> this<00:04:09.569> Swampert

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
water type attacks that this Swampert

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.770 
water type attacks that this Swampert
would<00:04:10.259> throw<00:04:10.560> at<00:04:10.769> it<00:04:11.150> now<00:04:12.150> I've<00:04:12.479> been<00:04:12.720> looking

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
would throw at it now I've been looking

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.270 
would throw at it now I've been looking
at<00:04:13.199> a<00:04:13.259> Pokemon<00:04:13.799> and<00:04:14.069> I've<00:04:14.129> been<00:04:14.220> thinking

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
at a Pokemon and I've been thinking
