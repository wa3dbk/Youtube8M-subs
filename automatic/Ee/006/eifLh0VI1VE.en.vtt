00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.460 

at<00:02:26.820> first<00:02:27.210> I<00:02:27.510> was<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.690> little<00:02:27.810> worried<00:02:28.380> about

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
at first I was a little worried about

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.440 
at first I was a little worried about
how<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.890> hook<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.340> wrecker<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.150> front<00:02:30.390> of

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
how to hook the wrecker to the front of

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.130 
how to hook the wrecker to the front of
the<00:02:30.540> Jeep<00:02:30.750> without<00:02:31.260> causing<00:02:31.920> any<00:02:32.100> more<00:02:32.190> damage

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
the Jeep without causing any more damage

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.780 
the Jeep without causing any more damage
but<00:02:34.140> then<00:02:34.380> after<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:35.040> looked<00:02:35.310> at<00:02:35.460> the<00:02:35.580> Jeep

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
but then after I looked at the Jeep

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.270 
but then after I looked at the Jeep
again<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.390> thought<00:02:36.870> what<00:02:37.440> does<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.770> matter

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
again I thought what does it matter

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.400 
again I thought what does it matter
all's<00:02:38.550> I<00:02:38.760> got<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:38.940> do<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.600> stay<00:02:39.660> away<00:02:40.080> from<00:02:40.140> the

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
all's I got to do to stay away from the

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.330 
all's I got to do to stay away from the
radiator<00:02:41.900> so<00:02:42.900> we<00:02:43.080> just<00:02:43.410> grabbed<00:02:43.890> it<00:02:44.070> with<00:02:44.190> the

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
radiator so we just grabbed it with the

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.340 
radiator so we just grabbed it with the
J<00:02:44.520> hooks<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.030> picked<00:02:45.330> it<00:02:45.480> up<00:02:47.960> now<00:02:48.960> with<00:02:49.200> the

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
J hooks and picked it up now with the

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.860 
J hooks and picked it up now with the
Jeep<00:02:49.560> hooked<00:02:49.860> on<00:02:50.070> I<00:02:50.340> had<00:02:50.760> two<00:02:50.970> concerns<00:02:51.450> on<00:02:51.720> my

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
Jeep hooked on I had two concerns on my

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.870 
Jeep hooked on I had two concerns on my
mind<00:02:52.140> whether<00:02:52.980> we<00:02:53.220> were<00:02:53.310> going<00:02:53.490> to<00:02:53.550> get<00:02:53.700> the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
mind whether we were going to get the

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.860 
mind whether we were going to get the
wrecker<00:02:54.090> back<00:02:54.959> up<00:02:55.200> through<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.620> holes<00:02:55.830> and

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
wrecker back up through the holes and

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.690 
wrecker back up through the holes and
whether<00:02:57.870> or<00:02:58.050> not<00:02:58.110> we'd<00:02:58.620> be<00:02:58.770> losing<00:02:59.130> pieces<00:02:59.550> of

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
whether or not we'd be losing pieces of

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:15.510 
whether or not we'd be losing pieces of
the<00:02:59.790> Jeep<00:03:00.030> along<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.510> way

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.370 

well<00:03:16.520> we<00:03:16.940> got<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.270> whole<00:03:17.420> Jeep<00:03:17.720> over<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.140> logs

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
well we got the whole Jeep over the logs

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.650 
well we got the whole Jeep over the logs
now<00:03:19.280> let's<00:03:19.580> see<00:03:19.790> if<00:03:19.880> we<00:03:19.910> can<00:03:20.120> get<00:03:20.300> up<00:03:20.420> through

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
now let's see if we can get up through

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:30.280 
now let's see if we can get up through
the<00:03:20.690> holes

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.410 

because<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.439> the<00:03:31.530> off<00:03:31.650> camber<00:03:32.129> holes<00:03:32.370> in<00:03:32.700> the

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
because of the off camber holes in the

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.630 
because of the off camber holes in the
squeeze<00:03:33.689> between<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.200> trees<00:03:34.500> I<00:03:34.739> was<00:03:35.370> pretty

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
squeeze between the trees I was pretty

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.839 
squeeze between the trees I was pretty
easy<00:03:35.879> on<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.180> skinny<00:03:36.540> pedal<00:03:36.959> so<00:03:37.680> we<00:03:38.579> didn't

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
easy on the skinny pedal so we didn't

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.530 
easy on the skinny pedal so we didn't
