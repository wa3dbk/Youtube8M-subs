00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.719 

squad<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.350> avoid<00:02:08.619> I<00:02:08.649> guess<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:09.369> way<00:02:09.520> this

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
squad to avoid I guess the way this

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.610 
squad to avoid I guess the way this
works<00:02:09.790> is<00:02:10.180> you<00:02:10.540> know<00:02:10.660> you<00:02:10.720> just<00:02:11.140> stick<00:02:11.410> it<00:02:11.530> in

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
works is you know you just stick it in

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.380 
works is you know you just stick it in
there<00:02:13.950> now<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:14.980> Mario<00:02:15.520> when<00:02:15.940> you<00:02:16.000> push<00:02:16.210> these

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
there now and Mario when you push these

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.790 
there now and Mario when you push these
