PSV<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.429> prototype<00:00:12.179> right<00:00:12.450> here<00:00:12.690> so<00:00:13.290> you're

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
PSV a prototype right here so you're

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.539 
PSV a prototype right here so you're
looking<00:00:13.530> at<00:00:13.710> this<00:00:13.830> thinking<00:00:14.040> what<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.370> hell

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
looking at this thinking what the hell

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.700 
looking at this thinking what the hell
is<00:00:14.700> this<00:00:14.880> but<00:00:15.089> this<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.330> actually<00:00:15.509> what<00:00:16.410> could

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
is this but this is actually what could

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.980 
is this but this is actually what could
have<00:00:16.830> been<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.550> PlayStation<00:00:18.090> video<00:00:18.240> so<00:00:18.869> as

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
have been the PlayStation video so as

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.170 
have been the PlayStation video so as
you<00:00:19.050> can<00:00:19.140> see<00:00:19.260> right<00:00:19.380> here<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.550> an

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
you can see right here and this is an

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.929 
you can see right here and this is an
image<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.350> PS<00:00:22.590> Vita<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.039> it's<00:00:23.670> obviously

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
image of the PS Vita and it's obviously

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.650 
image of the PS Vita and it's obviously
just<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.210> screen<00:00:24.510> but<00:00:25.220> boom<00:00:26.269> it<00:00:27.269> was<00:00:27.420> pretty

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
just a screen but boom it was pretty

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.259 
just a screen but boom it was pretty
much<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.869> PSV<00:00:28.410> ago<00:00:28.769> this<00:00:29.220> prototype<00:00:29.609> as<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.119> can

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
much a PSV ago this prototype as you can

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.120 
much a PSV ago this prototype as you can
see<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.630> it's<00:00:30.869> basically<00:00:31.199> based<00:00:31.800> off<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
see so it's basically based off of the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.880 
see so it's basically based off of the
PSP<00:00:32.520> Go<00:00:32.550> design<00:00:33.120> but<00:00:33.930> then<00:00:34.079> mix<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.440> with<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.620> PS

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
PSP Go design but then mix in with a PS

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.049 
PSP Go design but then mix in with a PS
veer<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.280> it's<00:00:35.430> called<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.640> dual<00:00:35.820> analog

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
veer so it's called the dual analog

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.270 
veer so it's called the dual analog
sticks<00:00:36.540> as<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:37.140> can<00:00:37.260> see<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.860> slide<00:00:38.100> up

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
sticks as you can see so you slide up

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.400 
sticks as you can see so you slide up
the<00:00:38.370> screen<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:39.149> reviews<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.719> controls<00:00:40.140> of

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
the screen it reviews the controls of

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.470 
the screen it reviews the controls of
the<00:00:40.500> console<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:41.790> we<00:00:41.879> have<00:00:42.000> two<00:00:42.180> analog

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
the console that so we have two analog

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.060 
the console that so we have two analog
sticks<00:00:42.540> they<00:00:42.899> look<00:00:43.050> like<00:00:43.170> flat<00:00:43.500> ones<00:00:43.710> so

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
sticks they look like flat ones so

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.310 
sticks they look like flat ones so
they're<00:00:44.219> not<00:00:44.309> like<00:00:44.489> current<00:00:44.820> PS<00:00:45.329> vir<00:00:45.480> which

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
they're not like current PS vir which

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.069 
they're not like current PS vir which
has<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.500> kind<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.920> angle<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.719> so<00:00:48.719> they<00:00:48.840> do<00:00:48.899> look

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
has a kind of angle to so they do look

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.590 
has a kind of angle to so they do look
like<00:00:49.170> flat<00:00:49.469> ones<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:49.800> PSP<00:00:50.219> go<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.520> PSP<00:00:50.940> but

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
like flat ones like PSP go and PSP but

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.180 
like flat ones like PSP go and PSP but
there<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.840> two<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.199> them<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.530> then<00:00:52.949> there's

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
there is two of them and then there's

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.029 
there is two of them and then there's
white<00:00:53.489> d-pad<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.590> PlayStation<00:00:55.590> bounce<00:00:55.800> and

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
white d-pad and PlayStation bounce and

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.740 
white d-pad and PlayStation bounce and
start<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.430> select<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.789> order<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.600> looks

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
start and select and order it looks

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.610 
start and select and order it looks
pretty<00:00:57.960> damn<00:00:58.109> cool

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
pretty damn cool

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.979 
pretty damn cool
because<00:00:58.980> I'm<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> really<00:00:59.340> cool<00:00:59.489> prototype<00:00:59.989> as

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
because I'm a really cool prototype as

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.420 
because I'm a really cool prototype as
you<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.530> see<00:01:01.649> right<00:01:01.770> there<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.100> bottom

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
you can see right there the bottom

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.130 
you can see right there the bottom
there's<00:01:02.640> like<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:02.910> lump<00:01:03.329> sticking<00:01:03.840> out<00:01:03.960> off

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
there's like this lump sticking out off

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.920 
there's like this lump sticking out off
the<00:01:04.320> console<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.670> I'm<00:01:06.360> guessing<00:01:06.659> is

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
the console and that I'm guessing is

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.030 
the console and that I'm guessing is
only<00:01:07.049> there<00:01:07.290> because<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.650> was<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> prototype

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
only there because it was a prototype

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.399 
only there because it was a prototype
and<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.150> lump<00:01:09.540> right<00:01:09.900> here<00:01:10.110> there's<00:01:10.290> some

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
and in this lump right here there's some

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.010 
and in this lump right here there's some
extra<00:01:10.770> features<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.150> we<00:01:12.150> haven't<00:01:12.390> seen<00:01:12.570> on

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
extra features that we haven't seen on

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.620 
extra features that we haven't seen on
the<00:01:13.439> PS<00:01:13.650> Vita<00:01:13.890> along<00:01:14.790> with<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> bunch<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.210> others

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
the PS Vita along with a bunch of others

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.330 
the PS Vita along with a bunch of others
which<00:01:15.780> I'll<00:01:15.960> get<00:01:16.110> into<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.470> second<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.250> so

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
which I'll get into in a second and so

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.740 
which I'll get into in a second and so
right<00:01:17.520> here<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.820> see<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.180> image<00:01:18.420> now

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
right here you see in this image now

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.710 
right here you see in this image now
that<00:01:19.320> proves<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> prototype<00:01:20.720> it

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
that proves that this is a prototype it

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.380 
that proves that this is a prototype it
says<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.130> not<00:01:23.250> for<00:01:23.670> resale<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.090> it

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
says this is not for resale and it

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.749 
says this is not for resale and it
should<00:01:24.570> be<00:01:24.689> returned<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.310> Saudi<00:01:26.310> Computer

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
should be returned to Saudi Computer

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.640 
should be returned to Saudi Computer
Entertainment<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.540> all<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:27.930> evers<00:01:28.500> got

Entertainment and all that so evers got

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.710 
Entertainment and all that so evers got
this<00:01:28.770> right<00:01:28.950> now<00:01:29.100> has<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.520> has<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.509> give<00:01:30.659> it

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
this right now has to has to give it

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.020 
this right now has to has to give it
back<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.079> right<00:01:31.110> now

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
back to it right now

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.609 
back to it right now
but<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.090> person<00:01:33.360> who<00:01:33.420> has<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.869> assembler

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
but the person who has this is assembler

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.140 
but the person who has this is assembler
games<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.130> believe<00:01:35.369> there's<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.729> link<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
games I believe there's a link in the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.999 
games I believe there's a link in the
description<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.140> actual<00:01:37.380> video<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.770> his

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
description to the actual video of his

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.899 
description to the actual video of his
showing<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:39.329> handout<00:01:39.750> he<00:01:39.990> actually<00:01:40.350> has<00:01:40.560> it

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
showing this handout he actually has it

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.880 
showing this handout he actually has it
so<00:01:41.909> we<00:01:42.030> check<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.600> video<00:01:42.720> out<00:01:42.869> these<00:01:43.770> are

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
so we check that video out these are

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.590 
so we check that video out these are
just<00:01:44.009> some<00:01:44.130> screenshots<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.759> video<00:01:45.090> so

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
just some screenshots of the video so

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.450 
just some screenshots of the video so
you<00:01:45.630> can<00:01:45.750> take<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.960> closer<00:01:46.259> look<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:47.130> yeah<00:01:47.280> you

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
you can take a closer look but yeah you

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.770 
you can take a closer look but yeah you
could<00:01:47.579> say<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:48.060> can<00:01:48.180> see<00:01:48.299> it's<00:01:48.420> not<00:01:48.600> for

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
could say you can see it's not for

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.330 
could say you can see it's not for
resale<00:01:49.079> it's<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.320> legit<00:01:49.680> prototype<00:01:50.130> by<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
resale it's a legit prototype by the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.940 
resale it's a legit prototype by the
looks<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:52.110> here's<00:01:52.320> here<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
looks of it and so here's here the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.160 
looks of it and so here's here the
port's<00:01:53.310> at<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.520> bottom<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.659> little<00:01:54.869> lump

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
port's at the bottom of that little lump

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.889 
port's at the bottom of that little lump
of<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.500> PS<00:01:55.710> Vita<00:01:56.009> or<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.460> PSV<00:01:56.880> ago<00:01:57.180> prototype

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
of the PS Vita or this PSV ago prototype

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.580 
of the PS Vita or this PSV ago prototype
it<00:01:58.649> actually<00:01:58.920> has<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.280> normal<00:01:59.790> PSV<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.479> data<00:02:01.020> for

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
it actually has a normal PSV of data for

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.830 
it actually has a normal PSV of data for
as<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.860> can<00:02:01.979> see<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.280> right<00:02:02.540> which<00:02:03.540> we<00:02:03.659> see

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
as you can see on the right which we see

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.569 
as you can see on the right which we see
on<00:02:03.990> our<00:02:04.049> PSP<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.649> now<00:02:04.799> or<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.280> looks<00:02:05.460> very

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
on our PSP is now or it looks very

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.580 
on our PSP is now or it looks very
similar<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.420> then<00:02:07.110> in<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.259> middle

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
similar to that and then in the middle

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.490 
similar to that and then in the middle
we<00:02:08.069> have<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.310> HDMI<00:02:08.940> output<00:02:09.450> which<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:09.959> awesome

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
we have a HDMI output which is awesome

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.950 
we have a HDMI output which is awesome
we<00:02:10.920> even<00:02:11.099> have<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.340> on<00:02:11.580> our<00:02:11.610> ps4<00:02:12.090> use

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
we even have that on our ps4 use

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.940 
we even have that on our ps4 use
would<00:02:13.140> have<00:02:13.200> been<00:02:13.290> great<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.560> actually<00:02:13.740> see

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
would have been great to actually see

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.440 
would have been great to actually see
that<00:02:14.250> in<00:02:14.370> our<00:02:14.430> current<00:02:14.640> peace<00:02:14.880> videos<00:02:15.210> but

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
that in our current peace videos but

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.750 
that in our current peace videos but
unfortunately<00:02:16.380> we<00:02:16.440> didn't<00:02:16.680> get<00:02:16.800> that<00:02:16.980> but<00:02:17.610> it

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
unfortunately we didn't get that but it

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.670 
unfortunately we didn't get that but it
is<00:02:17.910> in<00:02:17.940> this<00:02:18.390> prototype<00:02:18.780> but<00:02:19.350> do<00:02:19.410> you<00:02:19.470> think<00:02:19.620> it

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
is in this prototype but do you think it

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.800 
is in this prototype but do you think it
would<00:02:19.770> have<00:02:19.890> been<00:02:20.010> cool<00:02:20.220> if<00:02:20.340> we<00:02:20.370> had<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:21.030> HDMI<00:02:21.660> in

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
would have been cool if we had a HDMI in

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.390 
would have been cool if we had a HDMI in
our<00:02:21.960> current<00:02:22.320> PS<00:02:22.500> videos<00:02:22.770> I<00:02:22.950> think<00:02:23.070> would<00:02:23.340> have

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
our current PS videos I think would have

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.220 
our current PS videos I think would have
been<00:02:23.460> pretty<00:02:23.670> awesome<00:02:24.060> but<00:02:24.300> it<00:02:24.870> seems<00:02:25.080> like

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
been pretty awesome but it seems like

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.020 
been pretty awesome but it seems like
they<00:02:25.350> just<00:02:25.500> cut<00:02:25.710> out<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.340> question<00:02:26.730> because

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
they just cut out the question because

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.300 
they just cut out the question because
it<00:02:27.180> probably<00:02:27.480> was<00:02:27.720> too<00:02:28.620> much<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.190> probably

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
it probably was too much and probably

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.120 
it probably was too much and probably
cost<00:02:29.670> too<00:02:29.880> much<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.440> sell<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.590> PS<00:02:31.800> Vita<00:02:32.100> and

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
cost too much to sell the PS Vita and

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.100 
cost too much to sell the PS Vita and
they<00:02:32.310> want<00:02:32.460> to<00:02:32.550> cut<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.850> costs<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:33.300> kind

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
they want to cut the costs so kind

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.330 
they want to cut the costs so kind
understandable<00:02:34.710> but<00:02:34.890> I<00:02:34.920> think<00:02:35.190> they<00:02:35.280> are

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
understandable but I think they are

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.650 
understandable but I think they are
doing<00:02:35.520> pretty<00:02:35.640> awesome<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:36.150> then<00:02:36.420> on<00:02:36.540> the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
doing pretty awesome and then on the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.110 
doing pretty awesome and then on the
left<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.050> is<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.200> mini<00:02:37.590> USB<00:02:37.890> port<00:02:38.460> which<00:02:39.000> is

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
left it is a mini USB port which is

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.400 
left it is a mini USB port which is
really<00:02:39.360> strange<00:02:39.540> actually<00:02:39.990> because<00:02:40.230> there's

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
really strange actually because there's

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.140 
really strange actually because there's
already<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.710> PS<00:02:41.010> via<00:02:41.190> port<00:02:41.460> on<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.730> right<00:02:41.880> side

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
already a PS via port on the right side

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.120 
already a PS via port on the right side
and<00:02:42.420> then<00:02:42.750> there's<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:42.990> mini<00:02:43.170> USB<00:02:43.350> there<00:02:43.800> so

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
and then there's a mini USB there so

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.100 
and then there's a mini USB there so
what<00:02:44.880> are<00:02:44.970> they<00:02:45.060> using<00:02:45.240> that<00:02:45.480> for<00:02:45.690> is<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:45.960> for

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
what are they using that for is that for

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.800 
what are they using that for is that for
day<00:02:46.230> as<00:02:46.470> well<00:02:46.680> for<00:02:47.280> charging<00:02:47.670> I'm<00:02:48.030> likely<00:02:48.450> sure

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
day as well for charging I'm likely sure

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.170 
day as well for charging I'm likely sure
and<00:02:49.050> then<00:02:49.680> what's<00:02:50.100> even<00:02:50.400> more<00:02:50.430> confusing<00:02:50.910> us

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
and then what's even more confusing us

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.110 
and then what's even more confusing us
on<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.600> left<00:02:51.780> side<00:02:52.020> at<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.440> bottom<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:52.890> PS

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
on the left side at the bottom of the PS

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
on the left side at the bottom of the PS
the<00:02:54.120> approach<00:02:54.480> type<00:02:54.750> right<00:02:54.930> here

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
the approach type right here

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.650 
the approach type right here
there's<00:02:55.620> actually<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:55.950> AC<00:02:56.340> like<00:02:56.790> charging<00:02:57.330> port

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
there's actually a AC like charging port

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.260 
there's actually a AC like charging port
like<00:02:58.140> a<00:02:58.170> PSP<00:02:58.530> one<00:02:58.920> like<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.430> round<00:02:59.640> ones<00:02:59.910> which

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
like a PSP one like the round ones which

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.790 
like a PSP one like the round ones which
is<00:03:00.390> really<00:03:00.720> strange<00:03:00.960> so<00:03:01.170> we<00:03:01.290> have<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.500> normal

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
is really strange so we have a normal

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.880 
is really strange so we have a normal
day<00:03:02.730> appears<00:03:03.210> to<00:03:03.270> be<00:03:03.330> a<00:03:03.360> day<00:03:03.630> port<00:03:04.560> that<00:03:04.740> we've

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
day appears to be a day port that we've

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.650 
day appears to be a day port that we've
seen<00:03:05.070> on<00:03:05.250> our<00:03:05.340> pious<00:03:05.610> videos<00:03:05.880> then<00:03:06.450> we<00:03:06.480> have<00:03:06.630> a

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
seen on our pious videos then we have a

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.680 
seen on our pious videos then we have a
mini<00:03:06.990> USB<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:08.160> then<00:03:08.790> we<00:03:08.910> have<00:03:09.090> that<00:03:09.240> charging

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
mini USB and then we have that charging

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.000 
mini USB and then we have that charging
for<00:03:09.870> on<00:03:09.960> the<00:03:10.050> left<00:03:10.230> side<00:03:10.350> so<00:03:10.560> it's<00:03:10.680> like<00:03:10.770> why<00:03:10.950> is

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
for on the left side so it's like why is

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.440 
for on the left side so it's like why is
there<00:03:11.280> three<00:03:11.520> different<00:03:11.670> things<00:03:12.000> on<00:03:12.330> this

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
there three different things on this

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.720 
there three different things on this
prototype<00:03:12.840> it's<00:03:13.110> really<00:03:13.350> confusing<00:03:13.610> but<00:03:14.610> it's

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
prototype it's really confusing but it's

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.070 
prototype it's really confusing but it's
pretty<00:03:14.850> cool<00:03:15.090> but<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.450> main<00:03:15.630> difference<00:03:16.050> here

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
pretty cool but the main difference here

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.560 
pretty cool but the main difference here
is<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.380> HDMI<00:03:16.890> port<00:03:16.920> at<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.280> bottom<00:03:17.510> or<00:03:18.510> the

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
is the HDMI port at the bottom or the

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.750 
is the HDMI port at the bottom or the
output<00:03:19.050> which<00:03:19.590> is<00:03:19.710> really<00:03:20.010> awesome<00:03:20.160> another

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
output which is really awesome another

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.190 
output which is really awesome another
really<00:03:21.060> interesting<00:03:21.090> things<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:21.840> can<00:03:21.900> see<00:03:22.110> in

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
really interesting things you can see in

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.260 
really interesting things you can see in
this<00:03:22.290> image<00:03:22.800> the<00:03:23.580> volume<00:03:23.880> bones<00:03:24.060> are<00:03:24.240> very

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
this image the volume bones are very

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.700 
this image the volume bones are very
different<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.990> whole<00:03:25.080> design<00:03:25.440> of<00:03:25.500> the

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
different the whole design of the

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.800 
different the whole design of the
shoulder<00:03:26.160> buttons<00:03:26.490> on<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.760> top<00:03:27.000> half<00:03:27.480> of<00:03:27.630> the

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
shoulder buttons on the top half of the

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.930 
shoulder buttons on the top half of the
PSV<00:03:28.260> right<00:03:28.500> here<00:03:28.740> it's<00:03:29.220> got<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.370> similar<00:03:29.730> layout

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
PSV right here it's got a similar layout

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.490 
PSV right here it's got a similar layout
but<00:03:30.300> looks<00:03:30.480> really<00:03:30.570> different<00:03:30.960> the<00:03:31.200> volume

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
but looks really different the volume

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.650 
but looks really different the volume
buttons<00:03:32.070> design<00:03:32.490> is<00:03:32.730> very<00:03:32.940> different<00:03:33.420> and

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
buttons design is very different and

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.650 
buttons design is very different and
also<00:03:34.290> right<00:03:34.920> there's<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.370> port<00:03:35.670> for<00:03:36.180> what<00:03:36.540> we

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
also right there's the port for what we

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.750 
also right there's the port for what we
known<00:03:36.870> as<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.590> ps4<00:03:37.860> your<00:03:38.100> game<00:03:38.250> cartridges

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
known as the ps4 your game cartridges

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.600 
known as the ps4 your game cartridges
but<00:03:39.510> no<00:03:39.750> not<00:03:40.110> in<00:03:40.230> this<00:03:40.320> prototype<00:03:40.650> is<00:03:41.070> actually

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
but no not in this prototype is actually

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.590 
but no not in this prototype is actually
takes<00:03:42.240> SD<00:03:42.540> cards<00:03:43.200> but<00:03:44.130> Sony<00:03:44.700> for<00:03:44.970> some<00:03:45.180> reason

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
takes SD cards but Sony for some reason

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.420

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
cards whatever they were called I can't

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.250 
cards whatever they were called I can't
remember<00:03:55.560> but<00:03:55.830> they<00:03:55.890> were<00:03:55.980> a<00:03:56.010> ripoff<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:57.260> SD

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
remember but they were a ripoff and SD

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.330 
remember but they were a ripoff and SD
cards<00:03:58.560> would<00:03:58.650> just<00:03:58.800> would<00:03:58.920> have<00:03:59.010> been<00:03:59.100> so<00:03:59.220> much

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
cards would just would have been so much

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.160 
cards would just would have been so much
easier<00:03:59.490> and<00:03:59.820> probably<00:04:00.120> cheaper<00:04:00.660> for<00:04:00.900> us<00:04:00.960> as

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
easier and probably cheaper for us as

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.330 
easier and probably cheaper for us as
well<00:04:01.290> so<00:04:01.320> I<00:04:01.440> really<00:04:01.740> don't<00:04:01.830> know<00:04:02.010> why<00:04:02.160> they

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
well so I really don't know why they

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.010 
well so I really don't know why they
went<00:04:02.520> for<00:04:02.670> that<00:04:02.820> why<00:04:03.330> they<00:04:03.480> didn't<00:04:03.750> go<00:04:03.870> for

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
went for that why they didn't go for

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.230 
went for that why they didn't go for
that<00:04:04.170> but<00:04:04.890> this<00:04:04.980> prototype<00:04:05.340> seemed<00:04:05.940> to<00:04:06.060> be

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
that but this prototype seemed to be

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.110 
that but this prototype seemed to be
taking<00:04:06.660> actual<00:04:07.470> SD<00:04:07.950> cards<00:04:08.280> instead<00:04:08.520> of<00:04:08.640> PS<00:04:08.970> via

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
taking actual SD cards instead of PS via

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.690 
taking actual SD cards instead of PS via
game<00:04:09.390> cartridges<00:04:10.230> which<00:04:11.220> is<00:04:11.310> pretty<00:04:11.520> damn

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
game cartridges which is pretty damn

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.370 
game cartridges which is pretty damn
cool<00:04:11.910> as<00:04:12.060> well<00:04:12.240> and<00:04:12.450> then<00:04:12.870> you<00:04:12.960> can<00:04:13.110> see<00:04:13.230> here

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
cool as well and then you can see here

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.170 
cool as well and then you can see here
in<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.560> screenshot<00:04:14.010> it<00:04:14.250> actually<00:04:14.580> is<00:04:14.700> running

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
in the screenshot it actually is running

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.229 
in the screenshot it actually is running
the<00:04:15.840> PlayStation<00:04:16.320> video<00:04:16.470> software<00:04:16.770> legit<00:04:17.760> and

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
the PlayStation video software legit and

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.880 
the PlayStation video software legit and
it<00:04:18.390> does<00:04:18.510> have<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.690> touch<00:04:18.960> screen<00:04:19.230> it<00:04:19.410> has<00:04:19.470> the

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
it does have the touch screen it has the

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.740 
it does have the touch screen it has the
back<00:04:20.100> touchpad<00:04:20.580> and<00:04:20.730> everything<00:04:21.500> fully

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
back touchpad and everything fully

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.210 
back touchpad and everything fully
like<00:04:23.020> a<00:04:23.050> normal<00:04:23.350> PSV<00:04:23.680> do<00:04:23.770> just<00:04:23.980> with<00:04:24.130> these

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
like a normal PSV do just with these

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.160 
like a normal PSV do just with these
some<00:04:24.490> extra<00:04:24.850> features<00:04:25.000> here<00:04:25.360> like<00:04:25.390> SD<00:04:25.870> cards

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
some extra features here like SD cards

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.960 
some extra features here like SD cards
and<00:04:26.290> HDMI<00:04:26.800> outs<00:04:27.040> but<00:04:27.610> yeah<00:04:27.730> that's<00:04:27.850> pretty

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
and HDMI outs but yeah that's pretty

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.640 
and HDMI outs but yeah that's pretty
much<00:04:28.180> it<00:04:28.360> just<00:04:28.540> checking<00:04:28.930> out<00:04:29.020> this<00:04:29.140> PSV

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
much it just checking out this PSV

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
much it just checking out this PSV
prototype<00:04:30.520> or<00:04:30.790> PSV<00:04:31.450> a<00:04:31.480> go<00:04:31.870> prototype<00:04:32.550> if<00:04:33.550> you

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
prototype or PSV a go prototype if you

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.010 
prototype or PSV a go prototype if you
think<00:04:33.850> this<00:04:33.970> will<00:04:34.090> be<00:04:34.210> a<00:04:34.240> cool<00:04:34.510> thing<00:04:34.720> to<00:04:34.780> maybe

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
think this will be a cool thing to maybe

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.870 
think this will be a cool thing to maybe
revive<00:04:35.500> maybe<00:04:35.830> they<00:04:36.010> should<00:04:36.160> make<00:04:36.310> a<00:04:36.340> PSV<00:04:36.760> or

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
revive maybe they should make a PSV or

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.270 
revive maybe they should make a PSV or
two<00:04:37.030> and<00:04:37.330> it<00:04:37.660> should<00:04:37.840> have<00:04:38.050> this<00:04:38.560> design<00:04:39.100> with

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
two and it should have this design with

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.520 
two and it should have this design with
this<00:04:39.370> so<00:04:39.550> it's<00:04:39.640> like<00:04:39.730> a<00:04:39.760> PSP<00:04:40.090> go<00:04:40.390> but<00:04:41.080> a<00:04:41.110> PS<00:04:41.380> be

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
this so it's like a PSP go but a PS be

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.200 
this so it's like a PSP go but a PS be
able<00:04:41.740> to<00:04:41.800> HDMI<00:04:42.220> out<00:04:42.460> and<00:04:42.700> everything<00:04:43.030> do<00:04:43.120> you

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
able to HDMI out and everything do you
