where the kids can do and you just need

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.480 
where the kids can do and you just need
a<00:00:22.710> few<00:00:22.830> materials<00:00:23.000> like<00:00:24.000> some<00:00:24.210> wire<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:25.490> got

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
a few materials like some wire I got

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.130 
a few materials like some wire I got
some<00:00:26.609> water<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.119> any<00:00:27.359> kind<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.630> wire<00:00:27.779> will<00:00:27.960> do

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
some water and any kind of wire will do

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.400 
some water and any kind of wire will do
that's<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.830> newspaper<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.580> some<00:00:29.939> tape<00:00:30.260> and<00:00:31.260> it

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
that's a newspaper and some tape and it

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.069 
that's a newspaper and some tape and it
will<00:00:31.500> get<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.740> most<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.099> marionette<00:00:32.550> done

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
will get you most of the marionette done

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.790 
will get you most of the marionette done
so<00:00:34.079> what<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.320> do<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.649> there's<00:00:35.280> 12<00:00:35.640> pieces<00:00:36.120> here

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
so what to do is there's 12 pieces here

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.990 
so what to do is there's 12 pieces here
if<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.980> can<00:00:38.250> take<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> look<00:00:38.579> at<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.969> see

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
if you can take a look at this to see

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.729 
if you can take a look at this to see
the<00:00:39.149> trim<00:00:39.360> pieces<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.870> need<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.350> make<00:00:40.500> a

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
the trim pieces you need to make a

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.430 
the trim pieces you need to make a
typical<00:00:41.460> marionette<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.840> counted<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
typical marionette and I counted the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.630 
typical marionette and I counted the
feet<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.800> lower<00:00:44.730> lower<00:00:45.149> legs<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.600> 1<00:00:45.950> so<00:00:46.950> 1<00:00:47.219> 2<00:00:47.430> 3

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
feet and lower lower legs is 1 so 1 2 3

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.720 
feet and lower lower legs is 1 so 1 2 3
4<00:00:47.940> 5<00:00:48.239> 6<00:00:48.899> 7<00:00:49.079> 8<00:00:49.289> 9<00:00:49.530> 10<00:00:49.710> 11<00:00:49.770> 12

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.720 
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
now<00:00:51.719> one<00:00:51.930> thing<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.110> note<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.010> typically

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
now one thing to note is that typically

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.279 
now one thing to note is that typically
with<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.940> marionette<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.390> head<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.660> bigger<00:00:54.840> out

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
with a marionette the head is bigger out

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.049 
with a marionette the head is bigger out
of<00:00:55.440> proportion<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.100> body<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.910> could

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
of proportion to the body and I could

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.510 
of proportion to the body and I could
even<00:00:57.180> make<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.420> head<00:00:57.539> bigger<00:00:57.719> on<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.050> guy

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
even make the head bigger on this guy

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.599 
even make the head bigger on this guy
but<00:00:59.520> um<00:00:59.670> that's<00:01:00.350> kind<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.609> absurdity

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
but um that's kind of that absurdity

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.130 
but um that's kind of that absurdity
that<00:01:02.640> exaggeration<00:01:03.600> kind<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.899> makes<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
that exaggeration kind of makes the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.380 
that exaggeration kind of makes the
violin<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> little<00:01:04.680> bit<00:01:04.830> more<00:01:04.920> fun<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:05.700> don't

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
violin it a little bit more fun so don't

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.640 
violin it a little bit more fun so don't
make<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.570> marionette<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.110> scale<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
make the marionette and scale to the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.560 
make the marionette and scale to the
body<00:01:07.799> make<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.400> head<00:01:08.610> make<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.150> bigger<00:01:09.360> and

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
body make it the head make it bigger and

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.649 
body make it the head make it bigger and
I<00:01:10.470> could<00:01:10.650> even<00:01:10.799> make<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.280> big<00:01:11.659> kids

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
I could even make it that big kids

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.929 
I could even make it that big kids
relate<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.290> movie<00:01:13.830> date<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.220> larger<00:01:14.729> face

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
relate to movie date to the larger face

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.800 
relate to movie date to the larger face
more<00:01:15.710> that's<00:01:16.710> just<00:01:16.979> more<00:01:17.100> fun<00:01:17.540> so<00:01:18.540> it's<00:01:18.659> real

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
more that's just more fun so it's real

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.810 
more that's just more fun so it's real
simple<00:01:18.840> process<00:01:19.220> all<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.280> do<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.670> cut

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
simple process all you do is you cut

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.880 
simple process all you do is you cut
yourself<00:01:21.119> or<00:01:21.299> most<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.689> parts<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.710> just

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
yourself or most of the parts you just

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.020 
yourself or most of the parts you just
cut<00:01:23.009> yourself<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> piece<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.460> wire<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.820> long

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
cut yourself a piece of wire a long

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.910 
cut yourself a piece of wire a long
piece<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.360> wire<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:25.009> then<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.100> can<00:01:26.220> wrap<00:01:26.430> it

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
piece of wire and then you can wrap it

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.910 
piece of wire and then you can wrap it
inside<00:01:30.200> whatever<00:01:31.200> part<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.560> want<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.799> make

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
inside whatever part you want to make

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.450 
inside whatever part you want to make
here<00:01:32.329> so<00:01:33.329> if<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.479> were<00:01:33.600> making<00:01:33.720> one<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.140> legs

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
here so if I were making one of the legs

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.130 
here so if I were making one of the legs
and<00:01:35.460> put<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.729> while<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.180> there<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.960> then

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
and put that while in there and then

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.460 
and put that while in there and then
wrap<00:01:37.320> it

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:02:05.740 

but<00:01:41.470> this<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.970> if<00:01:52.150> I<00:01:52.300> can<00:01:52.480> take<00:01:52.660> that

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:13.920 

you

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.790 

then<00:02:14.930> once<00:02:15.140> you've<00:02:15.260> got<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.410> all<00:02:15.560> taped

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
then once you've got it all taped

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.430 
then once you've got it all taped
including<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.400> ends<00:02:16.700> you<00:02:17.050> suck<00:02:18.050> out<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.230> little

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
including the ends you suck out a little

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.010 
including the ends you suck out a little
tool<00:02:18.740> to<00:02:19.550> make<00:02:19.640> yourself<00:02:20.000> hooks<00:02:22.600> I'm<00:02:23.600> so<00:02:23.930> let

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
tool to make yourself hooks I'm so let

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.540 
tool to make yourself hooks I'm so let
me<00:02:24.110> see<00:02:24.260> I'll<00:02:24.410> make<00:02:24.440> a<00:02:24.560> hook<00:02:24.770> on<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.040> end<00:02:25.070> here

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.520 

with<00:02:28.550> that<00:02:28.820> hook<00:02:29.510> on<00:02:29.690> that<00:02:29.870> end<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.260> hook<00:02:30.410> on

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
with that hook on that end and a hook on

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.270 
with that hook on that end and a hook on
the<00:02:30.590> center<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:34.580> keep<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.880> hooks<00:02:35.030> close<00:02:36.280> don't

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
the center to keep the hooks close don't

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.920 
the center to keep the hooks close don't
have<00:02:37.550> them<00:02:37.700> stick<00:02:37.910> out<00:02:38.060> very<00:02:38.360> far

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
have them stick out very far

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.750 
have them stick out very far
actually<00:02:39.740> the<00:02:39.860> closer<00:02:40.100> they<00:02:40.370> are<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:40.700> the

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
actually the closer they are and the

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.850 
actually the closer they are and the
tighter<00:02:41.000> than<00:02:41.240> they<00:02:41.390> are<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.660> better<00:02:41.860> now

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
tighter than they are the better now

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.960 
tighter than they are the better now
this<00:02:43.100> hook<00:02:44.020> you<00:02:45.020> would<00:02:45.170> use<00:02:45.640> with<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.670> little

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
this hook you would use with a little

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.690 
this hook you would use with a little
piece<00:02:47.090> of<00:02:47.120> wire<00:02:47.390> to<00:02:47.720> tie<00:02:48.590> to<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.250> hook<00:02:49.430> on<00:02:49.580> the

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
piece of wire to tie to the hook on the

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.030 
piece of wire to tie to the hook on the
other<00:02:49.820> side<00:02:50.270> body<00:02:50.570> segment<00:02:51.080> see<00:02:51.260> right<00:02:51.860> here

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
other side body segment see right here

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.690 
other side body segment see right here
let's<00:02:52.250> take<00:02:52.370> a<00:02:52.400> look<00:02:52.580> you<00:02:52.840> see<00:02:53.840> this<00:02:53.990> so<00:02:54.800> the

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
let's take a look you see this so the

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.670 
let's take a look you see this so the
hook<00:02:55.850> comes<00:02:56.000> out<00:02:56.240> of<00:02:56.360> this<00:02:56.450> one<00:02:56.660> there's<00:02:57.620> a

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
hook comes out of this one there's a

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.170 
hook comes out of this one there's a
hook<00:02:57.800> coming<00:02:58.100> out<00:02:58.190> of<00:02:58.310> this<00:02:58.400> one<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:58.850> then<00:02:59.120> I

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
hook coming out of this one and then I

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.340 
hook coming out of this one and then I
use<00:02:59.330> a<00:02:59.360> little<00:02:59.630> piece<00:02:59.720> of<00:02:59.750> wire<00:02:59.960> that<00:03:00.110> I<00:03:00.200> just

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
use a little piece of wire that I just

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.130 
use a little piece of wire that I just
twisted<00:03:00.910> to<00:03:01.910> tie<00:03:02.060> but<00:03:02.300> those<00:03:02.720> segments

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
twisted to tie but those segments

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.250 
twisted to tie but those segments
together<00:03:04.360> so<00:03:05.360> and<00:03:05.600> you<00:03:05.660> can<00:03:05.810> you<00:03:05.990> know<00:03:06.110> go

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
together so and you can you know go

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.620 
together so and you can you know go
ahead<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:06.620> just<00:03:06.860> experiment<00:03:07.370> with<00:03:07.580> this<00:03:07.760> this

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
ahead and just experiment with this this

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.230 
ahead and just experiment with this this
one<00:03:08.870> for<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.290> main<00:03:09.680> chest<00:03:10.010> piece<00:03:10.220> what<00:03:10.940> I<00:03:10.970> like

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
one for the main chest piece what I like

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:17.110 
one for the main chest piece what I like
to<00:03:11.390> do<00:03:11.540> is<00:03:11.720> I<00:03:13.210> put<00:03:14.210> a<00:03:15.520> I'll<00:03:16.520> put<00:03:16.700> a<00:03:16.760> wire<00:03:16.910> across

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
to do is I put a I'll put a wire across

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.649 
to do is I put a I'll put a wire across
to<00:03:17.570> the<00:03:17.630> air<00:03:17.810> inside

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:23.659 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.110 

so<00:03:24.200> I<00:03:24.260> can<00:03:24.409> connect<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.769> two<00:03:24.799> arms<00:03:25.310> and<00:03:25.430> then<00:03:25.909> I

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
so I can connect the two arms and then I

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.690 
so I can connect the two arms and then I
insert<00:03:26.659> a<00:03:26.689> a<00:03:27.049> piece<00:03:27.469> of<00:03:27.590> wire<00:03:27.769> in<00:03:28.099> the<00:03:28.189> top<00:03:28.430> here

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
insert a a piece of wire in the top here

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.869 
insert a a piece of wire in the top here
to<00:03:28.730> connect<00:03:29.060> to<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.299> head<00:03:30.670> that<00:03:31.670> here's

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 
to connect to the head that here's

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.089 
to connect to the head that here's
another<00:03:32.060> one<00:03:32.239> here<00:03:32.389> as<00:03:32.569> a<00:03:32.599> girl<00:03:33.010> all<00:03:34.010> right

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
another one here as a girl all right

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.809 
another one here as a girl all right
just<00:03:34.459> a<00:03:34.549> different<00:03:34.849> shape<00:03:35.060> I<00:03:36.400> kind<00:03:37.400> of<00:03:37.459> simple

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
just a different shape I kind of simple

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.979 
just a different shape I kind of simple

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:09.199 
let's string it up so make yourself a

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:11.679 
let's string it up so make yourself a
cross<00:04:09.439> out<00:04:09.590> of<00:04:09.709> wood<00:04:09.889> like<00:04:10.010> this<00:04:10.659> all<00:04:11.659> right

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:11.689

cross out of wood like this all right
and<00:04:11.989> this<00:04:12.079> is<00:04:12.139> see<00:04:12.500> there's<00:04:12.680> a<00:04:12.739> short<00:04:12.980> end<00:04:13.159> and

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
and this is see there's a short end and

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.309 
and this is see there's a short end and
a<00:04:13.370> long<00:04:13.549> end<00:04:13.760> ear<00:04:13.939> on<00:04:14.269> the<00:04:14.540> long<00:04:14.719> end<00:04:14.930> here

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.499 
a long end ear on the long end here
connect<00:04:16.160> a<00:04:16.250> string<00:04:16.630> to<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:17.750> marionettes<00:04:18.169> head

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:19.509 
connect a string to the marionettes head

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.930 
connect a string to the marionettes head
and<00:04:20.509> then<00:04:20.660> offer<00:04:20.780> both<00:04:21.019> these<00:04:21.259> sides<00:04:21.940> connect

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
and then offer both these sides connect

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.430 
and then offer both these sides connect
your<00:04:23.060> string<00:04:23.270> to<00:04:23.449> the<00:04:23.660> marionettes<00:04:24.080> wrists

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440

celluclay Dakota you know to make a nice

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.129 
celluclay Dakota you know to make a nice
rough<00:05:13.340> kind<00:05:14.090> of<00:05:14.240> surface<00:05:14.630> it's<00:05:14.810> almost<00:05:14.990> like

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
rough kind of surface it's almost like

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:17.260

sculpting it and one of the most
important<00:05:17.599> things<00:05:17.780> I<00:05:17.900> guess<00:05:18.080> would<00:05:18.349> be<00:05:18.560> you
