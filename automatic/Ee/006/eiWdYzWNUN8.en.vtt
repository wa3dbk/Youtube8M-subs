00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Hey, guys, how are you? 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.270
 show here my yours 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.090
 slaughterhouse of cows that I made him 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.590
 works in a very simple way he has 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.809
 some steps I'll show you now 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.750
 It's only up to you to press this 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.980
 Leverage here and then the cows will start 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.470
 to come through this place here and here 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.630
 our first cows are coming 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.080
 Beauty they will come now to the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.849
 the first phase stage of suffocation 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.510
 that nothing in these bichões here 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.950
 the pedestrians did not focus on few cows 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.230
 taking their lives and now they will pass 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.230
 by the stages of crushing these people 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.510
 here they will crush the knives that are in the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.640
 and passing them to 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.860
 third phase which are phase of the blades 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.930
 There are several blades here from all 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.770
 types that will cheapen the cows in 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:56.160
 several pieces and now the last 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.469
 phase that is the phase of waiting for the oven 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.300
 has a way that goes to the furnace and 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.329
 This is the way the cows look at 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.369
 me desperately begs for life 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.369
 but it is inevitable the treadmill takes them 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.760
 for a furnace where they are burned and 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.040
 Unless opened a fleeing board did not 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.299
 there to go that way the cows are going 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.299
 running away there is not 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.900
 I hope you have enjoyed my 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.479
 cow slaughterhouse 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.430
 This is what the risk was an idea that 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.040
 I had to remember those movies. 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.950
 where there are those mats where the 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.840
 things and have options that crush dices 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.140
 Sliced ​​things at the weekend have 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.670
 a furnace where you die remember 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.610
 this idea of ​​movies and I decided to do 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.759
 It's here and so is this one thing. 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.659
 Useless way I would never use it. 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.960
 nothing at all 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.299
 I decided to do it on the creative and record a 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.649
 quick video showing mine 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.200
 construction was a good construction 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.450
 simple and I 'll enjoy it to show 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.649
 How did I do it because there might be people 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.570
 which is curious so I'll just give one 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.920
 Quick lesson here how you do 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.930
 and I will leave the download of 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.360
 registration for anyone who wants to download and view 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.239
 the cow beater by itself nor here 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.910
 back we have the cows that will enter the 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.720
 system 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.090
 the scene lever and I think the thing that 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.030
 More matters in this one is that I 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.340
 did to the cows walk slowly says 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:29.110
 so because I did not even know that here 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.810
 we have the defendant power which is the system of 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:36.700
 Mark says that it makes the cart go well 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:39.600
 I'm going to demonstrate here with a 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.220
 cart podium can normal radius 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.680
 activated this speed more or less 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.570
 that the cart reaches a speed 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.880
 very fast 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.040
 You can see my cows there. 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.760
 slow speed size 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.410
 Let me turn off the system here because 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.490
 I can not take it, I think it has 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.410
 another here and there to do 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.410
 protesters walked in a 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.660
 very slowly we used a system 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.100
 very simple operation that works 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.180
 The following way you simply take one 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.920
 companion and poses with perry is that 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.380
 you want and click on it to activate 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.790
 this front torch attached a sign on it 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:24.459
 picks up the tip of the back and does so 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.490
 question and you're ready to create a signal 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.560
 repeater as it used to have several 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.970
 ways to create a signal and now that 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.370
 I think the easiest way to 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:37.780
 create what happens with peter and you call 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:40.030
 he goes to his hill and then he's going to stay 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.920
 blinking like that and as soon as he does that 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.270
 slow speed of the sea in box 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.160
 and accelerating from being slow 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.950
 waiting to be slow and he walks 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.700
 so slowly and so have I done to 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.040
 the river 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.510
 walking at this slow speed is one way 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.020
 very simple, I just had to do this 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.850
 sometimes by the whole railing 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.660
 serve and so the cows can walk 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.430
 slowly 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.500
 here for me to start making cows 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.570
 I did basically this 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.000
 I put this schematic behind it 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:10.209
 off now and there when I activate 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.209
 this here by the netball lever to 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.060
 the rail and the marks 1 and go there for the 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:20.040
 system 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:22.750
 Now how did I make these pistons here? 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.990
 activate now is not enabled but everything 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.780
 well I used basically the same scheme 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:33.910
 only this time instead of simply 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:35.470
 do so and leave that pulse well 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.330
 fast and I could do so but the 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.100
 Options are going to be crazy going to 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.010
 up and down very fast so what 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.340
 I did was simply add a sir 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:48.640
 piers in front here I put four 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:53.410
 goals in total 2 going there to do a round 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:55.210
 and I came back and so it makes a good team a 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.090
 it is activated and 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.590
 turns off and on with you 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.150
 can see is identical to that of the 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:06.520
 front was working 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:11.020
 and then I called that there are some here in 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:14.410
 low and so does the pistons of the 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.900
 our our machine track 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.240
 and then I just had a little 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.420
 creativity put an awl here 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.640
 piston that crushes the blades using 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.190
 and at the end I put 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.980
 just a furnace with a right 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.450
 mountain of fire where the cows wine and who 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.370
 good and dies 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.250
 well, that 's it then guys here was a 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.050
 idea that I had I know I had this 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.190
 The idea is that I did not have to do this. 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.980
 I just did not want to make a man go. 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.750
 see that it was going to take a long time and not 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.180
 It made sense to do so I made a 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.490
 creative and when I finished I went 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.830
 This is cool doing a video of 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.270
 even curiosity because I can I 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.240
 I searched the internet before I started 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:58.120
 here and they did not find anything like this 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.880
 similar to that neither the movies where it has 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.650
 the pistons and so on. 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.680
 I decided to do it but that's not it 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.330
 I hope you have enjoyed the video is and 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:11.440
 I'll stay around and see you in the 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:13.660
 next video up but it was just another one 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.130
 warning will be in description download 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.200
 to this world if you want to check 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:22.770
 if what I have spoken but only putting 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.770
 new is coming that's it earned spoke
