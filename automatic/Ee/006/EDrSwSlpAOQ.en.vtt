and<00:00:43.920> start<00:00:44.190> off<00:00:44.399> with<00:00:44.670> my<00:00:45.329> thoughts<00:00:45.480> about

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
and start off with my thoughts about

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.290 
and start off with my thoughts about
Bernie<00:00:46.079> Eccleston<00:00:46.700> surely<00:00:47.700> he's<00:00:47.910> gonna<00:00:48.090> have

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
Bernie Eccleston surely he's gonna have

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.790 
Bernie Eccleston surely he's gonna have
to<00:00:48.390> step<00:00:48.629> down<00:00:48.840> from<00:00:48.899> sort<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.440> head<00:00:49.649> of

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
to step down from sort of the head of

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.979 
to step down from sort of the head of
formula<00:00:50.129> 1<00:00:50.340> zoom<00:00:50.670> because<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.719> know<00:00:51.840> it's

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
formula 1 zoom because you know it's

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.660 
formula 1 zoom because you know it's
getting<00:00:52.079> pretty<00:00:52.440> old<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:53.039> surely<00:00:53.399> he's<00:00:53.489> going

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
getting pretty old so surely he's going

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.220 
getting pretty old so surely he's going
to<00:00:53.730> be<00:00:53.820> getting<00:00:54.000> someone<00:00:54.480> else<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.719> take<00:00:54.989> over

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
to be getting someone else to take over

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.920 
to be getting someone else to take over
and<00:00:56.000> it's<00:00:57.000> been<00:00:57.210> lots<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.570> different<00:00:57.899> people

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
and it's been lots of different people

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.020 
and it's been lots of different people
that<00:00:58.379> have<00:00:58.469> been<00:00:58.620> linked<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.039> properly<00:00:59.699> or

taking over that role from Bernie

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.820 
taking over that role from Bernie
Akerson<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.750> don't<00:01:13.080> particularly<00:01:13.680> think

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
Akerson but I don't particularly think

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.280 
Akerson but I don't particularly think
that<00:01:14.729> Ross<00:01:14.939> bronzer<00:01:15.420> sort<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.659> personal<00:01:15.930> rot

that Ross bronzer sort of personal rot

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.359 
that Ross bronzer sort of personal rot
you<00:01:16.409> know<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.560> don't<00:01:16.830> think<00:01:17.009> you've<00:01:17.100> really

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
you know I don't think you've really

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.030

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
like to do that I think it's quite a lot

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.219 
like to do that I think it's quite a lot
of<00:01:20.100> pressure<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:21.240> don't<00:01:21.450> think<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:22.080> know<00:01:22.200> I

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
of pressure and I don't think you know I

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.560 
of pressure and I don't think you know I
think<00:01:22.380> Ross<00:01:23.340> was<00:01:23.580> really<00:01:23.880> sort<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.150> trying<00:01:24.450> to

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
think Ross was really sort of trying to

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.850 
think Ross was really sort of trying to
get<00:01:24.659> away<00:01:24.780> from<00:01:24.930> f1<00:01:25.170> as<00:01:25.409> much<00:01:25.560> as<00:01:25.710> possible

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
get away from f1 as much as possible

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.280 
get away from f1 as much as possible
he's<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.400> great<00:01:26.640> person<00:01:27.240> full<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.750> sport<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.259> a

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
he's a great person full of sport is a

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.620 
he's a great person full of sport is a
great<00:01:28.590> guy<00:01:28.799> but<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.549> just<00:01:29.640> don't<00:01:30.180> think<00:01:30.329> he'd

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
great guy but I just don't think he'd

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.569 
great guy but I just don't think he'd
want<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.990> get<00:01:31.350> back<00:01:31.530> involved<00:01:31.860> f1<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.460> that's

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
want to get back involved f1 and that's

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.240 
want to get back involved f1 and that's
all<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.240> know<00:01:33.360> role<00:01:33.659> but<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.170> know<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.829> must

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
all you know role but you know it must

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.010 
all you know role but you know it must
be<00:01:35.400> soon<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.240> burn<00:01:36.390> next<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.840> we'll<00:01:36.930> be

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
be soon that burn next and we'll be

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.719 
be soon that burn next and we'll be
stepping<00:01:37.200> down<00:01:37.380> from<00:01:37.560> Formula<00:01:38.070> One<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.430> mean

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
stepping down from Formula One I mean

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.550 
stepping down from Formula One I mean
he's<00:01:38.850> very<00:01:39.150> help<00:01:39.390> spoken<00:01:39.930> he<00:01:40.079> says<00:01:40.320> what<00:01:40.530> he

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
he's very help spoken he says what he

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.130 
he's very help spoken he says what he
wants<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.689> sometimes<00:01:42.689> he<00:01:42.780> doesn't<00:01:42.930> get<00:01:43.079> away

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
wants and sometimes he doesn't get away

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.100 
wants and sometimes he doesn't get away
with<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.420> honestly<00:01:45.420> think<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.810> it's

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
with it but I honestly think that it's

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.719 
with it but I honestly think that it's
gonna<00:01:46.259> be<00:01:46.500> just<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.860> couple<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.250> years<00:01:47.430> and

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
gonna be just a couple of years and

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.670 
gonna be just a couple of years and
we'll<00:01:48.060> see<00:01:48.240> him<00:01:48.509> stepping<00:01:48.780> down<00:01:49.020> from<00:01:49.079> sorta

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
we'll see him stepping down from sorta

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.190 
we'll see him stepping down from sorta
the<00:01:50.310> person<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.939> top<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.270> Formula<00:01:51.600> One<00:01:51.810> seeing

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
the person the top of Formula One seeing

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.859 
the person the top of Formula One seeing
what<00:01:52.409> happens<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.920> everything<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.869> don't

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
what happens and everything so I don't

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.600 
what happens and everything so I don't
really<00:01:54.930> know<00:01:55.200> there's<00:01:55.530> been<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:56.130> couple<00:01:56.430> of

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
really know there's been a couple of

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.950 
really know there's been a couple of
people<00:01:56.909> linked<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.329> but<00:01:57.479> hasn't<00:01:57.689> did<00:01:57.810> not

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
people linked to it but hasn't did not

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.319 
people linked to it but hasn't did not
been<00:01:58.110> really<00:01:58.380> any<00:01:58.409> strong<00:01:59.009> links<00:01:59.520> but<00:01:59.759> if<00:02:00.149> you

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
been really any strong links but if you

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.789 
been really any strong links but if you
want<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.509> leave<00:02:00.630> your<00:02:00.780> comment<00:02:01.079> about<00:02:01.170> who<00:02:01.409> you

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
would like to see replaced burn X then

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.120 
would like to see replaced burn X then
lay<00:02:04.079> down<00:02:04.320> in<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.469> comments<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:04.950> would<00:02:05.070> be

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
lay down in the comments that would be

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.469 
lay down in the comments that would be
really<00:02:05.369> interesting<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:05.939> see<00:02:06.090> what<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.299> guys

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
really interesting to see what you guys

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.130 
really interesting to see what you guys
think<00:02:07.290> about<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:08.039> second<00:02:09.000> off<00:02:09.119> for<00:02:10.080> the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
think about that I second off for the

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.080 
think about that I second off for the
future<00:02:10.470> from<00:02:10.590> where<00:02:10.739> one<00:02:10.920> apparently<00:02:11.640> next

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
future from where one apparently next

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.020 
future from where one apparently next
year<00:02:12.270> we<00:02:12.360> would<00:02:12.450> have<00:02:12.629> stayed

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
year we would have stayed

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.690 
year we would have stayed
he<00:02:13.120> starts<00:02:13.569> off<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:14.250> restarts<00:02:15.250> after<00:02:15.550> like

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
he starts off the restarts after like

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.510 
he starts off the restarts after like
safety<00:02:16.270> car<00:02:16.510> periods<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.110> I<00:02:18.040> tweeted<00:02:18.310> this

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
safety car periods and I tweeted this

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.010 
safety car periods and I tweeted this
out<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.000> I<00:02:19.209> think<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.450> lot<00:02:19.480> of<00:02:19.600> people<00:02:19.690> agree

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
out and I think a lot of people agree

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.630 
out and I think a lot of people agree
with<00:02:20.200> it<00:02:20.319> it's<00:02:20.800> going<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.040> end<00:02:21.100> up<00:02:21.220> being<00:02:21.490> like

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
with it it's going to end up being like

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.910 
with it it's going to end up being like
turn<00:02:22.060> one<00:02:22.270> accident<00:02:22.630> safety<00:02:23.110> car<00:02:23.319> when

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
turn one accident safety car when

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.710 
turn one accident safety car when
excellent<00:02:24.250> safety<00:02:24.610> car<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.120> an<00:02:25.300> accident

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
excellent safety car to an accident

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.960 
excellent safety car to an accident
safety<00:02:26.050> car<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.470> by<00:02:27.069> the<00:02:27.130> end<00:02:27.250> we've<00:02:27.490> got<00:02:27.520> you

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
safety car and by the end we've got you

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.850 
safety car and by the end we've got you
know<00:02:28.120> probably<00:02:28.720> 10<00:02:29.170> cars<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:29.770> up

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
know probably 10 cars and the up

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.140 
know probably 10 cars and the up
finishing<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.280> race<00:02:30.489> if<00:02:30.700> it's<00:02:30.760> going<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.060> end

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
finishing the race if it's going to end

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.390 
finishing the race if it's going to end
up<00:02:31.239> like<00:02:31.420> there<00:02:31.660> I<00:02:31.810> mean<00:02:32.470> in<00:02:32.890> all<00:02:33.130> fairness

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
up like there I mean in all fairness

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.400 
up like there I mean in all fairness
there<00:02:34.090> are<00:02:34.209> quite<00:02:34.569> a<00:02:34.630> lot<00:02:34.780> of<00:02:35.110> turn<00:02:35.380> one

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
there are quite a lot of turn one

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.640 
there are quite a lot of turn one
accidents<00:02:36.160> in<00:02:36.310> Formula<00:02:37.209> One<00:02:37.420> it's<00:02:38.020> just<00:02:38.470> where

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
accidents in Formula One it's just where

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.260 
accidents in Formula One it's just where
that<00:02:38.680> all<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.010> cars<00:02:39.220> are<00:02:39.400> congested<00:02:39.760> into<00:02:40.180> the

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
that all the cars are congested into the

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.059 
that all the cars are congested into the
smaller<00:02:40.540> space<00:02:40.930> they<00:02:41.590> are<00:02:41.770> throughout<00:02:41.980> the

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
smaller space they are throughout the

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.210 
smaller space they are throughout the
whole<00:02:42.310> grand<00:02:42.610> prix<00:02:42.910> so<00:02:43.209> obviously<00:02:43.840> i<00:02:44.230> think

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
whole grand prix so obviously i think

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.250 
whole grand prix so obviously i think
this<00:02:45.489> is<00:02:45.610> a<00:02:45.640> very<00:02:45.760> bad<00:02:46.330> decision<00:02:46.540> for<00:02:46.989> Formula

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
this is a very bad decision for Formula

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.790 
this is a very bad decision for Formula
One<00:02:47.440> it<00:02:48.070> can<00:02:48.250> only<00:02:48.540> be<00:02:49.540> worse<00:02:49.780> really<00:02:50.260> than

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
One it can only be worse really than

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.500 
One it can only be worse really than
what<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.100> currently<00:02:51.280> is<00:02:51.580> we<00:02:52.180> don't<00:02:52.269> really

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
what it currently is we don't really

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.500 
what it currently is we don't really
ever<00:02:52.600> see<00:02:52.870> accidents<00:02:53.709> on<00:02:54.519> the<00:02:54.790> store<00:02:55.000> start<00:02:55.330> of

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
ever see accidents on the store start of

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.440 
ever see accidents on the store start of
restart<00:02:56.110> so<00:02:56.380> that<00:02:56.500> makes<00:02:56.650> a<00:02:56.739> nice<00:02:56.860> dense<00:02:57.130> and<00:02:57.459> I

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
restart so that makes a nice dense and I

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.600 
restart so that makes a nice dense and I
honestly<00:02:58.930> think<00:02:59.290> standing<00:02:59.739> sorts<00:03:00.040> is<00:03:00.160> pretty

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
honestly think standing sorts is pretty

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.509 
honestly think standing sorts is pretty
much<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.730> worse<00:03:01.530> but<00:03:02.530> just<00:03:02.890> I<00:03:03.069> don't<00:03:03.190> see<00:03:03.430> if

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
much the worse but just I don't see if

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:04.740 
much the worse but just I don't see if
you'd<00:03:03.640> want<00:03:03.880> to<00:03:03.970> do<00:03:04.090> it<00:03:04.209> in<00:03:04.360> any<00:03:04.600> way

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
you'd want to do it in any way

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.309 
you'd want to do it in any way
whatsoever<00:03:05.050> and<00:03:05.970> it<00:03:06.970> pretty<00:03:07.540> much<00:03:07.630> just<00:03:07.959> you

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
whatsoever and it pretty much just you

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.870 
whatsoever and it pretty much just you
know<00:03:08.410> if<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:08.620> get<00:03:08.769> a<00:03:08.800> great<00:03:09.040> start<00:03:09.370> say<00:03:09.730> you're

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
know if you get a great start say you're

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.699 
know if you get a great start say you're
doing<00:03:09.910> a<00:03:10.239> vessel<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:10.750> 10<00:03:10.989> second<00:03:11.350> down<00:03:11.530> the

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
doing a vessel and 10 second down the

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.130 
doing a vessel and 10 second down the
lead<00:03:11.860> after<00:03:12.069> five<00:03:12.850> laps<00:03:13.180> and<00:03:13.480> then<00:03:13.930> out<00:03:14.110> of

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
lead after five laps and then out of

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.620 
lead after five laps and then out of
nowhere<00:03:14.620> you've<00:03:15.220> got<00:03:15.550> no<00:03:15.760> lead<00:03:16.030> again<00:03:16.330> and<00:03:16.510> you

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
nowhere you've got no lead again and you

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.660 
nowhere you've got no lead again and you
know<00:03:16.959> if<00:03:17.019> you<00:03:17.140> have<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.260> bad<00:03:17.470> start<00:03:17.890> it's<00:03:18.220> you

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
know if you have a bad start it's you

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.630 
know if you have a bad start it's you
know<00:03:18.790> if<00:03:18.880> that<00:03:19.060> restart<00:03:19.540> it's<00:03:20.320> just<00:03:20.829> like<00:03:20.890> what

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
know if that restart it's just like what

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.470 
know if that restart it's just like what
this<00:03:22.060> is<00:03:22.120> just<00:03:22.239> bit<00:03:22.780> silly<00:03:23.049> I<00:03:23.730> literally<00:03:24.730> think

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
this is just bit silly I literally think

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.789 
this is just bit silly I literally think
this<00:03:25.660> is<00:03:25.750> really<00:03:25.930> on<00:03:26.079> the<00:03:26.170> worst<00:03:26.380> things<00:03:26.650> they

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
this is really on the worst things they

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.680 
this is really on the worst things they
could<00:03:26.950> have<00:03:27.070> done<00:03:27.280> I'm<00:03:27.850> hundred<00:03:28.660> percent

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
could have done I'm hundred percent

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.009 
could have done I'm hundred percent
against<00:03:29.320> this<00:03:29.590> and<00:03:29.860> I<00:03:30.610> hope<00:03:30.820> they<00:03:30.959> sort<00:03:31.959> of

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
against this and I hope they sort of

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.020 
against this and I hope they sort of
flipped<00:03:32.290> this<00:03:32.440> decision<00:03:33.010> and<00:03:33.190> they<00:03:33.610> get<00:03:33.850> rid

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
flipped this decision and they get rid

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.430 
flipped this decision and they get rid
of<00:03:34.060> these<00:03:34.209> standing<00:03:34.660> stars<00:03:34.930> but<00:03:35.140> it<00:03:35.260> looks

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
of these standing stars but it looks

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.050 
of these standing stars but it looks
quite<00:03:35.709> you<00:03:36.070> know<00:03:36.100> quite<00:03:36.190> solid<00:03:36.790> that<00:03:36.910> they

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
quite you know quite solid that they

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.910 
quite you know quite solid that they
will<00:03:37.180> continue<00:03:37.630> with<00:03:37.720> this<00:03:37.840> which<00:03:38.079> in<00:03:38.560> my

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
will continue with this which in my

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.069 
will continue with this which in my
opinion<00:03:39.090> I'd<00:03:40.090> like<00:03:40.299> to<00:03:40.420> have<00:03:40.510> my<00:03:40.630> opinion<00:03:40.989> on

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
opinion I'd like to have my opinion on

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.069 
opinion I'd like to have my opinion on
this<00:03:41.230> matter<00:03:41.290> but<00:03:41.980> it's<00:03:42.700> just<00:03:42.970> so<00:03:43.540> silly<00:03:43.840> and

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
this matter but it's just so silly and

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.330 
this matter but it's just so silly and
wiping<00:03:44.470> it's<00:03:44.680> only<00:03:44.859> going<00:03:44.980> to<00:03:45.040> end<00:03:45.190> up<00:03:45.280> with

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
wiping it's only going to end up with

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.220 
wiping it's only going to end up with
more<00:03:45.519> crashed<00:03:45.850> cars<00:03:46.150> than<00:03:46.359> they're<00:03:46.570> currently

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
more crashed cars than they're currently

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.380 
more crashed cars than they're currently
also<00:03:47.590> yet<00:03:48.100> I<00:03:48.250> think<00:03:48.519> it's<00:03:48.609> a<00:03:48.700> really<00:03:49.120> bad<00:03:49.359> thing

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
also yet I think it's a really bad thing

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.110 
also yet I think it's a really bad thing
and<00:03:49.810> I<00:03:49.870> think<00:03:50.109> it's<00:03:50.890> in<00:03:51.070> most<00:03:51.609> of<00:03:51.820> the<00:03:51.910> team's

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
and I think it's in most of the team's

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.930 
and I think it's in most of the team's
best<00:03:52.390> interest<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:52.959> fight<00:03:53.140> against<00:03:53.530> this<00:03:53.650> and

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
best interest to fight against this and

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.479 
best interest to fight against this and
you<00:03:54.940> know<00:03:55.030> get<00:03:55.239> this<00:03:55.359> over<00:03:55.660> turd<00:03:55.900> and<00:03:56.489> also

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
you know get this over turd and also

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.069 
you know get this over turd and also
Bernie<00:03:57.760> accident<00:03:58.239> i<00:03:58.390> was<00:03:58.480> looking<00:03:58.720> at<00:03:58.750> earlier

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
Bernie accident i was looking at earlier

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.990 
Bernie accident i was looking at earlier
on<00:03:59.109> in<00:03:59.260> this<00:03:59.350> video<00:03:59.680> has<00:04:00.190> been<00:04:00.220> saying<00:04:00.670> quite<00:04:00.940> a

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
on in this video has been saying quite a

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.910 
on in this video has been saying quite a
lot<00:04:01.329> that<00:04:01.600> he<00:04:01.720> wants<00:04:01.930> to<00:04:01.959> have<00:04:02.109> less<00:04:02.350> teams<00:04:02.709> on

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
lot that he wants to have less teams on

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.420 
lot that he wants to have less teams on
the<00:04:03.070> grid<00:04:03.310> which<00:04:03.850> is<00:04:04.030> baffling<00:04:04.600> to<00:04:04.660> me<00:04:04.840> because

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
the grid which is baffling to me because

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.770 
the grid which is baffling to me because
surely<00:04:06.430> you'd<00:04:06.549> want<00:04:06.760> war<00:04:06.970> teams<00:04:07.239> on<00:04:07.450> the<00:04:07.570> grid

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
surely you'd want war teams on the grid

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.800 
surely you'd want war teams on the grid
you<00:04:08.079> know<00:04:08.200> somewhere<00:04:09.160> like<00:04:09.340> nesco<00:04:09.940> ok<00:04:10.660> I<00:04:10.690> don't

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
you know somewhere like nesco ok I don't

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.960 
you know somewhere like nesco ok I don't
want<00:04:10.900> to<00:04:11.049> compare<00:04:11.380> f12<00:04:11.799> ness<00:04:11.980> car<00:04:12.220> but<00:04:12.489> there

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
want to compare f12 ness car but there

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.030 
want to compare f12 ness car but there
are<00:04:13.060> so<00:04:13.209> many<00:04:13.299> teams<00:04:13.630> in<00:04:13.810> esco<00:04:14.230> on<00:04:14.350> a<00:04:14.530> lot<00:04:14.829> that

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
are so many teams in esco on a lot that

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.009 
are so many teams in esco on a lot that
had<00:04:15.160> the<00:04:15.250> chance<00:04:15.489> of<00:04:15.730> winning<00:04:16.060> and<00:04:16.209> I<00:04:16.959> think

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
had the chance of winning and I think

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.659 
had the chance of winning and I think
the<00:04:17.380> more<00:04:17.530> teams<00:04:17.769> you<00:04:17.919> could<00:04:17.950> have<00:04:18.250> informal

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
the more teams you could have informal

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.250 
the more teams you could have informal
one<00:04:18.820> the<00:04:18.940> more<00:04:19.120> chance<00:04:19.419> there<00:04:19.539> is<00:04:19.720> of<00:04:19.810> having

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
one the more chance there is of having

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.659 
one the more chance there is of having
someone<00:04:20.530> else<00:04:20.560> is<00:04:20.890> going<00:04:21.010> to<00:04:21.070> be<00:04:21.250> winning<00:04:21.580> the

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
someone else is going to be winning the

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.810 
someone else is going to be winning the
race<00:04:21.820> and<00:04:22.169> I<00:04:23.250> want<00:04:24.250> to<00:04:24.310> see<00:04:24.430> that<00:04:24.580> I<00:04:24.610> want<00:04:24.789> to

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
race and I want to see that I want to

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.100 
race and I want to see that I want to
see<00:04:24.940> different<00:04:25.120> people<00:04:25.360> on<00:04:25.599> the<00:04:25.659> podium<00:04:25.870> I

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
see different people on the podium I

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.910 
see different people on the podium I
don't<00:04:26.320> want<00:04:26.470> to<00:04:26.530> see<00:04:26.620> this

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
don't want to see this

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.280 
don't want to see this
team<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.760> same<00:04:28.000> drive<00:04:28.330> on<00:04:28.510> the<00:04:28.600> top<00:04:29.050> step<00:04:29.230> of

team the same drive on the top step of

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.140 
team the same drive on the top step of
the<00:04:29.350> podium<00:04:29.410> every<00:04:30.070> single<00:04:30.250> race<00:04:30.550> is<00:04:30.820> so

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
the podium every single race is so

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.170 
the podium every single race is so
boring<00:04:31.950> you<00:04:32.950> know<00:04:33.070> even<00:04:33.520> if<00:04:33.760> you're<00:04:33.880> a<00:04:33.910> fan<00:04:34.150> of

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
boring you know even if you're a fan of

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.150 
boring you know even if you're a fan of
that<00:04:34.360> driver<00:04:34.630> is<00:04:34.900> surely<00:04:35.380> boring<00:04:35.770> to<00:04:35.890> see<00:04:36.040> that

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
that driver is surely boring to see that

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.200 
that driver is surely boring to see that
person<00:04:36.490> on<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.670> top<00:04:36.820> step<00:04:37.000> of<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.150> podium

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
person on the top step of the podium

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.050 
person on the top step of the podium
every<00:04:37.930> single<00:04:38.290> race<00:04:38.440> it's<00:04:39.280> just<00:04:39.460> not<00:04:39.520> fun<00:04:39.850> than

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
every single race it's just not fun than

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.820 
every single race it's just not fun than
I<00:04:40.120> think<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.420> more<00:04:40.570> teams<00:04:40.810> we<00:04:40.990> have<00:04:41.020> the<00:04:41.650> more

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
I think the more teams we have the more

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.200 
I think the more teams we have the more
chance<00:04:42.130> we<00:04:42.220> have<00:04:42.400> of<00:04:42.430> you<00:04:42.820> know<00:04:42.940> somebody

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
chance we have of you know somebody

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.300 
chance we have of you know somebody
different<00:04:43.390> on<00:04:43.690> top<00:04:43.840> step<00:04:44.050> of<00:04:44.080> the<00:04:44.200> podium<00:04:44.310> even

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
different on top step of the podium even

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.740 
different on top step of the podium even
if<00:04:45.460> you<00:04:45.610> know<00:04:45.730> it's<00:04:45.970> a<00:04:46.030> bit<00:04:46.240> you<00:04:46.450> know<00:04:46.540> even

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
if you know it's a bit you know even

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.180 
if you know it's a bit you know even
though<00:04:46.930> it's<00:04:47.080> unlikely<00:04:47.200> they'll<00:04:47.770> come<00:04:47.980> in<00:04:48.010> and

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
though it's unlikely they'll come in and

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.920 
though it's unlikely they'll come in and
