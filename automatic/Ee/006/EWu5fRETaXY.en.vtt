was<00:02:21.350> before<00:02:21.410> so<00:02:22.400> I<00:02:22.430> haven't<00:02:22.730> made<00:02:23.000> any<00:02:23.240> changes

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
was before so I haven't made any changes

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.910 
was before so I haven't made any changes
to<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.780> hair<00:02:24.050> at<00:02:24.530> all<00:02:24.860> I<00:02:26.260> haven't<00:02:27.260> cut<00:02:27.470> it<00:02:27.650> any

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
differently this is the same exact way

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.390

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.730 
that was in my hair before the only
difference<00:02:34.760> is<00:02:35.000> my<00:02:35.720> part<00:02:35.990> is<00:02:36.110> different<00:02:36.530> so
