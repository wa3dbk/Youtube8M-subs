00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 very auspicious day called 2000 is not me 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.279
 javier muñiz and welcome to a new 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.750
 video with tips for writers the 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.700
 another day we were watching is the 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.410
 tips from the master of terror stephen 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.420
 king to write a novel that is what 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.650
 who uses what he does but 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.080
 this week of giving you a focus 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.150
 different than I found another article 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.160
 I really like the advice 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.650
 of pixar the toy story company 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.660
 looking for nemo and so on 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.070
 tips that give to write good 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.380
 stories them what is it they use 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.910
 what are your maxims and the truth I do not know 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.199
 you but I am a huge fan 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.820
 of picks to then said today we have 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.250
 let's take a look to see how 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.450
 because I find the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.489
 especially the way they 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.200
 tell the stories of transmitting 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.850
 get to the people worth it is clear that it is 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.129
 a very visual narrative always pixar 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.899
 plays a lot with the movements of 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.510
 characters with this kind of animation 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.039
 classic but I still find it very 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.110
 interesting and how they synthesize the 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.460
 stories and how we can learn a lot 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.559
 at the time of creating our own 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.390
 novels so I'll be going to give a review 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.920
 the tips to see what you think 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.930
 first that says pixar is that we admire 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.329
 the characters for their attempts more than 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.949
 for his successes is that well more than having 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.920
 characters that are perfect and what 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.750
 do all the first 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.610
 we have these poor imps for 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.409
 example as nemo that is lost or 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.049
 bulgari who does not know what is 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.790
 doing with their life that they transmit to us 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.860
 that empathy that tenderness because all the 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.460
 we shit from time to time 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.920
 quite often I also and is more 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.700
 easy to identify with these characters 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.409
 we have also been in always in 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.180
 count the reader's perspective or the 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.289
 viewer in this case putting the 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.390
 same as the creator's always 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.670
 we think we often do 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.380
 things or Paul and faster or by trying 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.180
 give more pomp more hype to what 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.619
 we are already doing the best 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.819
 to see that something simpler that 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.530
 we have to see we have to think that 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:43.330
 is what we wanted to see us in a 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.470
 story something that I liked a lot 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.840
 horizon is also that you can define 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.940
 the theme of the story but you will not see 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.560
 the finished plot you will not understand from 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.640
 what's the movie going on until you finish 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.409
 make it that is a bit paradoxical 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.049
 so basically what they tell you is 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.390
 that you look for a topic to develop it is 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.429
 a little as you can and then once 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.860
 you have finished scribes and come back to 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:04.630
 do it because you're going to get more juice 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.130
 the story in that way something pretty 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.720
 typical that also works well is 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.519
 think how comfortable the 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.590
 character what he is good at and 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.880
 send it precisely to the discomfort 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.250
 more absolute take out 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.040
 the comfort zone make this 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.290
 bitch the character and see how he overcomes 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.120
 that challenge this is a classic but 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.800
 something that I have not tried works very well 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.090
 and they also say and I think it's very 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.380
 interesting I'm going to try it for the 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.510
 next novel is that they tell you that 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.220
 when you attack instead of making a 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.660
 list with things that could happen 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.980
 to list them with what you're sure 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.870
 that will not happen in any of the 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.090
 ways that often come from that 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.840
 way the end is being discovered 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.490
 you only see when discarding ideas almost 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.680
 that are appearing those that have to 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.270
 be logically the following follows is a 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.770
 point that I use and I have told you that 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.390
 once the stories are dissected 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.840
 that we like as I said 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.450
 many times almost all the stories of 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.980
 a style have the same structure what 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.020
 I have said since the war of galaxies 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.300
 harry potter the lion king 'in fact I saw 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.370
 an infographic of this type on the web 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.740
 that you put the characters the 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.180
 truth is that they followed more or less the 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.790
 same development had the same 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.470
 friends there were the same enemies at 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.480
 end one has to find what formulas 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.120
 what formulas are attractive 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.580
 for us that we like and work at 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.120
 from them one of the most important things 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.640
 nice you've read is what it says 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.890
 you think why you have to count 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.290
 that story because you need to get it out 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.940
 because you need to tell the world there 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.739
 is where is your heart really that 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.120
 is what you have to tell because it is 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.860
 important that story for you what is 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.299
 what is special about the moment 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.940
 you find that the story is written 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.530
 you just have to have a reason and already 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.030
 to finish the pixel proposes something 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.950
 very interesting that tells us to take 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.920
 a movie that we have seen and that does not 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.360
 we liked it and as an exercise 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.030
 let's think how we would do the plot better 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.379
 that we would change that we would add that 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.690
 we would do to give him more rhythm to do 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:56.420
 what we like is a very 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.280
 interesting and with this we can see how 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.810
 we could be left with his new story to 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.200
 starting from one that does not work does not 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.650
 liked how we could do an improved 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.120
 that story with the characters this 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.920
 Believe me, that's a pretty good idea 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.989
 in fact it is this I think that the 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.220
 seized even díaz has been this 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.930

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.500
 chao video 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.110
 advice number one writes a expected 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.570
 central one main idea and then 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.580
 many more subplots although they do not have 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.750
 nothing to do or very little in the case of 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.990
 girl the shoe was when I started 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.970
 write it three years ago so the idea 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.490
 general of what seemed like a 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.070
 Five lines text is good you go to 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.440
 start with a generic idea I want 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:03.690
 that my novel will of a person 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.690
 go america and discover non-sexist
