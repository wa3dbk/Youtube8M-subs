00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.430
 welcome to another 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.460
 video of comics software 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:14.219
 it is now something here is what I am 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:16.289
 That's why you promised how to 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.850
 a weapon sound one has committed murder 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.199
 for example the berliner sound that we 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.380
 have brought us but it still goes on 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.019
 other sounds at least if you're with 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:31.740
 this file is mounted by the cnn 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:36.860
 difference point is this without 54 eg 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:46.710
 open volume real size has 1760 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:48.030
 1066 1002 and that is why it is meant 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.730
 you did not want the whole game 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.620
 Of course, do not reinstall then 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.780
 the manufacturing launcher from the So 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.680
 installation you can speak your language 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.260
 He clicks on ours then you see 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.619
 also very different at the top 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.820
 puncto point it abl 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:14.430
 because these three are the ones he has to 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.530
 be restored then he gives 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.619
 the serious 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.150
 then you choose your father so it is 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.580
 Of course, that's not the right father 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.549
 it is just an illustration where the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.930
 Ride around pleasing ones would have to be a lot 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.970
 builds so if a little call of duty 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.540
 Select vaart and then the sound 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.390
 file him in the call of duty 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.439
 installation folder 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:42.950
 I play possession of steam 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:46.970
 that's why it's going to work out that way 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.909
 come when she is over steam and then 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.369
 Games do not matter if the maps are coming 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:59.659
 head with call of duty black ops 2 and 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:01.700
 then sound is on ok install 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.219
 already you have the installed mine 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.069
 Not at all, I just wanted that too 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:09.289
 just say how to restore that 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:11.510
 I think I can bring it 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.250
 a complete production manager 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.010
 foreign complete sounds again 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.379
 manufacture can but I have to 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:25.209
 Research if this is not prohibited 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:25.209
 Well, yes, it does not matter and
