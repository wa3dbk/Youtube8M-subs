okay so I've been looking for a

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.959 
okay so I've been looking for a
Bluetooth<00:00:09.840> speaker<00:00:09.990> for<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.440> while<00:00:10.679> and<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:11.759> just

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
Bluetooth speaker for a while and I just

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.450 
Bluetooth speaker for a while and I just
happened<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.269> pick<00:00:12.450> this<00:00:12.570> one<00:00:12.630> up<00:00:12.780> today<00:00:12.960> I

happened to pick this one up today I

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.029 
happened to pick this one up today I
know<00:00:14.460> there's<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.700> lot<00:00:14.820> of<00:00:16.010> Bluetooth<00:00:17.010> speakers

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
know there's a lot of Bluetooth speakers

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.000 
know there's a lot of Bluetooth speakers
such<00:00:17.640> as<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.880> jawbone<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.960> beats<00:00:19.380> pill

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
such as the jawbone and the beats pill

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.290 
such as the jawbone and the beats pill
and<00:00:20.310> all<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.550> other<00:00:20.670> ones<00:00:20.880> but<00:00:21.029> those<00:00:21.150> are

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
and all the other ones but those are

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.349 
and all the other ones but those are
about<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.510> $20<00:00:21.960> range<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.529> this<00:00:23.310> one<00:00:23.550> was<00:00:23.760> $100

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
about the $20 range so this one was $100

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.599 
about the $20 range so this one was $100
and<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.960> was<00:00:25.050> half-price<00:00:25.500> for<00:00:25.529> 50<00:00:26.039> dollars<00:00:26.160> so

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
and it was half-price for 50 dollars so

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.310 
and it was half-price for 50 dollars so
I<00:00:26.640> figured<00:00:27.920> why<00:00:28.920> not<00:00:28.949> check<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.400> out<00:00:29.779> this<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.810> a

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
I figured why not check it out this is a

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.780 
I figured why not check it out this is a
bluetooth<00:00:31.710> speaker<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.189> can<00:00:32.279> connect<00:00:32.669> it

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
bluetooth speaker so you can connect it

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.650 
bluetooth speaker so you can connect it
to<00:00:33.890> smartphones<00:00:34.890> tablets<00:00:35.760> anything

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
to smartphones tablets anything

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.540 
to smartphones tablets anything
essentially<00:00:37.050> does<00:00:37.200> Bluetooth<00:00:37.530> enabled<00:00:37.739> it's

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
essentially does Bluetooth enabled it's

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.850 
essentially does Bluetooth enabled it's
a<00:00:38.850> really<00:00:39.120> compact<00:00:39.510> ultra<00:00:39.960> portable<00:00:40.200> speaker

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
a really compact ultra portable speaker

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.119 
a really compact ultra portable speaker
which<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.520> says<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.450> produce<00:00:42.690> high<00:00:43.079> quality

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
which is says to produce high quality

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.069 
which is says to produce high quality
sound<00:00:44.129> has<00:00:45.120> an<00:00:45.239> internal<00:00:45.570> battery<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.989> can

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
sound has an internal battery that can

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.209 
sound has an internal battery that can
last<00:00:46.140> up<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.410> 12<00:00:46.800> hours

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
last up to 12 hours

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.770 
last up to 12 hours
I<00:00:47.460> think<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:47.820> fifteen<00:00:48.210> hundred<00:00:48.570> milliamps

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
I think it's fifteen hundred milliamps

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.220 
I think it's fifteen hundred milliamps
lithium<00:00:49.559> battery<00:00:50.480> you<00:00:51.480> can<00:00:51.570> also<00:00:51.750> connect<00:00:52.079> it

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
lithium battery you can also connect it

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.020 
lithium battery you can also connect it
through<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.710> 3.5<00:00:53.460> millimeter<00:00:54.120> jack<00:00:56.030> audio

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
through the 3.5 millimeter jack audio

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.490 
through the 3.5 millimeter jack audio
cable<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.840> don't<00:00:58.050> know<00:00:58.109> if<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.350> don't

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
cable so you don't know if you don't

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.139 
cable so you don't know if you don't
have<00:00:58.649> bluetooth<00:00:59.039> or<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.760> don't<00:00:59.940> want<00:01:00.090> to

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
have bluetooth or you don't want to

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.450 
have bluetooth or you don't want to
enable<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.570> save<00:01:00.989> battery<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:02.010> includes<00:01:02.430> a

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
enable it to save battery it includes a

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.810 
enable it to save battery it includes a
USB<00:01:02.820> port<00:01:03.120> for<00:01:03.390> charging<00:01:03.629> on-the-go<00:01:04.729> so<00:01:05.729> you

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
USB port for charging on-the-go so you

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.310 
USB port for charging on-the-go so you
can<00:01:06.000> connect<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.080> pretty<00:01:07.200> much

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
can connect this to and pretty much

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.690 
can connect this to and pretty much
anything<00:01:07.790> Wireless<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:11.159> unique<00:01:11.460> feature

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
actually also serves as a power bank for

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.330 
actually also serves as a power bank for
external<00:01:16.049> charging<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.619> cell<00:01:16.860> phones<00:01:17.130> and

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:33.550 
was gonna get any bass out of this unit
but<00:04:31.639> the<00:04:32.090> actually<00:04:32.630> it<00:04:32.720> does<00:04:32.900> with<00:04:33.199> this<00:04:33.320> pump

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
but the actually it does with this pump

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.680 
but the actually it does with this pump
for<00:04:34.460> a<00:04:34.490> small<00:04:34.729> unit<00:04:35.030> like<00:04:35.210> it<00:04:35.419> this<00:04:35.630> is

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
for a small unit like it this is

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.170 
for a small unit like it this is
probably<00:04:36.250> recommended<00:04:37.250> for<00:04:37.400> a<00:04:37.430> small<00:04:37.729> room<00:04:37.970> if

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
probably recommended for a small room if

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.930 
probably recommended for a small room if
you<00:04:38.570> have<00:04:38.720> this<00:04:38.900> outdoors<00:04:39.440> I<00:04:39.729> probably<00:04:40.729> will

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
you have this outdoors I probably will

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.460 
you have this outdoors I probably will
recommend<00:04:41.389> that<00:04:41.419> the<00:04:41.570> sound<00:04:41.810> would<00:04:42.080> probably

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
recommend that the sound would probably

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.749 
recommend that the sound would probably
just<00:04:42.620> dissipate<00:04:43.009> in<00:04:43.130> all<00:04:43.280> right<00:04:43.430> so<00:04:43.490> the<00:04:43.699> other

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 
just dissipate in all right so the other

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.909 
just dissipate in all right so the other
song<00:04:44.060> worst<00:04:44.240> mostest<00:04:44.780> test<00:04:45.050> vocals<00:04:45.530> this<00:04:45.740> is

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
song worst mostest test vocals this is

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.290 
song worst mostest test vocals this is
gonna<00:04:46.099> test<00:04:46.430> a<00:04:46.550> little<00:04:46.729> bit<00:04:46.849> more<00:04:47.000> the<00:04:47.120> bass

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
gonna test a little bit more the bass

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:59.360
