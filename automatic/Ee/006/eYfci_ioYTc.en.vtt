00:00:00.889 --> 00:00:05.120
 lately come again 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.730
 we ask that you do not 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.099
 Hi, I'm Madrid and I'm thinking of your 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.509
 eyes and your eyes be in this video 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.220
 first they bring a very good temple and 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:22.000
 Today I do not have a little trick 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.230
 although I bring no advice or something like that 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.570
 good has done while doing well as a 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.880
 trick that right now I will say I want 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.970
 infinitely thank everyone 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.040
 you to all my subscribers that I 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.290
 those who voted for me in king helped 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.140
 of the music very many thanks 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.269
 I did not forget about you, no, 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.710
 I did not say this about the awards and that 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:44.899
 It was because I had not reached the 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.360
 prize at the best price but now a week 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.850
 last I got the award I warned them 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.579
 you and everything and I did a survey 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.010
 I did a survey in Miami in my 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:58.879
 facebook and I asked you to hear 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:02.090
 tell me who prefer prefer to raffle 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.100
 the three codes of 1500 points between 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.660
 all my subscribers so I heard that 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.119
 new people can enter because the 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.820
 it's really very difficult to monitor 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.259
 I have six thousand subscribers 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.300
 Imagine knowing who is my subscriber 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.090
 and who does not other people who face 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.649
 to enter because a lot of the truth 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.600
 Many subscribers arrive when you do 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.420
 raffles or when gifts arrive 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.659
 many subscribers but the truth is that 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.859
 it was not the purpose the purpose was 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.140
 thank you and then give them the 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:32.630
 honor not for having helped me because 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.789
 I only sing super good or not 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.709
 sing super good or whatever or be it or 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.090
 be creative do not be creative without the help 

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:39.920
 of you I could not have achieved it 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.649
 the goal if you had not voted 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.399
 for me at the awards if there was not 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.350
 could win so good 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.509
 I asked them what do they prefer me to do 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.340
 I do not know what I said earlier that I do 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.079
 a raffle and they can enter any 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.750
 all the people who would like to enter 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:02:01.069
 and then if they are going to point there in a 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.379
 commenting video is not something like that and good 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.270
 it was going to be the raffle not like that or they preferred that 

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:07.549
 to my three best subscribers 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.629
 give away the points on your behalf 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:13.310
 and to make a thank-you video 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:15.140
 fortunately and good they were not 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.780
 fortunately, but I also 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.269
 I thought like that and I said well it would be much better 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.069
 and it would be I would prefer it to be earned 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.100
 a good a subscriber of mine that is good 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.720
 subscriber 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.110

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.820

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.600
 Well, no, I prefer it to be 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.790
 someone that is faithful and that I 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.780
 see that it is always there is no 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.610

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.590
