that<00:01:35.489> try<00:01:36.489> to<00:01:36.520> keep<00:01:36.729> the<00:01:36.909> unit<00:01:37.780> twisted<00:01:38.289> a

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:38.319 
that try to keep the unit twisted a

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.050 
that try to keep the unit twisted a
little<00:01:38.470> bit<00:01:38.679> to<00:01:38.799> the<00:01:38.890> left<00:01:39.130> that<00:01:39.700> will<00:01:39.759> prevent

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
little bit to the left that will prevent

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.569 
little bit to the left that will prevent
the<00:01:40.209> unit<00:01:40.479> from<00:01:40.659> doing<00:01:41.020> this<00:01:41.229> pin<00:01:41.950> to<00:01:42.069> the<00:01:42.159> left

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
the unit from doing this pin to the left

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:44.429 
the unit from doing this pin to the left
you<00:01:43.270> know<00:01:43.390> if<00:01:43.689> I'm<00:01:43.840> over<00:01:44.020> here<00:01:44.110> trying<00:01:44.229> to<00:01:44.349> work

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
you know if I'm over here trying to work

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.949 
you know if I'm over here trying to work
with<00:01:44.619> this<00:01:44.709> one<00:01:44.890> it's<00:01:45.880> clicking<00:01:46.630> back<00:01:46.810> in

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:46.959 
with this one it's clicking back in

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:48.449 
with this one it's clicking back in
place<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:47.470> then<00:01:47.590> you<00:01:47.679> have<00:01:47.770> to<00:01:47.860> go<00:01:47.979> back<00:01:48.310> and

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
place and then you have to go back and

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:51.359 
place and then you have to go back and
repeat<00:01:48.670> so<00:01:49.259> it's<00:01:50.259> possible<00:01:50.560> that<00:01:50.799> these<00:01:51.099> legs

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
repeat so it's possible that these legs

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.559 
repeat so it's possible that these legs
will<00:01:51.610> try<00:01:52.270> to<00:01:52.299> snap<00:01:52.569> back<00:01:52.599> up<00:01:52.989> and<00:01:54.390> just<00:01:55.390> kind

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569 
will try to snap back up and just kind

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:57.749 
will try to snap back up and just kind
of<00:01:55.599> get<00:01:56.259> frustrating<00:01:56.770> if<00:01:56.860> you<00:01:56.979> let<00:01:57.429> it<00:01:57.459> so

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
of get frustrating if you let it so
