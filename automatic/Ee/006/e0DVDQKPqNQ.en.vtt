sitting there in a soap dish and so

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.150 
sitting there in a soap dish and so
that's<00:04:58.860> where<00:04:59.280> it<00:04:59.900> just<00:05:00.900> a<00:05:01.050> color<00:05:01.290> just<00:05:01.620> faded

in<00:05:05.850> the<00:05:06.300> dish<00:05:06.540> and<00:05:07.670> it<00:05:08.670> just<00:05:08.850> faded<00:05:09.090> but<00:05:09.480> yeah
