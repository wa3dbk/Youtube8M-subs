 good night friends of youtube the day 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.259
 today I bring you the video that I already had 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.840
 has drawn analysis to the character of 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.480
 roman range I finally could do it and here 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.429
 they have it I'm working on the jimmy 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.770
 of fanboy and hater for it have not 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.289
 appeared in the videos but they will be 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.510
 soon back we also have the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.580
 character of stephanie mcmann I do not know 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.769
 very good how to wear it and I'm thinking 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.019
 in putting the character of a rat child 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.140
 channel everything to make more fun the 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.809
 videos as always the material is yours 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.969
 as a user and subscriber so if 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.129
 you have ideas of how to use the characters 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.840
 or a new one as they will be welcome 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.750
 leave them in comments 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.059
 saying this I move on to the next note and it's 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.649
 that nobody has hit at all 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.600
 question from the previous video of 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.030
 gutting finishers on jones and na 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.160
 although the full answer is already in 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.590
 the comments did not say a single 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.960
 user in the gutting video 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.969
 finishers number 2 I will say the answer and 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.890
 the winner (s) 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.199
 said winners will add their first point 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.690
 later in the channel I will say so 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.820
 the points at the end of the analysis 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.010
 I will be the last news since I want 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.650
 Do not forget for now 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.350
 metamonos to the material I already have it to 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.300

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.180
 uses roman has made a great career 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.370
 sporting in the last seven years of 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.590
 young roman played professional soccer 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.290
 taking him to be a rookie of the Vikings 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.930
 of Minnesota in the nfl step by several 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.050
 teams like his cousin wayne and finally 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.600
 in 2010 change of discipline aimed at 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.180

 roman riquelme ww development dam 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.790
 at that time the fcw having good 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.890
 fiefs from the beginning in addition to 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.680
 impulse itself from the influences of its 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.050
 Roman family made interesting feuds 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.270
 curiously being the most important 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.300
 against rolling and dynamic set 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.730
 currently his shield mates in 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.140
 that time several triple battles 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.760
 threatens where román 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.459
 and they took most of the 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.800
 victories was champion of florida 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.620
 championship wrestling until in 2011 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.720
 the brand went to the pipe and we saw its way 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.940
 to the enee cyst in this made its debut 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.590
 shortly after becoming the brand 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.420
 of development where its main 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.300
 opponent was the hair warrior 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.000
 bicolor cedolins being one of the 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.610
 best roman exponents with their 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.010
 ancient rivals converted a group that 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.050
 debuted on the main roster being the 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.870
 guards and guardians of the regime 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.420
 triple h attacking the whole world being 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.120
 big show mark henry and daniel bryan 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.370
 some of his first victims the 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.380
 shield made an impact unbeatable but I 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.300
 I will focus only on roman maybe then 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.120
 I will make one on the shield in general 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.370
 Roman a few months became champion 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.890
 of couples with their earlier rival 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.780
 is of rollins beating the team gel no 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.690
 in a fight where the losing team 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.209
 besides everything went down the drain to 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.519
 principle ding ambrós painted as leader 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.830
 of the whole but the people saw román 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.450
 as the most powerful being this noticed 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.670
 by the directors of 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.489
 Roman began to be who appeared as 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.739
 the head of the group being over and over 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.810
 time the victors against superstars 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.700
 of all kinds román and his team were 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.610
 beaten by the robot brothers 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.610
 losing belts in pairs 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.620
 they arrived at the royal course to 2014 in this 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.200
 as a group they dispatched several rivals 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.480
 being eliminated almost at the end of the 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.940
 fight first denizet at the same time 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.430
 with a double loop and finally roman 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.830
 being about to win was pulled by 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.019
 batista being this the winner 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.030
 this action caused people to back 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.250
 a little more to reigns since the 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.069
 majority was against the return and 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.440
 meteoric rise of the animal in west him 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.870
 mania 30 faced with the shield to 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.760
 Kanye the modern outlaws in a match 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.160
 express that only served to make a 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.040
 change to the team returning from the rough to 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.049
 technicians betraying the triple h 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.150
 Roman and the shield confronted him and 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.919
 evolution in extreme rules where 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.070
 they took a great battle and a 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:22.320
 extraordinary victory at the moment román 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.570
 and the shield are kept together but in 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.700
 the individual is expected the Samoan 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.430
 manages to reach the top obtaining in 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.710
 some time the championship of the wwf 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.110
 undoubtedly one of the greatest talents 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.050
 that the company has a great future 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:40.620

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:44.039

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.080
 extras one in the photo we can see 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:47.970
 roman and the uses when they were players 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.450
 American football before his 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.729
 foray into wrestling 2 the end and 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.860
 to be of román is the spear being for me 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.810
 I like the third best applicator 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.260
 movement only from behind weak 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.330
 goldberg and the edge 3 román has 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.220
 turned his scream with open arms 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.080
 in a danger figure so much for 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.669
 apply the spear as for the triple 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.060
 injustice bomb with their 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:13.950
 old mates shield 4 people 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.010
 believes that román is there for having been 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:19.340
 just a spoiled however román day 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.169
 to day he has earned his place on the roster 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.240
 possibly be a champion of power and 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:27.330
 would be a great champion for the company 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.520
