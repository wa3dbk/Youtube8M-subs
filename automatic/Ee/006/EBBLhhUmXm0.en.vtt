armor<00:03:31.160> in-game<00:03:31.490> and<00:03:31.730> with<00:03:31.910> this<00:03:32.120> I<00:03:32.860> you<00:03:33.860> know<00:03:34.010> I

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
armor in-game and with this I you know I

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.740 
armor in-game and with this I you know I
think<00:03:34.250> it's<00:03:34.550> one<00:03:34.730> of<00:03:34.760> those<00:03:34.940> internet<00:03:35.360> Nexus

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
think it's one of those internet Nexus

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.900 
think it's one of those internet Nexus
weapons<00:03:36.500> at<00:03:36.740> first<00:03:37.010> when<00:03:37.160> I<00:03:37.190> looked<00:03:37.459> at<00:03:37.550> this<00:03:37.730> I

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
weapons at first when I looked at this I

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.000 
weapons at first when I looked at this I
thought<00:03:38.180> this<00:03:38.540> was<00:03:38.720> like<00:03:38.750> a<00:03:39.110> remixed<00:03:39.920> version

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
thought this was like a remixed version

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.860 
thought this was like a remixed version
of<00:03:40.520> the<00:03:40.640> shark<00:03:40.970> Reaper<00:03:41.300> from<00:03:41.510> tool

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
instruction but no this is actually the

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.340 
instruction but no this is actually the
winterizer<00:03:45.620> if<00:03:46.040> I<00:03:46.459> know<00:03:47.120> know<00:03:47.420> a<00:03:47.780> pretty<00:03:48.170> shoe
