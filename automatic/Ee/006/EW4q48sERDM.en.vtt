humans<00:05:11.470> so<00:05:11.919> we're<00:05:12.039> going<00:05:12.130> to<00:05:12.220> stop<00:05:12.490> feeding

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
humans so we're going to stop feeding

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:15.210 
humans so we're going to stop feeding
roadkill<00:05:13.479> to<00:05:14.110> pigs<00:05:14.560> and<00:05:14.740> chickens<00:05:14.770> which

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
roadkill to pigs and chickens which

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.629 
roadkill to pigs and chickens which
humans<00:05:15.520> eat<00:05:16.020> but<00:05:17.020> really<00:05:17.500> intuitively<00:05:18.220> you

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
humans eat but really intuitively you

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:21.120 
humans eat but really intuitively you
simply<00:05:19.030> know<00:05:19.240> that<00:05:19.539> it's<00:05:19.690> wrong<00:05:19.780> to<00:05:20.440> eat

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
simply know that it's wrong to eat

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.029 
simply know that it's wrong to eat
rotten<00:05:21.820> meat<00:05:22.210> or<00:05:22.509> to<00:05:23.080> eat<00:05:23.229> an<00:05:23.470> animal<00:05:23.680> like<00:05:23.979> a

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
rotten meat or to eat an animal like a

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:25.760 
rotten meat or to eat an animal like a
vulture<00:05:24.250> that<00:05:24.610> lives<00:05:24.789> off<00:05:24.910> of<00:05:24.970> rotten<00:05:25.389> meat

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
vulture that lives off of rotten meat

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.480 
vulture that lives off of rotten meat
now<00:05:26.770> theoretically<00:05:27.729> I<00:05:27.849> believe<00:05:28.449> the<00:05:28.660> reason

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
now theoretically I believe the reason

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.760 
now theoretically I believe the reason
almost<00:05:30.490> every<00:05:30.970> culture<00:05:31.240> on<00:05:31.449> earth<00:05:31.720> has<00:05:32.349> this

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
almost every culture on earth has this

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.399 
almost every culture on earth has this
prohibition<00:05:33.099> is<00:05:33.639> that<00:05:34.449> rotten<00:05:34.840> meat<00:05:34.990> is<00:05:35.169> full

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:35.409 
prohibition is that rotten meat is full

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:38.490 
prohibition is that rotten meat is full
of<00:05:36.300> neurotoxins<00:05:37.300> and<00:05:37.539> other<00:05:37.840> toxins<00:05:38.289> produced

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
of neurotoxins and other toxins produced

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.200 
of neurotoxins and other toxins produced
by<00:05:38.889> bacteria<00:05:39.039> and<00:05:39.490> I<00:05:39.580> went<00:05:39.760> over<00:05:39.909> this<00:05:40.000> in<00:05:40.060> a

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
by bacteria and I went over this in a

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.560 
by bacteria and I went over this in a
previous<00:05:40.449> video<00:05:40.750> basically<00:05:41.680> when<00:05:42.039> meat<00:05:42.220> rots

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
previous video basically when meat rots

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.719 
previous video basically when meat rots
bacteria<00:05:43.570> in<00:05:43.690> the<00:05:43.780> meat<00:05:43.930> produce<00:05:44.370> toxins<00:05:45.370> to

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
bacteria in the meat produce toxins to

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:47.520 
bacteria in the meat produce toxins to
stop<00:05:46.060> larger<00:05:46.599> animals<00:05:46.960> from<00:05:47.139> eating<00:05:47.260> that

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
stop larger animals from eating that

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.230 
stop larger animals from eating that
meat<00:05:47.740> so<00:05:47.889> that<00:05:47.919> the<00:05:48.130> bacteria<00:05:48.370> can<00:05:48.820> digest<00:05:48.849> the

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
meat so that the bacteria can digest the

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.600 
meat so that the bacteria can digest the
meat<00:05:49.270> themselves<00:05:49.870> and<00:05:50.460> neurotoxins<00:05:51.460> are<00:05:51.550> the

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
meat themselves and neurotoxins are the

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.129 
meat themselves and neurotoxins are the
most<00:05:51.729> effective<00:05:52.240> type<00:05:52.419> of<00:05:52.599> toxin<00:05:52.960> for

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:53.139 
most effective type of toxin for

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:55.800 
most effective type of toxin for
bacteria<00:05:53.560> to<00:05:53.590> produce<00:05:54.000> so<00:05:55.000> that's<00:05:55.509> why<00:05:55.780> you

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
bacteria to produce so that's why you

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.779 
bacteria to produce so that's why you
get<00:05:56.139> sick<00:05:56.409> when<00:05:56.560> you<00:05:56.710> eat<00:05:56.889> rotten<00:05:57.130> meat<00:05:57.460> it's

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
get sick when you eat rotten meat it's

00:05:57.789 --> 00:05:59.999 
get sick when you eat rotten meat it's
full<00:05:58.060> of<00:05:58.210> toxins<00:05:58.659> produced<00:05:58.900> by<00:05:59.229> bacteria<00:05:59.380> it's

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:00.009 
full of toxins produced by bacteria it's

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:02.040 
full of toxins produced by bacteria it's
kind<00:06:00.070> of<00:06:00.159> a<00:06:00.250> large<00:06:00.520> unstudied<00:06:00.970> field<00:06:01.360> and<00:06:01.659> we

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
kind of a large unstudied field and we

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.999 
kind of a large unstudied field and we
didn't<00:06:02.259> really<00:06:02.380> have<00:06:02.590> to<00:06:02.740> study<00:06:02.889> it

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:03.009 
didn't really have to study it

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:04.740 
didn't really have to study it
traditionally<00:06:03.580> because<00:06:03.820> people<00:06:04.120> knew<00:06:04.330> not<00:06:04.599> to

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
traditionally because people knew not to

unfortunately<00:06:11.889> today<00:06:12.220> we<00:06:13.000> feed

unfortunately today we feed
slaughterhouse<00:06:13.900> byproducts<00:06:14.770> and<00:06:14.889> a<00:06:15.250> lot<00:06:15.400> of

of potential things that we don't know
about<00:06:25.780> this<00:06:26.199> practice<00:06:26.409> what<00:06:27.280> we<00:06:27.400> do<00:06:27.610> know<00:06:27.820> is

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:27.849 
about this practice what we do know is

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:30.510 
about this practice what we do know is
that<00:06:28.120> traditionally<00:06:29.110> this<00:06:29.800> was<00:06:29.979> prohibited

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
that traditionally this was prohibited

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.909 
that traditionally this was prohibited
and<00:06:30.639> your<00:06:31.330> own<00:06:31.449> common<00:06:31.900> sense<00:06:31.930> tells<00:06:32.560> you<00:06:32.770> that

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 
and your own common sense tells you that

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:36.240 
and your own common sense tells you that
it's<00:06:33.070> wrong<00:06:33.370> to<00:06:33.610> eat<00:06:33.849> roadkill<00:06:34.950> no<00:06:35.950> matter<00:06:36.130> how

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.380 
much you cook the roadkill it's wrong to

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.250 
much you cook the roadkill it's wrong to
eat<00:06:38.590> an
