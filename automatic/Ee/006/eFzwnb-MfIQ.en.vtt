00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
like an iso on the middle you have the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.880 
like an iso on the middle you have the
eyeball<00:01:11.790> where<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.630> boss<00:01:12.960> creature

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
eyeball where is that this boss creature

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.609 
eyeball where is that this boss creature
which<00:01:14.250> gives<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.640> buff<00:01:14.850> when<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.180> kill<00:01:15.360> it

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
then you have two lanes and it's a

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.770 
then you have two lanes and it's a
trivia<00:01:18.720> tree<00:01:18.900> like<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.259> said<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.659> you're<00:01:21.659> able

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
trivia tree like I said so you're able

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.210 
trivia tree like I said so you're able
to<00:01:22.049> connect<00:01:22.320> through<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.619> middle<00:01:22.950> through

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
to connect through the middle through

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.100 
to connect through the middle through
the<00:01:23.340> other<00:01:23.490> line<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.000> there's<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.630> lot<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.780> team

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
the other line so there's a lot of team

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.050 
the other line so there's a lot of team
fights<00:01:25.470> there's<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.130> lot<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.340> there's<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.820> brush

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
fights there's a lot of there's a brush

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.830 
fights there's a lot of there's a brush
mechanic<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.750> course<00:01:29.090> there's<00:01:30.090> no<00:01:30.299> jungle<00:01:30.600> in

mechanic of course there's no jungle in
this<00:01:31.020> game<00:01:31.259> though<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.970> in<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.689> sort<00:01:34.079> of

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
sense so this it's I'd highly embraces

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.120 
sense so this it's I'd highly embraces
the<00:01:37.829> gameplay<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.549> not<00:01:38.939> farming<00:01:39.979> just<00:01:40.979> you

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
the gameplay of not farming just you

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.679 
the gameplay of not farming just you
need<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.369> poke<00:01:41.610> enemy<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.119> lay<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.540> have

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
need to poke enemy and lay and you have

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.030 
need to poke enemy and lay and you have

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
to harass them you have to kill them

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.340 
to harass them you have to kill them
that's<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.790> key<00:01:45.119> ponent<00:01:45.720> pashto<00:01:46.140> lanes

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
that's like the key ponent pashto lanes

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.069 
that's like the key ponent pashto lanes
it<00:01:47.280> doesn't<00:01:47.640> have<00:01:47.759> like<00:01:48.030> high-end<00:01:48.390> mechanics

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
it doesn't have like high-end mechanics

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.929 
it doesn't have like high-end mechanics
like<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.590> mean<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.189> statical<00:01:50.670> value

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
like I mean I and statical value

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.090 
like I mean I and statical value
compared<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.990> other<00:01:52.110> titles<00:01:52.560> because<00:01:52.770> you

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
compared to other titles because you

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.880 
compared to other titles because you
can't<00:01:53.369> really<00:01:53.490> freeze<00:01:53.939> lanes<00:01:54.329> or<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:55.619> can't

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
can't really freeze lanes or you can't

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.929 
can't really freeze lanes or you can't
really<00:01:56.130> proxy<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:57.000> game<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.689> do<00:01:58.939> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
really proxy in this game to do the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.139 
really proxy in this game to do the
shape<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.450> map<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.460> can<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:03.030> know

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
shape of the map and you can you know

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.580 
shape of the map and you can you know
and<00:02:03.360> there's<00:02:03.509> no<00:02:03.719> last<00:02:03.960> hitting<00:02:04.170> in<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.439> game

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
and there's no last hitting in the game

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.859 
and there's no last hitting in the game
so<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.490> there's<00:02:05.880> no<00:02:06.030> matter<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.479> game<00:02:06.630> so

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
so and there's no matter in the game so

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.779 
so and there's no matter in the game so
it's<00:02:07.049> all<00:02:07.229> cool<00:02:07.439> down<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.520> ball<00:02:08.700> about

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
it's all cool down so it's a ball about

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.320 
it's all cool down so it's a ball about
timing<00:02:09.780> your<00:02:10.050> spell's<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:11.030> then<00:02:12.030> there's<00:02:12.239> the

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
timing your spell's and then there's the

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.770 
timing your spell's and then there's the
low<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.720> system<00:02:13.110> so<00:02:13.319> you'll<00:02:13.470> get

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
low that system so you'll get

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.960 
low that system so you'll get
artifacts<00:02:14.319> and<00:02:14.709> i<00:02:15.160> think<00:02:16.120> they<00:02:16.209> were<00:02:16.330> called

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
artifacts and i think they were called

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
artifacts and i think they were called
well<00:02:18.970> they're<00:02:19.150> kind<00:02:19.330> of<00:02:19.390> like<00:02:19.480> similar<00:02:19.780> two

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
amazing it's kind of lacking on there

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.720 
amazing it's kind of lacking on there
sometimes<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.680> queue<00:03:17.890> times<00:03:18.070> might<00:03:18.370> be<00:03:18.549> dead

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
sometimes the queue times might be dead

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.580 
sometimes the queue times might be dead
maybe<00:03:19.239> I'm<00:03:19.420> trying<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.900> bad<00:03:20.079> time<00:03:20.380> though

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
maybe I'm trying a bad time though

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.819 
maybe I'm trying a bad time though
particular<00:03:21.310> time<00:03:21.670> scale<00:03:21.940> can<00:03:22.510> be<00:03:22.799> brutal<00:03:23.799> for

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
particular time scale can be brutal for

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.020 
particular time scale can be brutal for
you<00:03:24.220> at<00:03:24.400> least<00:03:25.079> so<00:03:26.079> I<00:03:26.500> think<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.430> game<00:03:27.610> is<00:03:27.640> like

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
you at least so I think the game is like

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.300 
you at least so I think the game is like
a<00:03:28.060> really<00:03:28.329> good<00:03:28.570> and<00:03:28.720> should<00:03:28.959> take<00:03:29.320> try<00:03:30.100> at<00:03:30.280> it

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
a really good and should take try at it

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.240 
a really good and should take try at it
if<00:03:30.579> you<00:03:30.670> have<00:03:30.790> a<00:03:30.820> possibility<00:03:31.600> but<00:03:32.130> I'm<00:03:33.130> going

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
if you have a possibility but I'm going

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.710 
if you have a possibility but I'm going
to<00:03:33.310> talk<00:03:33.430> about<00:03:33.579> being<00:03:33.850> a<00:03:33.940> platinum<00:03:34.390> dode

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
to talk about being a platinum dode

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.590 
to talk about being a platinum dode
in-game<00:03:35.290> currency<00:03:35.890> so<00:03:36.160> ten<00:03:36.579> dollars<00:03:37.000> cost<00:03:37.329> to

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
in-game currency so ten dollars cost to

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.590

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
guardians in this game but other than

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.630 
guardians in this game but other than
that<00:04:17.140> it's<00:04:17.590> just<00:04:17.739> ability<00:04:18.250> it's<00:04:18.370> stupid<00:04:18.609> to

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
that it's just ability it's stupid to

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.920 
that it's just ability it's stupid to
have<00:04:18.729> a<00:04:18.820> chair<00:04:19.120> that<00:04:19.299> doesn't<00:04:19.630> have<00:04:19.750> any

benefit<00:04:20.350> really<00:04:20.680> unless<00:04:21.489> you<00:04:21.669> have<00:04:21.820> platinum

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
benefit really unless you have platinum

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.990 
benefit really unless you have platinum
already<00:04:22.890> but<00:04:23.890> I<00:04:24.159> think<00:04:24.460> this<00:04:24.640> should<00:04:24.789> be<00:04:24.970> like

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
already but I think this should be like

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.300 
already but I think this should be like
more<00:04:25.450> things<00:04:25.690> to<00:04:25.840> buy<00:04:25.960> of<00:04:26.169> course<00:04:26.409> it<00:04:26.560> doesn't

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
more things to buy of course it doesn't

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.860 
more things to buy of course it doesn't

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
you have this realm system so each

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.190 
you have this realm system so each
character<00:04:48.940> belongs<00:04:49.150> to<00:04:49.480> this<00:04:49.600> like<00:04:49.840> there's<00:04:50.110> a

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
character belongs to this like there's a

kind<00:04:53.560> of<00:04:53.650> thing<00:04:53.860> I<00:04:54.130> think<00:04:54.910> there<00:04:55.030> was<00:04:55.060> six<00:04:55.450> of

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
kind of thing I think there was six of

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.590 
kind of thing I think there was six of
them<00:04:55.810> and<00:04:55.860> you<00:04:56.860> can<00:04:57.010> level<00:04:57.220> up<00:04:57.430> those<00:04:57.940> to<00:04:58.300> those

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
them and you can level up those to those

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.870 
them and you can level up those to those
realms<00:04:58.979> I'm<00:04:59.979> not<00:05:00.190> sure<00:05:00.250> why<00:05:00.520> they<00:05:00.669> called

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
realms I'm not sure why they called

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.270 
realms I'm not sure why they called
realms<00:05:01.300> they<00:05:01.389> were<00:05:01.690> called<00:05:01.990> domains<00:05:02.919> yet

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
realms they were called domains yet

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.270 
realms they were called domains yet
domains<00:05:03.639> and<00:05:04.080> this<00:05:05.080> will<00:05:05.320> give<00:05:05.590> you<00:05:05.830> like

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
domains and this will give you like

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.680 
domains and this will give you like
certain<00:05:07.270> spells<00:05:07.810> which<00:05:08.229> you<00:05:08.350> can<00:05:08.500> use<00:05:09.479> if<00:05:10.479> you

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
certain spells which you can use if you

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.560 
certain spells which you can use if you
level<00:05:11.290> certain<00:05:11.740> domain<00:05:12.070> and<00:05:12.580> I<00:05:12.970> think<00:05:13.419> that's

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
level certain domain and I think that's

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.510 
level certain domain and I think that's
pretty<00:05:13.750> nice<00:05:14.080> system<00:05:14.560> so<00:05:14.860> there's<00:05:15.310> a<00:05:15.370> lot<00:05:15.490> of

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
pretty nice system so there's a lot of

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.440 
pretty nice system so there's a lot of
progress<00:05:15.820> ability<00:05:16.510> in<00:05:16.630> this<00:05:16.810> game<00:05:17.080> and<00:05:18.450> let's
