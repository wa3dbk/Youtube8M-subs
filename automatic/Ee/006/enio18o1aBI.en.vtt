to and you got to kind of palm you to a

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:32.749 
to and you got to kind of palm you to a
tiny<00:00:54.320> bit<00:01:11.110> so<00:01:12.110> what<00:01:12.200> you<00:01:12.290> do<00:01:12.470> is<00:01:12.590> you<00:01:12.740> go<00:01:12.890> away

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.440 

so<00:01:33.759> I<00:01:34.180> make<00:01:34.420> sure<00:01:35.729> it's<00:01:36.729> going<00:01:36.850> to<00:01:36.909> be<00:01:37.030> like<00:01:37.210> e

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
so I make sure it's going to be like e

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.440 
so I make sure it's going to be like e
string<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.729> make<00:01:39.880> sure<00:01:39.909> you<00:01:40.030> get<00:01:40.090> that<00:01:40.180> first

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
string so make sure you get that first

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.380 
string so make sure you get that first
finger<00:01:40.689> on<00:01:40.720> two<00:01:41.460> little<00:01:42.460> thing<00:01:42.670> on<00:01:42.820> three<00:01:43.119> this

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
finger on two little thing on three this

00:01:43.390 --> 00:02:05.920 
finger on two little thing on three this
one<00:01:43.630> for

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:17.120 

so<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:06.990> e-string<00:02:07.729> hit<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.910> D<00:02:09.090> string

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.890 

so<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.250> first<00:02:18.520> bit<00:02:18.790> is<00:02:19.000> e<00:02:19.240> string<00:02:19.630> when<00:02:19.870> you

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
so the first bit is e string when you

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.060 
so the first bit is e string when you
hit<00:02:20.110> this<00:02:20.260> one<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:21.250> D<00:02:21.430> string<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:23.260> go<00:02:23.410> up<00:02:23.650> and

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
hit this one the D string you go up and

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:33.950 
hit this one the D string you go up and
you<00:02:24.250> hit<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.580> G<00:02:24.820> and<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.150> D<00:02:25.420> string<00:02:31.020> right

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
you hit the G and the D string right

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.000 
you hit the G and the D string right
down<00:02:34.960> down<00:02:35.850> down

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
down down down

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:46.730 
down down down
up<00:02:38.370> down<00:02:39.239> I<00:02:39.799> see<00:02:40.799> this<00:02:40.980> very<00:02:41.189> do

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.960 

second<00:02:47.740> bit<00:02:47.920> is<00:02:47.950> almost<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.430> same<00:02:48.640> with<00:02:48.700> the

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
second bit is almost the same with the

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:56.160 
second bit is almost the same with the
last<00:02:49.150> up<00:02:49.420> strand<00:02:49.750> you<00:02:49.870> go<00:02:49.990> up<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.230> here<00:02:55.170> dear

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
last up strand you go up to here dear

last up strand you go up to here dear
Elsa

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.349 

so<00:03:15.890> hopefully<00:03:16.010> that<00:03:16.280> makes<00:03:16.340> sense<00:03:16.670> it's<00:03:17.269> a

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
so hopefully that makes sense it's a

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.410 
so hopefully that makes sense it's a
little<00:03:17.599> tricky<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.049> explain<00:03:18.920> but<00:03:19.700> just<00:03:20.030> make

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
little tricky to explain but just make

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.610 
little tricky to explain but just make
sure<00:03:20.569> you<00:03:20.629> get<00:03:20.749> the<00:03:20.870> cord<00:03:21.139> set<00:03:21.319> up<00:03:21.439> right<00:03:23.620> it

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
sure you get the cord set up right it

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.110 
sure you get the cord set up right it
says<00:03:24.859> it's<00:03:25.040> a<00:03:25.129> D<00:03:25.700> ad<00:03:25.969> for<00:03:26.389> cord<00:03:27.819> guess<00:03:28.819> I<00:03:28.969> could

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
says it's a D ad for cord guess I could

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.339 
says it's a D ad for cord guess I could
see<00:03:29.299> that<00:03:29.450> it<00:03:29.719> doesn't<00:03:29.870> really<00:03:30.019> sound<00:03:30.230> like

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
see that it doesn't really sound like

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:31.509 
see that it doesn't really sound like
that<00:03:30.469> when<00:03:30.709> you're<00:03:30.799> playing<00:03:30.950> it<00:03:31.430> sounds

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
that when you're playing it sounds

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.360 
that when you're playing it sounds
pretty<00:03:31.849> weird<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:33.530> then<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:33.920> next<00:03:34.159> thing<00:03:34.310> you

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
pretty weird and then the next thing you

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.459 
pretty weird and then the next thing you
want<00:03:34.489> to<00:03:34.670> do<00:03:34.819> for<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.299> chorus<00:03:35.689> is<00:03:35.900> go<00:03:36.049> I<00:03:36.319> would

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:36.469 
want to do for the chorus is go I would

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:38.500 
want to do for the chorus is go I would
play<00:03:36.650> like<00:03:37.040> I<00:03:37.310> think<00:03:37.700> it<00:03:37.879> sounds<00:03:38.180> better<00:03:38.209> do

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
play like I think it sounds better do

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.800 
play like I think it sounds better do
power<00:03:38.719> chords<00:03:39.079> B<00:03:39.260> flat<00:03:39.530> 5<00:03:40.540> C<00:03:41.540> 5

and then d5 either like this or over
here<00:03:47.360> they<00:03:48.360> could<00:03:48.540> be<00:03:48.870> 5<00:03:49.110> 5<00:03:49.350> is<00:03:49.650> 1<00:03:49.860> 3<00:03:50.160> 3<00:03:51.050> PI<00:03:52.050> over
