00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
you have to check that out basically

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.560 
you have to check that out basically
it's<00:01:23.759> about<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:24.000> song<00:01:24.420> about<00:01:24.630> an<00:01:24.869> ancient<00:01:25.409> land

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
it's about a song about an ancient land

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.719 
it's about a song about an ancient land
it's<00:01:27.570> got<00:01:27.780> tons<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.259> tempo<00:01:28.920> changes<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.579> I

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
it's got tons of tempo changes in it I

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.660 
it's got tons of tempo changes in it I
think<00:01:30.030> it's<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.240> really<00:01:30.570> great<00:01:30.990> track<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.829> lead

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
think it's a really great track to lead

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.999 
think it's a really great track to lead
off<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.970> album<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:34.140> think<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:34.560> actually

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
off the album and I think it's actually

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.010 
off the album and I think it's actually
one<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.729> best<00:01:35.909> songs<00:01:36.240> on<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.630> album<00:01:36.900> as

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
one of the best songs on the album as

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.120 
one of the best songs on the album as
well<00:01:37.460> so<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.729> starts<00:01:39.360> off<00:01:39.450> well<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.680> second

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
well so that starts off well the second

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.440 
well so that starts off well the second
song<00:01:41.369> called<00:01:42.270> world<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:43.140> war<00:01:43.939> is<00:01:44.939> another

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
song called world of war is another

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.800 
song called world of war is another
complex<00:01:46.110> song<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:47.060> this<00:01:48.060> basically<00:01:48.600> it's

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
complex song and this basically it's

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.170 
complex song and this basically it's
about<00:01:48.930> war<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.649> how<00:01:49.950> war<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.369> about<00:01:50.579> money<00:01:50.850> and

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
about war and how war is about money and

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.520 
about war and how war is about money and
not<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.390> people<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.659> are<00:01:51.899> dying<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.350> things

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.410 
think out of all the songs on the album
I<00:01:58.649> enjoyed<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.159> one<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.430> most<00:01:59.670> because<00:02:00.210> they

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
I enjoyed this one the most because they

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.170 
I enjoyed this one the most because they
really<00:02:00.840> kind<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.890> experimented<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.880> little

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
really kind of experimented in a little

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.060 
really kind of experimented in a little
bit<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.479> different<00:02:03.869> sound<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.649> rhythms

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
bit of a different sound and rhythms

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.100 
bit of a different sound and rhythms
when<00:02:05.340> they<00:02:05.430> did<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.790> song<00:02:06.030> some<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
when they did this song some of the

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.139 
when they did this song some of the
guitar<00:02:07.500> crunching<00:02:08.069> heavy<00:02:08.369> groove<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:09.000> it

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
guitar crunching heavy groove to it

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.720 
guitar crunching heavy groove to it
slowing<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.660> down<00:02:09.690> sounds<00:02:10.440> really<00:02:10.800> cool<00:02:11.009> so

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
slowing it down sounds really cool so

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.620
