 dialogues and turn-based battles judging by

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.990
 everywhere 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.420
 the number of dialogues may shock 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.549
 modern lover role genre yet 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.610
 when creating a character on a player 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.490
 dumped ton of information to who 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.479
 not familiar with the concepts of the world to understand 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.479
 it will not just be such adepts than magicians 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.780
 differ from shaman what is the difference between 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.460
 deckers and riga rame 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.490
 however role system here in its own way 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.750
 logical and at the same time very diverse 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.600
 especially in battle 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.750
 for example, a shaman may incite the enemy 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.970
 summoned monster by the way is capable 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.540
 get out of control and attack

 our own team street samurai can and 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.939
 shoot and chop mages 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.270
 I am looking for points of concentration of magic lines 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.969
 and they increase their spells decker and 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.030
 are fighting inside the virtual matrix a 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.750
 riger and control 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.319
 onomi well, adepts are monks reinforcing 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.209
 yourself in melee ki energy 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:14.480
 plot single campaign noir with 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.760
 elements of fantasy and cyberpunk chief 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.700
 the hero is investigating the mysterious death 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.459
 old friend and looking for the killer 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.980
 unknown maniac holding in fear 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.700
 the whole city we will have to communicate with 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.670
 by the police 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.040
 fight street gangs drop in 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.590
 in the morgue nightclubs its all 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.620
 suspicious places in general deal 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.440
 the usual set of cases a private detective 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.230
 at the same time, the role system affects both 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.420
 dialogues strong character can in 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.540
 conversation threaten the guard 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.280
 and the one who is familiar with street slang or 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.130
 corporate rules 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.340
 ease your life flashed knowledge in 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:58.040
 the right moment the plot leads us from the location 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.769
 to the location from dialogue to dialogue from 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.700
 battles to battle quests are not organized 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.380
 cleverly but made in the same old school 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.410
 nostalgic coin messing around with a knapsack 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.840
 there are no dead enemies left 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.269
 prey and procure equipment 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.450
 account for a minimum of satellites 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.820
 join the team and leave it alone 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.489
 and temporarily join to solve 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.640
 your problems others can hire before 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:28.340
 especially important mission firepower is always 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.150
 prepare to fight 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.359
 uneasy 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.940
 in part they are similar to the old x cam with the 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:37.850
 the difference is that the characters here are not limited 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.680
 action points and the number of action for 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.940
 one turn 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.440
 rich role system makes 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.620
 tactical battles 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.930
 the most interesting element of the game is one and 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.630
 the same character can throw at the enemy 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.660
 spells or grenade summon on 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.450
 help monster android or standing behind 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.239
 help partners adding strength to them 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.940
 accuracy or speed hybrid 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:04.430
 characters feels fine here but 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.739
 not without limitations for example all 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.760
 electronic implants of the protagonist 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.549
 badly affect his magical 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.060
 areas become good hacker and strong 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.139
 magician tasks and incompatible at first 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.880
 strongly interferes 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.000
 so is the lack of normal 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.760
 saving there is only auto safe in front 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.360
 the beginning of each mission last battle on 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.949
 level is not in our favor 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.810
 come back to the very beginning 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:34.300
 promising game element 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.160
 ability to add new modules 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.229
 created by the players themselves 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.110
 good in the game is very present 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:45.180
 serious mission designer concept and 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.180
 large intricate scenes
