00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.870
 as we did before we started with the 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.510

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.340
 your category here in combat a program 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.720
 made for the whole family that we treat 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.860
 to convey positive things and 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.870
 just sport is one of them 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.660
 now thank you very much the truth that is the 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.000
 time I'm in Peru in Lima and good 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.400
 happy not very happy 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.100
 to have this opportunity and be in 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.360
 our program today has the 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.970
 opportunity the truth that public 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.110
 Peruvian has the gratitude obviously is 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.620
 you for having the possibility of 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.060
 repeat that final between you and nadal rafa 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.000
 the truth that a final that was of 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.860
 heart attack that feels like repeating it at the end 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.619
 with which I imagine that he was friend 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.990
 they are are compatriots obviously it is 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.670
 nice is not a different experience 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.619
 in any case, everything is given 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.290
 regardless of the rivalry that 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.080
 we can way is very good friend very 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.040
 good companion in which shared 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.040
 many years throughout my career 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.800
 and good to be in another scenario 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.250
 both for rafa and for me and to be able 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.869
 enjoy a game with him in the 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.360
 Peru, I wanted to ask you a drop 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.320
 and the topic of tics because I did 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.320
 ground fan 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.430
 rafael nadal imagine that not what he ate 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.430
 it is not stress he is that 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:18.290
 and we do some things and also because 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:20.569
 stress is part of stress if any 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.879
 I have something like turning around or it's so 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.950
 concentrated that sometimes you do not realize 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:27.620
 of tennis players we are not magnetic in 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.079
 the bed for example a cabal that is 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.400
 obviously a custom before before 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.379
 enter the court you have some kind of 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.930
 ritual some process that occurs naturally 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:38.180
 everything I personally does not pass it that if 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.579
 in the first match on the same track and 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.989
 I sat in a particular place and 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:45.049
 won the game because he always tried 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.060
 overtake and sit down and I do not always 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.319
 let's sometimes come in before them 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.120
 hey david that the expectations for this 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.400
 party they are but impressive 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.870
 because there are already very few practical entries 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.030
 very few entries what are causing 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.560
 you of sensational is obvious then not 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.849
 have the great codes the Lord of 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.469
 avilés impressive this question 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.480
 way of gossip up the opportunity to 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:04.810
 see some game of the flipped to the 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.810
 women 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.209
 and apart is one of the most 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.050
 sympathetic are now the cries of the 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.760
 action on trial 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.320
 when one is in the tribune that feels 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.210
 when one hears screaming at the wax but 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.990
 sometimes when you're training your 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:30.530
 side annoys a bit but it's a fight 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.550
 with a girl should very scare enough 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.670
 because a cachetadón stops hurting 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:38.510
 I can not imagine 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.980
 since I will take advantage of tennis fanatic and 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.970
 above all fanatical of God and that you 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.340
 You can send a greeting because it is 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.810
 stuck in the house relates also the 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.810
 program that can not anymore 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.890
 a greeting 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.530
 tatiana tatiana 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:05.450
 a greeting but the best is but good 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.370
 I hope we meet and I invite you to 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.810
 that this Sunday you come to see us so much 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.620
 rafa like to me the exhibition party 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.620
 here in Lima 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.850
 question next year starts 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.610
 again a tennis year 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.560
 I imagine that the idea you have in the 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.810
 Clear head is to arrive is the number 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.419
 one of the atp ranking which is quite 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.460
 difficult you have forward to the Serbian 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.320
 djokovic and you have also rafael nadal 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.320
 which is a phenomenon today but I think 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.960
 who grabs her and who is practicing 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:50.810
 to be very close at least 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:53.520
 well it is difficult one more complicated 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.259
 a very good year for me the goal 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.030
 just start years trying to finish 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:00.240
 among the best the best eight of the 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:04.789
 world and good to go step by step get to 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.789
 be number one really complicated 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:16.680
 when they found out when they found out 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:18.330
 when they found out that they are 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.710
 nervous asks a question that 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.450
 I wanted to make this david 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.800
 what happens I ever thought good 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.690
 that for tennis was also important 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.130
 the theme of height while a lot 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:30.900
 people think if you are tall you will leave 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:32.430
 much more for this kind of thing but 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.800
 He is a person who is our size 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.200
 what can you tell the people who see the 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:41.640
 program is in something like us 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:44.340
 because he knows but that does not mean anything 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:47.130
 such is a handicap or not to see really 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:51.330
 each one tries to do what he can with 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:52.920
 what tennis has evolved in 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.820
 because the way that people take very 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.650
 strong that really measures at least 11 85 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.900
 but but good since you 're short 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.030
 try to take advantage of it try to subtract 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.130
 better try to move better and fail 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.420
 less of that generation because more or 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.230
 less as the generation we are 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.230
 older actually 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.970
 37 years we have life has treated us 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:21.120
 so bad in any case clear but the 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:23.070
 generation here tennis player admired when 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.500
 you were when I was a boy this one I saw 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.289
 who motivated you for example to play 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.680
 tennis 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:32.139
 good motivate me motivated to tennis never 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.149
 I had someone to inspire me yes 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:35.439
 it is true that marcelo rivers was the 

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:37.509
 Chilean 

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:39.539
 tremendous had a lot of quality 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:42.490
 tennis and I liked to watch him play 

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:45.309
 also lleyton hewitt that match 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.509
 he then his claw his way of playing 

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:47.710
 now obviously with him is when 

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:49.569
 has somehow also boots the 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.279
 stress relaxes you a lot but when you do not 

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:53.020
 you are in the tennis that is posta soles 

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:54.369
 do you suddenly have some hobby 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.449
 something that will keep you quiet 

00:06:54.369 --> 00:06:57.249
 suddenly in a person that you like 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:58.689
 be in the home or you like it 

00:06:57.249 --> 00:07:01.449
 go out to have fun with friends the 

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:03.759
 girlfriend or whoever was like this either 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:06.339
 combine it a bit of all of course 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:09.610
 when he 's on vacation, I like it 

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:11.830
 to go out to know new places that do not 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.479
 that I have not been able to know and then 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:16.479
 supposed to spend it with my friends with my 

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:18.099
 couple and leave no no I'm not at home 

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:20.080
 because well I have little time and I want 

00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:21.369
 take advantage of most tennis players 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.939
 he is also a soccer fan 

00:07:21.369 --> 00:07:25.869
 most of which team are you in the league 

00:07:24.939 --> 00:07:29.020
 good 

00:07:25.869 --> 00:07:31.300
 to see I am of value and my land 

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:35.129
 tierra valencia is my team but for 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.129
 Of course I'm very close to FC Barcelona 

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:48.240
 you know the producer speaks to us here 

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:48.240
 today this combat
