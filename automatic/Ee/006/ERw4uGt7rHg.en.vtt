00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.230
 I bring you a program that works for 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.690
 defragment the hard drive many times 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:15.719
 when we open word for example 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.430
 and we edit a file we save it and 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.760
 next day we reopen the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:25.640
 file, we edit it again and 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:28.910
 we save but in this case 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:32.390
 what the hard drive does is that each 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:35.720
 Once you open that file, you edit it and 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:39.050
 you keep it in different 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.660
 disc spaces that's why when 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.239
 you open a file takes a long time 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.610
 in opening it because what it is doing 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:52.040
 the hard drive is to locate the spaces 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:54.770
 where he has saved them and put them together and 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.230
 it's how you can open the file 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.690
 the program that I bring to you is called the 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.960
 free geller 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.750
 this little program works like 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.180
 hard drive defragmenter for 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.770
 download it they just go to the 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.540
 page that I leave in the description of 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.940
 video 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.490
 they go to the part where it says double from 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.490
 and click on peru.com 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.080
 well once this comes out 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.600
 they simply give it in downloading me what 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.110
 I will give reject because previously 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.110
 download it 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.280
 When you have completed the download, 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.159
 will leave a file like this what will they 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.890
 do is right click execute as 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.890
 administrator accept the permissions 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:55.160
 and we select the language 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.160
 in my Spanish case we click on nets 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.720
 once translated we click on 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.720
 following 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:07.840
 in this part we are going to unmark what 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.130
 it would be this box 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.890
 this one too 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.890
 and that's all we click on install 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:24.200
 good once the installation is finished 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.010
 let's uncheck the option see notes of 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.810
 the version 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.810
 and we click on finish 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.760
 well this is the interface of the refrigerator 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.110
 claire 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.680
 here it shows us the units that can 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.349
 be fragmented 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.920
 in this case I recommend that only 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.990
 defragment in the disk ce 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.810
 do not go to play the album because 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.420
 many times there they have what is the 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.940
 Windows recovery does not not 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.800
 I recommend that you orally in this what 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.600
 that we are going to do nothing but defragment 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.210
 the local disk c 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.990
 we select our disk and click 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.990
 in analyzing 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.260
 it will automatically be making a 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.450
 analysis of how fragmented is 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.500
 our hard drive 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:24.470
 in my case it tells me that 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.690
 I have a fragmentation of 31% 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.420
 after having analyzed the only thing that 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.030
 have to do is defragment give 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.120
 click here where it says defrag and 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.230
 wait for the process to finish if 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.530
 you have not made a 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:44.140
 continuous defragmentation of your disk 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:47.700
 hard it may take you some hours 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.700
 or minutes 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.130
 well that 's all 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.060
 I hope you liked it, do not forget 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:59.390
 subscribe give the video and see you 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.390
 in the next
