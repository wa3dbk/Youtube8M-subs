00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
is I'm not adding additional salt to

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.380 
is I'm not adding additional salt to
this<00:03:16.769> recipe<00:03:17.190> because<00:03:17.370> when<00:03:17.640> you<00:03:17.790> get<00:03:18.090> the

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
this recipe because when you get the

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.900 
this recipe because when you get the
artichoke<00:03:18.930> hearts<00:03:19.440> in<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.950> jar<00:03:20.280> they<00:03:20.639> already

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
artichoke hearts in the jar they already

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.759 
artichoke hearts in the jar they already
have<00:03:21.180> like<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.720> vinegar<00:03:22.169> so<00:03:22.319> they're<00:03:22.440> kind<00:03:22.650> of

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
have like a vinegar so they're kind of

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.050 
have like a vinegar so they're kind of
acidic<00:03:23.069> so<00:03:23.370> you<00:03:23.459> don't<00:03:23.609> really<00:03:23.730> need

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
acidic so you don't really need

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.229 
acidic so you don't really need
additional<00:03:24.810> acid<00:03:25.530> and<00:03:25.709> instead<00:03:26.370> of<00:03:26.519> salt<00:03:26.880> a

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
additional acid and instead of salt a

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.809 
additional acid and instead of salt a
lot<00:03:27.480> of<00:03:27.569> times<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:28.260> can<00:03:28.410> substitute<00:03:28.919> citrus

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
lot of times you can substitute citrus

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.550 
lot of times you can substitute citrus
or<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:30.180> know<00:03:30.299> lemon<00:03:30.629> juice<00:03:30.810> or<00:03:30.989> lime<00:03:31.169> just<00:03:31.440> for

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
or you know lemon juice or lime just for

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.680 
or you know lemon juice or lime just for

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
that brightness okay so that's gonna

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.319
