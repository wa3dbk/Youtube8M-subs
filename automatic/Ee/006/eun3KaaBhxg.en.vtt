How to Knit a Minion

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.610
Hi, Guys, I’m Kristen and Welcome to Studio
Knit!

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.000
It’s Knitting Lesson Monday, the Minion
Movie is here, so let’s have some fun by

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.050
knitting up these mini Minions.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.810
The Materials we will use are Double Pointed
Knitting Needles – I’m using size 6US,

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.790
but any size will do for your yarn type.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.250
Scissors, a Tapestry Needle.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.110
Yarn in colors yellow, blue, black, and grey.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.839
Some googl-y eyes, a glue gun and glue.

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:50.160
Detailed Lessons on all the Knitting Techniques
we use, along with a link to written pattern,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.620
are in the description below.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:58.429
We will begin our knitting by casting on six
stitches in our yellow color.

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:07.020
Now, we are going to increase using Knit Front
and Back, that's written KFB, When we're done

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.430
with Row one, our six stitches are now twelve
stitches.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:22.120
Here on row two, it's a Purl Row, so all twelve
stitches will simply be purled.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.770
Now Row Three is another increase row.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.020
This time we knit one and then knit front
and back.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.020
So, here we have eighteen stitches.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.290
So on Rows four through ten, it's the Stockinette
Stitch.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.409
So, that's a purl row, followed by a knit
row.

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:54.359
So this, right here, row four was our purl
row, and next, row five, is a knit row all

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:55.520
the way down.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:04.109
And, we just keep knitting in stockinette
stitch until we are at row ten.

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:08.340
We knit and purl, knit and purl.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:16.290
To make the taller Minion Kevin, go ahead
and knit six more rows in Stockinette Stitch.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.760
Now it's time for our suspenders, so we are
going to add the color blue.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:29.080
So, here on row eleven, it's knitting three
stitches in blue, and then switch back to

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:45.480
the yellow and you're going to knit three
stitches in yellow, followed by three stitches

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.100
in blue.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:56.680
Now, when we are finished with this series
of blue yellow blue, repeat it so you'll start

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.590
again with the blue knitting three stitches.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.510
Go all the way down you're row.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.570
Here's what it's looking like, shaping up
super cute!

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:14.550
Now, on this purl row, the colors will be
opposite, we're going to purl yellow for three

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:30.360
stitches, and you'll see on our wrong side
of the work, we have some carry-overs, not

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.150
a problem.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:41.680
Here on row thirteen, we're just going to
be knitting the yellow three and three stitches

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.070
in blue and carry it down and there we are
so cute our little suspenders have been made.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.810
We are done with Yellow, so we can cut that
off.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.630
And now we are going to just be knitting only
in the blue color, so again, it's stockinette

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.590
stitch for rows fourteen through eighteen.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.420
Beginning with a purl row.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:11.190
And then we'll just go knit, purl, knit purl,
until you get to the end of right here is

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.760
how it's shaping up so cute.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.090
Now, row nineteen, is knit one and knit two
together.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.700
That's a decrease.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.050
We're almost done.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:32.030
Row twenty is simply purling all the way down
the row.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:39.060
And now on row twenty one, we are going to
decrease by knitting two stitches together

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.900
all the way down.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.389
When we are done, we just draw that tail all
the way through, no need to even bind off.

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:53.520
And then with the right sides touching, and
the wrong sides out, we'll just use our tapestry

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.000
needle and go ahead and seam our little minion
up.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.979
About two thirds of the way.

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.509
Then turn him inside out.

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:08.080
And stuff him with some stuffing or you can
just use bits of yarn, too.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.450
So small and cute.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.220
Either stuffing our yarn, totally works.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.919
Now we'll just stitch up the top of his head,
So cute.

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.740
Okay, our minion body is done.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.849
Now we are going to make little arms.

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:29.639
By casting on three stitches.

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:38.650
Just knit a row and then we're going to do
the I-Cord for our yellow arms for rows two

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:46.590
through five so that's four rows, and then
we are just going to draw the tail through

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.000
and stitch our arms directly onto our little
minion body.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.319
So cute.

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:56.009
Ah, the personality's already beginning.

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:04.699
Now, with the legs or the feet, we are going
to be doing the I-cord again just in the black

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:12.389
yarn with three stitches, and then just fold
the foot around, make a little circle, stitch

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:13.499
him on.

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:20.900
Now, I like to stitch the band of the little
goggles all the way around the head using

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.750
my tapestry needle and some black yarn.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.009
And then you can go ahead and add some black
hair, too.

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:32.840
I just like making little loops, cutting them
off, fluffing them out, and for the eyes,

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:41.550
my little googl-y eyes just go ahead and use
your glue gun and for the goggles, this is

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:51.699
an extra little touch, Iike to just take the
grey yarn and with my glue gun just sort of

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:54.699
wrap the yarn around cut it off and there
we go!

00:06:54.699 --> 00:07:00.340
Our little minion is done and I hope you're
inspired to knit up some mini minions of your

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.340
own.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.610
And, if you do, I would love to see them!
