00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello dear friends and today i am 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:10.650
 I will review at dinner plugin 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:15.619
 flash headphones for 37 rubles I bought 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:19.439
 they are all in the store for 37 rubles there 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:23.750
 really all for 37 rubles and it's cool well 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.910
 check them out because cheap 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:31.560
 if we refute the fact and the fact that 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.610
 cheap shit well, let's move on to 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.660
 unpacking 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:43.590
 I have never tried yet 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:58.699
 top open the cover probably a bottom 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:01:02.960
 hiding the bottom better looking headphones 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:14.490
 seemingly done so normal 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:21.950
 how will everything be tough enough ? 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:24.810
 tires here speakers themselves so to speak 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:30.090
 it is immediately obvious that they are cheap because they do not 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:33.960
 neither the left and right inscription that for 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.170
 such an ear and see here stands 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.060
 no you can see it in the video well 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:49.950
 actually proceed to the test postpone 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:52.579
 little box and stuff like that 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.579
 the tablet 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.800
 so on the tablet for work 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.840
 So 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:14.620
 now i'm on ice and turn on 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:36.129
 music will find more interesting to remember 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.129
 that is admissible 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.910
 from 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:03:03.710
 Well, let's say that already thrift shop so 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:08.360
 so another 5 never ceases to amaze them 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:11.150
 you have to break off like this 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:16.090
 tell them to fit 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.090
 my head including 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.180
 on the channel to 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.950
 I do not know how it will be heard in the microphone 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.950
 max 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:14.800
 and now they are comparable to the same 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:35.480
 the same chinese monster beats 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:48.520
 yes they get me insert them here 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:48.520
 here are such now will play it 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:13.640
 Well, on the record, I will knock out and compare it all with 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:13.640
 headphones from sony and go the most expensive 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.910
 sorry for keeping you waiting 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:43.320
 good was their search for valuable and 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:22.670
 but I think you will understand well by appointment 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:23.390
 because but these seem to me the most 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:28.610
 the bad 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:32.510
 but there a little if so on kraynyak 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:40.600
 It is good here, as I repeated these 37 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:40.600
 rubles, these are now 250 rubles, these 1200
