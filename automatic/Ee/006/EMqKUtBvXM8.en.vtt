00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 cuckoo tournament empty and today so 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.799
 it will be the earliest of the apple 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.380
 of love its liquid film and gets bogged down and 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:15.120
 we will start with the material so 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.250
 it's gone so he will not need to 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:23.279
 pages film in red so a Europe in 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:25.560
 104 full of a little bit of salt water 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.180
 remaining a slurry previously 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.090
 So here's me it's my slime shot 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.009
 famous coulis a movie at the highest 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.110
 that is how you see the texture it 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.350
 This is as it was a letter that 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:45.750
 Auditory films head circuits are 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:47.989
 powerful him is not happy and tooth 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.690
 for tooth 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.809
 so we're going to start so the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.680
 take a piece of that red word 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.680
 we are going to make a ball 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:11.860
 and we affixed on the small circuit are 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:15.160
 like that I will not drink and I learn from 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.930
 make me a small package and nono and jean 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.360
 shake me once and put it 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.479
 in my little noise a second time 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.190
 and now I'm putting you back 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.530
 this is up 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.880
 so as you see I'm just doing the 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.640
 turn in the direction of the needles of a 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.850
 just shows no trick 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.850
 particular 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:40.950
 so that's once I was brought from 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.830
 do this 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.360
 I want to teach people to take my 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.149
 current toothpicks with grout and jeans 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.039
 just dropped off just make yourself a little 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.990
 demonstration I make you here because 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.990
 otherwise we have I see it I'm sorry 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.870
 the right to do that all around them blue 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.810
 around the hour of the love apple 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.300
 so that's all 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:25.320
 so here I am cutting the video is 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.000
 now finished this rebound so here 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.570
 once I have it down here is what 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.130
 So it gives now because I 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.070
 I'll do it once I'm done 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.630
 I will come cut my Kurds in 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.050
 anyway the size of the stick that we want 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.070
 to have 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:44.760
 that's me it's pretty much more 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:48.720
 true now it's good that pretty much 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:52.760
 at this thesis is where I'm going to cut 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.650
 so hop I cut 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.720
 here we can do that with a clamp 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.070
 cutting or scissors but I 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.320
 find that it's a little easier with 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:07.050
 a clip when you're here and I like 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:10.550
 well get up a little cure inter bon 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.550
 just so that you see with hand 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.680
 here and then my love apple was led 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.020
 after we leave it more con we 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.060
 remains more than to let it dry here 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.950
 and it will be over 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:32.880
 So here is the love apple after this 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:34.410
 will be finished renting a more for you 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.750
 see English by calls by 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.370
 and flattens in fact she is bulging a 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.860
 sick thing on the camera paris 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:47.480
 flattens I try to show you the other 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:50.390
 side not so that's love apple 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:56.130
 after we can readjust it as you 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:58.020
 wish so here you turn that everything 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.370
 the world the time after to dry it 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.870
 and after you will see that it can 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.640
 to be a small role because there we 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.930
 would look like pink 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.490
 when putting the grout because the 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.990
 coulis it's a bit of a little pink but 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.610
 in fact when dried down it becomes 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:13.130
 red Indian but a faint red 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:15.990
 like red in ten years so here 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.609
 here you are after you put in the oven 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.109
 directly with the cooking apathy that 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.889
 is there on it and there is already 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.629
 and that's it and here we are 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:30.449
 for a next video a next 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:30.449
 times and where their salvation
