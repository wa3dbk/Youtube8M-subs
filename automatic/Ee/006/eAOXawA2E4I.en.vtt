because I find that it really brings out

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.620

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
we just eat anything and I just think I

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.360 
we just eat anything and I just think I
like<00:05:22.300> the<00:05:22.570> whole<00:05:22.810> kaleidoscope<00:05:23.650> of<00:05:23.830> foods<00:05:24.100> in

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
like the whole kaleidoscope of foods in

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.030 
like the whole kaleidoscope of foods in
that<00:05:24.520> sense<00:05:24.820> so<00:05:25.060> that<00:05:25.270> meal<00:05:25.930> is<00:05:26.229> my<00:05:26.680> favorite

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
that sense so that meal is my favorite

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.830 
that sense so that meal is my favorite
holiday<00:05:27.190> food<00:05:27.639> I<00:05:27.940> guess<00:05:28.180> the<00:05:28.330> closest

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
holiday food I guess the closest

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
holiday food I guess the closest
decoration<00:05:29.590> in<00:05:29.979> my<00:05:30.130> room<00:05:30.340> is<00:05:30.610> this<00:05:30.940> Emerald

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
decoration in my room is this Emerald

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.400 
decoration in my room is this Emerald
sequin<00:05:32.860> dress<00:05:33.340> by<00:05:33.640> Motel<00:05:34.090> rocks<00:05:34.360> and<00:05:34.690> it's

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
sequin dress by Motel rocks and it's

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.900 
sequin dress by Motel rocks and it's
just<00:05:35.560> been<00:05:35.680> hanging<00:05:35.830> on<00:05:36.100> my<00:05:36.669> wall<00:05:36.700> for

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
just been hanging on my wall for

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.510 
just been hanging on my wall for
inspiration<00:05:37.750> and<00:05:38.080> I<00:05:38.229> guess<00:05:38.470> it<00:05:38.710> kind<00:05:39.100> of<00:05:39.220> comes

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
inspiration and I guess it kind of comes

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.980 
inspiration and I guess it kind of comes
close<00:05:39.760> to<00:05:39.970> a<00:05:40.000> Christmas<00:05:40.360> tree<00:05:40.540> in<00:05:40.690> the<00:05:40.780> sense

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
close to a Christmas tree in the sense

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.140 
close to a Christmas tree in the sense
