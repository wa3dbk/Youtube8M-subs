00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.170
 little more than 15 women neighbors of the 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.389
 Erendira colony have been found in the 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.670
 second sale the opportunity to 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.040
 bring a little more money home for 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.830
 this is installed on weekends in 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.230
 the park of the sector from the 5 30 of 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.930
 the morning until shortly after 3 o'clock 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.180
 the afternoon however this has caused 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.670
 the annoyance of other neighbors who 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.100
 they simply ask for respect for the park 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.130
 the few trees that are there and over 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.800
 everything to the children something that the itinerants 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.679
 they describe as unfair when explaining that the 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.829
 crisis has borne this and that in addition 

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:42.199
 They do not bother anyone and they always clean 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.229
 we are not bothering the 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:48.019
 children because we are not above the 

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:50.839
 park if you see we are on the shore of 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:54.469
 park and the only thing that we are is some 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:56.299
 how many hours and then I do not know why 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.239
 annoyed we mistreat the trees 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:02.059
 even when we would sweep 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.549
 When we leave we do not leave trash 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.920
 nor are we opening keys, which is what 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.700
 it was said then primarily to be the 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.350
 economy 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.750
 as you can see I am already a 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.060
 adult person and I can not get work 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.520
 nowhere now because here is a 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.500
 place is a public place is the park 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.740
 of us because I also belong 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.829
 here to the colony and this is a place 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.409
 sure is a place be clean us 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:29.090
 we take care of keeping it clean 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.710
 we tell you truth to 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.530
 all the neighbors here all the 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.569
 people living here around 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.159
 this park true simply that simply 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:39.860
 get a little less in our 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.899
 shoes really good that not all the 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.170
 people have the need to leave 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.909
 forward to go out to sell true the 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.189
 conflict is already taking dyes 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.049
 violent the nonconformists ask for the 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.299
 timely intervention of the authorities 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:56.000
 of parks and gardens as well as 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.130
 Therefore, trade does not do its job 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.470
 own nonconformists would take action 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.740
 much more drastic are hanging from the 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.049
 trees leave trash 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.630
 and also they do not have permission and it's supposed 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.900
 which is a park is not an area for 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.630
 selling is not a market and must be given 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:19.130
 mind that it is a lung of our 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:21.080
 colony in addition to the future city 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.330
 needs reforestation by all 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.310
 trees that were lost and instead of 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.830
 Then let's take care of spoil 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.959
 our park the kanak authorities 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.209
 and municipalities calculate that for the lack 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.640
 of employment and because the 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.100
 seniors trade 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.069
 informal has grown by up to 300 per 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.870
 cent over the last two years by 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.810
 what they poured gysi seconds in 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.530
 any point of this border now 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:52.390
 is the most common carlos ortiz and david
