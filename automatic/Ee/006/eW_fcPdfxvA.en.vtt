00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
coming back like I think one of the

other<00:02:02.670> dragons<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:03.390> was<00:02:04.229> available<00:02:04.439> for<00:02:04.799> a

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
other dragons that was available for a

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.980 
other dragons that was available for a
limited<00:02:05.100> time<00:02:05.310> never<00:02:05.820> even<00:02:06.030> came<00:02:06.270> back<00:02:06.509> yet<00:02:06.810> I

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
limited time never even came back yet I

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.560 
limited time never even came back yet I
mean<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.740> popular<00:02:08.190> ones<00:02:08.700> did<00:02:09.060> come<00:02:09.330> back

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
mean the the popular ones did come back

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.960 
mean the the popular ones did come back
like<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:11.720> cloud<00:02:12.720> jumper

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
like a cloud jumper

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.060 
like a cloud jumper
but<00:02:14.210> the<00:02:14.630> other<00:02:14.780> ones<00:02:15.110> that<00:02:15.500> weren't<00:02:15.920> so

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.180 
but the other ones that weren't so
popular<00:02:16.730> they<00:02:17.630> never<00:02:17.840> showed<00:02:18.140> up<00:02:18.320> again<00:02:18.440> so

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
popular they never showed up again so

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.510 
popular they never showed up again so
