Marlin<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.460> got<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.700> get<00:01:08.820> three<00:01:09.060> fish<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.570> have

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:09.719 
Marlin you got to get three fish I have

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:14.929 
Marlin you got to get three fish I have
76<00:01:10.380> seconds<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.130> can<00:01:11.460> swim<00:01:11.670> faster<00:01:12.290> and<00:01:13.939> the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
76 seconds I can swim faster and the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.749 
76 seconds I can swim faster and the
idea<00:01:15.149> is<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.110> get<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.710> fish<00:01:16.979> with<00:01:17.430> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
idea is to is to get the fish with the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.889 
idea is to is to get the fish with the
spear<00:01:18.149> gun<00:01:18.390> unlike<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.110> am<00:01:19.259> doing<00:01:20.539> as<00:01:21.539> you<00:01:21.750> can

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
spear gun unlike I am doing as you can

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.550 
spear gun unlike I am doing as you can
see<00:01:22.140> there's<00:01:23.479> there's<00:01:24.479> another<00:01:24.689> one<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.259> I

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
see there's there's another one and I

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.029 
see there's there's another one and I
need<00:01:25.710> one<00:01:25.920> more<00:01:27.020> it's<00:01:28.020> sharp<00:01:28.500> doesn't<00:01:28.860> count

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
need one more it's sharp doesn't count

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:32.179 
need one more it's sharp doesn't count
he<00:01:29.909> always<00:01:30.060> bites<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.719> I'm<00:01:31.500> not<00:01:31.680> sure<00:01:31.950> if<00:01:32.070> it

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
he always bites you I'm not sure if it

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.670 
he always bites you I'm not sure if it
goes<00:01:32.369> into<00:01:32.609> that<00:01:32.700> pause<00:01:33.630> mode<00:01:33.960> but<00:01:34.229> seems<00:01:34.560> like

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
goes into that pause mode but seems like

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.170 
goes into that pause mode but seems like
whenever<00:01:34.859> I<00:01:35.039> hit<00:01:35.219> the<00:01:35.369> shark<00:01:35.640> or<00:01:35.789> if<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.939> bump

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
whenever I hit the shark or if I bump

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.730 
whenever I hit the shark or if I bump
into<00:01:36.329> him<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.630> always<00:01:36.840> go<00:01:36.960> into<00:01:37.079> pause<00:01:37.289> mode<00:01:37.560> so

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
into him I always go into pause mode so

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.139 
into him I always go into pause mode so
I'm<00:01:37.799> not<00:01:37.920> sure<00:01:37.979> how<00:01:38.219> that<00:01:38.520> works<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:39.000> don't

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
I'm not sure how that works I don't

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.330 
I'm not sure how that works I don't
think<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.539> does<00:01:39.689> maybe<00:01:39.990> it's<00:01:40.170> just<00:01:40.200> me<00:01:40.500> alright

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
think it does maybe it's just me alright

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.609 
think it does maybe it's just me alright
so<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.520> completed<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.149> by<00:01:42.960> getting<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.380> three

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
so I completed this by getting the three

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.099 
so I completed this by getting the three
fish<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.759> wasn't<00:01:45.119> too<00:01:45.240> bad<00:01:45.270> sometimes<00:01:45.780> it's

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:46.109 
fish that wasn't too bad sometimes it's

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:48.889 
fish that wasn't too bad sometimes it's
harder<00:01:46.549> the<00:01:47.549> next<00:01:47.579> won't<00:01:48.060> level<00:01:48.450> up<00:01:48.600> number

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
harder the next won't level up number

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.649 
harder the next won't level up number
