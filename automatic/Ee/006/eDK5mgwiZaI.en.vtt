00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
point oh six it's about to be at an inch

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.510 
point oh six it's about to be at an inch
deep<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:35.930> the<00:00:36.930> point<00:00:37.380> one<00:00:37.620> it's<00:00:37.860> about<00:00:37.980> two

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
deep and the point one it's about two

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.880 
deep and the point one it's about two
inches<00:00:38.850> do

nest AC here now I've got it on settings

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.590 
nest AC here now I've got it on settings
right<00:00:58.120> I'll<00:00:58.240> just<00:00:58.270> show<00:00:58.600> you<00:00:58.690> so<00:00:59.050> that<00:00:59.080> no<00:00:59.470> one

right I'll just show you so that no one

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:20.450 
right I'll just show you so that no one
says<00:01:01.600> I<00:01:01.750> didn't<00:01:13.200> just<00:01:14.200> graham<00:01:14.410> balance<00:01:19.440> now

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
says I didn't just graham balance now

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.030 
says I didn't just graham balance now
this<00:01:21.460> is<00:01:21.580> the<00:01:21.670> point<00:01:21.850> oh<00:01:22.060> sorry

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.650 

so<00:01:27.040> amongst<00:01:27.369> the<00:01:27.580> Emme<00:01:27.820> interference<00:01:28.360> it<00:01:28.510> is

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
so amongst the Emme interference it is

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.010 
so amongst the Emme interference it is
there<00:01:29.729> but<00:01:30.729> unless<00:01:31.000> you<00:01:31.150> put<00:01:31.330> headphones<00:01:31.540> on

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
there but unless you put headphones on

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.920 
there but unless you put headphones on
you<00:01:32.200> wouldn't<00:01:32.470> hear<00:01:32.680> it<00:01:32.740> any<00:01:32.890> deeper<00:01:33.340> and<00:01:33.970> you

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
you wouldn't hear it any deeper and you

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.900 
you wouldn't hear it any deeper and you
would<00:01:35.110> hear<00:01:35.350> a<00:01:35.380> deeper<00:01:35.800> and<00:01:36.010> so<00:01:36.610> would<00:01:36.820> you

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
would hear a deeper and so would you

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.730 
would hear a deeper and so would you
with<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.210> pro<00:01:37.479> with<00:01:38.050> headphones<00:01:39.330> 0.06<00:01:40.740> little

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
with the pro with headphones 0.06 little

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.460 
with the pro with headphones 0.06 little
bit<00:01:41.860> better<00:01:42.040> signal<00:01:42.490> on<00:01:42.610> that<00:01:42.790> but<00:01:43.470> just

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
bit better signal on that but just

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.990 
bit better signal on that but just
scraping<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.950> coil<00:01:45.220> on<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.399> ground<00:01:45.640> like<00:01:45.850> I

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
scraping the coil on the ground like I

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.450 
scraping the coil on the ground like I
was<00:01:46.179> at<00:01:46.300> the<00:01:46.390> pro<00:01:46.890> will<00:01:47.890> just<00:01:48.039> come<00:01:48.220> up<00:01:48.340> a

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
was at the pro will just come up a

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.999 
was at the pro will just come up a
little<00:01:48.640> bit<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:50.170> about<00:01:50.440> half<00:01:50.560> inch<00:01:50.800> off<00:01:50.979> the

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
little bit so about half inch off the

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.800 
little bit so about half inch off the
ground<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.729> signals<00:01:52.090> disappearing<00:01:52.720> but

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
ground and the signals disappearing but

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.480 
ground and the signals disappearing but
it's<00:01:52.960> you<00:01:53.259> know<00:01:53.380> you'd<00:01:53.679> still<00:01:53.800> dig<00:01:54.160> it<00:01:54.310> now<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
it's you know you'd still dig it now the

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.450 
it's you know you'd still dig it now the
point<00:01:57.820> one's<00:01:58.000> 50<00:01:58.479> mil<00:01:58.710> right<00:01:59.710> so<00:02:00.399> I'm

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
point one's 50 mil right so I'm

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.969 
point one's 50 mil right so I'm
basically<00:02:00.899> basically<00:02:01.899> scraping<00:02:02.679> the<00:02:02.740> ground

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
basically basically scraping the ground

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.880 
basically basically scraping the ground
with<00:02:03.280> it<00:02:03.429> as<00:02:03.550> well<00:02:03.729> sorry<00:02:04.690> but<00:02:05.470> just<00:02:05.679> about

you know dig those point oh five and
point<00:02:11.410> oh<00:02:11.530> seven<00:02:11.819> seven<00:02:12.819> inches<00:02:13.090> deep<00:02:13.360> that's

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
point oh seven seven inches deep that's

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.920 
point oh seven seven inches deep that's
I<00:02:13.960> can't<00:02:14.290> see<00:02:14.620> that<00:02:15.240> look<00:02:16.240> I<00:02:16.360> can't<00:02:16.600> see<00:02:16.780> that

I can't see that look I can't see that

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.390 
I can't see that look I can't see that
happening<00:02:17.080> if<00:02:17.410> I<00:02:17.470> turned<00:02:17.710> up<00:02:17.800> any<00:02:18.010> higher<00:02:18.250> it

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
happening if I turned up any higher it

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.110 
happening if I turned up any higher it
gets<00:02:18.580> so<00:02:18.730> unstable<00:02:19.150> I<00:02:19.330> can't<00:02:19.600> use<00:02:19.780> it

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
gets so unstable I can't use it

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.700 
gets so unstable I can't use it
so<00:02:22.120> that's<00:02:22.420> all<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.900> one<00:02:23.020> to<00:02:23.110> show<00:02:23.260> you<00:02:23.319> siddo
