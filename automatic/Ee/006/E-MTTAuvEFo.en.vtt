that<00:03:40.200> are<00:03:40.350> in<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.560> game<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:41.040> it<00:03:41.459> Bri<00:03:41.670> balance

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
that are in the game and it Bri balance

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.840 
that are in the game and it Bri balance
is<00:03:42.090> a<00:03:42.120> lot<00:03:42.480> of<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.870> AI<00:03:43.590> for<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.250> cannibals<00:03:44.700> and

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
is a lot of the AI for the cannibals and

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.310 
is a lot of the AI for the cannibals and
like<00:03:45.030> when<00:03:45.209> they<00:03:45.299> come<00:03:45.450> after<00:03:45.630> you<00:03:45.930> and<00:03:45.959> what

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
they do and things like that and it's

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.670 
they do and things like that and it's
meant<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:48.720> be<00:03:48.750> a<00:03:48.810> little<00:03:48.930> bit<00:03:49.049> more<00:03:49.170> hardcore

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
meant to be a little bit more hardcore

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.680 
meant to be a little bit more hardcore
but<00:03:49.890> you<00:03:50.010> also<00:03:50.130> get<00:03:50.670> to<00:03:50.790> do<00:03:50.910> more<00:03:51.090> damage<00:03:51.329> and
