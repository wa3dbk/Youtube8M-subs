here<00:03:35.969> but<00:03:36.969> it's<00:03:37.840> kind<00:03:38.049> of<00:03:38.109> an<00:03:38.230> interesting

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:38.469 
here but it's kind of an interesting

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:44.250 
here but it's kind of an interesting
concept<00:03:39.689> as<00:03:41.099> opposed<00:03:42.099> to<00:03:42.540> taking<00:03:43.540> a<00:03:43.870> like<00:03:44.109> an

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
concept as opposed to taking a like an

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.000 
concept as opposed to taking a like an
MRE<00:03:44.590> meal<00:03:44.980> or<00:03:45.909> something<00:03:46.120> like<00:03:46.329> that<00:03:46.599> where<00:03:47.010> if

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
MRE meal or something like that where if
