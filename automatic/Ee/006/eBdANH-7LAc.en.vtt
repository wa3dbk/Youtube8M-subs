 very good guys in this new video 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.069
 let's see how we can add the 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.690
 little bubbles of unread messages in 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.980
 any application build seeing 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.559
 here we have the whatsapp app 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.480
 but we can add this function as much 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.540
 The whatsapp Instagram app 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.340
 twitter the mail in all that 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.080
 we want and all this is going to be 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.430
 in a very simple way so if I 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.449
 you want to know you already know what you have 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.449

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.680
 notifier and good is simply to be 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.420
 very simple of a short video 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.370
 commented to access the application and 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.870
 the equipment to adjust things to 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.520
 our taste will know we have 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.140
 different configurations for example the 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.120
 position if we want it to be in the 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.559
 part up or in the center and 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.150
 I want this , configuring our 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.070
 notification taste if we want the 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.629
 button be like this and the style of samsung 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.120
 as we want we can go 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.739
 flipping with all the settings with the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.050
 size to put for example a size 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.640
 quite big and as I say 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.020
 just then go after three I know that 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.710
 a configuration that you find yourselves 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.120
 like 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.920
 now to add the functionality to 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.259
 blatter that we want either the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.759
 twitter to instagram to whatsapp the 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.890
 application that as I say you want 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.899
 they simply go after pressed to add 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.119
 a widget and down until 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:18.530
 let's find the notifier application 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.530
 which is the one that we have to install 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.479
 as you see here we have found it 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.479
 we select 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.060
 and the widget as you see opens us this 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.130
 window in which we will find 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.470
 all our applications that we have 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.670
 installed on our phone so 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.710
 we simply have to select the one 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.230
 I want I want to have it in whatsapp 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.420
 so it will be down all the w 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.090
 as you see here we have it and 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.620
 we select we give to ok if the 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.330
 priority that we set it will ask us 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.410
 that we mark this option here since it 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.480
 will allow access to our 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.640
 notifications we remove here you 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.800
 We accept and in this way we 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.450
 we could go out as you see here we 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.910
 the application would have appeared and as 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.560
 you see no, we do not have any 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.270
 icon in which we appear the 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.500
 whatsapp that we have received so 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.030
 I'm just going to pause the video 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.440
 wait for us to get a whatsapp and 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.480
 Thus it appears we will see how the 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.770
 Bubjita and good guys as seen 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.240
 I would have arrived on WhatsApp as you are 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.320
 looking at the top and how are you 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.120
 seeing then here the 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.770
 bubble where we see the 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.630
 messages that we have not read anything with 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.700
 zoom dust if you want and as from 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.370
 there he would be seeing perfectly 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.570
 how this bubble appears, so nothing 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.670
 that we have commented a pretty video 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.100
 short to add functionality 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.450
 extra to our smartphone and nothing 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.500
 would like low comments then it is that 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.440
 now this video has appeared and this 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.030
 application 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.530
 it would be all the truth in our networks 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.970
 social twitter and facebook and 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.340
 we download the application of the place 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.850
 totally free says they are dismissed and not 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.850
