00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.889
 even with all this firepower 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.950
 I figured I could not get a 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.410
 brick solution can only hope not 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.439
 lose the chance to hear implore 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:24.509
 to see that he had won here is but who 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:27.989
 want to do the street without a chance well you 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:30.239
 Already this has lately heard well 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:32.610
 his ship and it turns out that it was the 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:36.180
 crazy work hanger knows my 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.160
 restaurant without meeting in an hour 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.060
 fontinello's restaurant had already 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.460
 been through better days 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.620
 the snowstorm falls from a post-heaven 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.780
 apocalyptic but was on the outside 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.360
 things soon got hot in the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.730
 head chef restaurant 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.040
 I knew the answer to the Angelo staircase. 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.730
 fontinello in fact seemed more wait 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.730
 it was not a crime 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.830
 Who I am saving 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:17.180
 Why do you think we 're just gonna see what? 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:20.740
 The 1545 brain is not here and there. 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.740
 I suppose I'm due to enter 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:29.610
 he was so spoken line 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.610
 the guy who is deaf 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.509
 very dirty inside 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.780
 the guy is seeing now 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.780
 ok I know who 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:52.100
 the house got confused i think i learned 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:52.100
 That's it, it's not something tight. 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.869
 It's just getting some car transports that 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:04.210
 Today I keep thinking about an issue and it's 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:04.210
 lie that Ricardo was a time here 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.930
 Nowhere to go now. 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.030
 ok no 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.600
 see the same schematic diagram 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.110
 It was with this thing here that it does not have 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.110
 output 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.560
 check this out 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.340
 have here 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.680
 Okay, so here's the heat. 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.120
 I was confused 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.740
 here when you will have some enemies in the 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:03:01.300
 button that would carry the load may have 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:06.780
 focus we have to cease fire 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.780
 I can not get fire, right? 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.060
 I used 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.180
 almost dying of salvation 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.710
 I want to go back to the trade. 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.660
 the caracas 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.670
 Because I came in here, you have an excuse. 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.670
 business 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.630
 the goal 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.660
 With this for me, who did it? 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.660
 it will be difficult now 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:53.340
 nor blame type of game is to blame it 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.340
 speak 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:01.710
 Hum will stay here. 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.710
 and the dogs 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.830
 the old man 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.080
 What about 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.810
 Okay, this show in sounds you call the 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.710
 sake 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.710
 the usa 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.090
 Look the money is knocking at will. 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.710
 and get the feeling was mutual and was 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:40.860
 trying to put out the flames with gas 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:43.610
 makes sense even without wanting to know what 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.610
 they however the court 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:55.259
 the guy took out thiago 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:57.300

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:00.479
 whatever you play here 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:04.099
 11 the mafiosi was the true adamo 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.099
 treasure the exit of this club from hell 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.740
 our face 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:21.260
 God how much we send to see a guy who 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:27.160
 I 'm making you die 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:35.650
 Okay and now one side the guy was staying 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:35.650
 in the chain the 500 direction itself 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:53.700

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.630

00:05:53.700 --> 00:06:04.860
 I know to play all of that softbank 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:09.530
 You people or nothing silly takes good view 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.530

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:19.800
 make dirt 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:32.350
 Ok, let's applaud in a big way. 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:38.169
 something tells me that I should save the 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:41.020
 thing is downloading there already 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:43.419

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:46.870

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:49.600
 pack sirens erthal law with us let's go 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.880
 take him to the mansion of the tram leads by 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.740
 Sounds good to me when it 's over my 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.140
 purpose you could be a 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:59.340
 Search by company:
