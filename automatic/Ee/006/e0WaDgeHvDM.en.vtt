00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.130
 I dedicate myself to give lectures trained 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.139
 companies change attitude and there it went 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.599
 giving practice now this appears 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.389
 I have a long story to sit with him 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:16.330
 talk and we miss like ten coffees 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.880
 there and there then talking to him 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.400
 the subject arises that we are going to set aside the day 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.380
 today that is precisely the ideology 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.619
 of the Mexican 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.500
 because we are like because we are one we are 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.870
 and what is the main root of that the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.880
 Mexican act as it is 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.380
 Carlos Monsivais told me something very 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.150
 interesting and I think that this we're going to 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.180
 watch 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:41.150
 told me world in the ideology of 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.220
 Mexican is directly linked with the 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.060
 Mexican cinema you like the cinema 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.840
 Mexican 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.650
 the Mexican state is an X-ray of 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.570
 what is the life of the Mexican 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.820
 but there if a Mexican is a 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.920
 radiography for Mexicans or for 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.130
 outside of Mexico does not stop it for 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.080
 Mexicans and a lot of the image that you have 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.250
 the customer outside of us is red 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.250
 Mexican cinema 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.270
 we are talking about the Mexican cinema of 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.689
 Classic period is considered 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.220
 between the 40s to the mid 50s 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:25.840
 more accurate 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:29.290
 and good me saying the stores 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.700
 from scratch the stingray shop for those who 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.770
 they do not know 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.170
 so he knows but the hacienda war already 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.530
 have the peasants working at 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:43.390
 exact city forced marches in a 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:46.810
 micro in microeconomics and they worked like 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.420
 donkeys and at the end of the day 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.930
 they were paid with a coin that 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.930
 was driving 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.450
 and how little they earn and go to the store 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.390
 of line and they exchanged it for things 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:07.270
 basic sir that you can for these 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:09.369
 coins carry a sack of blood a 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.430
 veladora so that you alumbres then 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.799
 what he earned something he left 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.129
 but but but the question is 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:21.129
 interesting is that if you see the life of 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:23.590
 those in side the senate imagine the rich 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:27.370
 this charro dress like this 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.769
 silver studs on his horse with 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.840
 the one that challenges the movies of Pedro 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.939
 armendáriz and de jorge negri de jorge 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.239
 negrete so magical riding for their 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:40.329
 lands and seeing all his legs and 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:43.090
 arrives and finds a farmer thrown 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:47.910
 a flat roof that can no longer be 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:51.000
 work a heavy lift to work 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:55.380
 and the child already knows not 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.440
 I can not anymore 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:02.420
 the glasses and the foreman imagine 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.420
 bandana moored in the head 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.970
 stay tied to the head well 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.620
 as if the mamey 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.620
 this unfortunate 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.470
 talking 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.190
 and the lady says socket and there you have 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.910
 to almost 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:31.080
 and it is already 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:36.400
 and to be more dramatic comes the 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:42.510
 excuse of the channel maría candelaria 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.510
 and it stands between the Indian body 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:57.710
 then lashes the two more still 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:02.980
 dinner becomes more 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:07.910
 because it also comes from Maria Candelaria 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:12.080

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:04.380

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.190
 Beta de Maria Candelaria with a 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:27.270
 paliacate water and cleaning of the 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:30.180

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:33.530
 that is cursed pattern damn but what 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.530
 I hate that says the reason 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:37.919
 colom is the 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.160
 because without containment 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:49.169
 then there what is in the ideology 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:53.159
 of the Mexican is 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:55.789
 and good ready the good one is lorenzo rafael 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:55.789
 because yes 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:08.440
 and all the good ones are the ones that come 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.970
 here to suffer 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:14.590
 to this valley of tears the poor 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.050
 who is the bad 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.979
 track 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.979
 in that ideology 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.060
 sown in our minds the 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.660
 mexicas 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:29.030
 and we have that grudge always for him 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.730
 the rich people I tell them something that 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:34.050
 you consider our houses not 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:37.530
 all the rich people 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:40.500
 and not all rich people are good not all 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:43.560
 poor people are bad and not all the 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:46.110
 poor people are public historically 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:49.440
 so continue this rancor that we have 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:51.509
 towards power or towards the boss I see it 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.370
 when two conferences with two of 

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:55.759
 courses in companies the ideology of 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.759
 employee 

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:09.219
 and I'm going in the truck forever 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:12.339
 a greater social hatred lived toward 

00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:15.430
 the one that has and the one that has rather 

00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:18.849
 who does not always think badly of the 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:21.339
 what's in it if I get to success 

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:24.569
 for something was less for doctors less for 

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:24.569
 work if she is a woman 

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:33.210
 then also sure about two potatoes 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:34.980
 or have friends because narco really safe 

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:37.260
 then we need to achieve success 

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.810
 easy in some way because it's not 

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.850
 then they start from those rectors with 

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:44.670
 this very very interesting introduction 

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:46.620
 to stay there thinking about the first 

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:48.800
 cut because there are also gifts we're going 

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.800
 to show
