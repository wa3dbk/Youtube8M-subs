can note is you could line this corner
up<00:00:48.809> with<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.079> slant<00:00:49.440> right<00:00:49.649> here<00:00:49.890> when

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
up with this slant right here when

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.069 
up with this slant right here when
you're<00:00:50.579> about<00:00:50.700> halfway<00:00:50.910> with<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.480> slant<00:00:51.809> or

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
you're about halfway with the slant or

you're about halfway with the slant or
you're<00:00:52.710> halfway<00:00:52.950> line<00:00:53.219> up<00:00:53.340> with<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.489> slant

right<00:00:54.660> Celeste<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.170> it's<00:00:55.350> kind<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.559> hard<00:00:55.710> to

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
right Celeste of it's kind of hard to

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:56.959 
right Celeste of it's kind of hard to
tell<00:00:55.860> unless<00:00:56.100> you're<00:00:56.309> on<00:00:56.370> your<00:00:56.460> monitor<00:00:56.879> way

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
tell unless you're on your monitor way

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.279 
tell unless you're on your monitor way
you<00:00:57.120> shoot<00:00:57.300> right<00:00:57.539> when<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.780> becomes<00:00:57.989> flat

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
you shoot right when it becomes flat

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.590 
you shoot right when it becomes flat
again<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:59.309> actually<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.640> tap<00:00:59.969> right<00:01:00.180> here<00:01:00.449> at

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
again you actually can tap right here at

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.410 
again you actually can tap right here at
about<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:01.020> height<00:01:01.260> right<00:01:01.559> above<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.760> where

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
about this height right above the where

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.900 
about this height right above the where
the<00:01:03.539> brick<00:01:03.750> pattern<00:01:04.020> changes<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:05.309> that'll

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
the brick pattern changes and that'll

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.940 
the brick pattern changes and that'll
actually<00:01:06.060> be<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.330> good<00:01:06.539> like<00:01:06.780> chess<00:01:07.289> medium<00:01:07.740> hit

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
actually be a good like chess medium hit

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.130 
actually be a good like chess medium hit
you<00:01:08.100> know<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.430> that's<00:01:08.820> not<00:01:08.939> always<00:01:09.420> spot

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
you know and that's not always spot

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.179 
you know and that's not always spot
where<00:01:10.290> there's<00:01:10.500> going<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.680> be<00:01:10.710> standing<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
where there's going to be standing the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.010 
where there's going to be standing the
whole<00:01:11.220> time<00:01:11.580> but<00:01:12.180> it's<00:01:12.330> something<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.689> do<00:01:12.900> if

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
whole time but it's something you do if

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.020 
whole time but it's something you do if
maybe<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.350> did<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.530> double<00:01:13.920> long<00:01:14.100> setup<00:01:14.460> and

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
maybe you did a double long setup and

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.300 
maybe you did a double long setup and
you<00:01:15.119> had<00:01:15.299> another<00:01:15.600> guy<00:01:15.810> pushed<00:01:16.680> up<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.130> maybe

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
you had another guy pushed up to maybe

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.280 
you had another guy pushed up to maybe
here<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.119> they<00:01:18.240> couldn't<00:01:18.450> rush<00:01:18.630> out<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.110> or

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
here so they couldn't rush out on you or

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.960 
here so they couldn't rush out on you or
something<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.310> something<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.820> you

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970

stairs itself it's not really as much of
a<00:02:05.909> full<00:02:06.450> angled<00:02:06.899> spot<00:02:07.229> but<00:02:08.009> it's<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.190> fact

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
a full angled spot but it's the fact

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.440 
a full angled spot but it's the fact
that<00:02:08.519> you<00:02:08.640> could<00:02:08.759> take<00:02:08.940> advantage<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.390> you

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
that you could take advantage that you

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.639 
that you could take advantage that you

here so if you ever holding this angle
and<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:13.680> in<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:13.980> guy's<00:02:14.160> shoulder<00:02:14.370> Peaks<00:02:14.700> you

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
and you in a guy's shoulder Peaks you

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.050 
and you in a guy's shoulder Peaks you
instead<00:02:15.180> of<00:02:15.239> just<00:02:15.390> waiting<00:02:15.569> for<00:02:15.750> the

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
instead of just waiting for the

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.339 
instead of just waiting for the
again<00:02:16.330> because<00:02:16.540> you<00:02:16.599> can't<00:02:16.810> spin<00:02:17.050> through<00:02:17.230> is

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.710 
again because you can't spin through is
you<00:02:17.739> could<00:02:17.860> actually<00:02:18.010> unload<00:02:18.489> pretty<00:02:19.450> shallow

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
you could actually unload pretty shallow

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.940 
you could actually unload pretty shallow
on<00:02:19.959> this<00:02:20.080> wall<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.349> it'll<00:02:20.530> kill<00:02:20.680> them<00:02:20.830> you

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
here when they run away because even

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.240 
here when they run away because even
though<00:02:23.349> that<00:02:23.500> looks<00:02:23.709> like<00:02:23.830> that's<00:02:24.010> where

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
though that looks like that's where

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.490 
though that looks like that's where
they'll<00:02:24.430> be<00:02:24.459> when<00:02:25.209> they<00:02:25.330> go<00:02:25.510> right<00:02:25.750> here<00:02:26.110> it's

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
they'll be when they go right here it's

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.199 
they'll be when they go right here it's
