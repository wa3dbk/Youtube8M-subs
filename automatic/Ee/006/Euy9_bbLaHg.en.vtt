00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.500
 hi how about girls how are they 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:18.070
 welcome back to my channel today les 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.869
 I bring a review review of a product 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.240
 well actually they are two products of 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.150
 citi color that are very similar time 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.489
 have the same function so they 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.460
 says the review of those two products in 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:33.040
 the same video and I'm talking about the 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.399
 primers for shades of the color citi that 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.750
 is the first shadow that comes in this 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.719
 presentation with acrylic 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:46.600
 transparent which is that it increases and 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:50.469
 the first one that comes in the version of the 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.289
 liquid this is supposed or in the ticket 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:56.620
 when I buy it, it comes as a cast 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:58.839
 first news and this one only manage it 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.440
 as a shadow first and it will explain 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:04.690
 why it's easy because this design and 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.670
 this one only started prime what 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.920
 It happens that this one when you put it on 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.500
 comes in this presentation, you go 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.310
 taking out and if you realize it is given 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.430
 It looks like flesh - colored color 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:23.540
 The applicator is even flesh colored 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.000
 when you take it out 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.910
 of the container 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.890
 if you put them on your skin you follow 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.890
 seeing flesh color but 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.190
 but at the moment in which you 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.190
 blur 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:46.850
 blur transparent is not reached 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.850
 see nothing instead this 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.210
 you take out product since you 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.670
 they take out makes the color much more intense 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.179
 it's like a yellow color and when I 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.040
 put on the skin is much thicker 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.240
 this 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:08.539
 and manages to leave a color so much 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:13.310
 white as if it were a 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:16.939
 an illuminator indeed this when I tell you 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.450
 you put in on as a basis for shadow in 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:22.519
 the part here below the eyebrow if 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.209
 you do not put any shadow on you 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:30.319
 the as the illuminating shadow of the 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:33.319
 eyebrow bone does that function this one 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.760
 do not be is that is left dry 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.400
 completely transparent 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.170
 my opinion on these products the 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.569
 truth is that I had very good 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.700
 expectations about them we had seen 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.189
 some reviews in English about the 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.459
 shadow to eat of citi color that was 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:53.280
 a wonder that that was very good 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.230
 product that was worth the price what 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.540
 costing say they are not overly 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.239
 expensive to sell I do not remember exactly 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.670
 when they cost me but 23 pesos each 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.140
 one does not pass 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.440
 but to make them honest 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.350
 I do not like 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.320
 both I already tried really not 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.060
 try once I tried several times not 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.130
 I am a person that every day I put myself 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.980
 shadow and I was putting shadows 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.080
 just to do the test of these 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.730
 and to be able to do a good review on 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:29.130
 the products and I got tired of putting the 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.900
 first I got tired of putting the shadow 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:36.210
 I tried with one I tried with another and all 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.670
 I'm invariably seen by myself 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.110
 like at six o'clock in the morning I entered 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.570
 work at seven o'clock 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:46.100
 all six invariably at two 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:49.230
 in the afternoon she was bringing a super fold 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:53.400
 in this part of here that measure also 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:56.040
 be here below thing 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.079
 and you will tell me good from 6 o'clock 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.519
 the morning until 2 in the afternoon are 8 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:06.030
 hours if I understand it but this one the 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:09.620
 nix I put it on and it holds me all 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.620
 I put it on at 6 in the morning 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.750
 I can see myself in the makeup at 10 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.180
 the morning at 2 in the afternoon at 5 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.549
 the afternoon and this endures me all day 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.639
 I is not done nothing but fold 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:26.290
 world this and the one of palladio the one 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.290
 sold in sally beauty supply 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.610
 they work just the same for me both 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.220
 they hold perfect these two days 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.629
 at two in the afternoon I already have the super 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.240
 fold and do not think it's a fold 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:40.490
 little one is not a pretty crease 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.199
 broad that I would say that even me 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.460
 the fold with the 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:48.910
 product that without the product 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:54.120
 if you want to check to see how they 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:56.370
 I'm saying it's not such an expensive product but 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.930
 if it does not serve honestly the 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:03.389
 investment is not so good and cool to me not 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:07.290
 It served me just as there are people who 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:10.229
 It seems great product at best 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.880
 I have a much fatter eyelid 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.699
 better the people who have the skin a 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:18.090
 little else is removed with these products 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:20.160
 they are doing great because not if you 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.199
 they already tried them, they tell me in the box 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.060
 of information what happened to what 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.699
 you were much better 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.039
 more luck than me and any doubt that 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:30.600
 have on the product let me side on 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:32.280

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.740
 I can answer you with pleasure and 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.110
