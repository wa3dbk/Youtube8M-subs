some of our ideas and thinking behind

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.470 
some of our ideas and thinking behind
the<00:00:11.059> design<00:00:11.480> of<00:00:11.719> the<00:00:12.259> new<00:00:12.530> Bentley<00:00:12.889> Musa<00:00:13.339> if<00:00:14.240> we

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
the design of the new Bentley Musa if we

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.590 
the design of the new Bentley Musa if we
start<00:00:14.780> with<00:00:14.870> the<00:00:15.230> front<00:00:15.499> end<00:00:16.030> we<00:00:17.030> have<00:00:17.270> the

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
start with the front end we have the

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.410 
start with the front end we have the
classic<00:00:18.290> Bentley<00:00:18.800> elements<00:00:19.370> which<00:00:19.580> is<00:00:19.880> the

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
classic Bentley elements which is the

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.350 
classic Bentley elements which is the
grille<00:00:20.750> and<00:00:21.020> the<00:00:21.080> round<00:00:21.740> lines<00:00:22.130> this<00:00:22.880> time<00:00:23.210> you

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
grille and the round lines this time you

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.290 
grille and the round lines this time you
want<00:00:23.630> the<00:00:23.990> design<00:00:24.470> basically<00:00:25.130> to<00:00:25.640> show<00:00:25.970> that

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
want the design basically to show that

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.840 
want the design basically to show that
the<00:00:26.600> moves<00:00:26.840> on<00:00:27.110> its<00:00:27.590> the<00:00:27.830> car<00:00:28.070> that<00:00:28.340> sits<00:00:28.580> on

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:28.850 
the moves on its the car that sits on

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
we look to this in two ways

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.970 
we look to this in two ways
first<00:03:01.660> of<00:03:01.810> all<00:03:01.930> we<00:03:02.110> took<00:03:02.290> some<00:03:02.560> modern

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
first of all we took some modern

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.280 
first of all we took some modern
influences<00:03:03.220> from<00:03:03.940> architecture<00:03:04.660> jewelry

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290

and<00:03:12.160> craftsmanship<00:03:13.350> looking<00:03:14.350> at<00:03:14.440> the

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
and craftsmanship looking at the

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.270 
and craftsmanship looking at the
instrument<00:03:14.950> panel

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
instrument panel

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.250 
instrument panel
we<00:03:15.489> wanted<00:03:15.790> to<00:03:15.910> create<00:03:16.030> quite<00:03:16.360> a<00:03:16.390> formal<00:03:16.959> feel

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
we wanted to create quite a formal feel

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.190 
we wanted to create quite a formal feel
to<00:03:17.860> the

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
to the

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.230 
to the
so<00:03:18.770> we<00:03:18.860> took<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.130> wood<00:03:19.340> from<00:03:19.550> one<00:03:19.760> side<00:03:20.030> of<00:03:20.060> the

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
so we took the wood from one side of the

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.059 
so we took the wood from one side of the
car<00:03:20.450> all<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:20.900> way<00:03:21.020> across<00:03:21.380> to<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.590> other<00:03:21.680> and

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
car all the way across to the other and

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.100 
car all the way across to the other and
this<00:03:22.550> is<00:03:22.730> capped<00:03:23.030> by<00:03:23.180> what<00:03:23.540> we<00:03:23.630> call<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.900> top

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
this is capped by what we call the top

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.199 
this is capped by what we call the top
roll<00:03:24.349> there's<00:03:25.010> a<00:03:25.099> confident<00:03:25.610> line<00:03:25.760> over<00:03:26.090> the

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
roll there's a confident line over the

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.940 
roll there's a confident line over the
top<00:03:26.420> of<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:26.750> instrument<00:03:27.110> panel<00:03:27.620> and<00:03:27.739> then

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
top of the instrument panel and then

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.949 
top of the instrument panel and then
shoots<00:03:28.310> across<00:03:28.520> the<00:03:28.819> car<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.569> passenger

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
shoots across the car to the passenger

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.800 
shoots across the car to the passenger
side<00:03:30.550> supporting<00:03:31.550> that<00:03:31.760> are<00:03:32.150> basically<00:03:32.540> two

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
side supporting that are basically two

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.320 
side supporting that are basically two
wings<00:03:33.110> and<00:03:33.440> this<00:03:33.800> comes<00:03:34.099> from<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:34.880> shape<00:03:35.150> of

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
wings and this comes from the shape of

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.320 
wings and this comes from the shape of
the<00:03:35.480> symmetrical<00:03:36.050> Bentley<00:03:36.350> wing<00:03:36.530> badge

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.200 

looking<00:03:40.050> at<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.320> wood<00:03:40.760> something<00:03:41.760> I<00:03:41.880> wanted

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 
looking at the wood something I wanted

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.990 
looking at the wood something I wanted
to<00:03:42.300> do<00:03:42.480> was<00:03:42.990> really<00:03:43.290> capture<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.550> thickness

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
to do was really capture the thickness

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.030 
to do was really capture the thickness
of<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.240> wood<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:45.960> can<00:03:46.170> see<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.500> thickness<00:03:46.770> of

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
of the wood you can see the thickness of

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.010 
of the wood you can see the thickness of
the<00:03:47.160> wood<00:03:47.340> in<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:47.760> center<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.450> also<00:03:48.660> when<00:03:48.960> you

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
the wood in the center and also when you

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.990 
the wood in the center and also when you
open<00:03:49.050> the<00:03:49.410> door<00:03:49.620> you<00:03:50.160> can<00:03:50.340> see<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.580> exposed

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
open the door you can see it exposed

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.180 
open the door you can see it exposed
again<00:03:51.210> at<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.540> end<00:03:51.630> this<00:03:52.560> tells<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:53.010> customer

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
again at the end this tells the customer

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.890 
again at the end this tells the customer
that<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.700> wood<00:03:53.880> is<00:03:54.030> solid<00:03:54.270> all<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:54.690> way

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
that the wood is solid all the way

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.500 
that the wood is solid all the way
through<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:56.370> wood<00:03:56.520> also<00:03:56.670> connects<00:03:57.210> into<00:03:57.420> the

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
through the wood also connects into the

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.810 
through the wood also connects into the
doors<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:58.140> into<00:03:58.710> the<00:03:58.830> rear<00:03:59.040> doors<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.550> around

through the rear compartment and this

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.550 
through the rear compartment and this
creates<00:04:02.970> what<00:04:03.090> we<00:04:03.240> call<00:04:03.330> the<00:04:03.690> Ring<00:04:03.900> of<00:04:04.140> wood<00:04:04.350> a

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
creates what we call the Ring of wood a

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.340 
creates what we call the Ring of wood a
continuous<00:04:05.430> line<00:04:05.700> around<00:04:06.300> the<00:04:06.450> car<00:04:06.660> a<00:04:09.350> lot

two<00:04:19.080> dials<00:04:19.500> that<00:04:19.709> are<00:04:20.070> either<00:04:20.190> side<00:04:20.549> of<00:04:20.580> that

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
two dials that are either side of that

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.360 
two dials that are either side of that
display<00:04:21.269> and<00:04:22.049> we<00:04:22.170> introduced<00:04:22.590> something<00:04:23.040> that

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
display and we introduced something that

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.890 
display and we introduced something that
goes<00:04:23.610> back<00:04:23.790> to<00:04:23.940> our<00:04:24.030> old<00:04:24.180> cars<00:04:24.480> where<00:04:24.780> the

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
goes back to our old cars where the

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.140 
goes back to our old cars where the
needle<00:04:25.230> start<00:04:25.560> at<00:04:25.740> one<00:04:25.920> o'clock<00:04:26.160> and<00:04:26.490> rotate

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
needle start at one o'clock and rotate

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.570 
needle start at one o'clock and rotate
round<00:04:27.450> and<00:04:28.140> this<00:04:28.380> puts<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.770> majority<00:04:29.280> of<00:04:29.310> the

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
round and this puts the majority of the

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.100 
round and this puts the majority of the
needle<00:04:29.970> use<00:04:30.180> into<00:04:30.540> the<00:04:30.570> center<00:04:31.050> for<00:04:31.530> clarity

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
needle use into the center for clarity

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.080 
needle use into the center for clarity
they're<00:04:33.680> looking<00:04:33.979> at<00:04:34.129> the<00:04:34.220> detail<00:04:34.639> of<00:04:34.669> the

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
they're looking at the detail of the

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.110 
they're looking at the detail of the
fascia<00:04:35.599> the<00:04:36.289> switches<00:04:36.889> we<00:04:37.340> actually<00:04:37.699> made<00:04:37.909> of

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
fascia the switches we actually made of

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.339 
fascia the switches we actually made of
glass<00:04:38.419> and<00:04:39.199> the<00:04:39.319> reason<00:04:39.710> for<00:04:39.740> this<00:04:39.979> is<00:04:40.370> twofold

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:41.349 
glass and the reason for this is twofold

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.270 
glass and the reason for this is twofold
glass<00:04:42.349> gives<00:04:42.650> you<00:04:42.740> a<00:04:42.770> very<00:04:43.009> high<00:04:43.219> quality

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
glass gives you a very high quality

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.450 
glass gives you a very high quality
finish<00:04:44.000> but<00:04:44.750> also<00:04:44.930> it<00:04:45.620> allows<00:04:45.919> the<00:04:46.280> natural

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
finish but also it allows the natural

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.300 
finish but also it allows the natural
illumination<00:04:46.819> of<00:04:47.389> the<00:04:47.449> switches<00:04:48.250> next<00:04:49.250> to

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
illumination of the switches next to

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.399 
illumination of the switches next to
these<00:04:49.460> glass<00:04:49.819> switches<00:04:50.330> we<00:04:50.629> have<00:04:50.810> a<00:04:50.840> rotary

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:51.409 
these glass switches we have a rotary

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:53.770 
these glass switches we have a rotary
that<00:04:52.250> is<00:04:52.430> an<00:04:52.610> ill<00:04:52.849> texture<00:04:53.330> that<00:04:53.449> comes<00:04:53.599> from

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
that is an ill texture that comes from

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:00.820 
that is an ill texture that comes from
our<00:04:53.900> heritage<00:04:54.229> and<00:04:54.680> a<00:04:55.009> nice<00:04:55.189> glass<00:04:55.460> Center

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.290 

then<00:05:01.830> looking<00:05:02.040> at<00:05:02.190> the<00:05:02.280> detail<00:05:02.700> we<00:05:03.270> have

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
then looking at the detail we have

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.840 
then looking at the detail we have
something<00:05:03.840> called<00:05:04.050> an<00:05:04.290> iPod<00:05:04.710> draw<00:05:04.980> and<00:05:05.730> we

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
something called an iPod draw and we

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.580 
something called an iPod draw and we
wanted<00:05:06.180> a<00:05:06.300> clever<00:05:06.600> way<00:05:06.870> to<00:05:07.170> actually

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
wanted a clever way to actually

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.400 
wanted a clever way to actually
integrate<00:05:07.980> people's<00:05:08.670> music<00:05:09.120> devices<00:05:09.420> into

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
integrate people's music devices into

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.290 
integrate people's music devices into
the<00:05:10.440> car<00:05:10.710> and<00:05:10.950> then<00:05:11.250> that<00:05:11.490> connects<00:05:12.030> with<00:05:12.180> the

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
the car and then that connects with the

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:19.400 
the car and then that connects with the
60<00:05:12.750> gigabyte<00:05:13.170> memory<00:05:17.510> the<00:05:18.510> Mulsanne<00:05:18.900> interior

60 gigabyte memory the Mulsanne interior

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.650 
60 gigabyte memory the Mulsanne interior
can<00:05:19.620> accommodate<00:05:20.100> five<00:05:20.370> people<00:05:20.880> but<00:05:21.450> when<00:05:21.570> you

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
can accommodate five people but when you

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.300 
can accommodate five people but when you
have<00:05:21.780> four<00:05:22.020> people<00:05:22.140> in<00:05:22.350> the<00:05:22.500> car<00:05:22.710> you<00:05:22.860> fold

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
have four people in the car you fold

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.820 
have four people in the car you fold
this<00:05:23.490> armrest<00:05:23.880> down<00:05:24.060> for<00:05:24.390> comfort<00:05:24.750> and<00:05:25.110> then

when we started the design of the
interior<00:05:51.259> our<00:05:51.830> aim<00:05:52.039> was<00:05:52.280> to<00:05:52.460> capture<00:05:52.669> the

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:52.909 
interior our aim was to capture the

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
create the dynamics in the design we

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.839 
create the dynamics in the design we
actually<00:06:08.960> use<00:06:09.080> very<00:06:09.139> strong<00:06:09.440> graphics<00:06:10.370> that

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:10.849 
actually use very strong graphics that
