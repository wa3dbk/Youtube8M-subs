00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:21.470
 5 4 3 2 1 goes from 36 left 6 to 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.470
 left 4 full on the left 6 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.330
 look at the 35 on the left 5 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.510
 between four wrinkles pulls we started well 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.120
 with a good pace we tried to 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.340
 go with a regular trend though 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.170
 unfortunately a few kilometers from the 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.239
 departure about six seven kilometers 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.339
 we caught up with there in front of us 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.550
 he kept up with one of our own 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:51.170
 small mistake that causes dust in a 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.629
 hairpin to the left we arrived a 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.070
 a little long to back up there 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.659
 we succeeded because the car touched 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.129
 below so we are tried to go 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:01.399
 but ahead there was a big hole 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.710
 so we couldn't get out 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.110
 there were only 45 people there 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.729
 they pushed immediately and we managed to get out 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.090
 having very little time we have 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.729
 immediately found a good feeling and we had 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.040
 we also sailed at a good pace 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.460
 for many kilometers in the dust and then 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:24.710
 at some point probably even a 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:26.780
 po recovered from this situation there 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.049
 we have made a small mistake 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.540
 and our race for today is over there 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.880
 we hope to resume doing tomorrow 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.280
 better in short to get on stage 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.899
 of arrival and without damage 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.140
 in short, trying to do ours 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.939
 better unfortunately our car say 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.399
 at italy talent has had a little 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.890
 inconvenience can really so much 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:52.710
 bad luck they reached in 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.030
 in the first test here is correct before 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.210
 in the dust you are probably 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.159
 also deconcentrated a little bit and have 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.090
 made a long and banal turn 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.770
 long 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.770
 the problem is that there was no one in 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.920
 that moment 45 people were enough for 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.560
 let them restart however said this 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.860
 we continue the boys and girls continue 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.540
 tomorrow and the day after tomorrow will prove fourth 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.080
 these two guys are really good 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.239
 and so guys say such a Italy 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.760
 I recommend you cheer them on 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:34.970
 because they really deserve it bye
