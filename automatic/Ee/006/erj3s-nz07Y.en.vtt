i didn't know i didn't end up getting it
in<00:02:43.660> Teleca<00:02:44.020> like<00:02:44.410> I<00:02:44.530> was<00:02:44.650> like<00:02:44.770> level<00:02:45.040> like<00:02:45.190> 40

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
in Teleca like I was like level like 40

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.960 
in Teleca like I was like level like 40
or<00:02:45.880> something<00:02:46.270> hi<00:02:47.170> it<00:02:47.860> took<00:02:48.010> me<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.250> while<00:02:48.460> and

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
or something hi it took me a while and

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.460 
or something hi it took me a while and
then<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:49.150> know<00:02:49.270> you<00:02:49.390> proceed<00:02:49.780> all<00:02:49.960> over<00:02:50.230> again

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470

and<00:02:51.390> but<00:02:52.390> no<00:02:52.870> I<00:02:52.900> think<00:02:53.140> it's<00:02:53.320> definitely<00:02:53.410> one

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
and but no I think it's definitely one

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.020 
and but no I think it's definitely one
worth<00:02:53.920> getting<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:56.680> think<00:02:57.220> it's<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.400> bat

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
worth getting and I think it's a bat

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.880 
worth getting and I think it's a bat
park<00:02:58.330> that<00:02:58.630> perk<00:02:58.930> system<00:02:59.530> works<00:02:59.680> really<00:02:59.770> well

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
park that perk system works really well

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.410 
park that perk system works really well
for<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.160> shotgun<00:03:00.520> as<00:03:00.610> well<00:03:00.760> it<00:03:01.060> really<00:03:01.240> for

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
for the shotgun as well it really for

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.180 
for the shotgun as well it really for
any<00:03:01.540> class<00:03:01.780> um<00:03:02.260> kind<00:03:02.950> of<00:03:02.980> more<00:03:03.100> of<00:03:03.130> a

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
any class um kind of more of a

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.950 
any class um kind of more of a
domination<00:03:03.610> class<00:03:03.940> but<00:03:04.300> I<00:03:04.510> just<00:03:04.810> thought<00:03:04.900> I'd

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
domination class but I just thought I'd

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.870 
domination class but I just thought I'd
