 horror is falling a gas critic like that 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.089
 I got drenched when I came here to the car 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.499
 but well, we're already here 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:53.890
 I present my car a renault clio and 

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:53.890
 well then 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.839

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:04.070
 see a little bit like that the radio that we have 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:10.060
 try to light the little light so there 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.060
 we have a radio from a radio-cd 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.650
 you can operate up 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.000
 without housing without housing can be operated 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.180
 so, well, first of all 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.010
 we remove the contact and leave without 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.330
 current some man without current 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.340
 some not because we have the battery 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.770
 plugged the roll but well let's 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.840
 try to remove this case and then 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.730
 of it to remove it is worth with a tool 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.730
 let's see what we have on 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.830
 then I explain a little bit we are going to 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.480
 remove this and then we're going to take it out 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.450
 with a special tool that I have 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.700
 now continuous now we teach them up 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.110
 some connectors and they are from here they came 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.570
 I have directly put them as I have 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.060
 could you know how to broadcast because as 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.010
 can not enter anymore by directly to the 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.750
 volley let's hit with a hand is a 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.380
 little bitchy but let's give the contact 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:08.160
 the car and has not exploited the car does not 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:12.290
 it did not blow up hell name this is 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:17.349
 right evening so if we give you welcome 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.349
 here aux-in I do not know what volume 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.820
 then we are going to give him the radio 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:28.700
 although we do not have radio because there is 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.700
 antenna without putting I need an adapter 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:39.060
 but it sounds worth 1 2 3 4 uruguay and 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.549
 so now to remove the frame s 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.819
 I have to remove the connectors again 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:47.700
 and so we remove the frame that and put the 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.220
 that is from the radio and that's it and with that and 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.359
 a cake until tomorrow at 8 and already 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.550
 we have interim radios to see if I do not 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:59.550
 I'm running out of battery 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:03.030
 and the car will not start me 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.030
 by the hair 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.740
 and that's how the little one goes 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:16.250
 I hope you liked it is a radio 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:18.050
 that comes with usb that is very cool and 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.600
 that's good, it still does not fit or 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.820
 in the hole it's worth but how good 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.250
 we will fit in the gap later on we 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.250
 we see until the next kids 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.270
