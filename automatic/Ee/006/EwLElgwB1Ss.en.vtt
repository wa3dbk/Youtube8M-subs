00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.310 

and<00:06:10.980> the<00:06:11.070> deeper<00:06:11.430> you<00:06:11.550> dig<00:06:11.580> the<00:06:12.170> harder<00:06:13.170> it<00:06:13.260> is

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
and the deeper you dig the harder it is

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.900 
and the deeper you dig the harder it is
to<00:06:13.380> compress<00:06:13.740> all<00:06:14.010> that<00:06:14.160> stuff<00:06:14.400> back<00:06:14.610> into<00:06:14.820> the

to compress all that stuff back into the

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:20.210 
to compress all that stuff back into the
hole<00:06:15.090> so<00:06:18.590> really<00:06:19.590> need<00:06:19.740> to<00:06:19.830> make<00:06:19.950> sure<00:06:20.010> you

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220
