00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.430
 what is it that makes our planet so 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.470
 special 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.670
 and the answers are hidden 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.950
 deeply in the earth's past 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.110
 to find them we must travel back 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.080
 in time to see the first 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.150
 humans walk on the earth to 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.849
 travel on continents in their travels 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.080
 towards a collision to face 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.080
 killer dinosaurs 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.480
 to submerge in oceans full of 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.480
 strange ways of life 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.700
 to feel the penetrating cold of the 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.700
 global ice ages 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.590
 and experience the fury of the attacks 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.750
 of cosmic projectiles 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.000
 we must travel back in time 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.100
 until we get to the birth of the 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.350
 earth itself 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.640
 and then we can put together the incredible 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.149
 history of our planet 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:03.700
 and discover why this all 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.700
 We are here 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.910
 how the earth was born 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.970
 our trip starts almost five 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.060
 billion years 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.630
 but this can not be correct there is no 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.049
 signs of our beautiful blue planet 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:39.530
 just a newborn star of ours 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.530
 sun surrounded by all this dust 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:46.909
 we arrived very early 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.909
 before the earth was formed 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.950
 accelerate the time and we can see the 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.640
 gravity convert the powder into rocks 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.640
 lowercase 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.680
 it hardly seems possible that something so 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:16.170
 complex as a planet be made of 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.170
 nothing but dust and rocks 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.240
 through millions of years 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.230
 gravity joined these rocks to 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.230
 form the earth 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.440
 one of at least a hundred planets that 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.440
 they revolve around the sun 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.880
 but 4.54 billion years ago 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.380
 our planet was more like 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.380
 hell that to our home 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.630
 up close the temperature is over 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.630
 1200 degrees Celsius 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.489
 there is no air 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.120
 only carbon dioxide nitrogen and 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.120
 water vapor 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:43.689
 it's so hot so toxic that if we 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.700
 we approach more we incinerate and masters and not 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:47.700
 suffocate and masters in just seconds 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.489
 the newborn planet is a ball 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.760
 boiling liquid rock 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:01.769
 there are virtually no solid surfaces 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.769
 just an endless ocean of lava 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:20.049
 a young planet called tea is directed 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.049
 directly to us 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.639
 it's the size of Mars and travels to almost 15 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:31.069
 kilometers per second 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.069
 and 20 times faster than a bullet 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.920
 the gravity of the intruder deforms the 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.920
 surface of the earth 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.940
 the shock waves travel the planet 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.229
 it's as if both young planets are 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.229
 return liquid 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:27.350
 trillions of tons of rubble are 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.350
 fired into space 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:54.250
 but in the course of only 1000 years 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:56.350
 the gravity exerts its magic and 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.530
 turns the rubble into a ring of 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:02.640
 Hot red powder and rotating rock 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.640
 around the earth 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:13.270
 and now from this ring a ball forms 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.270
 more than three thousand kilometers wide 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:23.030
 we witness the birth of our 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.030
 Moon 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:29.430
 is much closer than the moon that 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:32.310
 we recognize only 22 thousand kilometers 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:35.840
 away instead of about 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.840
 400,000 km 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:00.530
 the sun rises on a planet that is 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.530
 cool 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:11.900
 and it gets only three hours after 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.900
 go out 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:18.770
 the impact has left the earth giving 

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:21.930
 turns so quickly that one day 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:25.050
 complete lasts only six hours 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:28.380
 the days can pass very fast but the 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:30.470
 Earth changes slowly to understand 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.910
 how our planet was formed 

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:35.960
 we need to advance the time some 

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.960
 millions of years 

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.510
 a meteoroid hail
