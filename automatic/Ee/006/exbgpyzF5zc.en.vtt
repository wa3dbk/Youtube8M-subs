genius<00:04:15.660> idea<00:04:15.750> that<00:04:16.140> she's<00:04:16.290> going<00:04:16.470> to<00:04:16.560> sync<00:04:16.919> up

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
genius idea that she's going to sync up

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.400 
genius idea that she's going to sync up
the<00:04:17.100> recording<00:04:17.790> with<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.060> actual<00:04:18.419> game<00:04:18.750> with

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
the recording with the actual game with

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.110 
the recording with the actual game with
her<00:04:19.620> voice<00:04:19.890> as<00:04:20.130> well<00:04:20.310> so<00:04:20.519> it's<00:04:20.669> almost<00:04:20.850> kind<00:04:21.090> of

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
her voice as well so it's almost kind of

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.750 
her voice as well so it's almost kind of
like<00:04:21.299> she's<00:04:21.570> there<00:04:21.870> and<00:04:22.020> all<00:04:22.890> of<00:04:22.950> this<00:04:23.370> is<00:04:23.550> just

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
like she's there and all of this is just

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.390 
like she's there and all of this is just
really<00:04:24.539> uncomfortable<00:04:25.080> and<00:04:25.680> just<00:04:25.890> kind<00:04:26.280> of

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
really uncomfortable and just kind of

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.470 
really uncomfortable and just kind of
strange

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
strange

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.810 
strange
just<00:04:27.660> odd<00:04:27.840> and<00:04:28.380> she<00:04:28.890> finally<00:04:29.130> finishes<00:04:29.670> her

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
just odd and she finally finishes her

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.820 
just odd and she finally finishes her
little<00:04:30.090> project<00:04:30.570> and<00:04:30.750> she<00:04:31.080> decides<00:04:31.350> to<00:04:31.500> listen

and<00:04:58.710> it<00:04:59.250> was<00:04:59.400> another<00:04:59.640> good<00:04:59.940> one<00:05:00.150> I<00:05:00.510> really

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
and it was another good one I really

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.720 
and it was another good one I really
like<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:01.890> fact<00:05:02.070> that<00:05:02.280> every<00:05:02.460> once<00:05:02.640> while

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
because the whole episode was just

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.460 
because the whole episode was just
really<00:05:44.970> good<00:05:45.240> there<00:05:45.870> are<00:05:45.900> some<00:05:46.110> people<00:05:46.260> who

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
really good there are some people who

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.900 
really good there are some people who
probably<00:05:46.710> aren't<00:05:47.010> going<00:05:47.190> to<00:05:47.280> like<00:05:47.520> the<00:05:47.670> slow

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
probably aren't going to like the slow

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.520 
probably aren't going to like the slow
pacing<00:05:48.210> like<00:05:48.540> at<00:05:48.660> the<00:05:48.720> very<00:05:48.840> beginning<00:05:49.080> like

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
pacing like at the very beginning like

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:50.810 
pacing like at the very beginning like
the<00:05:49.680> fact<00:05:49.890> that<00:05:49.980> she's<00:05:50.190> just<00:05:50.250> sitting<00:05:50.730> around

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
the fact that she's just sitting around

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.430 
the fact that she's just sitting around
reading<00:05:51.360> playing<00:05:51.690> video<00:05:51.960> games<00:05:52.200> and

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
reading playing video games and

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.870 
reading playing video games and
obviously<00:05:53.250> there's<00:05:53.520> some<00:05:53.640> cultural

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
obviously there's some cultural

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.640 
obviously there's some cultural
references<00:05:54.570> that<00:05:54.720> might<00:05:54.990> go<00:05:55.170> over<00:05:55.320> some

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
references that might go over some

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.760 
references that might go over some
people's<00:05:55.980> heads<00:05:56.220> but<00:05:56.750> still<00:05:57.750> for<00:05:58.320> what<00:05:58.560> it's

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
people's heads but still for what it's

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.060 
people's heads but still for what it's
doing<00:05:59.370> it's<00:05:59.550> doing<00:05:59.640> it<00:06:00.000> really<00:06:00.180> well<00:06:00.300> and

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
doing it's doing it really well and

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.890 
doing it's doing it really well and
again<00:06:02.070> the<00:06:02.250> Tomoko<00:06:02.670> character<00:06:03.090> is<00:06:03.300> not<00:06:03.690> really

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
again the Tomoko character is not really

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.090 
again the Tomoko character is not really
changing<00:06:04.290> all<00:06:04.470> that<00:06:04.650> much

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
changing all that much

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.640 
changing all that much
every<00:06:05.850> episode<00:06:05.970> she<00:06:06.420> does<00:06:06.540> like<00:06:06.690> maybe<00:06:07.230> one<00:06:07.530> or

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
every episode she does like maybe one or

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.200 
every episode she does like maybe one or
two<00:06:07.680> things<00:06:08.040> to<00:06:08.250> sort<00:06:08.430> of<00:06:08.580> like<00:06:08.730> show<00:06:09.000> that

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
two things to sort of like show that

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.510 
two things to sort of like show that
she's<00:06:09.390> becoming<00:06:09.720> slightly<00:06:10.260> more<00:06:10.680> sociable<00:06:11.160> so

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
she's becoming slightly more sociable so

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.700 
she's becoming slightly more sociable so
I'm<00:06:11.790> not<00:06:11.970> even<00:06:12.210> gonna<00:06:12.330> give<00:06:12.570> this<00:06:12.690> one<00:06:12.750> score

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 
I'm not even gonna give this one score
