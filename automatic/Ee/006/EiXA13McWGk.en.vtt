00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.740
 very good to all endorsers that such as 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:05.839
 you are welcome again from the channel 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.549
 guys welcome to a new video and you 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:08.900
 subject to do the special 20,000 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:11.330
 subscribers that was well received 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.240
 we're back kids 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.540
 of 90 in a new video and this time it's 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.580
 something special not because this video never 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.040
 I've done it for the channel it's worth I've never 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.650
 talked about a partner company but this 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.710
 once I think it's worth it since 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.390
 I was recently in a company 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.119
 called spain oil for 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.100
 about two months or something like that and 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.440
 The truth is that I would like to express myself 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.980
 It's worth it because it's not a bad company 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.410
 true compared to many there are 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.870
 very many that fuck you and the truth then 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.360
 I would like 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.030
 give information is valid so that it does not pass 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.530
 it's the same thing that I spend in 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.570
 example in a company it is worth that I 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.089
 they bitched they are not paying me 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.680
 they paid not even because here I am 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.870
 pretty good I'm pretty comfortable and 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.839
 the truth is worth doing this 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.989
 video so nothing that I will speak 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:07.030
 and what am I going to tell you then I'm going to give you 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.759
 a couple of steps worth 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.310
 and information about the partner company 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.690
 what it offers you and such if you do not know what 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.600
 which is a business partner surely 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.660
 Yes, but if not, that's what you could 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.350
 say that you are pussy that on youtube you 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.270
 put ads and then there's the company 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.979
 and the company takes you and it's worth it 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.170
 I do not know how to explain exactly that 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.479
 would be in this case and then between your 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.190
 You and your company have a contract worth 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.530
 the company stays a percentage and you 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.380
 you stay with the other one, so nothing 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.810
 let's move on to inform us it's worth a 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.759
 couple of things the company is worth and what 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.700
 happens is that in this company there is no 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.220
 permanence what is that means that if 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.420
 when you enter the company you can 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.680
 throw at any time 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.130
 requesting them 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.300
 link in the youtube channel and what 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.640
 is how good is the good thing that has 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.100
 this then that the truth then you do not 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.140
 they can do a lot of stitches because if 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.450
 you do not have peteco permanence expires in 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.570
 any time but obviously if you 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.690
 are you if you have permanence in a 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.209
 company when they have you inside you the 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.920
 can roll up so to speak if they are 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.440
 bad companies can mess you up 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.530
 pretty it and stay a year 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.250
 two years or even three you know what 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.560
 it happens here that you are not going to 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.850
 they are not going to go to fucking basically 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.380
 because it is not a beloved company 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.590
 Y 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.700
 and I quite like it better 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.790
 just as I said it does not have 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.340
 permanence in the cpm that is the cost 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.250
 per thousand visits is not better is a 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.920
 Pretty cpm is quite varied 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.260
 but it's because if you do not understand me, it's worth 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.200
 with cpm means cost for my visits 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.760
 advertised is worth what they give you for costs 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.670
 for my visits announced sometimes I 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.230
 you understand is not that of course it is that if not 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.910
 you have no fucking idea about these things 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.640
 I'm talking about you are 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.690
 staying with a face of in but good 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.220
 what's not bad is worth it because you have me and 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.530
 basically the requirements that you have 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.800
 have to enter the company 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.830
 where I am is a hundred visits 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.240
 daily is worth if you do not know the views of 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.220
 daily visits that you have can enter 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.660
 to the page of the social blade os what 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.040
 I'll leave the inscription so it does not 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.960
 you lose, you have it in the 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:28.260
 description and when you enter you can 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.930
 that is, if you want our channel here 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.620
 look at your statistics and 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.560
 you can observe 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.030
 in the box that puts daily visits 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.360
 so look at the daily visits that 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:44.540
 you have about 100 approximately 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.340
 and that you have about 500 subscribers to see 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.870
 if for example you have 400 subscribers and 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.659
 You have a thousand visits a day, I think 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.610
 they would accept you but not the case 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:55.519
 so that you have 100 daily visits 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.640
 minimally you know for you to keep and 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:01.579
 Finally, do not have any copyright infringement 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.879
 and here a lot of people get confused 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:07.700
 because there is the strike and the content of 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.200
 third there are people who are clear and 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.170
 When you have third-party content, 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.660
 think that that is copyright and it is lack and 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.160
 you are not going to see you can have content 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.989
 from third parties that is simply what 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.479
 What happens is that the income you generate 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:24.260
 in that video they do not leave for you but for 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:26.600
 Protect the owner of the song in a 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.810
 example ok we have to look if you have 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.760
 strikes you are is the part of you 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.330
 channel where you can see if you have the 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.789
 green or red button 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.470
 in that section, I suppose I do not 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:40.360
 you will have but if it is the case that 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.490
 you have then you wait for the one who is going to 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.210
 put the green button is OK and then 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.389
 you can enter the spain oil 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.289
 what else to enter the company the 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.150
 steps to follow 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.680
 Well, very simple if you meet 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.759
 those requirements 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.919
 dale applies that you have the official link 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:01.319
 of the company in the description I do not 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.030
 I earn money because that link is worth no 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:07.590
 you think here that I'm going to line up 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.380
 you, not much less, but it is a 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.040
 I leave the link there 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.810
 you apply fill in the form that does not 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:19.070
 you need neither to have primary to know 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:21.110
 make it worth it just you fall skins 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.560
 on behalf of your channel 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:27.740
 and things like that, it's already worth reading and 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.230
 you are understanding and when you give 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.650
 send the form then they will tell you 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.090
 that you need to certify your channel 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.610
 as you own it osa 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.680
 enter your channel and you accept that yes 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.930
 that if such as already take for ass worth 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.200
 then those will send an email to the end 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:48.230
 of a couple of days can be one two or 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:52.010
 three I do not know but he puts seven but they are 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:53.720
 few days is worth and then because 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.880
 from there I suppose that you no longer 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.680
 you will lose vale in the mail already they will go to you 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.660
 the things you have to do 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.789
 to enter the ice world but I guess 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.590
 I think I remember that we are already inside 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:07.949
 of the company if a message arrives 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.840
 saying that yes you are inside so 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:11.580
 I think he left me nothing more kids 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.720
 and he left me something else I'll leave it for the 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:17.789
 description is worth it because speaking like that without 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.169
 scripts or anything, it costs a little 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:21.900
 because before doing the video he has me 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:23.550
 to go over some statistics 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.960
 channel because it is that I did not remember and 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:32.449
 for last thing so it's worth I forget 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:36.319
 the company offers you a remnant almost of 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:38.180
 80 percent 20% what is that 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:40.310
 that you stay with 80 percent of 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:43.220
 what you generate 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.200
 in your videos and the company stays the 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.690
 20 percent is the agreement I had 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.790
 earlier told before the video 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.440
 that you stay with a percentage and the 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:54.080
 company is left with another then in this 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.600
 company offers you 80 percent is 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.000
 the case is worth of other companies that you 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.800
 offer 60 and 40 percent and then 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.450
 you say ostiense that in a 40 por 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.610
 hundred percent of what generated the truth is that 

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.260
 they stay pretty well here you are 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.020
 they are left with less and it is much better 

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.580
 It's worth it, guys, I do not want me 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.860
 roll up is better because it makes me a 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.320
 Super eternal video and I do not want it worth it 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.850
 that nothing kids try with oil 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.260
 spain which is a good company worth not 

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.360
 have permanence if you are not comfortable 

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.770
 you can leave at any time and 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.910
 nothing do not want to say anything else the 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.200
 continue to tablets see you in the 

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.200
 next video and greetings
