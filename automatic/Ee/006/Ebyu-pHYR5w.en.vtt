arm like hockey sticks that we use on
the<00:00:28.289> ice<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:29.250> um<00:00:30.080> this<00:00:31.080> one<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.529> kind<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:31.949> bad

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
the ice so um this one is kind of bad

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.479 
the ice so um this one is kind of bad
the<00:00:32.940> first<00:00:33.149> one<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.390> made<00:00:33.540> which<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.780> that

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
the first one I made which is that

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.250 
the first one I made which is that
because<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.910> was<00:00:36.329> really<00:00:36.600> just<00:00:36.660> getting<00:00:37.079> used

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
because I was really just getting used

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.459 
because I was really just getting used
to<00:00:37.350> tux<00:00:37.620> paint<00:00:38.390> with<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.660> sizing<00:00:40.379> and

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
to tux paint with the sizing and

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.340 
to tux paint with the sizing and
everything<00:00:40.950> but<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.750> the<00:00:42.750> tape<00:00:42.960> around<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
everything but and the tape around the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.279 
everything but and the tape around the
graphics<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:43.980> kind<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.309> crappy<00:00:44.640> but<00:00:45.289> this

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
graphics is kind of crappy but this

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.029 
graphics is kind of crappy but this
orange<00:00:46.710> stick<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.539> going<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.660> be<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:49.079> knack<00:00:49.500> 60

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
orange stick is going to be a knack 60

right<00:00:52.230> now<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.710> I'm<00:00:52.800> going<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.160> do<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.370> later

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
right now so I'm going to do it later

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.229 
right now so I'm going to do it later
and<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.539> going<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.840> be<00:00:55.079> either<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.340> total

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:04.609 
and this is going to be either a total
one<00:00:57.480> or<00:01:00.140> an<00:01:01.140> EQ<00:01:01.980> 50<00:01:02.399> or<00:01:03.030> an<00:01:03.510> S<00:01:03.629> 19<00:01:04.110> I'm<00:01:04.290> not<00:01:04.439> sure

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
one or an EQ 50 or an S 19 I'm not sure

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.850 
one or an EQ 50 or an S 19 I'm not sure
yet<00:01:04.970> so<00:01:05.970> um<00:01:06.420> I'll<00:01:07.140> just<00:01:07.260> show<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.500> my<00:01:07.680> first

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
stick I made it's a 195 um it's orange

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.270 
stick I made it's a 195 um it's orange
and<00:01:14.430> black<00:01:15.290> it's<00:01:16.290> got<00:01:16.470> my<00:01:16.619> name<00:01:16.650> on<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.040> name

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
and black it's got my name on the name

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:26.070 
and black it's got my name on the name
bar<00:01:21.619> then

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.220 

professional<00:01:26.680> use<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:28.240> I<00:01:28.600> mean<00:01:28.990> it's<00:01:29.110> pretty

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 
professional use so I mean it's pretty

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.870 
professional use so I mean it's pretty
good<00:01:29.470> for<00:01:29.620> my<00:01:29.650> first<00:01:29.920> stick<00:01:30.130> I<00:01:30.250> ever<00:01:30.400> made<00:01:30.670> and

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
good for my first stick I ever made and

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.970 
good for my first stick I ever made and
then<00:01:31.690> I<00:01:31.720> kind<00:01:32.110> of<00:01:32.170> screwed<00:01:32.350> up<00:01:32.590> with<00:01:32.860> the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
then I kind of screwed up with the

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.030 
then I kind of screwed up with the
sizing<00:01:33.430> there<00:01:33.610> and<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:35.110> tape<00:01:35.290> is<00:01:35.500> kinda<00:01:35.860> as

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
sizing there and the tape is kinda as

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.210 
sizing there and the tape is kinda as
you<00:01:36.910> can<00:01:37.030> see<00:01:37.210> they're<00:01:37.390> kind<00:01:37.840> of<00:01:38.100> kind<00:01:39.100> of

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
you can see they're kind of kind of

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.430 
you can see they're kind of kind of
weird<00:01:39.400> but<00:01:41.910> it's<00:01:42.910> it's<00:01:43.660> all<00:01:43.840> right<00:01:44.050> for<00:01:44.290> my

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
weird but it's it's all right for my

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.330 
weird but it's it's all right for my
first<00:01:44.620> one<00:01:44.890> I<00:01:44.920> ever<00:01:45.040> made<00:01:45.400> I<00:01:45.870> mean<00:01:47.190> it's<00:01:48.190> a

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
first one I ever made I mean it's a

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.090 
first one I ever made I mean it's a
Kovalchuk<00:01:48.940> curve<00:01:51.930> it's<00:01:52.930> pretty<00:01:53.170> I<00:01:53.380> mean<00:01:54.010> I'm

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
Kovalchuk curve it's pretty I mean I'm

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.940 
Kovalchuk curve it's pretty I mean I'm
pretty<00:01:54.280> good<00:01:54.400> at<00:01:54.460> doing<00:01:54.730> curves<00:01:54.940> on<00:01:55.150> the<00:01:55.950> on

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
pretty good at doing curves on the on

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.180 
pretty good at doing curves on the on
the<00:01:56.980> sticks<00:01:58.050> but<00:01:59.050> uh<00:01:59.080> this<00:01:59.500> is<00:01:59.650> going<00:01:59.800> to<00:01:59.860> be<00:01:59.950> my

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
the sticks but uh this is going to be my

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.360 
the sticks but uh this is going to be my
x<00:02:00.460> 60<00:02:02.460> Ovechkin<00:02:03.460> curve<00:02:04.360> I<00:02:05.010> think<00:02:06.010> I<00:02:06.100> did<00:02:06.280> the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
x 60 Ovechkin curve I think I did the

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.639 
x 60 Ovechkin curve I think I did the
Ovechkin<00:02:06.850> pattern<00:02:07.240> on<00:02:07.390> this<00:02:07.540> stick<00:02:07.810> extremely

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
Ovechkin pattern on this stick extremely

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.130 
Ovechkin pattern on this stick extremely
well<00:02:08.830> it<00:02:09.550> looks<00:02:09.760> exactly<00:02:10.240> like<00:02:10.479> Ovechkin's

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
well it looks exactly like Ovechkin's

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.410 
well it looks exactly like Ovechkin's
curve<00:02:11.350> and<00:02:11.650> like<00:02:12.610> I<00:02:12.760> said<00:02:12.820> this<00:02:13.060> is<00:02:13.120> going<00:02:13.360> to

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
curve and like I said this is going to

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.680 
curve and like I said this is going to
be<00:02:13.540> an<00:02:13.780> orange<00:02:14.320> and<00:02:14.670> black<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:16.090> orange<00:02:16.330> and

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
be an orange and black and orange and

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.290 
be an orange and black and orange and
white<00:02:16.870> like<00:02:17.410> just<00:02:17.709> X<00:02:17.950> 60<00:02:18.280> decals<00:02:18.700> but<00:02:19.000> instead

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
white like just X 60 decals but instead

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.320 
white like just X 60 decals but instead
of<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:19.510> being<00:02:19.680> black<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:20.920> mean<00:02:21.400> red<00:02:21.700> it's<00:02:22.150> going

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
of it being black I mean red it's going

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.750 
of it being black I mean red it's going
to<00:02:22.390> be<00:02:22.480> orange<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.410> then<00:02:24.310> this<00:02:24.520> is<00:02:24.670> probably

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
to be orange and then this is probably

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.850 
to be orange and then this is probably
going<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.150> be<00:02:25.270> a<00:02:25.510> penguin<00:02:25.840> small<00:02:26.590> candy<00:02:27.010> q50<00:02:27.840> as

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
going to be a penguin small candy q50 as

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:37.229 
going to be a penguin small candy q50 as
the<00:02:29.860> malkin<00:02:30.250> curve<00:02:30.430> there<00:02:30.989> so<00:02:33.090> yeah<00:02:34.380> my<00:02:35.380> toe<00:02:36.239> so
