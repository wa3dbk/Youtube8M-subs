crashing<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.109> glowing<00:00:22.380> green<00:00:22.740> that's<00:00:23.340> an

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
crashing and glowing green that's an

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.910 
crashing and glowing green that's an
example<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:24.029> bioluminescence<00:00:25.019> but<00:00:25.170> it's<00:00:25.320> far

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
example of bioluminescence but it's far

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.089 
example of bioluminescence but it's far
more<00:00:26.810> widespread<00:00:27.810> in<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.410> world<00:00:28.590> ocean<00:00:28.949> then

perhaps<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.820> even<00:00:29.849> appreciate<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:31.109> let's

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
perhaps you even appreciate so let's

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.760 
perhaps you even appreciate so let's
look<00:00:31.410> at<00:00:31.560> some<00:00:31.769> examples<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.899> it's

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
look at some examples of that and it's

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.700 
look at some examples of that and it's

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
funniest one are the one that we just

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.540 
funniest one are the one that we just
talked<00:04:46.789> about<00:04:46.960> most<00:04:47.960> amazing<00:04:48.530> one<00:04:48.710> I<00:04:48.889> think<00:04:49.430> is

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
talked about most amazing one I think is

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.730

this burglar alarm response where an

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.820 
this burglar alarm response where an

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
what we call the burglar alarm response

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.860 
what we call the burglar alarm response
well<00:05:12.500> it<00:05:12.770> isn't<00:05:13.250> just<00:05:13.550> fish<00:05:14.120> in<00:05:14.479> larger

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
well it isn't just fish in larger

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.050 
well it isn't just fish in larger

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
organisms that by luminous but it's also

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.779 
organisms that by luminous but it's also
bacteria<00:05:17.960> and<00:05:18.050> amazingly<00:05:18.710> enough<00:05:19.009> these

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
Bozeman produced essentially

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.659 
Bozeman produced essentially
bioluminescent<00:05:26.599> bacteria<00:05:26.840> art<00:05:27.740> and<00:05:28.219> that's

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
bioluminescent bacteria art and that's

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.909 
bioluminescent bacteria art and that's
what<00:05:28.849> this<00:05:29.000> picture<00:05:29.270> is<00:05:29.659> about<00:05:30.110> these<00:05:30.710> are

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
what this picture is about these are

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.519 
what this picture is about these are
bioluminescent<00:05:31.759> bacteria<00:05:31.909> and<00:05:32.509> they<00:05:33.259> grew

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:33.529 
bioluminescent bacteria and they grew

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:35.200 
bioluminescent bacteria and they grew
them<00:05:33.710> up<00:05:33.860> in<00:05:33.979> a<00:05:34.039> way<00:05:34.219> that<00:05:34.250> gave<00:05:34.789> them<00:05:35.029> these

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
them up in a way that gave them these

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.839 
them up in a way that gave them these
interesting<00:05:36.110> patterns<00:05:36.860> and<00:05:37.130> so<00:05:37.490> this<00:05:37.699> is

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 
interesting patterns and so this is

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:39.969 
interesting patterns and so this is
really<00:05:38.029> just<00:05:38.270> a<00:05:38.449> painting<00:05:38.870> of<00:05:39.169> bioluminescent

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
really just a painting of bioluminescent

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.730 
really just a painting of bioluminescent
