00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:04.339
 sought 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.700
 in the theoretical driving test are now 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.439
 Tested video films 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:16.609
 the Minister of Transport of NRW CHP Fuchsberger procured himself as 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.149
 Client a first impression of the pilot project at TÃ¼v Rheinland 

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:24.099
 especially percent you do not have the ability to do certain things anymore 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.630
 just memorizing as was the case with this old questionnaire 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.640
 but where you now have the opportunity to redesign situations in the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.320
 Video Animation That Builds Percent Vehicles 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.120
 around 20 2 action and can represent differently and the examinee significantly more 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.120
 must think along and are often situations to adjust 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:48.810
 variable 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.450
 Have product catalog 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.300
 in the empty go out on the server Interlaken data currently a valley one 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.430
 Assemble morning and give from one test report to another 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.430
 there are different questions that is the questions can be mixed 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.410
 All of the realistic animations were surprised 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.130
 produced cheaply and can be varied many times 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.410
 From 2012 to nationally in addition to revised photos and videos in the 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.260
 theoretical driving license examination 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.840
 young prince graduates told us how much better now the theory 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.860
 So people learned from here Axept any case rather Alpina Gerhard 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.250
 everything is more complicated 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.000
 and she was easier on the computer then when the process started 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.240
 been 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.050
 you can see every day tendency 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.210
 You can see this more feminine accordingly, you can also answer the question 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.049
 but then you can answer better 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.859
 If you can not look away can see you can answer better 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.120
 its milestone 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.500
 especially if you consider that now five sequences have been added 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.220
 that is what our young customers age now means 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.920
 the MOPO exam up to the car driver's license so things 15 and 18 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.509
 years 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.759
 today he is not used to that we also offer it here it is one of the 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.010
 completely new way to operate the normally driven prevention and 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.260
 With that, I'm sure in this age group 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.260
 To generate road traffic 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:53.849
 now he is already very impressive can be a traffic situation 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.760
 in fact right here 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.829
 experience 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.540
 What you otherwise can hardly represent percent that suddenly a child 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.799
 that one has just barely disappeared behind a car 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.470
 and now it has to act accordingly that is for him 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:11.629
 actually only in his video can be displayed that is otherwise on 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.159
 Questionnaires quite heavy who in his in his 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:19.629
 Importance and also drama he otherwise would not have presented 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:21.149
 that was desired earlier 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:23.689
 So I wished that before. "I'm really helped
