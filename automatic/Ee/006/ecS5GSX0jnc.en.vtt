00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:09.180
 democratic well since from a 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.690
 small comparative performance between 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.590
 the g2 with the 4.4 point 2 and the nexus 5 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.590
 let's see 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.910
 good as you all know does some 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.410
 time he said the comparison between the 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.759
 lexus 5 and the g 2 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.119
 but good taking advantage of the recent 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:28.550
 update from g2 to 4.4 point 2 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.779
 I have decided to make a comparison of 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.489
 performance so you can see the 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.050
 differences taking advantage of that the two 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.970
 they have the same version of the system 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.970
 operative so nothing let's see 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:43.880
 the g2 has an ips screen of 5.2 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:47.390
 inches with full hd resolution and a 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:50.300
 density of 423 pixels per inch a 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.570
 snapdragon processor 800 to 2.26 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:57.500
 gigahertz and 2 gigas of ram a memory 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.300
 internal of 16 or 32 gb not expandable a 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.850
 front camera 2 with 1 megapixels 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.040
 and 13-megapixel rear and one 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.350
 3000 million battery 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.010
 the nexus 5 mounted an ips screen 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.380
 4.95 inches with full hd resolution and 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.979
 a density of 445 pixels per inch 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.650
 a snapdragon 800 to 226 processor 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.380
 gigahertz and 2 gigas of ram a memory 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.660
 internal of 16 and 32 gigas not expandable 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.450
 a 1.3 megapixel front camera 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.470
 and 8- megapixel rear and one battery 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.470
 of 2,300 million 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.480
 we start with the navigation color 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:41.150
 first of all the usual points 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:44.510
 in the module and good as you see him 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.830
 the screen tone of the nexus is a 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.830
 little warmer but good 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.190
 we are going to attack 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.000
 nexus charges and the g2 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.270
 light nexuses 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.060
 nexus 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.120
 and good as your last one stands out 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.400
 geologists and naxos 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.400
 come on with vers 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.409
 nexus 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.680
 nexus 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.510
 again with his last 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.730
 and practically the same 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.220
 We are going to do the Youtube tests 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.220
 as usual 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.890
 g2 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.840
 two 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.080
 we have a little bit before 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.700
 a tris 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.700
 and well let's go to the last 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.680
 advertising 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.380
 light 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.380
 we open to the games we go with the blog 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.319
 and now a little where 2 comes up 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:06.979
 our all the same we go with the 

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:06.979
 vector 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:21.199
 when you have a little more breaker in 

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:21.199
 nexuses 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.020
 we do not put a game 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.090
 it's not finally we're going to withdraw 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.630
 it's not that the bed is practically 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.630
 immediate 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.660
 well, you've seen it 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.740
 well, this in terms of performance 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:10.169
 of the two very equal opening 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.440
 web pages maybe it's something faster 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:15.539
 in nexus videos on youtube the g2 equal 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.169
 in equalized applications the we books 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:21.210
 have been chosen then the link has been 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:23.610
 faster in the vector and finally the 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.650
 reptile of the truth that that matched 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.680
 so nothing you see we say the 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:30.330
 two perfectly and the truth that I 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.270
 personally in the note the difference 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:36.690
 between 4.4 point 2 and 4 points 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.729
 points 2 in g2 I do not know possibly if 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.470
 has noticed difference when opening 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:42.810
 the camera but that opens up more 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:45.840
 fast but a little more understanding 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:48.180
 it's still as good and as you see 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.139
 the two very closely matched are not six 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.139
 our individuals
