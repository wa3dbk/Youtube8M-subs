going<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.310> be<00:02:45.430> mid-back<00:02:46.090> isolation<00:02:46.780> hole<00:02:46.989> what

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
going to be mid-back isolation hole what

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.960 
going to be mid-back isolation hole what
we're<00:02:48.040> gonna<00:02:48.130> do<00:02:48.280> is<00:02:48.340> we're<00:02:48.489> gonna<00:02:50.760> it's<00:02:51.760> new

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
called anyway you can grab the handles

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.089 
called anyway you can grab the handles
as<00:03:03.700> well<00:03:03.810> but<00:03:04.810> Tommy<00:03:05.080> you<00:03:05.410> know<00:03:05.440> for<00:03:05.739> me<00:03:05.830> I<00:03:06.040> just

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
more of a neutral grip whereas grabbing

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.199 
more of a neutral grip whereas grabbing
the<00:03:14.650> handle<00:03:14.980> is<00:03:15.130> more<00:03:15.310> of<00:03:15.370> a<00:03:15.459> traditional<00:03:15.700> grip

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
the handle is more of a traditional grip

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.089 
the handle is more of a traditional grip
overhand<00:03:16.660> grip<00:03:16.750> so<00:03:17.650> we're<00:03:17.739> gonna<00:03:17.829> see<00:03:17.950> this

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
overhand grip so we're gonna see this

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.430 
overhand grip so we're gonna see this
forget<00:03:18.340> it<00:03:18.430> between<00:03:18.610> eight<00:03:18.910> and<00:03:18.940> fifteen<00:03:19.440> for

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
forget it between eight and fifteen for

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.580 
forget it between eight and fifteen for
total<00:03:20.860> sets<00:03:21.209> so<00:03:22.209> again<00:03:22.450> you<00:03:22.540> can<00:03:22.660> do<00:03:22.750> including

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
super set it's a high volume and if you

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.880 
super set it's a high volume and if you
don't<00:03:28.840> like<00:03:28.959> volume<00:03:29.260> you're<00:03:29.380> watching<00:03:29.680> wrong

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
don't like volume you're watching wrong

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.670 
don't like volume you're watching wrong
goddamn<00:03:30.220> channel<00:03:31.290> yes<00:03:32.290> sir

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680

so then you're gonna come in here watch
this<00:03:35.530> movement<00:03:35.889> he's<00:03:36.069> gonna<00:03:36.190> get<00:03:36.310> in<00:03:36.400> a

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
this movement he's gonna get in a

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:37.620 
this movement he's gonna get in a

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
movement it's almost like a pullover but

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.270 
movement it's almost like a pullover but
you<00:03:46.660> have<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:46.959> you<00:03:47.410> know<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.650> obvious<00:03:47.829> help

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
you have the you know the obvious help

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.390 
you have the you know the obvious help
of<00:03:48.459> gravity<00:03:49.000> at<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.900> top<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.620> contraction<00:03:51.340> at

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
of gravity at the top the contraction at

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.160 
of gravity at the top the contraction at
the<00:03:51.489> top<00:03:51.700> which<00:03:52.359> is<00:03:52.480> what<00:03:52.600> I<00:03:52.630> found<00:03:52.870> I<00:03:53.019> can

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
the top which is what I found I can

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:00.070 
the top which is what I found I can
never<00:03:53.350> get<00:03:53.620> on<00:03:54.069> a<00:03:54.400> pool<00:03:55.290> as<00:03:56.290> well<00:03:56.470> as<00:03:56.590> I<00:03:56.650> like<00:03:56.829> to

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.120 

so<00:04:01.080> there<00:04:01.260> you<00:04:01.290> go<00:04:01.380> we're<00:04:01.620> gonna<00:04:01.680> do<00:04:01.800> about<00:04:01.920> 80

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
so there you go we're gonna do about 80

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.220 
so there you go we're gonna do about 80
