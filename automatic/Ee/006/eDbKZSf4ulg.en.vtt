separate places that you can go inside

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.550 
separate places that you can go inside
of<00:02:29.370> cuz<00:02:30.030> in<00:02:30.180> my<00:02:30.330> characters<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.050> can<00:02:31.170> see<00:02:31.380> my

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
legs are sorted together and that's why

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.720 
legs are sorted together and that's why
I<00:02:33.150> look<00:02:33.360> like<00:02:33.570> a<00:02:33.800> like<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:34.830> creamsicle<00:02:35.370> some

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730

might say but um yeah I wanted to

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.620 
might say but um yeah I wanted to
separate<00:02:38.610> his<00:02:38.760> leg<00:02:38.910> so<00:02:39.060> that's<00:02:39.240> why<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.420> looks

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
separate his leg so that's why it looks

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.250 
separate his leg so that's why it looks
