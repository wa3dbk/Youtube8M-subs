one<00:00:04.940> of<00:00:05.060> the<00:00:05.150> concepts<00:00:05.720> that<00:00:06.020> I'm<00:00:06.230> very

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:06.470 
one of the concepts that I'm very

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.010 
one of the concepts that I'm very
interested<00:00:06.800> to<00:00:07.160> explore<00:00:07.370> is<00:00:07.970> how<00:00:08.480> I<00:00:08.510> can<00:00:08.690> take

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:09.020 
interested to explore is how I can take

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.590 
interested to explore is how I can take
my<00:00:09.200> experience<00:00:09.770> as<00:00:09.950> a<00:00:10.010> drumset<00:00:10.550> player<00:00:10.880> to<00:00:11.570> a

beautiful<00:00:14.299> instruments<00:00:14.870> you've<00:00:15.080> seen<00:00:15.320> me

play the djembe drum in combination with
the<00:00:18.170> Cajon<00:00:18.560> and<00:00:18.800> foot<00:00:19.100> patterns<00:00:19.520> and<00:00:19.730> cymbals

the Cajon and foot patterns and cymbals

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.230 
the Cajon and foot patterns and cymbals
I'm<00:00:20.449> going<00:00:21.410> to<00:00:21.529> build<00:00:21.740> on<00:00:21.949> that<00:00:21.980> now<00:00:22.400> by<00:00:22.880> adding

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
I'm going to build on that now by adding

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.849 
I'm going to build on that now by adding
a<00:00:23.330> beautiful<00:00:23.720> drum<00:00:23.960> by<00:00:24.140> my<00:00:24.349> friends<00:00:24.740> at

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
a beautiful drum by my friends at

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.310 
a beautiful drum by my friends at
Cooperman<00:00:25.359> this<00:00:26.359> is<00:00:26.539> called<00:00:26.750> the<00:00:26.839> slap<00:00:27.080> back

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
Cooperman this is called the slap back

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.099 
Cooperman this is called the slap back
99<00:00:27.830> as<00:00:28.310> you<00:00:28.640> can<00:00:28.759> see<00:00:28.970> it's<00:00:29.269> a<00:00:29.359> frame<00:00:29.570> drum<00:00:29.900> that

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
99 as you can see it's a frame drum that

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:36.930 
99 as you can see it's a frame drum that
I<00:00:30.169> play<00:00:30.470> with<00:00:30.890> my<00:00:30.949> finger<00:00:31.550> snap<00:00:31.820> techniques

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.369 

what's<00:00:37.940> very<00:00:38.210> interesting<00:00:38.510> about<00:00:39.050> this

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
what's very interesting about this

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.319 
what's very interesting about this
though<00:00:39.620> is<00:00:39.649> that<00:00:40.039> there<00:00:40.219> are<00:00:40.399> small<00:00:40.820> metal

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
though is that there are small metal

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.160 
though is that there are small metal
beads<00:00:41.629> underneath<00:00:42.530> that<00:00:43.600> behind<00:00:44.600> there<00:00:44.840> is<00:00:44.870> a

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
beads underneath that behind there is a

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.330 
beads underneath that behind there is a
mesh<00:00:45.500> head<00:00:45.739> as<00:00:45.920> well

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
mesh head as well

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.689 
mesh head as well
so<00:00:46.730> when<00:00:46.879> I<00:00:46.910> strike<00:00:47.300> the<00:00:47.329> drum<00:00:48.280> it<00:00:49.280> excites

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
so when I strike the drum it excites

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.869 
so when I strike the drum it excites
these<00:00:49.910> beads<00:00:50.289> and<00:00:51.289> if<00:00:51.440> I<00:00:51.590> move<00:00:51.829> my<00:00:51.859> left<00:00:52.370> leg<00:00:52.850> I

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
these beads and if I move my left leg I

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.450 
these beads and if I move my left leg I
get<00:00:55.879> even<00:00:56.210> a<00:00:56.300> bigger<00:00:56.510> sound<00:00:57.070> so<00:00:58.070> I'm<00:00:58.190> going<00:00:58.370> to

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
get even a bigger sound so I'm going to

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.580 
get even a bigger sound so I'm going to
play<00:00:58.640> a<00:00:58.670> solo<00:00:58.940> now<00:00:59.329> that<00:00:59.600> incorporates<00:01:00.350> the

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
play a solo now that incorporates the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.880 
play a solo now that incorporates the
Cooperman<00:01:01.010> slapback<00:01:01.460> 99<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:02.660> djembe<00:01:03.199> and<00:01:03.469> the

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
Cooperman slapback 99 the djembe and the

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.040 
Cooperman slapback 99 the djembe and the
Cajon<00:01:04.280> I'm<00:01:04.790> going<00:01:05.030> to<00:01:05.120> be<00:01:05.210> using<00:01:05.510> a<00:01:05.570> variety<00:01:05.720> of

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
Cajon I'm going to be using a variety of

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.020 
Cajon I'm going to be using a variety of
foot<00:01:06.350> patterns<00:01:06.770> including<00:01:07.490> a<00:01:07.610> heartbeat

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
foot patterns including a heartbeat

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:15.410 
foot patterns including a heartbeat
pattern

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:25.770 

I'll<00:01:16.420> use<00:01:16.660> the<00:01:16.840> claw<00:01:17.050> Bay<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:24.300> I'll<00:01:25.300> even<00:01:25.480> use

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
I'll use the claw Bay and I'll even use

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.720 
I'll use the claw Bay and I'll even use
a<00:01:26.050> middle-eastern<00:01:26.800> foot<00:01:27.100> pattern<00:01:27.460> called

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
a middle-eastern foot pattern called

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:37.590 
a middle-eastern foot pattern called
Mach<00:01:27.940> zoom<00:01:34.830> as<00:01:35.830> well<00:01:36.520> as<00:01:36.820> other<00:01:37.060> improvised

Mach zoom as well as other improvised

00:01:37.600 --> 00:03:36.070 
Mach zoom as well as other improvised
foot<00:01:37.900> patterns<00:01:38.320> let's<00:01:38.650> see<00:01:38.800> what<00:01:38.950> we<00:01:39.040> get

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080
