00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
which IP is which we're going to look to

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.260 
which IP is which we're going to look to
the<00:01:11.729> right<00:01:11.820> side<00:01:12.180> right<00:01:12.210> here<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.580> our<00:01:14.580> router

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
the right side right here and our router

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.450 
the right side right here and our router
should<00:01:15.650> say<00:01:16.650> our<00:01:16.740> router<00:01:16.950> type<00:01:17.250> right<00:01:17.430> here

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
should say our router type right here

mine is a d-link

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.380 
mine is a d-link

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
of packets right here will stop moving

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.490 
of packets right here will stop moving
now<00:04:47.160> people<00:04:47.820> are<00:04:47.910> still<00:04:48.120> in<00:04:48.210> my<00:04:48.300> party<00:04:48.690> so<00:04:49.260> the

now people are still in my party so the

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.560 
now people are still in my party so the

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
packets haven't stopped going up and

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.740 
packets haven't stopped going up and
down<00:04:52.280> so<00:04:53.280> once<00:04:53.820> they<00:04:54.000> leave<00:04:54.210> your<00:04:54.360> party

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
you'll notice the packet flow will stop

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.190 
you'll notice the packet flow will stop
completely<00:04:57.690> and<00:04:58.430> that<00:04:59.430> is<00:04:59.610> how<00:04:59.820> you<00:05:00.300> determine

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
completely and that is how you determine

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.010 
completely and that is how you determine
that<00:05:01.560> that<00:05:01.830> is<00:05:01.979> that<00:05:02.130> person's<00:05:02.550> IP<00:05:02.940> address<00:05:04.250> so

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
that that is that person's IP address so

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.890 
that that is that person's IP address so
this<00:05:07.020> one<00:05:07.260> eight<00:05:07.380> four<00:05:08.360> let's<00:05:09.360> just<00:05:09.510> say<00:05:09.690> that

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
this one eight four let's just say that

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.040 
this one eight four let's just say that
that's<00:05:09.990> player<00:05:10.440> number<00:05:10.770> one<00:05:11.040> in<00:05:11.310> our<00:05:11.460> party

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.810 
that's player number one in our party
player<00:05:13.050> number<00:05:13.380> one<00:05:13.410> leaves<00:05:14.130> the<00:05:14.280> party<00:05:14.639> and

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
player number one leaves the party and

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.300 
player number one leaves the party and
this<00:05:15.540> packet<00:05:15.990> flow<00:05:16.200> right<00:05:16.410> here<00:05:16.680> stops

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
this packet flow right here stops

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.450 
this packet flow right here stops
completely<00:05:18.979> player<00:05:19.979> number<00:05:20.250> two<00:05:20.460> who<00:05:21.150> is<00:05:21.180> 64

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
completely player number two who is 64

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.980 
completely player number two who is 64

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
is still in the party so this packet

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.740 
is still in the party so this packet
flow<00:05:25.169> keeps<00:05:25.410> going<00:05:25.910> as<00:05:26.910> you<00:05:27.060> can<00:05:27.180> see<00:05:27.360> right

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
flow keeps going as you can see right

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.969 
flow keeps going as you can see right
here<00:05:28.370> so<00:05:29.510> player<00:05:30.510> number<00:05:30.840> one<00:05:30.870> has<00:05:31.620> left<00:05:31.860> the

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:35.090 
here so player number one has left the
party<00:05:32.310> and<00:05:32.490> is<00:05:33.300> packed<00:05:33.479> flow<00:05:33.750> stopped<00:05:34.080> so<00:05:34.680> we

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
party and is packed flow stopped so we

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.590 
party and is packed flow stopped so we
know<00:05:35.280> that<00:05:35.310> one<00:05:35.910> eight<00:05:36.030> four<00:05:36.330> is<00:05:37.020> player<00:05:37.320> 1<00:05:38.600> so

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
an easier way to determine this would be

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.040 
an easier way to determine this would be
to<00:06:03.479> take<00:06:03.510> a<00:06:03.750> screenshot<00:06:04.229> of<00:06:05.570> the<00:06:06.570> people<00:06:06.900> of
