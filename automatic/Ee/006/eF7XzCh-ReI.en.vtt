EP<00:00:21.900> we<00:00:22.050> were<00:00:22.170> kind<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.470> experimenting<00:00:23.100> with<00:00:23.220> a

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
EP we were kind of experimenting with a

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.279 
EP we were kind of experimenting with a
whole<00:00:23.430> bunch<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.699> different<00:00:23.820> styles<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.539> think

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
whole bunch of different styles I think

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.359 
whole bunch of different styles I think
we<00:00:25.350> really<00:00:25.560> discovered<00:00:25.830> what<00:00:26.099> urban

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
we really discovered what urban

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.609 
we really discovered what urban
disturbance<00:00:26.849> as<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.090> as<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.810> whole<00:00:28.080> wanted<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.439> do

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
disturbance as a as a whole wanted to do

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.099 
disturbance as a as a whole wanted to do
so<00:00:29.099> we<00:00:29.250> did<00:00:29.429> never<00:00:30.240> done<00:00:30.390> no<00:00:30.480> flame<00:00:30.720> which<00:00:30.900> was

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
so we did never done no flame which was

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.260 
so we did never done no flame which was
a<00:00:31.679> commercial<00:00:32.130> move<00:00:32.460> we<00:00:32.640> did<00:00:32.820> hit<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.149> run

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
a commercial move we did hit and run

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.850 
a commercial move we did hit and run
which<00:00:33.420> was<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.600> more<00:00:33.989> underground<00:00:34.230> move<00:00:34.530> we<00:00:34.680> did

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
which was a more underground move we did

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.350 
which was a more underground move we did
some<00:00:35.280> weird<00:00:35.370> stuff<00:00:35.640> with<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.850> by<00:00:36.000> four<00:00:36.210> modes

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
some weird stuff with a by four modes

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.540 
some weird stuff with a by four modes
with<00:00:36.480> instrumental<00:00:37.170> we<00:00:37.260> did<00:00:37.410> some<00:00:38.190> interlude

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
with instrumental we did some interlude

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.610 
with instrumental we did some interlude
so<00:00:39.120> we<00:00:39.300> had<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.450> whole<00:00:39.629> bunch<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.960> diverse<00:00:40.410> stuff

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
so we had a whole bunch of diverse stuff

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.069 
so we had a whole bunch of diverse stuff
on<00:00:40.739> an<00:00:40.829> EP<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:42.180> just<00:00:42.360> helped<00:00:42.540> us<00:00:42.600> find<00:00:42.870> a

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
on an EP and it just helped us find a

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.170 
on an EP and it just helped us find a
direction<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:44.010> think<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.280> 37<00:00:44.910> degrees

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
direction and I think that 37 degrees

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.360 
direction and I think that 37 degrees
latitude<00:00:45.620> really<00:00:46.620> represents<00:00:47.219> their

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
latitude really represents their

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:59.220 
latitude really represents their
direction

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.500 

Robert<00:01:00.160> Jana<00:01:00.370> was<00:01:00.579> a<00:01:00.640> real<00:01:00.879> collective<00:01:01.329> thing

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
Robert Jana was a real collective thing

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.819 
Robert Jana was a real collective thing
as<00:01:01.600> far<00:01:01.750> as<00:01:01.780> me<00:01:01.960> and<00:01:01.989> Ali<00:01:02.170> went<00:01:02.440> we<00:01:02.530> spend<00:01:02.769> the

as far as me and Ali went we spend the

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.679 
as far as me and Ali went we spend the
afternoon<00:01:03.190> we<00:01:03.280> made<00:01:03.519> their<00:01:03.730> beat<00:01:04.000> we<00:01:04.509> went

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689

session always made in the process as

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.320 
session always made in the process as
possible<00:01:10.780> because<00:01:11.110> it<00:01:11.350> was<00:01:11.470> a<00:01:11.500> real<00:01:11.890> I<00:01:12.330> think

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
possible because it was a real I think

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.100 
possible because it was a real I think

took my words for them it was a

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.200 
took my words for them it was a
marijuana<00:01:30.130> song<00:01:30.490> because<00:01:30.759> that's<00:01:31.000> how<00:01:31.149> we

really restricted by the 4/4 beat the

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.029 
really restricted by the 4/4 beat the
whole<00:01:47.140> way<00:01:47.229> through<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.470> album<00:01:47.740> and<00:01:47.890> Ollie

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
whole way through the album and Ollie

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:49.949 
whole way through the album and Ollie
had<00:01:48.250> expressed<00:01:48.700> his<00:01:48.880> disinterest<00:01:49.390> and<00:01:49.509> having

had expressed his disinterest and having
an<00:01:50.020> album<00:01:50.259> completely<00:01:50.679> made<00:01:50.830> up<00:01:50.950> at<00:01:51.069> that<00:01:51.190> time

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
an album completely made up at that time

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.180 
an album completely made up at that time
to<00:01:51.490> be<00:01:51.610> so<00:01:52.179> I<00:01:52.209> thought<00:01:52.450> well<00:01:52.630> it<00:01:53.200> may<00:01:53.440> be<00:01:53.470> what's

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
to be so I thought well it may be what's

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.680 
to be so I thought well it may be what's
stopping<00:01:54.490> me<00:01:54.520> from<00:01:54.610> chucking<00:01:55.270> it<00:01:55.330> into<00:01:55.479> three

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
stopping me from chucking it into three

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.630 
stopping me from chucking it into three
five<00:01:55.899> four<00:01:56.259> three<00:01:56.289> three<00:01:56.860> five<00:01:57.009> beat<00:01:57.399> you<00:01:57.549> know

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
five four three three five beat you know

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.370 
five four three three five beat you know
just<00:01:57.819> just<00:01:58.030> not<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.720> whole<00:01:58.810> songs<00:01:59.080> that<00:01:59.289> would

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
just just not the whole songs that would

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.529 
just just not the whole songs that would
just<00:01:59.500> get<00:01:59.619> too<00:01:59.770> much<00:01:59.950> but<00:02:00.940> just<00:02:00.970> in<00:02:01.179> the<00:02:01.240> chorus

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
just get too much but just in the chorus

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.959 
just get too much but just in the chorus
and<00:02:01.720> and<00:02:02.440> it<00:02:02.799> worked<00:02:02.950> with<00:02:03.250> with<00:02:03.579> the<00:02:03.670> organ

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969

like<00:02:54.600> the<00:03:13.459> custom-made<00:03:14.459> thoughts<00:03:14.760> when<00:03:15.209> I

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
like the custom-made thoughts when I

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.460 
like the custom-made thoughts when I
made<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.569> there<00:03:15.630> was<00:03:15.750> one<00:03:15.870> of<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:15.989> last<00:03:16.110> beats

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470

made it there was one of the last beats
I<00:03:16.620> made<00:03:16.830> I<00:03:17.100> made<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.580> into<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:18.180> album<00:03:18.450> process

and<00:03:19.310> so<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.550> think<00:03:20.730> it's<00:03:20.819> definitely<00:03:20.940> different

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
and so I think it's definitely different

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.940 
and so I think it's definitely different
feel<00:03:21.690> as<00:03:21.870> far<00:03:22.049> as<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.260> music<00:03:22.350> goes<00:03:22.560> it's<00:03:22.799> way

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950
