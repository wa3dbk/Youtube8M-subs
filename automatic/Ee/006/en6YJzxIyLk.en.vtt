part the video card itself so first off
this<00:02:11.620> thing<00:02:11.769> and<00:02:12.130> it's<00:02:12.400> fairly<00:02:12.610> heavy<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.180> the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
this thing and it's fairly heavy the the

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.449 
this thing and it's fairly heavy the the
liquid<00:02:13.720> cooling<00:02:13.989> block<00:02:14.140> is<00:02:14.319> a<00:02:14.459> substantially

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
liquid cooling block is a substantially

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.610 
liquid cooling block is a substantially
large<00:02:15.670> chunk<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.180> metal<00:02:16.360> but<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.470> nice<00:02:17.590> thing

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
large chunk of metal but the nice thing

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.020 
large chunk of metal but the nice thing
is<00:02:17.830> even<00:02:18.250> though<00:02:18.280> it's<00:02:18.459> still<00:02:18.610> heavy<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:18.910> can

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
is even though it's still heavy you can

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.880 
is even though it's still heavy you can
see<00:02:19.180> it's<00:02:19.299> really<00:02:19.390> slim<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.140> kind<00:02:20.530> of<00:02:20.590> sexy

one<00:02:36.849> of<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.000> things<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:37.209> really<00:02:37.239> like<00:02:37.540> that

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
one of the things I really like that

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.050 
one of the things I really like that
EVGA<00:02:38.230> does<00:02:38.440> is<00:02:38.620> they<00:02:38.709> put<00:02:38.890> these<00:02:39.040> nice<00:02:39.370> metal

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
EVGA does is they put these nice metal

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.699 
EVGA does is they put these nice metal
backings<00:02:40.420> on<00:02:40.569> here<00:02:40.810> not<00:02:41.290> only<00:02:41.410> does<00:02:41.530> it<00:02:41.590> give

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
backings on here not only does it give

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.800 
backings on here not only does it give
it<00:02:41.829> a<00:02:41.920> clean<00:02:42.130> look<00:02:42.400> but<00:02:42.640> it<00:02:42.730> also<00:02:42.849> strengthens

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
it a clean look but it also strengthens

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.350 
it a clean look but it also strengthens

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
the durability on the card a little bit

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.819 
the durability on the card a little bit
in<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.630> back<00:02:46.780> now<00:02:47.079> one<00:02:47.290> of<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:47.440> best<00:02:47.620> things

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
in the back now one of the best things

in the back now one of the best things
about<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.130> 590<00:02:48.640> is<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.850> fact<00:02:49.030> that<00:02:49.120> you<00:02:49.239> can

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
about the 590 is the fact that you can

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:50.940 
about the 590 is the fact that you can
do<00:02:49.450> 3d<00:02:49.750> vision<00:02:49.900> surround<00:02:50.290> off<00:02:50.410> a<00:02:50.440> one<00:02:50.680> card

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
do 3d vision surround off a one card

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.559 
do 3d vision surround off a one card
this<00:02:51.489> is<00:02:51.609> the<00:02:51.700> first<00:02:51.910> product<00:02:52.180> that<00:02:52.329> we<00:02:52.480> have

this is the first product that we have

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.900 
this is the first product that we have
offered<00:02:52.780> that<00:02:53.079> does<00:02:53.290> this<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.340> get<00:02:54.459> every

offered that does this so you get every
GeForce<00:02:55.390> feature<00:02:55.690> packed<00:02:56.230> into<00:02:56.470> one<00:02:56.590> card

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
GeForce feature packed into one card

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.520 
GeForce feature packed into one card
it's<00:02:57.730> pretty<00:02:58.030> amazing<00:02:58.180> we've<00:02:59.019> also<00:02:59.170> got<00:02:59.500> a

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
it's pretty amazing we've also got a

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.860 
it's pretty amazing we've also got a
mini<00:03:00.250> display<00:03:00.579> port<00:03:00.609> connector<00:03:01.480> right<00:03:01.690> there

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
mini display port connector right there

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.300 
mini display port connector right there
so<00:03:02.079> you<00:03:02.139> can<00:03:02.290> hook<00:03:02.380> up<00:03:02.530> multiple<00:03:02.889> screens<00:03:03.160> with

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
so you can hook up multiple screens with

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.210 
so you can hook up multiple screens with
that<00:03:03.519> and<00:03:03.790> then<00:03:04.269> our<00:03:04.540> sli<00:03:05.230> connector<00:03:05.680> here<00:03:05.950> for

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
that and then our sli connector here for

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.030 
that and then our sli connector here for
quad<00:03:06.609> sli<00:03:06.819> so<00:03:07.780> this<00:03:08.260> is<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.500> liquid<00:03:08.680> cooled

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
quad sli so this is the liquid cooled

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.559 
quad sli so this is the liquid cooled
version<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:09.579> in<00:03:09.700> case<00:03:09.850> you<00:03:10.000> were<00:03:10.030> curious<00:03:10.299> to

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
version and in case you were curious to

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:11.970 
version and in case you were curious to
see<00:03:10.750> what<00:03:11.170> it<00:03:11.260> looks<00:03:11.380> like<00:03:11.500> compared<00:03:11.829> to<00:03:11.920> the

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
see what it looks like compared to the

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.650 
see what it looks like compared to the
air<00:03:12.100> cooled<00:03:12.370> version<00:03:12.700> I've<00:03:13.090> got<00:03:13.150> one<00:03:13.510> of<00:03:13.600> those

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
air cooled version I've got one of those

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.509 
air cooled version I've got one of those
right<00:03:13.930> here<00:03:14.200> so<00:03:14.769> the<00:03:14.889> first<00:03:15.069> thing<00:03:15.130> you'll<00:03:15.400> see

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
right here so the first thing you'll see

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.220 
right here so the first thing you'll see
is<00:03:15.549> obviously<00:03:16.000> this<00:03:16.450> is<00:03:16.630> a<00:03:16.660> liquid<00:03:16.900> cooling

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
is obviously this is a liquid cooling

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.990 
is obviously this is a liquid cooling
block<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:17.590> then<00:03:17.650> this<00:03:17.799> has<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.190> shroud<00:03:18.760> with

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
block and then this has the shroud with

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.340 
block and then this has the shroud with
the<00:03:19.090> vapor<00:03:19.269> chambers<00:03:19.690> underneath<00:03:19.959> it<00:03:20.200> and

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
the vapor chambers underneath it and

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.620 
the vapor chambers underneath it and
also<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.680> fan<00:03:20.859> in<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.040> middle<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:22.209> then<00:03:22.389> they

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
also the fan in the middle and then they

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.660 
also the fan in the middle and then they
both<00:03:22.840> do<00:03:23.049> have<00:03:23.230> some<00:03:23.560> type<00:03:23.739> of<00:03:23.769> LED<00:03:24.250> light<00:03:24.519> up

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
both do have some type of LED light up

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.270 
both do have some type of LED light up
on<00:03:24.850> an<00:03:25.359> air-cooled<00:03:25.720> card<00:03:26.049> the<00:03:26.440> g-force<00:03:27.010> lights

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
on an air-cooled card the g-force lights

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.240 
on an air-cooled card the g-force lights
up<00:03:27.519> on<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.900> liquid<00:03:28.900> cooled<00:03:29.109> version<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.859> EVGA

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
up on the liquid cooled version the EVGA

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.759 
up on the liquid cooled version the EVGA
lights<00:03:30.850> up<00:03:31.060> here<00:03:31.299> so<00:03:31.900> you<00:03:31.959> can<00:03:32.290> also<00:03:32.410> see<00:03:32.680> the

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
lights up here so you can also see the

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.440 
lights up here so you can also see the
profiles<00:03:33.190> here<00:03:33.400> that<00:03:33.639> the<00:03:34.000> liquid<00:03:34.180> cooled

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
profiles here that the liquid cooled

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.640 
profiles here that the liquid cooled
card<00:03:34.690> is<00:03:34.780> quite<00:03:34.959> a<00:03:34.989> bit<00:03:35.139> thinner<00:03:35.319> than<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.530> air

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
card is quite a bit thinner than the air
