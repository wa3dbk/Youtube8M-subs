so<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.040> weapons<00:00:14.280> I<00:00:14.400> recommend<00:00:14.790> using<00:00:14.940> are

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
so the weapons I recommend using are

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.820 
so the weapons I recommend using are
going<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.480> be<00:00:15.540> machine<00:00:15.900> gun<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.260> volley<00:00:16.619> gun

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.040 
take out the Patriot that is closest to
you<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:21.029> reason<00:00:21.300> for<00:00:21.449> that<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.600> if<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.020> have

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
you the reason for that is if you have

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.990 
you the reason for that is if you have
both<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.439> them<00:00:22.650> out<00:00:22.830> at<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.220> same<00:00:23.400> time<00:00:23.640> it's

pretty hard one especially for a wave
one<00:02:20.280> but<00:02:20.850> because<00:02:21.150> it's<00:02:21.330> wave<00:02:21.510> one<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:22.170> don't

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
one but because it's wave one you don't

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.720 
one but because it's wave one you don't
have<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.530> go<00:02:22.650> back<00:02:22.830> far<00:02:23.130> in<00:02:23.250> case<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.520> mess<00:02:23.700> up
