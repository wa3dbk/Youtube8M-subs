in<00:04:50.320> FIFA<00:04:50.620> man<00:04:50.800> they'll<00:04:51.010> probably<00:04:51.280> remove<00:04:51.790> them

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
in FIFA man they'll probably remove them

in FIFA man they'll probably remove them
for<00:04:52.150> some<00:04:52.330> reason<00:04:52.360> they<00:04:52.870> won't<00:04:53.110> be<00:04:53.260> in<00:04:53.380> the
