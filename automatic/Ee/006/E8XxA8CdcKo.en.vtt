 purely 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.899
 he made the rainbow then he flies 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.180

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.239
 heartily team bloody and come now 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.399
 we at your price we go now 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.920
 on your channel and want to try 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.710
 you a little bit known'll 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.170
 What strikes me immediately is tm bloody 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.190
 your channel design you have left here and 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.750
 on the right , the duo probably took a lot 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.689
 you like then you still have yours 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.220
 beautiful lettering here in the store exactly 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.689
 with a nice effect i believe 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.220
 somehow so cluster effects as so 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.890
 one calls it does not matter 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.420
 the channel hastet the design you have indeed 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.020
 not created yourself that you can see here 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.549
 above at royal blue hd but also me 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.869
 I do not have my own channel design 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.500
 that we do not create at all 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.140
 problem 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.880
 then look here is he calls himself 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.170
 I can do that a lot for newcomers , for example 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.710
 cool he is modest 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.890
 he does not come or you do not come up 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.360
 youtube with the title yes best 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.350
 player in fifa but you are 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.270
 modest and say you are one 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.490
 newcomer there is just starting 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.189
 and you say it with you 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.049
 Skills your videos and turns them off 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.490
 Germany is very beautiful you are 15 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.070
 he is 15 years old 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.710
 he used before he had two and sony 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.840
 vegas 11 and he's gambling on the ps3 and 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.710
 I also assume that you are everywhere 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.119
 your gameplay is getting good 166 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.200
 Maybe I had subscribers 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.880
 already said no idea 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.960
 Now let's go to upload state then 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.369
 namely seven videos online 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.340
 I am also immediately at the velvet mails 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.180
 that he has a lot to do with it 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.230
 Color correction works 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.540
 although I have not even watched a video 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.439
 have for example been times when I have a 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.019
 good sign 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:20.459
 then there was a skill squad squad here 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:24.829
 building I suppose or he shows 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:28.590
 just let me just click on it 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:31.340
 we do again silently, I find 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.750
 also very nice that he though 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.870
 reasonably small so that's supposed to 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.310
 Do not pull it down or anything but you 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.719
 you have it in the beginning and you still have 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.730
 not so many subscribers but still 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:45.079
 you give yourself a lot of trouble his 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.290
 subscribers, so to speak, through specials too 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.859
 to chat 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.849
 Now I want to look at a team 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.409
 Oh no, you can do it yourself then 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.519
 look at 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:55.310
 In any case, you realize that you 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.269
 go ahead and look hard 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.209
 otherwise I can not do anything here now 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:04.489
 see more or say i click to 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:07.829
 just look at this compilation here 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.560
 15 60 dislike is definitely one 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.700
 very good quote 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.959
 that means also for you out there 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.419
 who do not know yet 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.159
 if he is already 15 spawning time and 0 dislike 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:17.819
 then it is probably not a bad 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.889
 make videos 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.220
 he already has her effect on her 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:25.859
 with a slow-motion effect that is 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.599
 I'm very nice because that makes it right 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:32.609
 work there speak from experience that he 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.250
 very often against which effects insert there 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:37.109
 that requires a lot of tact 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.169
 was and a lot of time before all hire 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:42.180
 really cool with those with the 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:43.889
 slow motion effect just before the 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.379
 trick starts starts with is the ground 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:49.009
 very nicely done you can see that 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.209
 he is not an entry a mayfly 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:52.829
 but really hard work 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.349
 his videos and as I said I know 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.370
 how exhausting and how time consuming 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.009
 can be something like that 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.500
 and because you get my respect 

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:03.419
 plate continues to do so I call now 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.400
 Just bloody is better than animals 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:09.629
 bloody down to say yes and that was it 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.979
 then watch the rest of the videos 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.470
 I do not care about you now 

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:15.750
 Please, because he has it 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.389
 deserves to come in place 1 and 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.919
 Look at him in any case 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.630
 shows him that he can do something that he can 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.849
 which has it that he makes good videos 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.490
 by subscribing to him or his videos 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:26.560
 easy or 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.690
 It would certainly look at him 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.490
 I am sure that I am happy too 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.050
 then a slightly smaller youtuber 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.419
 helped me because I am actually 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.050
 set that smaller people 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.740
 wants to help 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:42.039
 but if you write me please my 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.569
 videos or or give me your opinion 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.360
 I can not do that anymore 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:48.190
 get too many questions about this topic 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:53.470
 I just do not do that anymore 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:56.199
 you have to do something to quasi me 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.789
 to watch their videos there 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:01.150
 will be coming soon sometime now 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:02.770
 even a little information is coming 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.509
 I have something else forum something 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.490
 to promote smaller youtubers 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:07.810
 but now only the one is here 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.710
 animals I think he has one 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.270
 very nice canal 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.479
 the design is of course a matter of taste 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.919
 I think it's ok but the design is not 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.960
 the most important thing about a youtube channel 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.789
 his videos are the most important and there 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.800
 he definitely has a lot 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.870
 effort and I think he is 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.250
 has earned many more subscribers and 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.020
 much more attention in front of everyone 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.630
 I know how hard it is 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.349
 if you start something new at all 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.990
 to reach 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:34.300
 it would not work for me either 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.469
 but luckily it has it 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.849
 could have done differently and 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:38.710
 That's why I'm actually so 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:40.719
 the slightly smaller youtube 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.000
 just want to help and you watch 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:45.250
 please look please tell me please write 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.630
 me please in the comments purely as you 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.030
 the idea is that in the future 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.550
 slightly smaller youtuber a bit 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.870
 Promoters do not often want to do so 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.539
 Do not worry now about advertising 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.599
 but completely blocked via other channels 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.409
 for example now top five days of 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:02.380
 week winner 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:04.479
 only the winner gets promotion and 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.090
 then there will be such a possible 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:08.560
 such a smaller series come out so what 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.319
 as abonnent of the month because it may 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.479
 then my subscribers with one 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:14.650
 Application video from a one minute 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:17.680
 to one and a half minutes with me 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.090
 introduce and advertise and then would 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.699
 i may stop once a month or 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.630
 such a video about a subscriber of 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:25.419
 make me 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.800
 which is a bit smaller than I write 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:28.449
 that would be that would be me real 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.280
 I personally find that interesting 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:32.289
 idea class in the last live stream 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.560
 almost all spectators found this idea 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:37.400
 also awesome and I 'm happy if I am 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.650
 then someone could help 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.940
 I wish you all the best animals bloody 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.070
 Of course we will continue to send yours 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.300
 clear 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.979
 but you should sit down again 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.509
 Of course there is no one coming 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:50.090
 video more that I have forgotten 

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:53.360
 but to say last top 5 gates video 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:55.070
