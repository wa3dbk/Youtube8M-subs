00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:05.180 
at Arctic Cat there's a formula we use

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.410 
at Arctic Cat there's a formula we use
to<00:00:05.390> create<00:00:05.569> the<00:00:05.899> ultimate<00:00:06.500> off-road<00:00:06.939> ATV<00:00:07.939> we

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:08.420 
to create the ultimate off-road ATV we

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.900 
to create the ultimate off-road ATV we
start<00:00:08.780> by<00:00:09.050> designing<00:00:09.230> our<00:00:09.620> ATV<00:00:10.190> systems<00:00:10.700> to

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.839 
start by designing our ATV systems to
work<00:00:10.940> together<00:00:11.299> on<00:00:11.719> all<00:00:12.080> types<00:00:12.469> of<00:00:12.620> terrain<00:00:12.849> we

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:16.700 
call this ride ability then because we

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.760 
call this ride ability then because we
know<00:00:16.880> you<00:00:16.940> don't<00:00:17.210> use<00:00:17.480> your<00:00:17.720> ATV<00:00:18.320> with<00:00:18.530> just
