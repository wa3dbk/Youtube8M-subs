00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
different than those in the sense that

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.270 
different than those in the sense that
it<00:00:42.880> actually<00:00:43.120> really<00:00:43.960> changes<00:00:44.500> how<00:00:44.680> some<00:00:45.250> of

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
it actually really changes how some of

the<00:00:45.370> characters<00:00:45.850> move<00:00:46.180> in<00:00:46.510> general<00:00:47.140> like

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
the characters move in general like

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.740 
the characters move in general like
there<00:00:47.620> are<00:00:47.860> the<00:00:48.490> special<00:00:48.880> attacks<00:00:49.210> that<00:00:49.450> ken

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
different directions that's something

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.950 
different directions that's something
that<00:00:56.800> we<00:00:57.190> haven't<00:00:57.520> seen<00:00:57.610> with<00:00:58.450> at<00:00:58.570> least<00:00:58.720> these

across<00:01:03.130> the<00:01:03.520> entire<00:01:03.820> roster<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:05.290> is<00:01:05.500> a<00:01:05.530> sort

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
across the entire roster this is a sort

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.320 
across the entire roster this is a sort
of<00:01:05.920> thing<00:01:06.100> that<00:01:06.130> you<00:01:06.370> might<00:01:06.550> see<00:01:06.820> in<00:01:07.030> like<00:01:07.270> a

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
of thing that you might see in like a

of thing that you might see in like a
mod<00:01:07.720> or<00:01:07.990> a<00:01:08.020> hack<00:01:08.380> but<00:01:08.710> this<00:01:09.400> is<00:01:09.580> actually<00:01:10.060> an

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
mod or a hack but this is actually an

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.820 
mod or a hack but this is actually an
officially<00:01:10.750> released<00:01:11.050> version<00:01:11.470> of<00:01:11.560> it<00:01:11.710> now

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
officially released version of it now

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.320 
officially released version of it now
they<00:01:11.980> didn't<00:01:12.250> tune<00:01:12.430> it<00:01:12.580> in<00:01:12.670> a<00:01:12.790> sense<00:01:13.030> that<00:01:13.120> it

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
they didn't tune it in a sense that it

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.240 
they didn't tune it in a sense that it
is<00:01:13.480> going<00:01:13.690> to<00:01:13.960> be<00:01:14.080> a<00:01:14.110> balance<00:01:14.440> version<00:01:15.070> but

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
is going to be a balance version but

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.380 
is going to be a balance version but
they<00:01:15.430> really<00:01:15.580> just<00:01:15.850> want<00:01:16.030> to<00:01:16.120> put<00:01:16.270> it<00:01:16.330> out

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
they really just want to put it out

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.350 
they really just want to put it out
there<00:01:16.600> to<00:01:16.630> be<00:01:16.840> fun<00:01:17.700> however<00:01:18.700> that<00:01:18.940> leads<00:01:19.180> to

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
there to be fun however that leads to

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.000 
there to be fun however that leads to
the<00:01:19.480> speculation<00:01:20.140> that<00:01:20.350> why<00:01:20.680> would<00:01:20.740> they<00:01:20.950> do

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
the speculation that why would they do

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.590 
the speculation that why would they do
something<00:01:21.340> like<00:01:21.640> this<00:01:21.850> is<00:01:22.090> this<00:01:22.360> actually

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
something like this is this actually

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.050 
something like this is this actually
some<00:01:23.320> sort<00:01:23.350> of<00:01:23.650> testing<00:01:24.280> ground<00:01:24.520> to<00:01:24.610> see<00:01:24.850> what

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
some sort of testing ground to see what

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.210 
some sort of testing ground to see what
we<00:01:25.180> like<00:01:25.390> for<00:01:25.659> street<00:01:25.870> fighter<00:01:26.050> 5<00:01:26.380> and<00:01:26.710> that

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
we like for street fighter 5 and that

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.370 
we like for street fighter 5 and that
does<00:01:27.490> actually<00:01:27.730> make<00:01:28.030> sense<00:01:28.510> every<00:01:29.200> main

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
does actually make sense every main

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.200 
does actually make sense every main
entry<00:01:29.800> in<00:01:29.890> the<00:01:30.010> Street<00:01:30.220> Fighter<00:01:30.250> series<00:01:30.760> has

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
entry in the Street Fighter series has

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.880 
entry in the Street Fighter series has
been<00:01:31.510> drastically<00:01:31.870> different<00:01:32.530> from<00:01:32.560> the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
been drastically different from the

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.340 
been drastically different from the
other<00:01:33.010> one<00:01:33.220> on<00:01:33.460> it<00:01:34.060> carries<00:01:34.570> of<00:01:34.720> course<00:01:34.960> a<00:01:35.110> few

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
other one on it carries of course a few

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.040 
other one on it carries of course a few
basic<00:01:36.070> traits<00:01:36.670> but<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.390> systems<00:01:37.810> and<00:01:37.900> the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
basic traits but the systems and the

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.020 
basic traits but the systems and the
styles<00:01:38.500> are<00:01:38.680> very<00:01:39.280> different<00:01:39.580> from<00:01:39.820> one

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
styles are very different from one

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.210 
styles are very different from one
another<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.659> it<00:01:41.560> kind<00:01:41.800> of<00:01:41.860> leads<00:01:42.040> to<00:01:42.130> the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
another and it kind of leads to the

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.710 
another and it kind of leads to the
question<00:01:42.370> what<00:01:42.820> could<00:01:43.030> they<00:01:43.120> do<00:01:43.180> for<00:01:43.540> street

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
question what could they do for street

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.480 
question what could they do for street
fighter<00:01:43.870> 5<00:01:44.200> I<00:01:44.560> haven't<00:01:44.860> been<00:01:44.979> thinking<00:01:45.159> about

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
fighter 5 I haven't been thinking about

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.490 
fighter 5 I haven't been thinking about
it<00:01:45.729> so<00:01:45.909> much<00:01:45.970> as<00:01:46.330> a<00:01:46.390> lot<00:01:46.780> of<00:01:46.870> other<00:01:47.020> people<00:01:47.229> out

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
it so much as a lot of other people out

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.710 
it so much as a lot of other people out
what<00:01:48.280> there<00:01:48.490> seemed<00:01:48.729> to<00:01:48.820> be<00:01:48.880> going<00:01:49.150> for<00:01:49.510> though

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
what there seemed to be going for though

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.420 
what there seemed to be going for though
if<00:01:50.020> they<00:01:50.260> are<00:01:50.409> going<00:01:50.560> to<00:01:50.740> take<00:01:50.950> some<00:01:51.220> of<00:01:51.250> these

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
if they are going to take some of these

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.480 
if they are going to take some of these
new<00:01:51.700> ideas<00:01:52.260> into<00:01:53.260> account<00:01:53.650> and<00:01:53.890> see<00:01:54.130> what<00:01:54.310> the

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
new ideas into account and see what the

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.730 
new ideas into account and see what the
community<00:01:54.700> really<00:01:55.330> likes<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:55.930> takes<00:01:56.440> away

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
community really likes and takes away

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.190 
community really likes and takes away
from<00:01:56.799> Omega<00:01:57.430> mode<00:01:57.700> they<00:01:58.299> will<00:01:58.540> probably

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
from Omega mode they will probably

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.010 
from Omega mode they will probably
integrate<00:01:59.979> it<00:02:00.130> into<00:02:00.310> Street<00:02:01.210> Fighter<00:02:01.420> 5<00:02:01.720> and

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
integrate it into Street Fighter 5 and

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.680 
integrate it into Street Fighter 5 and
so<00:02:02.409> overall<00:02:02.950> I<00:02:03.159> have<00:02:03.490> to<00:02:03.729> anticipate<00:02:04.090> that<00:02:04.570> the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
so overall I have to anticipate that the

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.109 
so overall I have to anticipate that the
game<00:02:04.869> will<00:02:04.990> be<00:02:05.140> a<00:02:05.170> faster-paced<00:02:05.850> maybe<00:02:06.850> more

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
game will be a faster-paced maybe more

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.499 
game will be a faster-paced maybe more
combo<00:02:07.510> centrica<00:02:08.200> game<00:02:08.799> than<00:02:09.429> street<00:02:10.299> fighter

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
combo centrica game than street fighter

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.019 
combo centrica game than street fighter
4<00:02:10.810> Street<00:02:11.200> Fighter<00:02:11.409> 2<00:02:11.680> was<00:02:11.920> maybe<00:02:12.700> it<00:02:12.909> would

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:13.029 
4 Street Fighter 2 was maybe it would

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:13.910 
4 Street Fighter 2 was maybe it would
have<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:13.389> feel

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
have the feel

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.490 
have the feel
of<00:02:14.040> third<00:02:14.790> strike<00:02:15.150> which<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:15.720> my<00:02:15.990> favorite<00:02:16.410> of

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
of third strike which is my favorite of

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.160 
of third strike which is my favorite of
the<00:02:16.560> series<00:02:16.849> but<00:02:17.849> it<00:02:18.180> might<00:02:18.569> be<00:02:18.599> closer<00:02:18.989> to

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
the series but it might be closer to

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.680 
the series but it might be closer to
something<00:02:19.500> like<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:20.190> Alpha<00:02:20.700> series<00:02:20.910> or<00:02:21.300> like

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
something like the Alpha series or like

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.080 
something like the Alpha series or like
alpha<00:02:22.080> 3<00:02:22.319> on<00:02:22.500> turbo<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:23.130> where<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:23.580> is<00:02:23.700> much

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
alpha 3 on turbo to where it is much

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.210 
alpha 3 on turbo to where it is much
faster<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:24.840> can<00:02:24.989> pull<00:02:25.230> off<00:02:25.260> some<00:02:25.590> long

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
faster and you can pull off some long

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.460 
faster and you can pull off some long
crazy<00:02:26.640> combos<00:02:27.239> now<00:02:27.690> if<00:02:27.840> they<00:02:27.959> do<00:02:28.020> something

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
crazy combos now if they do something

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.690 
crazy combos now if they do something
like<00:02:28.620> this<00:02:28.830> they're<00:02:29.040> really<00:02:29.310> going<00:02:29.459> to<00:02:29.580> have

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
like this they're really going to have

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.510 
like this they're really going to have
to<00:02:29.730> adjust<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.959> damage<00:02:31.560> levels<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.130> you<00:02:32.340> can

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
to adjust the damage levels that you can

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.910 
to adjust the damage levels that you can
do<00:02:32.700> when<00:02:33.180> you're<00:02:33.300> making<00:02:33.330> these<00:02:33.780> high<00:02:34.290> combos

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
do when you're making these high combos

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.280 
do when you're making these high combos
and<00:02:35.220> these<00:02:35.520> juggling<00:02:35.940> moves<00:02:36.239> to<00:02:36.540> kind<00:02:37.200> of

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
and these juggling moves to kind of

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.990 
and these juggling moves to kind of
level<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:37.620> out<00:02:37.770> essentially<00:02:38.430> make<00:02:38.610> them<00:02:38.819> have

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
level it out essentially make them have

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.520 
level it out essentially make them have
double<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.390> white<00:02:39.600> bars<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.200> of<00:02:40.290> course

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
double the white bars and of course

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.830 
double the white bars and of course
tweak<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.950> lot<00:02:41.100> of<00:02:41.220> what's<00:02:41.430> already<00:02:41.610> there<00:02:41.880> but

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
tweak a lot of what's already there but

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.210 
tweak a lot of what's already there but
it<00:02:42.959> seems<00:02:43.170> apparent<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.860> system

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
it seems apparent that the system

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.740 
it seems apparent that the system
they're<00:02:44.370> going<00:02:44.640> for<00:02:44.849> is<00:02:45.090> much<00:02:45.300> different<00:02:45.720> than

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
they're going for is much different than

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.680 
they're going for is much different than
a<00:02:46.080> regular<00:02:46.170> street<00:02:46.950> fighter<00:02:47.190> game<00:02:47.390> maybe<00:02:48.390> not

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
a regular street fighter game maybe not

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.930 
a regular street fighter game maybe not
to<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.350> extent<00:02:49.680> of<00:02:49.860> something<00:02:50.220> like<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.430> guilty

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
to the extent of something like a guilty

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.949 
to the extent of something like a guilty
gear<00:02:51.209> or<00:02:51.769> even<00:02:52.769> King<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.130> Fighters<00:02:53.280> 13<00:02:53.970> but<00:02:54.780> it

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
gear or even King of Fighters 13 but it

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.570 
gear or even King of Fighters 13 but it
seems<00:02:55.350> like<00:02:55.560> they<00:02:55.709> want<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.040> go<00:02:56.130> for<00:02:56.370> something

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
seems like they want to go for something

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.729 
seems like they want to go for something
a<00:02:56.730> little<00:02:56.760> bit<00:02:57.090> faster<00:02:57.360> pace<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.110> I<00:02:58.200> what<00:02:58.470> and

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
a little bit faster pace and I what and

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.140 
a little bit faster pace and I what and
I<00:02:58.860> have<00:02:59.069> to<00:02:59.250> wonder<00:02:59.489> if<00:02:59.730> that's<00:02:59.940> at<00:03:00.120> all

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
I have to wonder if that's at all

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.449 
I have to wonder if that's at all
influenced<00:03:00.810> by<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.019> fact<00:03:01.110> that<00:03:01.410> guilty<00:03:02.310> gear

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459

going for this kind of fighting style I

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.400 
going for this kind of fighting style I
have<00:03:20.880> to<00:03:21.030> wonder<00:03:21.180> what<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.630> art<00:03:21.900> style<00:03:22.170> is

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
it's kind of cartoony or if they're

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
to see and especially considering the

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.780

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
technology we have now is that they

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.020 
technology we have now is that they
would<00:03:44.970> have<00:03:45.180> 3d<00:03:45.989> models<00:03:46.500> of<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:47.280> character

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
turbo where it has that kind of quasi

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.759 
turbo where it has that kind of quasi
realistic<00:03:53.940> look<00:03:54.209> everyone<00:03:55.109> looks<00:03:55.380> a<00:03:55.590> little

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
realistic look everyone looks a little

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.530 
realistic look everyone looks a little
bit<00:03:56.040> they<00:03:56.579> don't<00:03:56.790> look<00:03:56.880> quite<00:03:56.940> as<00:03:57.359> cartoony

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
bit they don't look quite as cartoony

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.199 
bit they don't look quite as cartoony
you<00:03:58.440> know<00:03:58.560> Blanco<00:03:58.890> was<00:03:59.280> actually<00:03:59.910> still<00:04:00.180> kind

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
you know Blanco was actually still kind

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.840 
you know Blanco was actually still kind
of<00:04:00.450> scary<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.079> I<00:04:01.290> I<00:04:01.620> want<00:04:02.130> that<00:04:02.340> feeling<00:04:02.519> back

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
of scary and I I want that feeling back

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.059 
of scary and I I want that feeling back
I<00:04:03.030> kind<00:04:03.299> of<00:04:03.359> want<00:04:03.569> that<00:04:03.750> kind<00:04:03.959> of<00:04:04.079> mood<00:04:04.350> to<00:04:04.680> it<00:04:04.890> I

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
I kind of want that kind of mood to it I

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.740 
I kind of want that kind of mood to it I
think<00:04:05.609> it<00:04:05.730> would<00:04:05.819> bring<00:04:06.000> kind<00:04:06.329> of<00:04:06.420> an<00:04:06.510> edge<00:04:06.720> to

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
think it would bring kind of an edge to

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.979 
think it would bring kind of an edge to
the<00:04:07.170> game<00:04:08.060> something<00:04:09.060> where<00:04:09.209> it's<00:04:09.299> not<00:04:09.569> too

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
the game something where it's not too

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.379 
the game something where it's not too
far-fetched<00:04:10.319> but<00:04:10.980> not<00:04:11.430> too<00:04:11.639> realistic<00:04:11.970> either

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
far-fetched but not too realistic either

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.870 
far-fetched but not too realistic either
like<00:04:13.200> street<00:04:13.440> fighter<00:04:13.470> 4<00:04:13.889> is<00:04:14.040> kind<00:04:14.310> of<00:04:14.430> it<00:04:14.639> is

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
like street fighter 4 is kind of it is

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.610 
like street fighter 4 is kind of it is
cartoony<00:04:15.480> looking<00:04:15.840> and<00:04:16.019> I<00:04:16.079> think<00:04:16.320> that<00:04:16.470> will

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
cartoony looking and I think that will

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.650 
cartoony looking and I think that will
turn<00:04:16.889> a<00:04:16.919> few<00:04:17.220> people<00:04:17.549> off<00:04:17.700> I<00:04:17.880> know<00:04:17.940> when<00:04:18.209> it<00:04:18.299> was

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
turn a few people off I know when it was

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.750 
turn a few people off I know when it was
first<00:04:18.989> announced<00:04:19.350> it<00:04:19.950> did<00:04:20.220> throw<00:04:20.459> a<00:04:20.489> lot<00:04:20.729> of

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
first announced it did throw a lot of

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.870 
first announced it did throw a lot of
people<00:04:21.000> off<00:04:21.269> not<00:04:21.840> to<00:04:21.959> mention<00:04:22.140> this<00:04:23.030> haha

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
people off not to mention this haha

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.730 
people off not to mention this haha
you<00:04:25.270> thought<00:04:25.420> you<00:04:25.480> forgot<00:04:25.810> about<00:04:25.870> a<00:04:26.080> denture<00:04:26.350> I

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
you thought you forgot about a denture I

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.290 
you thought you forgot about a denture I
brought<00:04:27.310> a<00:04:27.370> brat<00:04:28.890> it<00:04:29.890> won't<00:04:30.130> leave<00:04:30.310> it's

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
brought a brat it won't leave it's

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.640 
brought a brat it won't leave it's
what's<00:04:31.600> your<00:04:31.750> forever<00:04:32.050> as<00:04:32.320> a<00:04:32.910> street<00:04:33.910> fighter

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
what's your forever as a street fighter

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.080 
what's your forever as a street fighter
so<00:04:35.650> with<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:35.950> kind<00:04:36.160> of<00:04:36.250> artwork<00:04:36.490> and<00:04:36.760> super

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
so with the kind of artwork and super

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.690 
so with the kind of artwork and super
street<00:04:37.300> fighter<00:04:37.330> two<00:04:37.780> turbo<00:04:37.810> I<00:04:38.560> think<00:04:39.550> they

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
street fighter two turbo I think they

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.660 
street fighter two turbo I think they
can<00:04:39.730> translate<00:04:40.660> that<00:04:40.900> kind<00:04:41.200> of<00:04:41.350> look<00:04:41.560> into<00:04:42.280> 3d

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
can translate that kind of look into 3d

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.610 
can translate that kind of look into 3d
models<00:04:43.090> and<00:04:43.360> I<00:04:43.810> think<00:04:44.080> that's<00:04:44.230> the<00:04:44.320> way<00:04:44.470> they

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
models and I think that's the way they

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.680 
models and I think that's the way they
should<00:04:44.680> really<00:04:44.980> go<00:04:45.190> and<00:04:45.460> when<00:04:46.210> it<00:04:46.330> comes<00:04:46.540> to

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
should really go and when it comes to

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.720 
should really go and when it comes to
being<00:04:46.990> some<00:04:47.650> of<00:04:47.740> the<00:04:47.800> goofier<00:04:48.190> elements<00:04:48.640> of

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
being some of the goofier elements of

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.280 
being some of the goofier elements of
street<00:04:48.940> fighter<00:04:49.150> I<00:04:49.390> always<00:04:49.570> felt<00:04:49.840> that<00:04:49.960> it

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
street fighter I always felt that it

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.800 
street fighter I always felt that it
kinda<00:04:50.620> made<00:04:50.770> the<00:04:50.920> goofier<00:04:51.280> elements<00:04:51.970> better

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
kinda made the goofier elements better

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.510 
kinda made the goofier elements better
it<00:04:53.080> made<00:04:53.290> them<00:04:53.440> stand<00:04:53.680> out<00:04:53.860> more<00:04:53.920> and<00:04:54.310> made<00:04:54.490> a

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
it made them stand out more and made a

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.790 
it made them stand out more and made a
more<00:04:54.790> outrageous<00:04:55.180> one<00:04:55.720> they<00:04:56.230> occurred<00:04:56.590> with
