spring<00:00:06.629> compressors<00:00:07.490> now<00:00:08.990> all<00:00:09.990> you<00:00:10.260> need<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.530> a

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630 
spring compressors now all you need is a

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.870 
spring compressors now all you need is a
vise<00:00:12.630> grips<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.049> really<00:00:13.410> old<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:13.860> can't<00:00:14.610> find<00:00:14.759> my

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
vise grips is really old I can't find my

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.620 
vise grips is really old I can't find my
new<00:00:15.030> ones<00:00:15.240> so<00:00:16.490> that's<00:00:17.490> pretty<00:00:18.000> much<00:00:18.210> all<00:00:18.420> you

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
new ones so that's pretty much all you

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.960 
new ones so that's pretty much all you
need<00:00:18.660> um<00:00:19.550> maybe<00:00:21.949> maybe<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.100> little<00:00:23.400> magnet<00:00:23.850> if

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
need um maybe maybe a little magnet if

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.779 
need um maybe maybe a little magnet if
you<00:00:24.090> need<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.390> kind<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.160> don't<00:00:26.160> know<00:00:26.250> maybe

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
you need to kind of I don't know maybe

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.060 
you need to kind of I don't know maybe
get<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.119> little<00:00:27.320> retainers<00:00:28.320> out<00:00:28.500> through

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
get the little retainers out through

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.200 
get the little retainers out through
Tanner's<00:00:29.460> with<00:00:29.670> Mike<00:00:29.880> if<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.869> don't<00:00:31.050> know

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
Tanner's with Mike if you don't know

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.420 
Tanner's with Mike if you don't know
there<00:00:33.210> just<00:00:33.450> look<00:00:33.600> like<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.809> they<00:00:34.170> just

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
there just look like that they just

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.680 
there just look like that they just
clamp<00:00:35.430> right<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.270> valve<00:00:36.450> spring

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
clamp right in and the valve spring

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.540 
clamp right in and the valve spring
pushes<00:00:36.930> up<00:00:37.230> these<00:00:37.410> clamp<00:00:37.739> into<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.129> valve<00:00:38.309> and

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
pushes up these clamp into the valve and

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.459 
pushes up these clamp into the valve and
hold<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.879> L<00:00:39.180> spring<00:00:39.480> on<00:00:39.629> um<00:00:41.809> but<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:43.079> got<00:00:43.260> this

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
hold the L spring on um but I got this

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.229 
hold the L spring on um but I got this
first<00:00:43.710> one<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.280> now<00:00:44.610> I'm<00:00:44.760> going<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.030> set<00:00:45.149> the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
first one and now I'm going to set the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.869 
first one and now I'm going to set the
camera<00:00:45.480> down<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.840> show<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.579> how<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.640> eat<00:00:47.850> it

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
camera down and show you how to eat it

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.580 
camera down and show you how to eat it
out<00:00:48.059> with<00:00:48.300> only<00:00:50.239> vice<00:00:51.239> grips<00:00:51.539> or<00:00:51.719> pliers<00:00:52.050> but

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
out with only vice grips or pliers but

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.900 
out with only vice grips or pliers but
vice<00:00:52.829> grips<00:00:53.100> are<00:00:53.190> easier<00:00:53.489> because<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.760> don't

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
vice grips are easier because you don't

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.990 
vice grips are easier because you don't
have<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.120> keep<00:00:54.480> tension<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.870> them<00:00:55.969> all<00:00:56.969> right

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
have to keep tension on them all right

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.430 
have to keep tension on them all right
first<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.750> want<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.020> take<00:00:58.170> your<00:00:58.230> vice

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
first you just want to take your vice

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.240 
first you just want to take your vice
grips<00:00:59.390> and<00:01:00.390> clamp<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.809> onto<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.260> top<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.920> here

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
grips and clamp it onto the top in here

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.969 
grips and clamp it onto the top in here
you<00:01:02.550> don't<00:01:02.640> want<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.969> clamp<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.390> too<00:01:03.600> hard

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
you don't want to clamp it on too hard

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:08.450 
you don't want to clamp it on too hard
but<00:01:05.270> you<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.360> got<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.540> push<00:01:06.780> down<00:01:07.189> just<00:01:08.189> kind

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
but you just got to push down just kind

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.780 
but you just got to push down just kind
of<00:01:09.110> move<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.320> one<00:01:10.439> side<00:01:10.470> one<00:01:11.280> will<00:01:11.400> just<00:01:11.580> pop

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
of move it to one side one will just pop

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.640 
of move it to one side one will just pop
out<00:01:11.939> right<00:01:12.180> away<00:01:12.299> once<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.320> other<00:01:13.439> one's

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
out right away once the other one's

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.390 
out right away once the other one's
popped<00:01:13.920> out<00:01:14.509> things<00:01:15.509> should<00:01:15.689> come<00:01:15.869> off<00:01:16.400> then

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
popped out things should come off then

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.760 
popped out things should come off then
one<00:01:17.850> sticks<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.360> there<00:01:18.509> but<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.689> can<00:01:18.750> just<00:01:18.990> pop

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
one sticks in there but you can just pop

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.920 
one sticks in there but you can just pop
it<00:01:19.920> out<00:01:23.090> make<00:01:24.090> sure<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.270> don't<00:01:24.479> lose<00:01:24.630> these

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
it out make sure you don't lose these

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.730 
it out make sure you don't lose these
little<00:01:25.170> retainers<00:01:27.080> take<00:01:28.080> your<00:01:28.259> spring<00:01:28.560> out

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
little retainers take your spring out

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.350 
little retainers take your spring out
you<00:01:29.400> can<00:01:29.549> just<00:01:29.729> push<00:01:29.939> your<00:01:30.060> valve<00:01:30.299> through<00:01:35.360> and

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
you can just push your valve through and

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.480 
you can just push your valve through and
there<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.720> have<00:01:36.900> your<00:01:36.930> valve<00:01:37.320> out<00:01:40.009> now<00:01:41.009> it's<00:01:41.400> a

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
there you have your valve out now it's a

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.920 
there you have your valve out now it's a
little<00:01:41.729> bit<00:01:41.850> more<00:01:41.970> difficult<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.659> put<00:01:42.840> them

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
little bit more difficult to put them

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.639 
little bit more difficult to put them
back<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.850> but<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.509> basically<00:01:45.689> obviously<00:01:46.470> just

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
back in but you basically obviously just

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.230 
back in but you basically obviously just
have<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.890> put<00:01:47.040> your<00:01:47.189> valve<00:01:47.430> back<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:50.149> and<00:01:51.149> you

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
have to put your valve back in and you

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.300 
have to put your valve back in and you
want<00:01:51.479> some<00:01:51.689> sort<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.020> support<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.130> valve

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
want some sort of support so the valve

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.999 
want some sort of support so the valve
doesn't<00:01:53.549> go<00:01:53.759> down<00:01:54.350> through<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.649> just<00:01:55.680> have<00:01:55.979> a

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
doesn't go down through so I just have a

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.219 
doesn't go down through so I just have a
little<00:01:56.189> cap<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:57.509> other<00:01:57.689> side<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.049> valve

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
little cap the other side of the valve

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.670 
little cap the other side of the valve
put<00:01:58.530> your<00:01:58.680> spring<00:01:58.920> on<00:02:01.219> of<00:02:02.219> your<00:02:02.460> top<00:02:02.700> ring<00:02:03.240> and

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
put your spring on of your top ring and

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.219 
put your spring on of your top ring and
the<00:02:04.680> retainer

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.410 

and<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.160> grab<00:02:09.310> your<00:02:09.459> trainer<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.119> set<00:02:10.300> it

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
and the grab your trainer and set it

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.170 
and the grab your trainer and set it
down<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.940> just<00:02:13.300> put<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.510> down<00:02:14.910> like<00:02:15.910> I<00:02:15.940> said

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
down and just put that down like I said

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.699 
down and just put that down like I said
it's<00:02:16.330> it's<00:02:16.930> harder<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.349> put<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:17.620> back<00:02:17.770> on<00:02:18.040> but

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
it's it's harder to put it back on but

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.199 
it's it's harder to put it back on but
after<00:02:20.709> a<00:02:20.739> little<00:02:20.920> bit<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.130> wiggling<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:22.090> know

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
after a little bit of wiggling you know
