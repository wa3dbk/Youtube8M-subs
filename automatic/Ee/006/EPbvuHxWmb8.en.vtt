 Birabi chan I layout of the rubber Sasaki Asahi Come 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:12.840
 Yes Today is Valentine , which I am looking forward to 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:17.490
 And we can make some unusual gifts for White Day 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:20.020
 I 'm going to introduce the app This is pretty funny I think 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:26.500
 An app named small cookie 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:28.720
 You can make an original cookie easily with your smartphone 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:35.110
 It's an app, it's great, is n't it? 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:38.320
 Erase Te master shot in Ikima start How to make it camera teach a little 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.010
 Design without shooting from the album 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:45.090
 I was looking at a shopping cart 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:51.300
 Although there is something, shooting with the camera is as it is now. 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.860
 It will be in the form of reading something back I saw the design without taking a picture 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.850
 Let's see 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.900
 Yes It is round shape that overwintering cookies can be selected without such a feeling 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:07.040
 Octagonal 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:13.040
 If you try to go from almost all over the place you will see pictures of imagination and cookies 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:16.500
 In though there Toka or was templates Room with filters it under Well 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.270
 Where to do so ten pre 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.810
 Zune Fight 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.810
 Thank you 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.050
 Happy ring or congratulations 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.010
 8 There are already existing ones 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:36.210
 It to Toka cookies from pretty color is clear it yet 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:38.860
 It is amazing to print It is a cute design I also 10 later this frame 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.320
 I know I'm frame also full 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.130
 The frame is 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.079
 A lot of things 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:51.250
 You can choose this, so the good part of this is still only one original in the world 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:58.869
 I choose from the album because I think that it is possible to make a cookie 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:02:02.120
 I would like to see from my photos Press Select from the album and press to 8 folders 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:07.910
 As we go, we have a hood with cookies by hand 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:12.470
 This time I thought that I wanted to flex the two of these 8 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:16.130
 You probably did not see this picture in the advertisement very much last year 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:22.140
 8 It was used for advertising on youtube 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:24.810
 It becomes one of the pictures, but it is small if you easily enlarge it with your finger like this 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.989
 I can say that 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:33.420
 The same 10 plays as before 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:35.220
 I 'm going to go to a page with a frame that was 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:41.430
 When you scroll 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.880
 Prahran comes out also Toka or was the stamp lettering hit by a sideways like this stamp 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.830
 Hey 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.980
 There is a lot 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.010
 In feeling 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.580
 There are some stamps after this put in 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:54.020
 I think that I want to put the character of the cat this time 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.020
 For example 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.970
 39 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:10.330
 Since coming out of some fonts in it was to serve as likely to result and 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.330
 You can choose the font as you go here 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:22.000
 Choose you this really after Once you have selected font I wonder if try this color Iromon 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:28.450
 I think that some round colors are lined up on this, but 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:31.319
 The color you like in this in the choice or quite many kinds I also here 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:35.189
 Input completed in you 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:39.719
 Such a feeling that will be reflected in Surdo here 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:42.069
 Put in quickly and save 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:47.860
 Opposite save 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:51.490
 Then you have to order with this design 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.840
 Time to say here entertain and Domo 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.870
 In the shopping cart 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:01.730
 It becomes a form that can be purchased 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:07.790
 You in quantity will also purchase Chokkokara 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:11.480
 As it is 200 yen at a minimum of 10 pieces, it costs 20002000 yen 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.830
 + I think that the form called shipping costs should be illustrated 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.820
 Illustration This is Hey with the Tomb 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:22.380
 There is also a sticker but I changed it here 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.950
 Although it becomes my illustration which the person called Ripopo wrote, I photographed it 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.850
 only 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:30.000
 a You may be able to make a cute person 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:35.600
 Determine the size in the same way 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.120
 39 ッ か 決 め 還 流 by the Maruka qualification or decision 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.020
 Nde was thought that want to make in the design differences 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:45.340
 It is true of color 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:50.430
 I want to put together in the pink series, so to this 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.409
 After the power is complete , the font size and so on 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.500
 To a dream 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:57.950
 day 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.950
 I think that I want to filter with color 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.860
 not 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:07.340
 In a little crispy clear color 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:10.630
 I tried it and finished it with this save 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.030
 The description of the app is about this 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:21.030
 Another place tour 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:21.030
 I made it. Here is the original cookie true 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.529
 Not really 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:31.210
 I can really do it 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:34.210
 I was surprised I was really horror 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:40.690
 Properly to the photographs are printed 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:42.580
 The illustration is pretty It looks like this color comparing the actual finish and the color on the app 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:49.000
 Sleeping in it you I firmly eye 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:50.050
 Finish color of something like this because the color I made a trial of the Well I am I this time is printed 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.200
 I will be 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.310
 Imagine 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:06:01.310
 I think it seems like it will be used if you use it, but this time I call it a cookie 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:08.090
 Because it is made using only the application and can be done with such feeling 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:09.080
 Use the processing application that you are usually familiar with and use it to capture and print the past 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.190
 Also 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:16.710
 I think I can do it at all 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:23.980
 I'm going to Valentine 8 or something that's great now, and it seems like it 's a little bit more right now 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:25.750
 It is a cookie of the Osaka-style confectioner's shop called Peach and sleeping Poche 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:29.670
 Let's eat 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:33.700
 I do not want to eat to the bad guy 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:36.160
 I want to receive a decoration that I do not want to eat, but I also have a shelf life 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:41.200
 Image 4 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.920
 Well then I 'm glad I want to eat my face 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.910
 Ah 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:50.040
 If you look only at cookies, it's a little different again 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.040
 We will have in the state language 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:59.780

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:02.080
