in<00:00:10.400> this<00:00:10.700> video<00:00:10.970> I'm<00:00:11.210> going<00:00:11.480> to<00:00:11.570> show<00:00:11.750> you<00:00:11.809> how

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
in this video I'm going to show you how

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.379 
in this video I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:12.139> take<00:00:12.500> your<00:00:12.530> defuse<00:00:13.070> and<00:00:13.309> use<00:00:13.880> that<00:00:14.120> as<00:00:14.360> a

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
to take your defuse and use that as a

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:15.789 
to take your defuse and use that as a
specular<00:00:15.350> map

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:15.799 
specular map

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.370 
specular map
let's<00:00:16.040> open<00:00:16.160> up<00:00:16.340> content<00:00:16.760> browser<00:00:16.910> and<00:00:17.380> jump

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
let's open up content browser and jump

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.530 
let's open up content browser and jump
straight<00:00:18.590> into<00:00:18.860> the<00:00:19.099> material<00:00:19.460> editor<00:00:19.580> the

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:20.540 
straight into the material editor the

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.290 
straight into the material editor the
best<00:00:20.779> way<00:00:20.990> to<00:00:21.020> have<00:00:21.500> a<00:00:21.529> spec<00:00:22.070> map<00:00:22.279> is<00:00:22.520> to<00:00:22.939> create

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
best way to have a spec map is to create

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.269 
best way to have a spec map is to create
your<00:00:23.480> own<00:00:23.630> so<00:00:24.349> that<00:00:24.380> way<00:00:24.650> you<00:00:24.710> can<00:00:24.950> be<00:00:25.040> mindful

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
your own so that way you can be mindful

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.460 
your own so that way you can be mindful
of<00:00:25.609> where<00:00:25.970> the<00:00:26.090> highlights<00:00:26.510> are<00:00:26.720> and<00:00:26.960> whether

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
of where the highlights are and whether

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.890 
of where the highlights are and whether
or<00:00:27.680> not<00:00:27.830> in<00:00:28.250> this<00:00:28.490> spec<00:00:28.760> map<00:00:29.000> the<00:00:29.420> whites<00:00:29.660> of

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
or not in this spec map the whites of

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.470 
or not in this spec map the whites of
the<00:00:30.140> spec<00:00:30.380> on<00:00:30.529> map<00:00:30.740> are<00:00:30.920> the<00:00:31.070> highlights<00:00:31.480> is

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
the spec on map are the highlights is

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.390 
the spec on map are the highlights is
where<00:00:32.780> the<00:00:32.900> light<00:00:33.050> is<00:00:33.260> going<00:00:33.500> to<00:00:33.620> be<00:00:33.800> reflected

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
where the light is going to be reflected

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.700 
where the light is going to be reflected
and<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:34.940> dark<00:00:35.210> blacks<00:00:35.750> is<00:00:36.080> where<00:00:36.590> the

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
and the dark blacks is where the

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.950 
and the dark blacks is where the
highlights<00:00:37.190> are<00:00:37.309> not<00:00:37.730> going<00:00:38.000> to<00:00:38.120> show<00:00:38.330> so

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
highlights are not going to show so

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.080 
highlights are not going to show so
let's<00:00:39.170> say<00:00:39.350> we<00:00:39.530> didn't<00:00:39.710> have<00:00:39.739> our<00:00:40.160> spec<00:00:40.489> map<00:00:40.640> so

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
let's say we didn't have our spec map so

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.020 
let's say we didn't have our spec map so
we're<00:00:41.300> not<00:00:41.390> disconnected<00:00:41.930> and<00:00:42.730> all<00:00:43.730> we<00:00:43.850> had

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
we're not disconnected and all we had

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.260 
we're not disconnected and all we had
was<00:00:44.239> the<00:00:44.300> diffuse<00:00:44.780> we<00:00:45.680> can<00:00:45.860> use<00:00:46.130> a<00:00:46.399> diffuse<00:00:46.969> and

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
was the diffuse we can use a diffuse and

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.270 
was the diffuse we can use a diffuse and
convert<00:00:47.719> that<00:00:47.750> to<00:00:48.140> a<00:00:48.170> spec<00:00:48.469> map<00:00:48.680> using<00:00:49.250> a

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
convert that to a spec map using a

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.760 
convert that to a spec map using a
variety<00:00:49.520> of<00:00:49.820> expressions<00:00:50.450> to<00:00:50.930> get<00:00:51.110> a<00:00:51.140> similar

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
variety of expressions to get a similar

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.860 
variety of expressions to get a similar
effect<00:00:52.070> so<00:00:52.820> let's<00:00:53.000> go<00:00:53.090> ahead<00:00:53.180> select<00:00:53.480> our

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
effect so let's go ahead select our

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.900 
effect so let's go ahead select our
diffuse<00:00:54.260> I'm<00:00:54.950> gonna<00:00:55.129> press<00:00:55.340> control<00:00:55.670> C

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
diffuse I'm gonna press control C

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.850 
diffuse I'm gonna press control C
control<00:00:55.940> need<00:00:56.420> to<00:00:56.570> copy<00:00:56.719> and<00:00:57.520> paste<00:00:59.710> so<00:01:00.710> let's

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
control need to copy and paste so let's

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.069 
control need to copy and paste so let's
move<00:01:01.100> all<00:01:01.309> diffuse<00:01:01.640> up<00:01:01.910> give<00:01:02.660> ourselves<00:01:02.780> some

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
move all diffuse up give ourselves some

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.779 
move all diffuse up give ourselves some
space<00:01:03.469> and<00:01:03.890> I'm<00:01:04.160> going<00:01:04.339> to<00:01:04.399> move<00:01:04.550> this

00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:04.789 
space and I'm going to move this

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:07.690 
space and I'm going to move this
specular<00:01:05.210> all<00:01:05.600> the<00:01:05.690> way<00:01:05.750> down<00:01:05.960> that<00:01:06.830> we<00:01:07.009> can't

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
specular all the way down that we can't

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.320 
specular all the way down that we can't
see<00:01:07.940> it<00:01:08.000> so<00:01:09.399> let's<00:01:10.399> go<00:01:10.520> ahead<00:01:10.610> take<00:01:11.119> our

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
see it so let's go ahead take our

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.420 
see it so let's go ahead take our
default<00:01:12.140> diffuse<00:01:12.500> and<00:01:12.740> just<00:01:12.920> plug<00:01:13.100> it<00:01:13.250> into

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
default diffuse and just plug it into

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.550 
default diffuse and just plug it into
the<00:01:13.610> specular<00:01:14.030> of<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:14.330> material<00:01:14.720> and<00:01:14.840> we're

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
the specular of the material and we're

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.710 
the specular of the material and we're
gonna<00:01:15.710> disconnect<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:16.250> diffuse<00:01:16.610> so<00:01:17.360> all<00:01:17.540> we

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
gonna disconnect the diffuse so all we

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.130 
gonna disconnect the diffuse so all we
see<00:01:17.960> is<00:01:18.200> a<00:01:18.680> spec<00:01:19.130> map<00:01:19.310> so<00:01:20.180> right<00:01:20.360> now<00:01:20.479> we<00:01:20.540> have<00:01:21.110> a

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
see is a spec map so right now we have a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.429 
see is a spec map so right now we have a
specular<00:01:21.740> on<00:01:21.950> our<00:01:22.280> material<00:01:23.110> using<00:01:24.110> just<00:01:24.290> a

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
specular on our material using just a

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.800 
specular on our material using just a
regular<00:01:24.470> diffuse<00:01:25.070> but<00:01:25.759> this<00:01:26.090> texture<00:01:26.509> is<00:01:26.659> not

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
regular diffuse but this texture is not

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.899 
regular diffuse but this texture is not
taken<00:01:27.170> into<00:01:27.350> account<00:01:27.500> of<00:01:28.100> where<00:01:28.610> the

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
taken into account of where the

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.240 
taken into account of where the
highlights<00:01:29.570> are<00:01:29.750> going<00:01:29.900> to<00:01:30.049> be<00:01:30.200> or<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.740> darks

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
highlights are going to be or the darks

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.160 
highlights are going to be or the darks
where<00:01:31.790> there<00:01:32.090> is<00:01:32.180> no<00:01:32.299> highlight<00:01:32.689> is<00:01:32.840> going<00:01:33.020> to

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
where there is no highlight is going to

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.020 
where there is no highlight is going to
be<00:01:33.290> so<00:01:33.740> it's<00:01:33.920> just<00:01:34.040> doing<00:01:34.430> this<00:01:34.549> Vachon

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
be so it's just doing this Vachon

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.240 
be so it's just doing this Vachon
guesstimating<00:01:35.720> so<00:01:36.080> we<00:01:36.259> need<00:01:36.380> to<00:01:36.530> add<00:01:36.860> a<00:01:36.920> few

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
guesstimating so we need to add a few

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.550 
guesstimating so we need to add a few
nodes<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:38.270> this<00:01:38.420> texture<00:01:38.869> to<00:01:39.110> make<00:01:39.229> it<00:01:39.409> work

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
nodes to this texture to make it work

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.460 
nodes to this texture to make it work
better<00:01:40.090> first<00:01:41.090> let's<00:01:41.479> do<00:01:41.689> saturate<00:01:42.229> our

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
better first let's do saturate our

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.760 
better first let's do saturate our
texture<00:01:42.979> and<00:01:43.130> make<00:01:43.640> it<00:01:43.759> black<00:01:43.880> and<00:01:44.000> white<00:01:44.770> so

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
texture and make it black and white so

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.700 
texture and make it black and white so
we<00:01:45.920> need<00:01:46.040> your<00:01:46.250> saturation<00:01:46.729> node<00:01:47.500> let's<00:01:48.500> drag

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
we need your saturation node let's drag

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.350 
we need your saturation node let's drag
it<00:01:48.829> into<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.100> working<00:01:49.369> area<00:01:49.610> and<00:01:49.759> when<00:01:50.270> you

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
it into the working area and when you

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.730 
it into the working area and when you
take<00:01:50.540> constant<00:01:50.900> one<00:01:51.140> node<00:01:51.380> which<00:01:51.710> will

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
take constant one node which will

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.889 
take constant one node which will
control<00:01:52.310> how<00:01:52.549> much<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.909> saturation<00:01:53.420> will<00:01:53.720> get

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
control how much the saturation will get

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.530 
control how much the saturation will get
so<00:01:54.560> hold<00:01:54.770> on<00:01:54.920> one<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:55.310> left<00:01:55.549> look<00:01:55.759> for<00:01:56.509> a

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
so hold on one and left look for a

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.069 
so hold on one and left look for a
constant<00:01:57.020> vector<00:01:57.729> so<00:01:58.729> let's<00:01:58.909> move<00:01:59.090> our<00:01:59.329> spec

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
constant vector so let's move our spec

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.819 
constant vector so let's move our spec
map<00:02:00.259> off<00:02:00.500> to<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.829> side<00:02:01.040> here<00:02:01.399> is<00:02:02.060> a<00:02:02.270> eration

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
map off to the side here is a eration

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.450 
map off to the side here is a eration
in<00:02:03.829> front<00:02:04.250> and<00:02:05.439> let's<00:02:06.439> plug<00:02:06.680> in<00:02:06.890> our<00:02:07.040> constant

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
in front and let's plug in our constant

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.440 
in front and let's plug in our constant
one<00:02:07.670> two<00:02:08.149> percent<00:02:08.630> and<00:02:10.000> let's<00:02:11.000> take<00:02:11.180> our

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
one two percent and let's take our

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.410 
one two percent and let's take our
texture<00:02:12.200> sample<00:02:12.380> our<00:02:12.709> spectral<00:02:13.700> map<00:02:13.880> I<00:02:14.090> get

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
texture sample our spectral map I get

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.059 
texture sample our spectral map I get
into<00:02:14.660> this<00:02:14.780> situation

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
into this situation

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.220 
into this situation
and<00:02:16.189> the<00:02:16.790> situation<00:02:16.970> into<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.750> speckle<00:02:18.140> of

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
and the situation into the speckle of

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.699 
and the situation into the speckle of
the<00:02:18.349> material<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:20.810> let's<00:02:20.989> change<00:02:21.349> our

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
the material so let's change our

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.860 
the material so let's change our
constant<00:02:22.340> one<00:02:22.459> vector<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:22.939> 1

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
constant one vector to 1

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.020 
constant one vector to 1
this<00:02:23.989> will<00:02:24.170> make<00:02:24.319> it<00:02:24.530> 100%<00:02:25.159> black<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:25.909> white

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
this will make it 100% black and white

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.300 
this will make it 100% black and white
so<00:02:26.780> now<00:02:26.930> we<00:02:26.989> have<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.260> spec<00:02:27.590> map<00:02:27.739> that's<00:02:28.099> black

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
so now we have a spec map that's black

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.220 
so now we have a spec map that's black
and<00:02:28.489> white<00:02:28.670> but<00:02:29.239> we<00:02:29.390> don't<00:02:29.569> have<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:30.049> range

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
and white but we don't have the range

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.339 
and white but we don't have the range
the<00:02:30.769> contrast<00:02:31.280> of<00:02:31.549> whites<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:32.329> darks<00:02:32.810> to<00:02:33.019> make

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
the contrast of whites and darks to make

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.280 
the contrast of whites and darks to make
us<00:02:33.530> back<00:02:33.769> map<00:02:34.040> work<00:02:34.370> so<00:02:35.060> in<00:02:35.540> order<00:02:35.780> for<00:02:36.170> us<00:02:36.200> to

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
us back map work so in order for us to

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.039 
us back map work so in order for us to
get<00:02:36.620> a<00:02:36.829> higher<00:02:37.220> contrast<00:02:37.879> and<00:02:38.239> higher<00:02:38.569> values

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
get a higher contrast and higher values

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.319 
get a higher contrast and higher values
of<00:02:39.079> from<00:02:39.680> black<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.250> white<00:02:40.610> we<00:02:41.060> need<00:02:41.209> to

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
of from black to white we need to

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.110 
of from black to white we need to
increase<00:02:41.690> its<00:02:41.959> contrast<00:02:42.430> so<00:02:43.430> to<00:02:43.489> increase

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
increase its contrast so to increase

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.729 
increase its contrast so to increase
contrast<00:02:44.569> we<00:02:44.750> need<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:45.019> power<00:02:45.319> node<00:02:47.530> let's<00:02:48.530> drag

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
contrast we need a power node let's drag

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.830 
contrast we need a power node let's drag
it<00:02:48.769> into<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.129> working<00:02:49.400> area<00:02:49.670> and<00:02:49.819> we<00:02:50.540> need<00:02:50.659> a

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
it into the working area and we need a

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.869 
it into the working area and we need a
constant<00:02:51.290> one<00:02:51.500> which<00:02:51.890> will<00:02:52.099> control<00:02:52.430> how<00:02:52.670> much

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
constant one which will control how much

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.220 
constant one which will control how much
contrast<00:02:53.659> we<00:02:53.870> give<00:02:54.470> our<00:02:54.709> speckle<00:02:55.370> map<00:02:56.170> so<00:02:57.170> I'm

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
contrast we give our speckle map so I'm

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.770 
contrast we give our speckle map so I'm
going<00:02:57.349> to<00:02:57.440> put<00:02:57.560> power<00:02:58.370> right<00:02:58.790> in<00:02:58.940> here<00:02:59.150> I'm

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
going to put power right in here I'm

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.270 
going to put power right in here I'm
going<00:02:59.959> to<00:03:00.019> move<00:03:00.139> our<00:03:00.379> spec<00:03:00.650> map<00:03:00.859> back<00:03:01.459> and

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
going to move our spec map back and

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.379 
going to move our spec map back and
constant<00:03:04.280> one<00:03:04.370> vector<00:03:04.700> will<00:03:05.000> go<00:03:05.120> right<00:03:05.329> here

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:05.389 
constant one vector will go right here

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.500 
constant one vector will go right here
let's<00:03:06.290> plug<00:03:06.590> in<00:03:06.859> our<00:03:07.280> constant<00:03:07.879> into<00:03:08.389> the

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
let's plug in our constant into the

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.660 
let's plug in our constant into the
exponent<00:03:08.900> this<00:03:09.440> will<00:03:09.620> control<00:03:09.950> our<00:03:10.129> contrast

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
exponent this will control our contrast

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.369 
exponent this will control our contrast
I'm<00:03:11.090> going<00:03:11.359> to<00:03:11.420> change<00:03:11.690> their<00:03:11.840> constant<00:03:12.230> 1

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
I'm going to change their constant 1

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.830 
I'm going to change their constant 1
vector<00:03:12.709> to<00:03:13.190> 1<00:03:13.400> this<00:03:14.090> will<00:03:14.150> be<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.629> default

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
vector to 1 this will be the default

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.710 
vector to 1 this will be the default
where<00:03:15.230> we<00:03:15.379> see<00:03:15.560> now<00:03:15.819> take<00:03:16.819> the<00:03:16.940> power<00:03:17.150> plug<00:03:17.540> it

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
where we see now take the power plug it

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.099 
where we see now take the power plug it
into<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.590> saturation<00:03:19.040> and<00:03:19.660> take<00:03:20.660> our<00:03:20.810> spec

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
into the saturation and take our spec

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.140 
into the saturation and take our spec
map<00:03:21.260> and<00:03:21.500> plug<00:03:21.680> it<00:03:21.799> into<00:03:21.949> base<00:03:22.220> so<00:03:22.819> let<00:03:22.940> me<00:03:23.030> move

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
map and plug it into base so let me move

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.759 
map and plug it into base so let me move
this<00:03:23.329> closer<00:03:23.599> so<00:03:23.959> we<00:03:23.989> can<00:03:24.079> see<00:03:24.349> what's<00:03:24.500> going

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
this closer so we can see what's going

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.689 
this closer so we can see what's going
on<00:03:25.930> so<00:03:26.930> now<00:03:27.049> we<00:03:27.109> have<00:03:27.379> contrast<00:03:28.069> controls<00:03:28.430> and

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:28.699 
on so now we have contrast controls and

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:32.229 
on so now we have contrast controls and
we<00:03:28.940> have<00:03:29.090> this<00:03:29.239> situation<00:03:29.780> in<00:03:29.930> front<00:03:30.139> of<00:03:30.199> it<00:03:31.239> so

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
we have this situation in front of it so

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.550 
we have this situation in front of it so
let's<00:03:32.419> go<00:03:32.510> ahead<00:03:32.690> and<00:03:32.900> increase<00:03:33.590> contrast<00:03:34.480> and

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
let's go ahead and increase contrast and

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.619 
let's go ahead and increase contrast and
we'll<00:03:36.560> be<00:03:36.799> able<00:03:36.889> to<00:03:37.099> see<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.430> results<00:03:38.000> inside

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
we'll be able to see the results inside

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.900 
we'll be able to see the results inside
this<00:03:39.019> desaturation<00:03:39.410> node<00:03:39.949> so<00:03:40.609> let's<00:03:40.760> increase

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
this desaturation node so let's increase

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.960 
this desaturation node so let's increase
contrast<00:03:41.510> to<00:03:41.690> 3<00:03:42.290> it<00:03:42.709> increased<00:03:43.310> our<00:03:43.459> contrast

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
contrast to 3 it increased our contrast

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.050 
contrast to 3 it increased our contrast
but<00:03:44.359> it<00:03:44.480> also<00:03:44.720> darkened<00:03:45.410> our<00:03:45.590> texture<00:03:46.099> so<00:03:46.910> now

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
but it also darkened our texture so now

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.479 
but it also darkened our texture so now
we<00:03:47.120> need<00:03:47.389> to<00:03:47.510> brighten<00:03:47.900> our<00:03:48.230> spec<00:03:48.769> map<00:03:48.980> and<00:03:49.220> for

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
we need to brighten our spec map and for

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.509 
we need to brighten our spec map and for
that<00:03:49.639> we<00:03:50.060> need<00:03:50.449> a<00:03:50.720> multiply<00:03:51.379> and<00:03:51.590> a<00:03:52.040> constant

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
that we need a multiply and a constant

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.089 
that we need a multiply and a constant
vector<00:03:52.699> node<00:03:53.030> so<00:03:53.840> I'm<00:03:54.079> going<00:03:54.349> to<00:03:54.500> take<00:03:54.709> our

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
vector node so I'm going to take our

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.110 
vector node so I'm going to take our
contrast<00:03:56.030> controls<00:03:56.359> and<00:03:56.569> move<00:03:56.750> them<00:03:56.870> back<00:03:56.900> and

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
contrast controls and move them back and

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.089 
contrast controls and move them back and
I'm<00:03:59.120> going<00:03:59.329> to<00:03:59.389> insert<00:03:59.659> multiply<00:04:00.409> and<00:04:00.620> one<00:04:00.859> in

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
I'm going to insert multiply and one in

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.809 
I'm going to insert multiply and one in
between<00:04:01.579> the<00:04:01.730> saturation<00:04:02.299> and<00:04:02.470> contrast<00:04:03.819> so

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
between the saturation and contrast so

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.430 
between the saturation and contrast so
I'm<00:04:04.879> gonna<00:04:05.000> hold<00:04:05.180> on<00:04:05.359> 1<00:04:05.629> and<00:04:05.810> left-click<00:04:06.019> for<00:04:06.409> a

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
I'm gonna hold on 1 and left-click for a

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.869 
I'm gonna hold on 1 and left-click for a
constant<00:04:06.949> vector<00:04:07.129> this<00:04:07.489> will<00:04:07.639> be<00:04:07.760> our

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
constant vector this will be our

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.569 
constant vector this will be our
brightness<00:04:08.449> control<00:04:08.959> and<00:04:09.169> M<00:04:09.859> and<00:04:10.159> left<00:04:10.400> click

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
brightness control and M and left click

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.300 
brightness control and M and left click
for<00:04:10.849> multiply<00:04:11.349> then<00:04:12.349> I<00:04:12.440> change<00:04:12.709> our<00:04:12.859> constant

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
for multiply then I change our constant

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.640 
for multiply then I change our constant
vector<00:04:13.549> to<00:04:13.760> 1<00:04:14.000> given<00:04:14.569> us<00:04:14.720> the<00:04:14.870> default<00:04:15.290> or<00:04:15.470> what

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
vector to 1 given us the default or what

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.800 
vector to 1 given us the default or what
we<00:04:15.769> see<00:04:15.979> right<00:04:16.190> now<00:04:16.220> take<00:04:16.909> power<00:04:17.150> plug<00:04:17.539> it<00:04:17.690> in

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
we see right now take power plug it in

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.930 
we see right now take power plug it in
to<00:04:17.930> multiply<00:04:18.380> a<00:04:18.650> slot<00:04:19.010> take<00:04:19.400> a<00:04:19.430> constant

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
to multiply a slot take a constant

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.230 
to multiply a slot take a constant
vector<00:04:20.090> into<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:20.870> B<00:04:21.019> slot

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
vector into the B slot

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.159 
vector into the B slot
and<00:04:22.330> plug<00:04:23.169> multiply<00:04:23.620> it<00:04:23.680> into<00:04:24.130> this<00:04:24.250> situation

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
and plug multiply it into this situation

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.749 
and plug multiply it into this situation
so<00:04:26.169> now<00:04:26.199> let's<00:04:26.500> go<00:04:26.590> ahead<00:04:26.650> and<00:04:26.979> increase<00:04:27.490> and

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 
so now let's go ahead and increase and

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:30.180 
so now let's go ahead and increase and
brighten<00:04:28.120> our<00:04:28.240> texture<00:04:28.660> so<00:04:29.050> select<00:04:29.860> the

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
brighten our texture so select the

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.710 
brighten our texture so select the
constant<00:04:30.610> vector<00:04:30.880> that's<00:04:31.090> pumped<00:04:31.539> into

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
constant vector that's pumped into

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.620 
constant vector that's pumped into
multiply<00:04:32.289> give<00:04:32.979> it<00:04:33.099> a<00:04:33.160> value<00:04:33.280> of<00:04:33.520> five<00:04:33.759> and<00:04:34.090> now

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
multiply give it a value of five and now

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.870 
multiply give it a value of five and now
our<00:04:34.900> spec<00:04:35.289> map<00:04:35.470> looks<00:04:35.770> a<00:04:35.889> lot<00:04:36.130> better<00:04:36.340> very

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
our spec map looks a lot better very

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.279 
our spec map looks a lot better very
close<00:04:37.210> to<00:04:37.569> the<00:04:37.720> original

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
close to the original

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.529 
close to the original
so<00:04:39.069> with<00:04:39.280> these<00:04:39.370> controls<00:04:39.580> we<00:04:40.180> can<00:04:40.210> give<00:04:40.449> it

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
so with these controls we can give it

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:44.460 
so with these controls we can give it
more<00:04:40.690> contrast<00:04:41.069> let's<00:04:42.069> say<00:04:42.190> five<00:04:42.720> and<00:04:43.720> we<00:04:44.349> can

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
more contrast let's say five and we can

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.879 
more contrast let's say five and we can
brighten<00:04:44.740> this<00:04:44.949> up<00:04:45.130> to<00:04:45.550> about<00:04:45.610> ten<00:04:46.740> maybe<00:04:47.740> more

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
brighten this up to about ten maybe more

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:51.120 
brighten this up to about ten maybe more
let's<00:04:48.430> do<00:04:48.699> 25<00:04:49.259> so<00:04:50.259> a<00:04:50.289> quick<00:04:50.560> rundown

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
let's do 25 so a quick rundown

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.969 
let's do 25 so a quick rundown
we<00:04:51.310> have<00:04:51.490> contrast<00:04:52.270> controls<00:04:52.660> for<00:04:52.960> our<00:04:53.020> spec

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
we have contrast controls for our spec

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.040 
we have contrast controls for our spec
map<00:04:54.130> then<00:04:54.610> we<00:04:54.880> are<00:04:55.090> brightening<00:04:55.690> in<00:04:55.840> that

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
map then we are brightening in that

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.439 
map then we are brightening in that
contrast<00:04:56.560> and<00:04:56.860> then<00:04:57.340> we<00:04:57.550> are<00:04:57.639> desaturating

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
contrast and then we are desaturating

00:04:58.449 --> 00:04:59.909 
contrast and then we are desaturating
turning<00:04:58.900> it<00:04:58.990> into<00:04:59.199> a<00:04:59.349> black<00:04:59.590> and<00:04:59.800> white

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
turning it into a black and white

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.070 
turning it into a black and white
texture<00:05:00.400> so<00:05:00.669> our<00:05:00.789> final<00:05:01.150> thing<00:05:01.300> let's<00:05:01.569> plug<00:05:01.810> in

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
texture so our final thing let's plug in

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.020 
texture so our final thing let's plug in
our<00:05:02.289> diffuse<00:05:02.680> let's<00:05:03.490> take<00:05:03.669> a<00:05:03.699> look<00:05:03.909> at<00:05:03.970> the

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
our diffuse let's take a look at the

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.149 
our diffuse let's take a look at the
preview<00:05:04.330> hold<00:05:04.659> the<00:05:04.870> Alt<00:05:05.020> key<00:05:05.139> and<00:05:05.440> move<00:05:05.979> the

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:06.159 
preview hold the Alt key and move the

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:08.730 
preview hold the Alt key and move the
light<00:05:06.340> let's<00:05:07.300> save<00:05:07.539> the<00:05:07.690> material<00:05:08.080> and<00:05:08.259> see

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
light let's save the material and see

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.339 
light let's save the material and see
what<00:05:08.860> it<00:05:08.979> looks<00:05:09.009> like<00:05:09.250> inside<00:05:09.669> the<00:05:09.819> map<00:05:10.349> this

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:11.349 
what it looks like inside the map this

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:13.830 
what it looks like inside the map this
is<00:05:11.530> a<00:05:11.560> good<00:05:11.800> start<00:05:12.099> and<00:05:12.250> I<00:05:12.880> would<00:05:13.090> tweak<00:05:13.360> values

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
is a good start and I would tweak values

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.390 
is a good start and I would tweak values
a<00:05:13.870> little<00:05:14.169> bit<00:05:14.259> more<00:05:14.470> to<00:05:14.680> make<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:15.009> diffuse

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
a little bit more to make the diffuse

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.029 
a little bit more to make the diffuse
work<00:05:15.639> better<00:05:15.970> as<00:05:16.270> a<00:05:16.300> spec<00:05:16.659> map<00:05:16.810> but<00:05:17.440> now<00:05:17.650> you

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
work better as a spec map but now you

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:20.010 
work better as a spec map but now you
have<00:05:18.220> the<00:05:18.430> tools<00:05:18.639> and<00:05:18.849> the<00:05:19.060> know-how<00:05:19.210> to<00:05:19.659> turn

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
have the tools and the know-how to turn

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.909 
have the tools and the know-how to turn
a<00:05:20.259> diffuse<00:05:20.650> to<00:05:21.220> a<00:05:21.250> spec<00:05:21.759> map
