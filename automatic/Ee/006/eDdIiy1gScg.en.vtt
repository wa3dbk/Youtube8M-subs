00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 Hello everyone, it's just gta 4 with 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.820
 converted by a card from gta 5 what is it 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.550
 say everything will seem to me very 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.230
 good and lovely but ipsy for now 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:19.710
 tough straight alpha which is 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.050
 represents only textures such 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.330
 know what it's called I don't remember in 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.220
 In general, they are transparent and even some 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.199
 places and so how would the circuit just to 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.119
 see where what is i 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.900
 on top of these textures will be more 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.309
 applied 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:39.210
 some part well in principle here's how 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:43.920
 it looks like from a bird's flight 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:47.550
 and maybe from the height of the plane let's say on 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.760
 different you can basically say but here 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.539
 how does she look like 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:57.140
 on top of already more or less as if to 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:01:00.300
 draws a picture of such gta 5 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.340
 but still it's tough alpha we will 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.830
 wait I'll take it off even when 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.650
 some update may say that 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.159
 do the city first well how to do 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:15.030
 then I will start doing the rest 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:20.549
 pokamys update was not online in 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.000
 the inscription hour we will reach the highest 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.400
 the mountains 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.320
 but you know it seems to me that this card is still 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.260
 do not remember need it looks too small 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.140
 maybe somehow she 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.260
 and have not completed your well in general, that's what 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:40.400
 she is enough 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:44.690
 already impressive and you know I probably already 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:49.190
 I'm waiting more when they finish this miracle 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.930
 of our creation because well gta 5 she 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.230
 and in africa this developers are fast 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.780
 it will stir up and here, well, a couple of guys decided 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.640
 do here I think they are good 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.990
 it turns out they are important not to give up 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.290
 because it's really hard 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:09.040
 I wish them good luck 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.920
 I want to see all the same final version 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.290
 it will seem very cool to me and 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.330
 so many people are waiting 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:22.010
 This is exactly the ported map 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.620
 because I don't know this five this and already 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.640
 don't even wait insaat ride have scored already 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.600
 not aggrieved on anyone just come out yes and 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.630
 nobody will come out then when it comes out again 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.930
 all so far calmed him even more 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:44.180
 worried about this one's card envelope 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:46.640
 shot down again on gta 4 oh well I would show 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.390
 would you down there how you can ride on 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.980
 the ride doesn't fail but it's ok 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.220
 see from above that it looks awful 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.890
 it is as if not meant for 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.890
 so you can play on it 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.110
 This is for the developers themselves. 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.150
 so you can say that they saw where 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.920
 what is and then put on top on 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:13.280
 she already has normal textures and everything 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:17.360
 that is, the Danton pistes were installed 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.910
 where it is necessary as if there is nothing else to do 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.780
 nothing to do here i'm talking about running 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.459
 on look what's his vanomas there 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.180
 here probably would cut yourself 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:32.260
 eyes not to see that length for 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.060
 it would be a shock to me 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.240
 yes it's shocked for me but it's terrible 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.380
 just looks 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:45.770
 however I don't know it without just 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:49.420
 Now here's what it can be such a 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:52.490
 shnyaga help with just hand we go 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:59.890
 let's get a little uphill there i will show you in 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:04:05.220
 games it also flies 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.220
 Adaev so little Boost 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.530
 Well, I do not know that something will come out from them 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:16.910
 normal or will some kind of bullshit this 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:19.130
 we must all wait to watch while not counting 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.520
 Generally behind the thunder offset say honestly 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:26.330
 Well, I want to see up to do well 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.639
 it will be cool there will make a lousy one 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.400
 will not be here and can play a couple 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.530
 schoolboy the main thing that they all amounts 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.550
 done and what are you failing not 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:41.510
 I know before there was no such site 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:46.690
 I started for some reason through textures 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:49.040
 fail baby how are you all so 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:53.000
 the coolest thing that I have now 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:55.340
 Neighbors started here for nothing walls 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.490

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.610

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.860
 in principle, and not and well, I already show 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:07.389
 here with these cries with these amounts 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.650
 this is another piece of his card 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:13.910
 see for this principle and watch something 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:16.400

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:36.200
 just wait and hope that they 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:39.010
 still do not give up doing it 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:44.630
