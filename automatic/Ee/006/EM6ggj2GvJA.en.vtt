00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.160
 hi everyone today i'm going 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.129
 present you two art miles for the 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.470
 valentine stepping and varnish 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.449
 so we will start with this first 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.939
 nayla it's an integral motive is a 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.400
 little letter in base I posed a 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.410
 blue varnish really very very clear and 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.109
 for the bottom I also want to use two 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.920
 other pastel polish remover and a 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.380
 Q-tip 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.290
 I start by putting my solvent 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.910
 in a small container and then I'm going 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.360
 put a drop of polish on a 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.000
 support on a sheet for example I 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.489
 then quench my cotton a little bit 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.890
 rod in the solvent and then I put it 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.960
 lol to my left of polish it's going 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.789
 allow to thin it a little bit 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.260
 to make it more liquid and to make 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.860
 also the varnish a little bit more 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.690
 transparent 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.480
 you really need to measure your 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.829
 dissolving if you have an accident on 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.660
 your cotton swab you can remove it 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.140
 on a plastic sheet on a 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.330
 smooth surface then you can buffered 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.980
 on the nail so you make weights 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.510
 like that on your angle so 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.760
 random we are not looking at all 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.290
 do something regular you can 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.450
 it's a little bit anyhow in 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.060
 so do you put a little bit 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.400
 everywhere then we will redo exactly 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.640
 the same steps but with another 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.500
 color so here here the purple 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.930
 I'm going to ask the purple to 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.550
 on top of the green ever a little bit 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.590
 everywhere I try to cover anyway 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.210
 the blue that I have in base I can 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.800
 leave some spaces of course but 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.490
 I try to cover a 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.160
 good surface 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.920
 I end with the blue color that I have 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.720
 also used in base and I'm going to go to 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.070
 add some little touches ever 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.630
 still a little bit less than the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.890
 rape and the green since there were 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.970
 already in base, you will find all this a 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.830
 last time quickly 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.600
 so I like working on a 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.810
 plasticized surface because like that 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.000
 the paper is not going to drink the varnish 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.170
 it's more practical 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 dawes well your solvent and 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.070
 especially also there should not be 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.930
 have too much otherwise it'll do something 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.330
 too much liquid but you still have to 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.940
 useful hue your polish otherwise it's just going 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.400
 to make points it's not going to mix the 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.500
 colors between them then try to 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.210
 do not 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.740
 to pay attention in cotton fibers 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.020
 that can be deposited on the nail 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.480
 regularly change cotton swab for 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.860
 not that it does it then i'm going 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.170
 go to stenting so I'm going to use 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.390
 a stamping plate that makes 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.310
 part of the tourists collection I 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.280
 will also use a stamping polish 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.390
 purple and a big stamp with his 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.970
 racket 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.980
 so I take my integral motive and I 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.550
 deposits the varnish a stamping especially the 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.990
 pattern 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.950
 it does not take much for this 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:49.310
 kind of big patterns right after 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.780
 I come scraped the pattern is still all 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.780
 immediately after I come stamped in 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.280
 pressing well on my thermos 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.480
 so that's what we get on the 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.890
 buffer we will come aim and deposit it 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.720
 on the nail doing a little 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.050
 rotational movement a little bit we're going 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.670
 to say next I will use another 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.070
 stamping plate still from the brand 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.850
 miu but from the collection under whom this 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:16.700
 time after that I'll keep the same 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:20.030
 time pau and I'm going to use a polish 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.640
 black stamping so I put the polish 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.250
 black on the letter right after 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.049
 I scrape without pressing too much then I 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.450
 buffers 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.880
 I also want to use white and 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.640
 purple varnish and a small spa 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.620
 dent so here's what it looks like 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.440
 our stamp we will now come 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.959
 fill the pattern with the colors we 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.090
 so chose me I'm going to rape 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.130
 and in the bone of the envelope simply 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.799
 to remember the colors that there are on 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.900
 the other nails and then the rest of 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.579
 the wrapped I would do it a white by 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.530
 against small precision for this 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.810
 technique you really have to fill everything 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.489
 the reason so if there are areas that 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.410
 you do not fill with a varnish of 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.180
 color but you're still top 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.810
 coat under a gloss varnish a varnish 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.880
 transparent 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.190
 because you really have to fill everything 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.930
 otherwise your polish will be too dry 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.989
 will not be transposed on the nail so 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.310
 I really had nail polish everywhere 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.140
 then waited for it to dry a little 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.320
 do not miss it right now 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:22.130
 the nail and so gently 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.050
 on your nail once it's done 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.120
 I will come and add little hearts 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.760
 so it's the same heart 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.620
 that's what makes it on the plate of 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.630
 stamping there is the letter and I come 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.940
 add a little bit above 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.150
 of a flop I end as always by 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.949
 of the top coat and so that's the result of 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.860
 this first nail art we will go to 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:44.360
 second which is much faster and 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.120
 much easier to achieve 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.150
 it is also more classic more refined 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.460
 more romantic we'll say so I 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.430
 started by laying a dark varnish in 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.740
 base and I will come this time peace with 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.320
 a white polish and a large tampon 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.030
 still from the miu brand for the plate 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.770
 it's the same as it was earlier 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.470
 the plate moe ue of the collection 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.080
 tourists so I'm going to come take the 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:14.180
 integral pattern of intel and i'm going to put 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:16.280
 white polish everywhere then I come 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.500
 remember without pressing too much there is no need 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:22.970
 of many supported and I come in good 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.979
 and so then I aim well and I come 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:28.010
 to make a small movement without too much 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.330
 press to drop the pattern if the 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.160
 pattern is a bit too big for 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.830
 your angle that it exceeds on the skin 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.750
 you can very easily removed with 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.849
 a correction pen this one comes from 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.500
 site bang or two points as which 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:42.470
 I added a little bit of my own 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.900
 dissolving inside as always 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.870
 we finish with top coat not to 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.400
 that the top 4 faces b the pattern was going on 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.530
 not many times same place is 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.960
 passed quickly we do not hang out 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.520
 the brush here is so I hope this 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.919
 video you snatch him I wish you 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.900
