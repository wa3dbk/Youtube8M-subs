00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:09.900
 how about good night youtube friends 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:13.879
 good in this in this video for today 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.310
 I'll try to show you how to enter 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:20.070
 to self-diagnosis mode 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.460
 through 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.079
 with a remote control 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:30.519
 well this see the mistakes that this has 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:33.180
 television as well as some others of the 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.810
 chassis see 6 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.870
 ok well then we'll go into mode 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:46.399
 self-diagnosis with the display keys 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.399
 with 5 volume - and power 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.440
 good me after 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.739
 we have already entered the service mode we 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.480
 will show is on screen that is the 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:05.590
 self-diagnosis where then there are the 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:08.860
 the errors where are these ones 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:14.350
 because this one we will proceed here we there 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:17.409
 it also shows us s &amp; p to failure or pp 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.950
 for today to end also a problem of 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.509
 video that had previously 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.110
 Well, all those mistakes, 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:29.720
 we will proceed to zero them 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:35.740
 out there be good then right now 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:38.740
 let's go into how to erase the errors 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.740
 good 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.230
 what we do now is turn off the 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.480
 TV 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.740
 and re-enter it again but enter 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.740
 now as a service 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.500
 as you will see now we have now 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.010
 focused to service mode out there to 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.500
 through the key display channel 5 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.500
 more volume 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.259
 and power on and now we will proceed to 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.340
 press squeeze also the other two 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.890
 following keys channel 8 and enter to 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:20.010
 be able to erase the errors that 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.010
 This had previously been ok 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.700
 as we see there is the television after 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:32.200
 to be in service mode when oppressing 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.450
 the 8 key and enter out there went off it 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.320
 it turned off and then I definitely believe 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.960
 that already were left was erased all 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.970
 the errors of 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.610
 where we had observed in the 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.680
 self-diagnostic screen then 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:53.430
 let's proceed to turn it on to see what 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.430
 such how the screen shows us 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:01.490
 there are as we already observed this one because as 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.210
 we observed it has already been 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:08.390
 has been this respects the issuer has been 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:11.000
 re besieged and already probably already 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.590
 Factory mode with errors 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.550
 deleted 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.830
 and everything like in the factory, that's why 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.470
 we do it sometimes to leave mistakes 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.890
 around the television that sometimes 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.710
 turn off or turn on any 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:31.220
 error you already need already after 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:35.060
 have finished a repair then 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:39.880
 we will proceed to reset the 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.880
 TV to factory settings 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.439
 today we proceed to use the car 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:48.260
 programming to the television so that 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:50.090
 program all channels already after 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.540
 that this car programmed all the 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:57.849
 channels because this will work again 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:02.510
 and now yes obviously without any error 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:04.660
 that he had the TV out there 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.850
 of some this 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.190
 of the faults that previously had 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.850
 put in there either by the change of 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:15.230
 motto sct 3001 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.230
 or any other problem 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.920
 as they observed after I had 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:24.790
 prescribed the television and we go back to 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.640
 enter self-diagnosis on screen 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.130
 We can already see all the places where 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.770
 they were the other ones again 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.110
 at zero where were the 1 already in 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.050
 zero then it means that we have already 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.210
 resisted by the television already this 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.020
 we go out there to turn off the TV 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.060
 and try it and check not being able to 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.790
 we turn off and turn it on again and 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.900
 we proceed to put them to work 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:55.120
 how many hours and see if there is an error 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.370
 this TV since the ball repaired 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.340
 the sct but it turned off or I was 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:03.970
 I used to light it on alone 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:06.300
 no problem out there at the source in 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.760
 the source must more everything normal everything well 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:12.120
 so what I check was that maybe 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.160
 it was due to the errors there that it detected 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.010
 in the 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.410
 in the self-diagnosis not even though there 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:24.110
 good but it has served you in this 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.110
 you can serve video thank you very much
