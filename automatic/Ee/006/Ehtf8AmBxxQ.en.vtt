00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.019
 so well know the specifics of comics not 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.239
 considering the 90's cartoon so she 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.399

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.570
 I'll mess up with some names or 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.550
 names Well let's try 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.620
 so first I will talk about the game in general 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.809
 this time the main actions will be 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.600
 take place far beyond the city 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.700
 gotham new villain brainiac wants 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.160
 destroy our whole planet 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.100
 taking possession of the rings of the order of the green lanterns 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.039
 he learned to reduce whole worlds to 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.199
 tiny miniature sizes and to 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.180
 avoid this sad fate all the heroes 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.430
 disi must unite only league 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.670
 You see justice and you said 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.350
 you will have no benefit 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.900
 they must all come together to 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.390
 stop brain k and even so amusing 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.380
 villains like joker Lex luthor killer 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.869
 boxed solomon grundy grande 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.400
 so start already a little bit to avoid in 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.270
 general they must all unite against 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.119
 brainiac 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.870
 and save not only gotham but the whole earth 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.020
 let's order 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.240
 the game begins with the fact that all the lights 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.910
 both good and again calls for one 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.580
 after another mysterious force intention 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.830
 which are not yet clear after a short 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.260
 Inter we find ourselves in the familiar 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.080
 goths where we try to catch croc 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.210
 playing for batman and robin like all 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.610
 The remaining games are pasted over the third part of the 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.920
 Batman to the eyeballs filled with jokes and 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.750
 funny conversations of characters so 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.170
 expect nolan's seriousness from her 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.170
 not worth 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.160
 after an unsuccessful chase so rock we 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.080
 back to the Batman cave which 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.360
 he is mesmerized by an alien ship 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.520
 through a telescope and we have to 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.980
 alfredo and robin stop the dark 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.840
 knight until he destroyed everything around with 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.430
 in terms of gameplay everything looks and 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.460
 played the same as in other games 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.920
 low tide collect Circuits solve puzzles 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.530
 play simple mini-game and of course 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.640
 We win bosses please thematic 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.920
 qcyber type inserts 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.690
 level olya country but only we manage 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.520
 stop batman how comes 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.290
 alarm signal for senior and tower 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.480
 justice leagues because green 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.610
 lantern and martian hunter notices 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.739
 unidentified ship approaching 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.300
 earth and while all heroes are concerned 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.020
 new challenges united team 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.360
 villains 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.010
 attacked by a live tower and captures over 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.930
 her control so we have to 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.910
 win her back and after 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.830
 space assault stations continue 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.520
 the fight with the enemy is to be in 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.650
 native walls 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.380
 you can switch characters by the way 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.560
 any time and they each have their own 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.200
 chips and forces we offer to apply on 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.390
 the skin itself or more precisely the plastic 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.770
 model the whole type of heroes and villains 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.780
 di di universe 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.180
 although most often the team will 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.519
 pair up cooperative 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.160
 passage is the main feature of games 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.680
 from the league however the feature is the same 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.770
 as well as the need since alone 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.930
 to pass these games is not a lesson 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.790
 Sima sad they think that this 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.130
 quite ururu so for all not 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.050
 speaks after defeating the camps and 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.880
 conquering the ship back to first 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.780
 the plan goes danger much more 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.850
 serious 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.860
 alien ship starts again 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.150
 act on our planet rushes 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.980
 reducing beam 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.170
 if not to do something near 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.720
 time the earth will become just another 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.580
 Exhibit in the collection of Brainiac here 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.040
 time for enemies to become friends now 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.590
 shoulder shoulder with recent enemies we 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.160
 We 're going to defeat a new enemy I think 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.680
 on this 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.930
 plot description may yes there already to this 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.720
 stage the monotony of the game is already 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.640
 too unbearable you anyway the game 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.950
 very little can entertain a player 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.050
 only funny dialogues okay 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.810
 the cooperative is essentially all the benefits 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.030
 This game has little to say about 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.400
 the graphics seem like the game could 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.520
 pull even without a pit so about any 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.040
 the beauty of speech does not go the same goes for 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.709
 plot as a whole story caricature 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.140
 for the second time however it goes great 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.880
 with the spirit of comics and normal in general 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.040
 many comedians have amazing stories 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.930
 much cooler than most games and 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.430
 century plot batman 3 not so impossible 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.730
 compare standard policy 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.040
 yes the old enmity of good and evil is interrupted 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.750
 because of the emergence of mighty power from space 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.540
 which can only be stopped 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.050
 jointly but never 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.050
 comic strip 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.770
 despite the comic basis here in any 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.740
 case there are no canonical images 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.270
 characters not spectacular scenes not depth 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.950
 stories and motives of actors 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.290
 so a small gathering does not 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.270
 redeem the shortcomings of the game and does not detract 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.950
 merits of comics well yes here I am 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.590
 I agree it is still another 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.600
 stamping cool which brings them 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.850
 very good money enviably 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.740
 by periodicity I would give this game 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.020
 honest 6 out of 10 points 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.180
 would recommend her either to children who 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.220
 Should you like it or just if 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.950
 you have nothing to play with friends or 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:27.130
 as a girl I would give 8 to my subscribers 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:28.870
 this had to taste and thank you to
