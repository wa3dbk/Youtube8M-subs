00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 I'm going to take a little break but 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.440
 I'm also going to have a drink, but what 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.230
 I will do it in a very special way 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.730
 that is, I am going to pay with nfc os 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.990
 commented on the first train news that 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.490
 in the army also in the part 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.320
 important of this mobile world congress 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.920
 to begin with I am accessing the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.690
 fair with my nfc smartphone so in 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.029
 all the bars of the fair are also 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.920
 can pay with nfc I will use a 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.750
 vodafone smartphone that has a 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.240
 agreement with visa to perform this type 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.210
 of payments a cocacola please I'll 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.969
 pay with nfc 0 and now I will pay with 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.430
 this seems to you since the 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.410
 weirdest ticket is wearing the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.440
 amount that are 230 already what I have to 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.790
 to do is to bring the smartphone closer 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.800
 a little cigarette and now he is telling us 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.800
 that we wait for the answer communicating 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.690
 and successful operation we have 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.190
 paid 230 and now our smartphone 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.780
 is vibrating and is saying that what 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.430
 we have paid clear as if 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.050
 paid with a credit card in the 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.030
 mall and current I got the ticket 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.550
 in which indicates the operation that I have 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.960
 accomplished 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.270
 surely many doubts will arise what 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.220
 happens if it turns out that when I want 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.480
 pay the smartphone is off then 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.190
 that nothing happens the chip is 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.230
 absolutely independent is to say that 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.210
 if you do not have coverage and you are going to access 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.980
 to the subway because this does not only have 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.840
 what is necessarily to pay in a 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.920
 bar but you can also buy a 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.960
 subway ticket 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.030
 if you do not have coverage, nothing happens 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.190
 you can pay exactly the same you can 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.490
 pay without coverage when it's off 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.040
 without battery at any time because 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.590
 the information on the nfc chip is here 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.670
 and will communicate with the tpv 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.410
 Exactly the same you have seen that no 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.020
 you need to put any kind of purpose neither 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.660
 sign anything because then because I have 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.640
 a limit of up to 20 euros according to visa 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.530
 to not have to put the pin then 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.270
 You can only customize me as you like to 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.880
 through an application that I have in the 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.340
 smartphone this device with lfc's 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.320
 vodafone that I have here is prepaid 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.570
 that is to say that here I was recharging a 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.009
 amount and I'm paying with respect to the 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.150
 amount that I have is to say that if you 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.070
 I lost my smartphone and it's been 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.509
 five euros will be spent as 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.550
 five euros but they are not going to spend 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.100
 none 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.950
 in the future you can also have it 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.780
 associated with a normal visa card or 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.700
 in the limit that you want the fact of 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.530
 that we have integrated nfc also we 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.630
 will in the future use it as 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.730
 Loyalty card as for example 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.100
 those that have the other airlines 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.830
 use could be to use it as a 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.020
 transport fertilizer is to use it for 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.670
 be able to access the subway or the bus 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.560
 when we can more or less have this 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.840
 type of services to be able to use them 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.490
 in a normal way , it depends a bit on 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.350
 the implementation of smartphones that 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.570
 include nfc and the sites that 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.880
 integrate but more or less is expected 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.920
 Vodafone expects mid-year 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.080
 that comes there is an important 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.360
 implementation and that more or less 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.860
 an average of people may already be 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.930
 I use, of course, to enter 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.930
 clips you can enter with and without the ff
