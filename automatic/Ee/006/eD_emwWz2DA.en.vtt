for<00:06:52.610> these<00:06:52.850> shorter<00:06:53.270> hurdles<00:06:53.770> I<00:06:54.770> think<00:06:55.340> just

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:55.940 
for these shorter hurdles I think just

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.820 
for these shorter hurdles I think just
watching<00:06:56.120> in<00:06:56.660> the<00:06:56.750> rounds<00:06:57.230> and<00:06:57.410> through<00:06:57.710> the

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:57.830 
watching in the rounds and through the

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.040 
watching in the rounds and through the
semifinals<00:06:58.490> I<00:06:58.610> think<00:06:58.820> these<00:06:58.940> taller<00:06:59.450> athletes

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.050 
semifinals I think these taller athletes

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.260 
semifinals I think these taller athletes
had<00:07:00.860> more<00:07:01.130> problems<00:07:01.400> with<00:07:01.820> the<00:07:01.940> shorter

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.270 
had more problems with the shorter

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.370 
had more problems with the shorter
hurdles<00:07:02.660> and<00:07:04.000> you<00:07:05.000> could<00:07:05.180> see<00:07:05.419> it<00:07:05.570> especially
