00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
with our pace here in the week we're a

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.959 
with our pace here in the week we're a
little<00:05:39.229> bit<00:05:39.349> slower<00:05:39.590> but<00:05:39.949> I<00:05:40.250> mean<00:05:40.819> you<00:05:40.879> were

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:40.969 
little bit slower but I mean you were

little bit slower but I mean you were
probably<00:05:41.090> a<00:05:41.270> little<00:05:41.330> bit<00:05:41.509> easier<00:05:41.599> on<00:05:41.870> tires

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
probably a little bit easier on tires

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.770 
probably a little bit easier on tires
and<00:05:43.580> that's<00:05:43.669> what<00:05:43.849> paid<00:05:44.060> off<00:05:44.240> you<00:05:44.539> know<00:05:44.629> the

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
and that's what paid off you know the

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.240 
and that's what paid off you know the
ties<00:05:44.960> are<00:05:45.169> lasted<00:05:45.530> and<00:05:45.680> would<00:05:45.830> come<00:05:45.949> over<00:05:46.099> the

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
ties are lasted and would come over the

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.969 
ties are lasted and would come over the
one<00:05:46.340> Daniel<00:05:47.120> it<00:05:47.810> was<00:05:47.840> a<00:05:47.990> great<00:05:48.259> race<00:05:48.469> I<00:05:48.650> mean<00:05:48.800> I

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
one Daniel it was a great race I mean I

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:50.230 
one Daniel it was a great race I mean I
really<00:05:49.310> thought<00:05:49.550> that<00:05:49.699> he<00:05:49.759> were<00:05:49.879> gonna<00:05:50.000> be

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
really thought that he were gonna be

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.059 
really thought that he were gonna be
able<00:05:50.330> to<00:05:50.479> hold<00:05:50.599> him<00:05:50.779> out<00:05:50.900> I<00:05:51.229> thought<00:05:51.860> I<00:05:51.889> was

00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:52.069 
able to hold him out I thought I was

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:53.529 
able to hold him out I thought I was
going<00:05:52.219> to<00:05:52.430> as<00:05:52.520> well<00:05:52.699> and<00:05:52.879> then<00:05:52.969> looked<00:05:53.479> down
