00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
this as you can see up here was pretty

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.260

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.100 
be no problem considering it's just
three<00:01:32.310> pieces<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:33.030> there's<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.420> base<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
three pieces so there's the base the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.319 
three pieces so there's the base the
figure<00:01:34.409> connects<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:35.040> something<00:01:35.909> like<00:01:36.270> that

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
figure connects on something like that

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.510 
figure connects on something like that
then<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.229> cable<00:01:37.409> connects<00:01:37.920> into<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.310> base

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
then the cable connects into the base

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.080 
then the cable connects into the base
down<00:01:39.119> here<00:01:39.720> then<00:01:40.110> into<00:01:40.470> our<00:01:40.590> back<00:01:40.979> up<00:01:41.310> here<00:01:41.850> and

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
down here then into our back up here and

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.450 
down here then into our back up here and
there<00:01:42.390> she<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.630> all<00:01:42.869> assembled<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.860> they're<00:01:44.310> a

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
there she is all assembled and they're a

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.399 
there she is all assembled and they're a
quick<00:01:44.670> size<00:01:44.970> comparison<00:01:45.000> against<00:01:45.990> Good<00:01:46.170> Smile

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
quick size comparison against Good Smile

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.889 
quick size comparison against Good Smile
company's<00:01:46.860> 1/8<00:01:47.399> scale<00:01:47.610> wool<00:01:48.060> clasp<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.750> as

company's 1/8 scale wool clasp and as

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.359 
company's 1/8 scale wool clasp and as
you<00:01:49.049> can<00:01:49.170> see<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.409> battleship<00:01:49.829> princess<00:01:50.220> is

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
you can see the battleship princess is

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.969 
you can see the battleship princess is
quite<00:01:50.759> small<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.360> comparison<00:01:51.619> so<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.860> it

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
quite small in comparison so that is it

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.620 
quite small in comparison so that is it
for<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.220> unboxing<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.119> was<00:01:54.360> much

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
for the unboxing and that was much

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.660 
for the unboxing and that was much
quicker<00:01:54.930> than<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.380> thought<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.680> would<00:01:55.770> be<00:01:55.920> 4,000

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
quicker than I thought it would be 4,000

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.819 
quicker than I thought it would be 4,000
yen<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.360> definitely<00:01:57.840> an<00:01:58.259> awesome<00:01:58.380> figure
