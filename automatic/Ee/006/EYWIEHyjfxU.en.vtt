00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.330
 hello everyone we are on paris 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.190
 turf tv for our daily received five 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.110
 on five by my side sébastien piazza 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.580
 hello sebastien hello florent so 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.049
 apart from that of a very beautiful 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.210
 neighborhood that opposes 18 age competitors 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.260
 on the course said classic 2700 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.520
 meters of the great track an epoch 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.970
 very interesting but relatively 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.189
 opened 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.390
 we had the opportunity to talk about it together 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.019
 both what is Sebastian 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.210
 you can tell us 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.820
 a very interesting event to follow 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.619
 difficult to decipher and even more 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.780
 maybe to play will start with your 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.340
 henrichon selection with head 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.020
 displayed with the sup four hours number 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.300
 bouffey were mostly opposed 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.579
 number six needs green on the 14th 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.219
 except laden the number 15 is attractive 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.890
 phu tho the 9th of July the xiii was of 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.260
 China the number 16 she.w feydeau and in 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.239
 eighth position on 11/9 air title del 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.280
 rio so you decided to break into 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.539
 head of your selection the wall capsule 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.129
 of taste did away the art of the family 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.809
 verva kneaded with qualities she remains 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.859
 tricky but can you 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.270
 tell us you expect a great 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.600
 performance on his part for his return to 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.579
 vincennes 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.290
 exactly he stays on two 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.670
 disqualifications but she finds her 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.080
 course of predilection we will see him again 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.460
 on track for the occasion of 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.439
 one of these two last 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.240
 disqualification after investigation you 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.530
 can see it on these pictures she 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.479
 commits the irreparable 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.340
 around the pole is a 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.020
 little bit in gaits struck what 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.939
 earned him a disqualification from the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.729
 first place after investigation what has 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.310
 took advantage she.w feydeau a mare who 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.540
 remains in any case very very talented and who 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.280
 in this category has largely the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.990
 ways to get on the highest 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.579
 walk of the podium that's why we 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.030
 made our favorite from this 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.979
 test 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.600
 we can say it will certainly be 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.850
 all or nothing with the partner of 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.890
 stone is exactly wanted to oppose everything 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.659
 first the wholesaler of the grinder rsa 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.920
 as winner of stage gnt in Nantes 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.430
 already associated with pierre lévesque 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.920
 here he was 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.800
 déferré later for this occasion 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.570
 there on Monday he will be deferré of the four 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.640
 feet he finds the great track a 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.950
 competitor that it is necessary '' a priori and 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.330
 preserve hard mixed race the finish 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.160
 quickly his races elsewhere we saw him at 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.870
 nantes when they were ahead of united bac 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.570
 on a regular basis we are entitled 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.650
 obviously to wait for his share a very 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.090
 very nice performance 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.830
 that's why we 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.360
 we put him in the lead behind ursula of 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.680
 bouffey agree a competitor who was 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.900
 eliminated we know Saturday in the 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.800
 coveted Brittany price is to say the 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.870
 great form that currently holds 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.180
 besides our colleague arnaud lecomte 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:45.400
 met Patrick Thery for our 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:46.600
 myth of the rare as confirmed 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.550
 Patrick Thery a very open event 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.930
 since his competitor according to him can 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.160
 finish and does as well on the most 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.570
 up the podium or finish 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.489
 fifth is the course that will make the 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.170
 difference so we repeat a test 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.970
 very open but very interesting in 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.310
 third Sebastian position you have 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.959
 placed the 14 terminal m genuine 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.370
 metronome that has been disqualified 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.030
 recently to nantes while she was rendering 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.610
 25 meters 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.380
 the green the rather scavenging track did 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.110
 certainly not served the interests of 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.670
 this mare of quality which finds the 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.950
 2007 of the big track 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.650
 when we do the analysis of this test 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.750
 it is necessary to retain the water in 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.459
 any case of a selection 7 matching 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.530
 this mare the part she can 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.510
 win she can finish 4th 5th is 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.130
 mounted on the podium everything is possible 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.870
 with it while still reporting 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.760
 that it is a wait-and-see and that it is 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.530
 able to finish very quickly 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.459
 yes it's safe when all cases especially 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.019
 by the condemned on his last 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.519
 disqualification as you said 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.200
 because previously has meanwhile outstripped 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.750
 especially some va bellino the laureate 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.430
 of the criterium of 5 years then you have 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.510
 placed on 15 6 12 years ago ago 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.980
 now several courses in the 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.480
 legs and who will be straightened out of the four 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.769
 feet for the occasion we have seen it 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.209
 very very well of course defend the winter 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.579
 last on the 2100 meters of the great 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.819
 track where he won two races on 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.200
 the 2700 meters he is also capable 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.969
 to do well a competitor who like 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.099
 practice the race in the lead he will 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:00.030
 unchained for the occasion he goes 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.709
 definitely go very far 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.810
 can he win he can win 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.670
 but we preferred to place it a bit more 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.379
 far in our selection we see it 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.609
 more for a fourth for a 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.749
 nice fifth place we feel that it is 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.980
 a little the race aimed at the ceiling of 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:12.870
 earnest charles winnings will certainly 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.519
 come in trust and in fifth 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.750
 position you will go from new line 2 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.639
 who had shone twice in the winter 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.049
 last and marcel associated with the very 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.579
 skillful youki blocking 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.539
 yes it's a little bit the originality of 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.979
 this selection with some 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.660
 competitors who won in France she 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.449
 ran twice twice vincennes and 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.880
 he won on 2100 and over 2800 m a 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.440
 trotter who has recently passed 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.449
 time under the responsibility of the very 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.190
 clever yoakim their seeds that do not get 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.840
 move in France and to rare 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.570
 exceptions and always wisely 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.280
 that's why this new line is 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.289
 likely to pull his 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.050
 pin of the game a rating that should be 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.190
 rather speculative then add on 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.780
 your new line tickets and who can do 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.340
 show a nice rating the arrival 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.590
 after sébastien so we can repeat it 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.849
 a very interesting event that we 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.259
 the possibilities are numerous 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:56.880
 will have to make the right choices then 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.560
 to perform your games the course can 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.669
 certainly the difference and then they 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.030
 also follow the hits before 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:01.740
 race 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.690
 you can follow including on equidia 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.000
 it can be quite a lot 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.349
 of importance yes that's for sure so we see 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.419
 what is you Sebastian with the reminder of 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:11.789
 your selection is your game concept 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:14.370
 cantalou you can find us with 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:16.139
 a quinté disputed Tuesday at saint cloud the 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.849
 coveted price of breeding thank you 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.849
 Sebastian a good game everyone played at all
