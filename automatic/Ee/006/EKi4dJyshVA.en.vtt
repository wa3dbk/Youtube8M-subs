00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
beret on glass

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.240 
beret on glass
first<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.599> all<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:28.019> beret<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.820> dance<00:00:30.179> form<00:00:30.630> in

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
first of all a beret is a dance form in

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.330 
first of all a beret is a dance form in
French<00:00:32.250> origin<00:00:32.910> typically<00:00:33.510> which<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:35.250> a

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
French origin typically which is in a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.119 
French origin typically which is in a
quick<00:00:35.610> double<00:00:36.329> time<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:37.020> which<00:00:37.739> has<00:00:37.980> an

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
quick double time and which has an

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.970 
quick double time and which has an
emphasis<00:00:38.430> on<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:39.090> upbeat<00:00:39.870> or<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.440> anacrusis

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
emphasis on the upbeat or the anacrusis

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.200 
emphasis on the upbeat or the anacrusis
and<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:42.300> in<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.629> Bach<00:00:42.899> bourree<00:00:43.710> we<00:00:44.610> have<00:00:44.850> that

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
and so in the Bach bourree we have that

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.450 
and so in the Bach bourree we have that
upbeat<00:00:47.300> that's<00:00:48.300> haha<00:00:49.200> that's<00:00:49.649> our<00:00:49.800> upbeat<00:00:50.219> and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
upbeat that's haha that's our upbeat and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.209 
upbeat that's haha that's our upbeat and
that<00:00:51.180> gives<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:52.020> liveliness<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
that gives the liveliness and the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.240 
that gives the liveliness and the
forward<00:00:53.750> motion<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.530> quality<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
forward motion to the quality of the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.170 
forward motion to the quality of the
beret<00:00:56.750> now<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:58.710> particular<00:00:59.039> bourree<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.120> a

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
beret now this particular bourree is a

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.080 
beret now this particular bourree is a
blu-ray<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.350> glass<00:01:01.890> which<00:01:02.370> means<00:01:02.640> it's<00:01:02.910> an

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
blu-ray on glass which means it's an

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.990 
blu-ray on glass which means it's an
english<00:01:03.899> bourree<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.700> little<00:01:05.820> bit

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
english bourree so it's a little bit

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.670 
english bourree so it's a little bit
different<00:01:06.330> from<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.630> French<00:01:06.930> beret<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
different from the French beret the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.640 
different from the French beret the
English<00:01:08.400> bourree<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.780> more<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:11.240> heavy

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
English bourree is more of a heavy

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.340 
English bourree is more of a heavy
peasant<00:01:13.650> dance<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:15.360> really<00:01:15.900> like<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.080> keep

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
peasant dance and I really like to keep

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.520 
peasant dance and I really like to keep
that<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.770> mind<00:01:17.159> as<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:18.240> character<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
that in mind as the character of the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.020 
that in mind as the character of the
movement<00:01:19.920> when<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.070> approach<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.790> piece

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
movement when I approach this piece

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.710 
movement when I approach this piece
because<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.320> want<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.280> emphasize<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
because you want to emphasize that the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.340 
because you want to emphasize that the
heaviness<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.920> have<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.369> anacrusis<00:01:27.360> but<00:01:28.259> at

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
heaviness you have the anacrusis but at

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.480 
heaviness you have the anacrusis but at
the<00:01:28.439> same<00:01:28.590> time<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.920> also<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
the same time you also have the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.969 
the same time you also have the
heaviness<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.360> downbeat<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.740> there's<00:01:31.920> a

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
heaviness of the downbeat so there's a

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.859 
heaviness of the downbeat so there's a
little<00:01:32.100> bit<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.340> interplay<00:01:32.970> between<00:01:33.270> those

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
little bit of interplay between those

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.020 
little bit of interplay between those
two<00:01:34.170> elements<00:01:34.549> now<00:01:35.549> there<00:01:35.729> are<00:01:35.850> some

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
two elements now there are some

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.990 
two elements now there are some
excellent<00:01:36.450> videos<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.470> can<00:01:37.619> watch<00:01:38.000> that

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
excellent videos that you can watch that

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.030 
excellent videos that you can watch that
talk<00:01:39.360> about<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.810> particular<00:01:40.140> movement<00:01:40.590> and

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040

teaching videos on this piece as well so
I'll<00:01:48.899> try<00:01:49.049> not<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.259> repeat<00:01:49.500> what<00:01:49.950> he<00:01:50.220> says<00:01:50.869> but

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
I'll try not to repeat what he says but

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.859 
I'll try not to repeat what he says but
I<00:01:51.899> also<00:01:52.140> suggest<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.280> watch<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:54.030> video

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
I also suggest that you watch a video

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.340 
I also suggest that you watch a video
that<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.740> manual<00:01:56.280> power<00:01:56.640> made<00:01:57.540> where<00:01:57.869> he<00:01:58.049> talks

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
that a manual power made where he talks

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.069 
that a manual power made where he talks
about<00:01:58.590> his<00:01:59.549> recording<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.540> he<00:02:00.659> made<00:02:00.840> of

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
about his recording that he made of

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.920 
about his recording that he made of
Bach's<00:02:01.380> sonatas<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:02.509> it's<00:02:03.509> an<00:02:03.719> interesting

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
Bach's sonatas and it's an interesting

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.929 
Bach's sonatas and it's an interesting
recording<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.649> think<00:02:04.829> it's<00:02:04.979> on<00:02:05.159> YouTube<00:02:05.759> under

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
recording I think it's on YouTube under

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.960 
recording I think it's on YouTube under
EMI<00:02:06.540> classics<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:07.700> first<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.819> all<00:02:08.910> he

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
EMI classics and first of all he

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.380 
EMI classics and first of all he
discusses<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.790> Bach<00:02:11.790> partita

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
discusses the Bach partita

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.080 
discusses the Bach partita
being<00:02:13.569> written<00:02:13.810> in<00:02:14.140> much<00:02:14.440> more<00:02:14.860> of<00:02:15.160> a<00:02:15.610> style

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
being written in much more of a style

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.800 
being written in much more of a style
similar<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:17.709> when<00:02:17.890> Bach<00:02:18.220> writes<00:02:18.940> for<00:02:19.360> string

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
similar to when Bach writes for string

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.949 
similar to when Bach writes for string
instruments<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:20.940> compares<00:02:21.940> this<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.480> the

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
instruments and compares this to the

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.220 
instruments and compares this to the
cello<00:02:23.860> suites<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.300> solo

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
cello suites and to the solo

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.820 
cello suites and to the solo
unaccompanied<00:02:26.860> violin<00:02:27.700> partita<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:29.260> I

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
unaccompanied violin partita and I

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.920 
unaccompanied violin partita and I
happen<00:02:30.580> to<00:02:30.610> agree<00:02:30.820> with<00:02:31.150> him<00:02:31.300> on<00:02:31.480> that<00:02:31.540> I

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
happen to agree with him on that I

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.880 
happen to agree with him on that I
absolutely<00:02:32.709> feel<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:33.750> idiomatically<00:02:34.890> this

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890

different movements in the flute partita
I'm<00:02:47.290> trying<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:48.010> imitate<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.880> sound<00:02:48.910> of<00:02:49.330> a

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
I'm trying to imitate the sound of a

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.960 
I'm trying to imitate the sound of a
cello<00:02:49.690> or<00:02:49.989> imitate<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.830> sound<00:02:51.100> of<00:02:51.370> a<00:02:51.459> violin

but<00:02:52.690> there's<00:02:52.870> something<00:02:53.080> else<00:02:53.170> that<00:02:53.470> Pao<00:02:53.800> says

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
but there's something else that Pao says

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.009 
but there's something else that Pao says
in<00:02:54.519> that<00:02:54.880> interview<00:02:55.420> which<00:02:55.570> I<00:02:55.690> thought<00:02:55.900> was

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
in that interview which I thought was

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.790 
in that interview which I thought was
really<00:02:56.080> interesting<00:02:56.890> and<00:02:57.040> he<00:02:57.220> says<00:02:57.519> that<00:02:57.850> his

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
really interesting and he says that his

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.690 
really interesting and he says that his
work<00:02:59.800> in<00:03:00.070> jazz<00:03:01.410> informed<00:03:02.410> his<00:03:02.950> approach<00:03:03.400> to

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
work in jazz informed his approach to

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.550 
work in jazz informed his approach to
playing<00:03:04.030> Bach<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.780> that's<00:03:05.290> not<00:03:05.440> something

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
playing Bach and that's not something

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.390 
playing Bach and that's not something
you<00:03:05.739> hear<00:03:05.950> too<00:03:06.160> often<00:03:06.900> so<00:03:07.900> I<00:03:08.230> was<00:03:09.010> listening<00:03:09.370> to

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
you hear too often so I was listening to

you hear too often so I was listening to
what<00:03:09.610> he<00:03:09.640> said<00:03:09.940> about<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.510> idea<00:03:10.840> of

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
what he said about the idea of

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.050 
what he said about the idea of
improvisation<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.220> how<00:03:12.670> Baroque<00:03:13.030> music

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
improvisation and how Baroque music

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.840 
improvisation and how Baroque music
relied<00:03:13.989> on<00:03:14.019> improvisation<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:15.070> I<00:03:15.190> really

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
relied on improvisation and I really

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.090 
relied on improvisation and I really
agree<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:16.750> I<00:03:17.080> think<00:03:17.320> it's<00:03:17.470> an<00:03:17.590> interesting

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
agree and I think it's an interesting

element that he points out there that

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.640 
element that he points out there that
there's<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.579> improv<00:03:22.329> is<00:03:22.450> atari<00:03:22.810> feeling<00:03:23.440> in

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
it's often said that it's not really a
