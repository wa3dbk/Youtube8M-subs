I believe when they first came out this

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.470 
I believe when they first came out this
physics<00:03:17.380> so<00:03:18.010> we<00:03:18.100> just<00:03:18.220> got<00:03:18.400> this<00:03:18.550> in<00:03:18.610> this<00:03:19.330> is

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
physics so we just got this in this is

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.020
