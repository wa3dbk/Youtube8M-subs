00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.010
 hello everyone today we will change 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.170
 larva 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.220
 on you classics for that to us 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.030
 need to remove 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.279
 door 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.630
 mouth or skin as it is called 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.349
 to take it off 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.390
 we need to unscrew this pimp 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:28.500
 unscrew the three bolts on the handle 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:34.530
 directly remove this cap 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:37.860
 remove the handle from the door handle 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.000
 window so well here 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.770
 there everything is already kept on the caps 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.960
 This already hands on themselves tugging on either 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.879
 do something to tidy them 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.420
 take off but usually they break 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.699
 so buy new ones in advance so as not to 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.980
 rattled nothing there were problems here 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:02.789
 so so here we removed the trim here it is ours 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.330
 lock meaning here what is this bracket 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.890
 which stands near the door 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.659
 that is, here it is she must up 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.270
 any screwdriver or pliers 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.720
 get out of here pull it like 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.960
 fixes our lock but this traction 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.560
 we just need to make a ball to 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.759
 extract 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.149
 extract our castle and the animals here we took off 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.509
 our fixer as you can see and now 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.299
 move the lock out with a simple movement 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.680
 and shoot 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:41.659
 so here I am 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.359
 our door lock is all in reverse 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:49.890
 it remains only to lock the lock down 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:54.509
 traction dressed everything works but now 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:59.700
 left to assemble the door to put the trim 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:03.920
 pens well and the like with all thanks 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.920
 I hope someone will be useful for now
