00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.250
 bring you the best games 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:17.699

 totally gas for android normally 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.400
 are heavy games or not but in 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.660
 Most often are heavy games to 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.179
 Do you have a little more device? 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.990
 simple that does not wheel is game are 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.969
 heavy 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.750
 I have another channel series that is 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.160
 are the simplest games that have 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.910
 most appliances then you can 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.670
 take a look 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.280
 also in other series is come on the 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.730
 Today's first game is the dragon 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.879
 warcraft was in a play here is a game 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.520
 so it does not have super graphics but it is 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.399
 a game well done is I like to show 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.789
 games that the producer actually 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.719
 invests does something well done with a 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:04.290
 cool graphic 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.930
 track sound a nice soundtrack 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.430
 Okay, so come on, do not continue here, okay? 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.340
 basically what you have to do is 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.760
 Defend this castle is the graph it 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.729
 It's who 2d but it's pretty cute, I like it 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.970
 last very well done is you use that 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.939
 this gun 10 so mark york date flash 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.390
 but ultimately they were meant to protect the 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.220
 tower and I have some powers to 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.770
 able to defend the tower is also 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.979
 making a castle in case that 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.040
 Meteor is letting the enemies get in 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.060
 a good meteor game that you see playing 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.990
 on here 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.420
 Ok, you're going to play, you're going to win. 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.770
 money to be able to buy new items 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.990
 new skills 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.610
 I have here those warriors that I 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.720
 I can put in front of the castle to 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.720
 protect the castle 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.969
 I can put more than 2 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.189
 and as time goes by, the more time 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.229
 an enemy coming more monsters 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.259
 monsters are coming and you have to 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.649
 protect the castle here is someone well 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:10.560
 cool fun, really, it's with a car 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.700
 Beautiful, I liked the look here. 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.650
 of the game 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:20.420
 I think it 's worth downloading then 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:23.989
 let the next game the next game is the 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.569
 deficit is a game says unb 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.870
 There's a lot that I'm going to get on google. 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.030
 play and much that he himself but some 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.819
 They are very bad and others are legal. 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.840
 This one is one of the cool ones I found. 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:44.030
 fun gives a graphic is is very simple 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:46.850
 actually in 2d different had not 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.360
 seen a game in style is the cartoon 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:53.420
 My pretty face is very different. 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.590
 out of it I thought it was a rock 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.900
 very cool 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.150
 usually it's not rock that kind of 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.690
 game he puts other soundtracks 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.870
 so really cool effects of 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.209
 explosion well done there and sound effects 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.500
 also well made so a very 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:14.180
 good even if it's when you start with 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.269
 audience begins with this line in tosca 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.459
 and as the game will make money 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.170
 on top of the money is winning 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.690
 won in the case 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.680
 Can you buy another this is the weapon? 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:30.880
 and with a pass to the stage you can 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.170
 catch him on the ground to improve alone 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.370
 have improved to develop their life 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:40.250
 up here now I died and squeezed 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.799
 here I can change arms is in the case 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:48.040
 I got a machine gun with mac 10 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:51.530
 and here I get a cox is a pistol 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.220
 Shooting you do not destroy to climb a 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.780
 once only 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.739
 you will start but part of the 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:00.530
 what to do because it is eliminate by 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:03.709
 complete 10 so it's so very different 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.019
 the game is well run fast and well 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.420
 fun even i liked it 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:12.500
 so I recommend it to you so good 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:16.280
 for the last game of today the last game 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:22.240
 of today is the guingamp channels is a game 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:25.900
 well done well it is developed in 3d 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.960
 m2 of eta is platform here are the phases 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.759
 lb to the fourth phase for now I'm going 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.729
 choose the fourth phase 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:36.400
 the platform game as you go 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:38.620
 passing and the phases it goes is te 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.110
 showing some tutorials the first 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.610
 This trial taught that how to jump and such 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.410
 and coins 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.630
 the second of the real he taught me how 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.880
 destroy these enemies here in a case 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.569
 that these roosters pa 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:56.050
 here you jump command're here and you give 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:59.830
 more to the next and have a 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:03.729
 ability to release in the game is the 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:06.400
 shield is to protect against enemies and 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:09.009
 to protect from fire of this type of 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.830
 It's like this at the beginning. The game is well. 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:13.690
 easy does not have many obstacles but 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.960
 as goes by stage business is 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.069
 difficult and so this is a very good game 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.130
 same 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:23.500
 I even wondered when I threw it through the 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.690
 first time because this level of 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.090
 quality you find paid games 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.520
 What is a totally free game for? 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.830
 I think it's really worth doing. 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:39.159
 download this game is a graphic 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:41.650
 3d is very good and I think it really is 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:43.539
 a game to have there on your device 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:47.530
 with android 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:52.030
 Ok, guys, these were the three games. 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:54.490
 of today remembering that there in the page 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.740
 about the channel you have the agenda is if you 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:00.729
 You do not know which videos out during 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:03.550
 You take a look at the calendar. 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:06.190
 I'm going to leave the link for today's games in 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:09.460

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.810
 so if you can download it through 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.060
 computer then there it is 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.880
