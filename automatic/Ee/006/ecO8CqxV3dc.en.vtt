simple mistake if Cambridge Poland is by

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.100 
simple mistake if Cambridge Poland is by
far<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.340> largest<00:02:55.670> of<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.390> new<00:02:56.600> member<00:02:57.080> states

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
far the largest of the new member states

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.990 
far the largest of the new member states
of<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.590> European<00:02:58.160> Union<00:02:58.190> so<00:02:58.790> it's<00:02:58.910> an

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
of the European Union so it's an

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.430 
of the European Union so it's an
important<00:02:59.390> market<00:02:59.720> for<00:03:00.020> the<00:03:00.140> United<00:03:00.410> Kingdom

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
important market for the United Kingdom

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.190 
important market for the United Kingdom
going<00:03:00.920> forward<00:03:01.250> secondly<00:03:01.850> it's<00:03:02.200> geostrategic

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
going forward secondly it's geostrategic

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.810 
going forward secondly it's geostrategic
significance<00:03:04.190> and<00:03:04.370> that's<00:03:04.520> become

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
significance and that's become

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.670 
significance and that's become
increasingly<00:03:04.850> clear<00:03:05.750> over<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.260> last<00:03:06.410> few

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
increasingly clear over the last few

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.470 
increasingly clear over the last few
years<00:03:06.740> so<00:03:07.250> that's<00:03:07.370> why<00:03:07.640> I<00:03:07.670> think<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.150> study<00:03:08.390> of

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
years so that's why I think the study of

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.590 
years so that's why I think the study of
Poland<00:03:08.990> is<00:03:09.650> particularly<00:03:10.510> important<00:03:11.510> Britain

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
Poland is particularly important Britain

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.910 
Poland is particularly important Britain
besides<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:14.780> fact<00:03:14.959> that<00:03:15.110> it's<00:03:15.560> a<00:03:15.709> fascinating

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
besides the fact that it's a fascinating

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:27.190 
besides the fact that it's a fascinating
subject<00:03:16.730> worthy<00:03:17.480> of<00:03:17.780> study<00:03:18.020> in<00:03:19.010> itself<00:03:26.200> don't

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
subject worthy of study in itself don't

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.280 
subject worthy of study in itself don't
know<00:03:27.260> anything<00:03:27.530> about<00:03:27.620> their<00:03:28.090> free<00:03:29.090> open<00:03:29.450> eyes

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.970 

it's<00:03:33.290> been<00:03:33.470> so<00:03:33.590> much<00:03:33.680> fun

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
it's been so much fun

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.350 
it's been so much fun
pending<00:03:34.310> into<00:03:34.489> like<00:03:34.580> history<00:03:35.030> you've<00:03:35.180> never
