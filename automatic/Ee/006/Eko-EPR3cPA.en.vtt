these plants they want to produce seeds

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.850 
these plants they want to produce seeds
that's<00:00:51.310> how<00:00:51.550> they<00:00:51.760> reproduce<00:00:52.150> by<00:00:52.860> deadheading

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
that's how they reproduce by deadheading

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.460 
that's how they reproduce by deadheading
the<00:00:54.040> old<00:00:54.190> flowers<00:00:54.910> we<00:00:55.690> prevent<00:00:56.200> them<00:00:56.410> from

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
the old flowers we prevent them from

the old flowers we prevent them from
going<00:00:57.040> to<00:00:57.280> seed<00:00:57.580> and<00:00:57.910> that<00:00:58.690> forces<00:00:59.320> them<00:00:59.470> to

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
going to seed and that forces them to

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.280 
going to seed and that forces them to
try<00:01:00.190> again<00:01:00.400> so<00:01:01.150> they'll<00:01:01.390> keep<00:01:01.630> budding<00:01:02.140> and

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
try again so they'll keep budding and

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.460 
try again so they'll keep budding and
making<00:01:02.710> flowers<00:01:03.280> most<00:01:04.239> plants<00:01:04.839> in<00:01:04.960> the

can see most of its flowers have seen
better<00:02:16.239> days<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:17.560> it's<00:02:17.739> about<00:02:17.920> time<00:02:18.250> for<00:02:18.280> some

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.050 
back and remove all these dead flowers
and<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:56.349> plant<00:02:56.650> will<00:02:56.860> look<00:02:57.040> great<00:02:57.340> again<00:02:57.730> and

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
and the plant will look great again and

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.750 
and the plant will look great again and
in<00:02:58.180> time<00:02:58.480> it<00:02:58.810> will<00:02:58.959> continue<00:02:59.620> to<00:02:59.860> bloom

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
in time it will continue to bloom

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.550 
in time it will continue to bloom
because<00:03:01.150> there<00:03:01.329> are<00:03:01.480> buds<00:03:01.810> down<00:03:02.170> there

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560

salvia we get a lot of questions about

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.589 
salvia we get a lot of questions about
salvia<00:03:09.370> because<00:03:09.610> we<00:03:09.760> have<00:03:09.910> some<00:03:10.090> beautiful

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
salvia because we have some beautiful

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.020

called East Friesland and the same idea
holds<00:03:18.819> what<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.150> salvia<00:03:19.690> is<00:03:19.750> although<00:03:20.620> on
