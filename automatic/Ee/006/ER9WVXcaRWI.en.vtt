end Nintendo did bring a bound to do Wii
U<00:02:42.970> and<00:02:44.860> least<00:02:45.860> in<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.070> process<00:02:46.459> of<00:02:46.610> trying<00:02:46.820> to

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
U and least in the process of trying to

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.360 
U and least in the process of trying to
bring<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.239> bound<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:47.780> in<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.650> Virtual<00:02:49.010> Console

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
bring a bound and in the Virtual Console

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:56.259 
bring a bound and in the Virtual Console
so<00:02:51.880> hopefully<00:02:53.080> by<00:02:54.080> doing<00:02:54.410> all<00:02:54.560> this<00:02:54.970> we<00:02:55.970> might

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
so hopefully by doing all this we might

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.880 
so hopefully by doing all this we might
end<00:02:56.800> up<00:02:57.800> removing<00:02:58.580> all<00:02:58.910> of<00:02:59.120> these<00:02:59.709> region<00:03:00.709> lock

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
policies because all of these regional

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.940 
policies because all of these regional
policies<00:03:03.620> are<00:03:03.800> anti<00:03:04.069> consumer<00:03:04.580> and<00:03:04.850> since<00:03:05.269> the

the<00:03:08.959> next-gen<00:03:09.319> console<00:03:09.739> has<00:03:10.280> free<00:03:10.459> movies<00:03:10.790> DRM

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
policy making in region free it now so

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.370 
policy making in region free it now so
and<00:03:17.450> now<00:03:17.690> it<00:03:17.870> leaves<00:03:18.079> Nintendo<00:03:18.560> with<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:18.829> only

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380
