this<00:04:15.260> one<00:04:15.470> drop<00:04:15.860> down<00:04:16.040> here<00:04:16.280> which<00:04:16.430> is

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:16.520 
this one drop down here which is

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.800 
this one drop down here which is
starting<00:04:17.180> convenient<00:04:18.640> the<00:04:19.640> stereo<00:04:20.030> itself<00:04:20.419> is

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
starting convenient the stereo itself is

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.450 
starting convenient the stereo itself is
really<00:04:21.200> nicely<00:04:21.440> laid<00:04:21.739> out<00:04:21.950> it's<00:04:22.070> got<00:04:22.130> a<00:04:22.190> very

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
really nicely laid out it's got a very

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.980 
really nicely laid out it's got a very
very<00:04:22.520> good<00:04:22.760> sound<00:04:23.150> system<00:04:23.240> I<00:04:23.540> think<00:04:23.570> this<00:04:23.780> has

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
very good sound system I think this has

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.540 
very good sound system I think this has
got<00:04:24.080> a<00:04:24.140> standard<00:04:24.620> cell<00:04:24.830> system<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.280> be<00:04:25.340> honest

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
got a standard cell system to be honest

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.510 
got a standard cell system to be honest
but<00:04:25.820> it<00:04:26.540> does<00:04:26.690> sound<00:04:26.810> very<00:04:27.050> good<00:04:27.110> is<00:04:28.100> more<00:04:28.400> than

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
but it does sound very good is more than

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.120 
but it does sound very good is more than
adequate<00:04:28.640> for<00:04:28.970> just<00:04:29.270> general<00:04:29.450> usage<00:04:30.040> again<00:04:31.040> if

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
adequate for just general usage again if

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.220 
adequate for just general usage again if
you<00:04:31.220> hold<00:04:31.400> this<00:04:31.490> button<00:04:31.669> down<00:04:32.000> you'll<00:04:32.870> see

you hold this button down you'll see

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.310 
you hold this button down you'll see
that<00:04:33.970> it<00:04:34.970> flips<00:04:35.180> down<00:04:35.419> and<00:04:35.690> closes<00:04:36.080> and<00:04:36.290> that

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
that it flips down and closes and that

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.750 
that it flips down and closes and that
does<00:04:36.560> that<00:04:36.680> automatically<00:04:37.250> as<00:04:37.370> well<00:04:37.520> when<00:04:37.669> you

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760
