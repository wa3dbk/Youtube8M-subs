00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.320
 Hi everyone, I'm a chef in the kitchen. 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.210
 And today, let's talk about 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.730
 spiral massager 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.130
 it was developed to knead pasta 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.960
 heavy in large quantities 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.570
 It can also be used as a 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.550
 mixer fillings to give 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.360
 uniformity of mixtures 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.359
 we have models for 25 and 40 kilos of 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.789
 Massive attention to all equipment 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:43.559
 Venancio comes with instruction manual 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:45.780
 It is very important that you 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.730
 reading the manual before starting the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.839
 installation and operation of your 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.339
 equipment 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.010
 the electrical installation of your 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:57.600
 establishment must meet the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.149
 specifications of ordinance 3214 nr10 of 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.510
 Ministry of Labor, all taken 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.850
 They must be connected to the next protection 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.140
 machine is manufactured in accordance with the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.479
 requirements of ordinance 197 nr12 of 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.899
 the Ministry of Labor and also the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.360
 porter 371 that deal with the 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.579
 security requirements after reading 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.649
 The first step in the manual is to identify 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:26.610
 if the attention of your equipment is 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:28.500
 single phase 220 volts three phase 220 or 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.469
 380 volts 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.229
 in the case of single-phase machines both 25 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:35.610
 about 40 pounds may have one or two 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.399
 speeds 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.350
 in the case of three-phase machines both 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.939
 versions will always be with two 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.369
 speeds 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.560
 you can ask your electrician to 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.939
 do the installation of a stec outlet 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.609
 how are you doing 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.680
 Once installed you can now 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:54.990
 equipment operation 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.219
 this is the general key that will emphasize 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.320
 machine 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.689
 the buttons on the control panel are 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.359
 According to standard nr 12 they are the 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.679
 emergency button that when activated 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:06.679
 button and now the machine 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.530
 never use the 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.330
 emergency to switch off the machine uses 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.530
 only in a real situation of 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.120
 emergency 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.310
 in case you have machine stop 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.380
 using the emergency button 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.010
 procedure to restart the cycle is 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.290
 this work the emergency button 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.380

 button switches on for your safety beyond 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.420
 control panel the machine has 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.180
 also a mobile protection that turns off the 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.590
 equipment whenever it is opened 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.590
 now we go to work 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.739
 we first put solid products 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.920
 in the pot 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.840
 we set the speed of the machine to 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.800
 initiate the process preferably in the 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.350
 smaller 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.690
 press a reset button and press 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.270
 the green button to turn on the machine and 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.400
 mix the ingredients then 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.890
 we put cold water 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.050
 realize that when I open the grid the 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.450
 security system was activated 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.030
 closes the grid and again press the 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.560
 reset button and the button to switch back 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.239
 to work 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.090
 remember that Venancio also 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.610
 produces water coolers do not place 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.350
 Ice not to damage the equipment 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.450
 mass will be organized in 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.180
 approximately 15 minutes 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.200
 ready now just remove the dough from the 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.200

 turn off the main switch before any 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.650
 cleaning 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.780
 it must be done externally with a 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.959
 dry cloth to protect the buttons 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.569
 electronics and the tachi beaters should 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.120
 be made with sponge and detergent and

 avoid using knives and other objects 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.370
 to maintain the performance of the 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.890
 your wood does adjusting the belts 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.230
 after the first 15 hours of use and
