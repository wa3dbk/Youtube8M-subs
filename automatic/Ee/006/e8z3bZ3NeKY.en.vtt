00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980 
their purpose see you by the cone or the

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.050 
their purpose see you by the cone or the
tube<00:00:15.190> and<00:00:16.110> is<00:00:17.110> it<00:00:17.289> worth<00:00:17.440> getting<00:00:17.740> the<00:00:18.100> brand

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
tube and is it worth getting the brand

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.499 
tube and is it worth getting the brand
name<00:00:19.529> Canon<00:00:20.529> made<00:00:20.740> one<00:00:21.039> or<00:00:21.279> a<00:00:21.310> Nikon<00:00:21.970> made<00:00:22.300> one

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:22.509 
name Canon made one or a Nikon made one

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:29.749 
name Canon made one or a Nikon made one
so<00:00:23.429> the<00:00:24.429> purpose<00:00:24.820> of<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.949> lens<00:00:27.189> hood<00:00:27.460> is<00:00:27.699> to

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
so the purpose of the lens hood is to

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.060 
so the purpose of the lens hood is to
protect<00:00:30.759> from<00:00:31.119> lens<00:00:31.509> flare<00:00:31.810> that's<00:00:32.470> that

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
protect from lens flare that's that

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.210 
protect from lens flare that's that
ray<00:00:33.579> that<00:00:33.850> you<00:00:33.940> get<00:00:34.150> into<00:00:34.329> your<00:00:34.690> lens<00:00:35.260> and<00:00:35.680> it

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
ray that you get into your lens and it

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.720 
ray that you get into your lens and it
creates<00:00:36.580> that<00:00:36.900> a<00:00:37.980> little<00:00:38.980> speckle<00:00:39.460> light

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
creates that a little speckle light

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.540 
creates that a little speckle light
effect<00:00:40.360> and<00:00:40.710> depending<00:00:41.710> on<00:00:41.800> what<00:00:41.950> you<00:00:42.100> want<00:00:42.130> to

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
effect and depending on what you want to

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.950 
effect and depending on what you want to
do<00:00:42.700> with<00:00:42.880> your<00:00:43.000> picture<00:00:43.360> sometimes<00:00:43.630> it's

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
do with your picture sometimes it's

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.670 
do with your picture sometimes it's
pretty<00:00:44.200> sometimes<00:00:44.680> it's<00:00:44.800> not<00:00:44.980> so<00:00:46.230> for<00:00:47.230> me<00:00:47.380> I

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
pretty sometimes it's not so for me I

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.330 
pretty sometimes it's not so for me I
use<00:00:47.950> it<00:00:48.130> mostly<00:00:48.400> for<00:00:48.640> protection<00:00:50.040> if<00:00:51.040> it's<00:00:51.220> on

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
use it mostly for protection if it's on

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.300 
use it mostly for protection if it's on
my<00:00:51.490> camera<00:00:51.730> I<00:00:52.650> hit<00:00:53.650> it<00:00:53.680> against<00:00:54.070> the<00:00:54.160> wall

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.310 
my camera I hit it against the wall

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.790 
my camera I hit it against the wall
that's<00:00:54.820> the<00:00:54.970> first<00:00:55.180> thing<00:00:55.330> that<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:56.530> bangs

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
that's the first thing that it bangs

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.760 
that's the first thing that it bangs
into<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:58.510> it's<00:00:58.750> not<00:00:58.870> banging<00:00:59.200> my<00:00:59.290> lens<00:00:59.560> it's

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
into so it's not banging my lens it's

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.110 
into so it's not banging my lens it's
not<00:00:59.890> scratching<00:01:00.190> up<00:01:00.400> my<00:01:00.430> lens<00:01:00.760> and<00:01:00.910> that's

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
not scratching up my lens and that's

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.020 
not scratching up my lens and that's
scratching<00:01:01.990> up<00:01:02.080> the<00:01:02.200> glass<00:01:02.470> so<00:01:03.280> that's<00:01:03.520> that's

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
scratching up the glass so that's that's

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.499 
scratching up the glass so that's that's
what<00:01:04.330> I<00:01:04.509> mean<00:01:04.720> we've<00:01:04.960> I<00:01:05.290> use<00:01:05.860> it<00:01:06.009> for<00:01:06.220> and<00:01:06.610> to<00:01:07.479> be

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
what I mean we've I use it for and to be

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.030 
what I mean we've I use it for and to be
honest<00:01:07.930> it<00:01:08.440> looks<00:01:08.470> kind<00:01:08.860> of<00:01:08.890> cool<00:01:09.100> right

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
honest it looks kind of cool right

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.220 
honest it looks kind of cool right
second<00:01:12.040> second<00:01:12.880> question<00:01:13.300> is<00:01:13.480> should<00:01:13.990> you<00:01:14.020> go

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.230 
second second question is should you go

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.220 
second second question is should you go
with<00:01:14.260> the<00:01:14.560> tulip<00:01:15.070> or<00:01:15.340> the<00:01:16.330> comb<00:01:16.540> and<00:01:16.840> that's

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
with the tulip or the comb and that's

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.010 
with the tulip or the comb and that's
really<00:01:17.590> depends<00:01:18.160> on<00:01:18.250> your<00:01:18.370> lens<00:01:18.670> so<00:01:19.390> depends

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
really depends on your lens so depends

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.640 
really depends on your lens so depends
on<00:01:20.170> your<00:01:20.290> lens<00:01:20.470> in<00:01:20.680> this<00:01:20.920> particular<00:01:21.190> lens

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
on your lens in this particular lens

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.460 
on your lens in this particular lens
focusing<00:01:23.650> is<00:01:23.800> on<00:01:24.010> internal<00:01:25.230> zooming<00:01:26.230> just

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
focusing is on internal zooming just

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.560 
focusing is on internal zooming just
goes<00:01:26.650> in<00:01:26.890> and<00:01:27.040> out<00:01:27.130> so<00:01:27.430> nothing<00:01:27.580> rotates<00:01:28.330> the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
goes in and out so nothing rotates the

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.960 
goes in and out so nothing rotates the
front<00:01:28.780> element<00:01:29.020> does<00:01:29.290> not<00:01:29.500> rotate<00:01:29.740> so<00:01:30.670> in<00:01:30.820> this

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
front element does not rotate so in this

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.080 
front element does not rotate so in this
case<00:01:31.210> you<00:01:31.480> could<00:01:31.630> get<00:01:31.750> a<00:01:31.780> tulip<00:01:32.350> or<00:01:32.560> a<00:01:33.159> comb<00:01:33.550> it

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
case you could get a tulip or a comb it

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.490 
case you could get a tulip or a comb it
doesn't<00:01:34.420> matter<00:01:35.909> but<00:01:36.909> for<00:01:37.180> some<00:01:37.870> elements

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
doesn't matter but for some elements

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.310 
doesn't matter but for some elements
front<00:01:39.460> elements<00:01:39.970> that<00:01:40.150> rotates<00:01:40.840> like<00:01:41.290> this

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
front elements that rotates like this

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.580 
front elements that rotates like this
kit<00:01:41.860> lens<00:01:42.130> if<00:01:43.030> you<00:01:43.690> were<00:01:43.750> to<00:01:43.990> get<00:01:44.140> a<00:01:44.170> column

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
kit lens if you were to get a column

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.130 
kit lens if you were to get a column
it's<00:01:45.280> fine<00:01:45.550> but<00:01:45.790> if<00:01:45.970> you<00:01:46.150> were<00:01:46.270> to<00:01:46.420> get<00:01:46.570> a<00:01:46.600> tulip

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
it's fine but if you were to get a tulip

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.140 
it's fine but if you were to get a tulip
this<00:01:47.409> is<00:01:47.590> what<00:01:47.770> happened<00:01:48.280> it<00:01:48.490> rotates<00:01:48.909> that's

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
this is what happened it rotates that's

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.789 
this is what happened it rotates that's
your<00:01:49.299> focusing<00:01:49.870> so<00:01:50.020> if<00:01:50.140> you<00:01:50.320> use<00:01:50.470> an<00:01:50.590> auto

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
your focusing so if you use an auto

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.149 
your focusing so if you use an auto
focus<00:01:51.340> or<00:01:51.490> something<00:01:51.820> like<00:01:51.970> that<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:53.740> spins

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
focus or something like that it spins

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.130 
focus or something like that it spins
around<00:01:56.370> it's<00:01:57.370> kind<00:01:57.670> of<00:01:57.729> silly

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
around it's kind of silly

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.320 
around it's kind of silly
so<00:01:59.680> I<00:01:59.710> didn't<00:02:00.010> do<00:02:00.130> much<00:02:00.340> for<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:00.790> lens<00:02:01.030> flare

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
so I didn't do much for the lens flare

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.310 
so I didn't do much for the lens flare
as<00:02:01.570> it<00:02:02.440> be<00:02:03.070> kind<00:02:03.280> of<00:02:03.369> silly<00:02:03.580> if<00:02:03.820> you<00:02:04.000> have<00:02:04.119> to

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
as it be kind of silly if you have to

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.510 
as it be kind of silly if you have to
focus<00:02:05.320> and<00:02:05.740> then<00:02:06.010> screw<00:02:06.280> this

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.230 

and<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.630> third<00:02:10.930> question<00:02:11.920> is<00:02:12.310> should<00:02:13.000> you<00:02:13.030> go

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
and the third question is should you go

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.080 
and the third question is should you go
ahead<00:02:13.330> and<00:02:13.570> buy<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.830> cannon<00:02:14.830> one<00:02:15.010> or<00:02:15.790> one<00:02:16.000> of

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
ahead and buy a cannon one or one of

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.860 
ahead and buy a cannon one or one of
those<00:02:16.290> operand<00:02:17.290> one<00:02:17.500> for<00:02:18.690> four<00:02:19.690> or<00:02:19.810> five

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
those operand one for four or five

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.760 
those operand one for four or five
dollars<00:02:20.200> versus<00:02:20.980> thirty<00:02:21.400> dollars<00:02:22.590> firstly<00:02:23.590> I

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
dollars versus thirty dollars firstly I

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.340 
dollars versus thirty dollars firstly I
don't<00:02:23.950> think<00:02:24.160> these<00:02:24.310> are<00:02:24.370> worth<00:02:24.640> 30<00:02:24.940> dollars

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
don't think these are worth 30 dollars
