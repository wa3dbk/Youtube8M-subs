00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
in the middle east on this knife I was

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.600 
in the middle east on this knife I was
speaking<00:00:35.430> with<00:00:35.550> my<00:00:35.820> dad<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.300> believed<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.930> was

speaking with my dad I believed it was
introduced<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:39.379> the<00:00:40.379> middle<00:00:40.620> east<00:00:40.800> by<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
introduced to the middle east by the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.990 
introduced to the middle east by the
Egyptians<00:00:42.950> who<00:00:45.500> made<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> union<00:00:47.219> with<00:00:47.489> Syria

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
Egyptians who made a union with Syria

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.430 
Egyptians who made a union with Syria
back<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.480> 60s<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.789> as<00:00:50.789> cold<00:00:51.270> steel<00:00:51.600> say

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
back in the 60s and as cold steel say

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.430 
back in the 60s and as cold steel say
it's<00:00:52.829> from<00:00:53.190> South<00:00:53.899> Africa<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.079> believed

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
it's from South Africa and I believed

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.520 
it's from South Africa and I believed
that<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:56.160> be<00:00:56.190> true<00:00:56.309> because<00:00:56.750> this<00:00:57.750> knife<00:00:57.989> came

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
that to be true because this knife came

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.209 
that to be true because this knife came
to<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.829> Middle<00:00:59.070> East<00:00:59.930> from<00:01:00.930> Egypt<00:01:01.410> which<00:01:02.039> is

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
to the Middle East from Egypt which is

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.510 
to the Middle East from Egypt which is
in<00:01:02.340> Africa<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:04.070> I<00:01:05.070> believe<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.270> be<00:01:06.299> true

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
in Africa so I believe that to be true

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.840 
in Africa so I believe that to be true

really good there we go fairly sharp the

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.000 
really good there we go fairly sharp the
steel<00:04:57.510> I<00:04:57.930> believe<00:04:58.650> it's<00:04:58.889> called<00:04:59.720> 4116

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
steel I believe it's called 4116

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.520 
steel I believe it's called 4116
stainless<00:05:02.010> steel<00:05:02.510> not<00:05:03.510> the<00:05:03.780> best<00:05:03.990> deal<00:05:04.260> you

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
stainless steel not the best deal you

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.820 
stainless steel not the best deal you
can<00:05:04.560> have<00:05:05.360> but<00:05:06.360> this<00:05:06.600> one<00:05:06.900> we<00:05:07.139> used<00:05:07.380> it<00:05:07.590> most

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
can have but this one we used it most

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.960 
can have but this one we used it most
likely<00:05:08.270> when<00:05:09.270> we<00:05:09.419> went<00:05:09.930> fishing<00:05:10.520> to<00:05:11.520> clean<00:05:11.820> the

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
likely when we went fishing to clean the

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.540 
likely when we went fishing to clean the
fish<00:05:12.180> with<00:05:12.419> it<00:05:12.570> or<00:05:12.840> to<00:05:13.110> skin<00:05:13.440> small<00:05:14.040> animals

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
fish with it or to skin small animals

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.610 
fish with it or to skin small animals
like<00:05:14.639> a<00:05:14.790> rabbit<00:05:15.240> or<00:05:16.400> maybe<00:05:17.400> some<00:05:17.700> birds<00:05:18.620> you

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
like a rabbit or maybe some birds you

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.670 
like a rabbit or maybe some birds you
know<00:05:19.770> cut<00:05:20.039> them<00:05:20.190> it's<00:05:20.400> it's<00:05:21.180> really<00:05:21.510> easy<00:05:22.260> to

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
know cut them it's it's really easy to

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.560 
know cut them it's it's really easy to
do<00:05:22.830> that<00:05:23.070> with<00:05:23.310> this<00:05:23.340> knife<00:05:23.699> two<00:05:24.120> millimeter

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
do that with this knife two millimeter

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.830 
do that with this knife two millimeter
in<00:05:24.780> thickness<00:05:25.550> it<00:05:26.550> could<00:05:26.789> be<00:05:26.940> applied<00:05:27.360> as<00:05:27.810> a

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
in thickness it could be applied as a

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.070 
in thickness it could be applied as a
defensive<00:05:28.500> knife<00:05:28.850> also<00:05:29.850> because<00:05:30.690> it<00:05:30.870> has<00:05:31.050> a

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
defensive knife also because it has a

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.050 
defensive knife also because it has a
lot<00:05:31.410> of<00:05:31.440> reach<00:05:31.680> I<00:05:32.930> mean<00:05:33.930> 10<00:05:34.200> inches<00:05:35.060> folding

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
lot of reach I mean 10 inches folding

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.010 
lot of reach I mean 10 inches folding
knife<00:05:36.270> this<00:05:36.900> is<00:05:37.080> really<00:05:37.289> a<00:05:38.030> large<00:05:39.030> one<00:05:39.360> and<00:05:39.510> the

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
knife this is really a large one and the

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.589 
knife this is really a large one and the
best<00:05:40.229> thing<00:05:40.349> about<00:05:40.620> it<00:05:40.770> it's<00:05:41.130> the<00:05:41.849> weight<00:05:42.240> it's

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599 
best thing about it it's the weight it's

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
the 10 inches voyager is much much

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.279 
the 10 inches voyager is much much
heavier<00:05:57.780> than<00:05:58.280> this<00:05:59.280> one<00:05:59.840> but<00:06:00.840> again<00:06:00.960> it's

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
heavier than this one but again it's

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:04.850 
heavier than this one but again it's
much<00:06:01.500> stronger<00:06:01.860> so<00:06:02.720> you<00:06:03.720> gotta<00:06:03.930> compromise<00:06:04.320> as

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
much stronger so you gotta compromise as

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.690 
much stronger so you gotta compromise as
