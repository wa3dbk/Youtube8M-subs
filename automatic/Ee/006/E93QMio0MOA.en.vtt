00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
heater because it's been really cold and

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.640 
heater because it's been really cold and
wet<00:04:01.489> here<00:04:01.850> in<00:04:01.940> Alabama<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:03.050> weather's<00:04:03.470> been

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
in league 30s and 40s and it uses a lot

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.690 
in league 30s and 40s and it uses a lot
of<00:04:08.360> propane<00:04:08.959> to<00:04:09.410> keep<00:04:09.560> this<00:04:09.709> place<00:04:09.980> heated

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
of propane to keep this place heated

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.070 
of propane to keep this place heated
with<00:04:11.209> you<00:04:11.420> to<00:04:12.019> 20<00:04:12.950> gallon<00:04:13.400> propane<00:04:14.030> tanks<00:04:14.900> and

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
with you to 20 gallon propane tanks and

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.650 
with you to 20 gallon propane tanks and
those<00:04:15.290> cost<00:04:15.560> twenty<00:04:15.920> dollars<00:04:16.190> of<00:04:16.340> keys<00:04:16.549> and<00:04:16.850> I

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
those cost twenty dollars of keys and I

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.620 
those cost twenty dollars of keys and I
mean<00:04:17.810> that's<00:04:17.959> been<00:04:18.260> in<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.410> last<00:04:18.709> week<00:04:19.160> so

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
mean that's been in the last week so

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.360 
mean that's been in the last week so
it's<00:04:20.630> a<00:04:20.750> lot<00:04:20.930> more<00:04:20.959> cost<00:04:21.470> effective<00:04:22.070> just<00:04:22.280> to

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
it's a lot more cost effective just to

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.010 
it's a lot more cost effective just to
use<00:04:22.550> an<00:04:22.669> electric<00:04:23.090> heater<00:04:23.270> since<00:04:23.840> we're

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
use an electric heater since we're

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.440 
use an electric heater since we're
plugged<00:04:24.260> up<00:04:24.410> anyways<00:04:24.919> we<00:04:25.700> also<00:04:25.880> use<00:04:26.240> this

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
plugged up anyways we also use this

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.200 
plugged up anyways we also use this
griddle<00:04:27.080> to<00:04:27.500> cook<00:04:27.680> just<00:04:27.919> about<00:04:28.190> everything<00:04:28.790> on

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
griddle to cook just about everything on

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.659 
griddle to cook just about everything on
because<00:04:30.020> the<00:04:30.500> stove<00:04:30.950> and<00:04:31.510> the<00:04:32.510> oven<00:04:33.430> also<00:04:34.430> went

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
because the stove and the oven also went

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:39.270 
because the stove and the oven also went
off<00:04:34.790> propane<00:04:35.890> so<00:04:36.890> we<00:04:37.460> use<00:04:37.640> that<00:04:37.910> instead<00:04:38.180> we

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
off propane so we use that instead we

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.980 
off propane so we use that instead we
have<00:04:40.280> a<00:04:40.310> microwave<00:04:40.970> I<00:04:41.360> actually<00:04:41.479> thought<00:04:41.810> this

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
have a microwave I actually thought this

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.469
