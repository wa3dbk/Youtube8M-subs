I knew I've played that so much in

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.980 
I knew I've played that so much in
development<00:01:58.260> you<00:01:59.010> know<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.060> get<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.300> hit<00:02:00.870> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
development you know to get to hit the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.470 
development you know to get to hit the
game<00:02:01.140> as<00:02:01.350> good<00:02:01.500> as<00:02:01.620> it<00:02:01.770> could<00:02:01.860> be<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.070> then

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.060 
game as good as it could be and then
once<00:02:03.480> the<00:02:03.690> development<00:02:04.230> was<00:02:04.380> done<00:02:04.650> I<00:02:04.680> played

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
once the development was done I played

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.920 
once the development was done I played
at<00:02:05.250> some<00:02:05.460> but<00:02:05.640> not<00:02:05.670> as<00:02:05.970> much<00:02:06.150> as<00:02:06.330> I<00:02:06.450> did<00:02:06.660> in<00:02:06.810> all
