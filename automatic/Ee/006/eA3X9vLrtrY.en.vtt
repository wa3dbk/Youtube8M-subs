00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 I really do not feel well as me 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.990
 make out of the witches houses airfield 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.450
 to conquer the summer sky 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.139
 but pilot thomas meder knows me 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.429
 soothe 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.570
 today with the Sf 25 motor sailer 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.390
 open flair in eschwege 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.580
 We fly about half to 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.000
 three quarters of an hour, I think it's weather 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.960
 Well 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.369
 good visibility barely clouds all the way 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.529
 nice flight I also hope and hope 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.440
 I am glad that the young aviator from 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.630
 state everything under again 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.309
 the magnifying glass takes 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.879
 then it's time to go open 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.890
 flair 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.030
 I'm really curious how that 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.410
 Festungs probably looks from above 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.930
 the landscape along our 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.680
 Flight is definitely on the best 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.079
 hope 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.719
 It would not be the summer wind of it 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.880
 neatly wiggling always leaves more 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.190
 closer we come gsw 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.110
 500 meters we are high than they already are 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.440
 from a distance a sparkle of more 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.540
 hundreds of cars down tents and 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.770
 Of course the stages, especially the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.420
 huge stage 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.700
 those from up here but much more 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.870
 looks like a tiny ants 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.390
 playground 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.670
 the band against me from florida is raging 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.000
 straightforward from which I neither 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.110
 something looks even higher so much whistles 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.490
 the wind is blowing around us 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.920
 admitted at musical ohrenschmaus 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.770
 is my trip to the open flair festival 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.660
 not for that but i have the and best 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.290
 I ever go to a concert 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.450
 would have 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.450
 if a little bit shaky 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.270
 the photos are in the box and so on 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.450
 We quickly get back on the way 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.910
 my car is waiting in witzenhausen with the 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.220
 it goes back directly to eschwege to 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.710
 at least something of the blazing flair 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.230
 then to get the program with 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.730
 no longer from the bird's eye view 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:03.340
 but with a fat portion 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.340
 Music takes place and engine sounds
