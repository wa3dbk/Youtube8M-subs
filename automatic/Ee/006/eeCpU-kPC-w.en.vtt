for<00:01:19.420> niburu<00:01:19.890> let's<00:01:20.890> take<00:01:21.159> an<00:01:21.310> image<00:01:21.429> showing

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
the planets of course but that's what

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.169 
the planets of course but that's what
we're<00:01:29.319> aiming<00:01:29.440> for<00:01:29.649> clear<00:01:30.369> photographic

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
what happens then is that we steer

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.339 
what happens then is that we steer
Photoshop<00:01:42.640> towards<00:01:43.119> finding<00:01:43.420> what<00:01:43.750> we<00:01:43.989> see<00:01:44.200> is
