and it tells you which mob of ours the
juice<00:02:09.050> from<00:02:09.289> and<00:02:09.709> you<00:02:10.399> put<00:02:10.640> in<00:02:10.759> your<00:02:10.879> body<00:02:11.090> size

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
juice from and you put in your body size

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.729 
juice from and you put in your body size
index<00:02:12.080> to<00:02:12.760> determine<00:02:13.760> which<00:02:14.060> blade<00:02:14.810> sizes<00:02:15.500> for

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
index to determine which blade sizes for

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.360 
index to determine which blade sizes for
you<00:02:16.150> so<00:02:17.650> all<00:02:18.650> our<00:02:18.769> people<00:02:18.950> are<00:02:19.099> going<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.280> use

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
you so all our people are going to use

what<00:02:19.700> we<00:02:19.819> call<00:02:19.849> the<00:02:20.540> 90<00:02:21.110> square<00:02:21.380> inch<00:02:21.650> blade

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
what we call the 90 square inch blade

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.150 
what we call the 90 square inch blade
like<00:02:22.880> this<00:02:22.910> one<00:02:23.239> here<00:02:23.480> which<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.800> bladers

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
like this one here which the bladers

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.420 
like this one here which the bladers
just<00:02:25.400> calculated<00:02:26.170> simply<00:02:27.170> by<00:02:27.500> total<00:02:28.190> surface

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
just calculated simply by total surface

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.410 
just calculated simply by total surface
area<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.150> power<00:02:29.360> face<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:30.549> the<00:02:31.549> 90<00:02:32.239> square

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
area of the power face and the 90 square

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.270 
area of the power face and the 90 square
inches<00:02:32.720> maybe<00:02:33.049> for<00:02:33.319> our<00:02:33.379> smaller<00:02:33.769> paddlers

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
inches maybe for our smaller paddlers

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.660 
inches maybe for our smaller paddlers
and<00:02:34.519> 100<00:02:35.510> which<00:02:35.660> I<00:02:35.840> would<00:02:36.110> use<00:02:36.319> is<00:02:36.620> for<00:02:37.010> your

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
and 100 which I would use is for your

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.520 
and 100 which I would use is for your
medium<00:02:38.360> sized<00:02:38.569> people<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:40.489> 110<00:02:41.030> is<00:02:41.530> 110

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
medium sized people and the 110 is 110

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.900 
medium sized people and the 110 is 110
square<00:02:42.799> inches<00:02:43.010> about<00:02:43.250> ten<00:02:43.430> percent<00:02:43.579> larger

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
square inches about ten percent larger

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.300 
square inches about ten percent larger
again<00:02:44.329> and<00:02:44.720> that's<00:02:45.170> for<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.440> bigger<00:02:45.890> palace

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
again and that's for the bigger palace

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.420 
again and that's for the bigger palace
so<00:02:47.120> that's<00:02:47.480> pretty<00:02:47.690> much<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.930> idea<00:02:48.500> behind<00:02:49.010> it

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
so that's pretty much the idea behind it

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.330 
so that's pretty much the idea behind it
we<00:02:50.269> offer<00:02:50.480> a<00:02:50.660> variety<00:02:50.959> of<00:02:51.380> price<00:02:51.799> ranges

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.259 
blade sizes for different folks we
decided<00:03:55.319> that<00:03:55.469> one<00:03:56.040> shaft<00:03:56.430> stiffness<00:03:56.909> is<00:03:57.030> not

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
decided that one shaft stiffness is not

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.300 
decided that one shaft stiffness is not
really<00:03:57.599> ideal<00:03:57.989> for<00:03:58.260> every<00:03:58.469> application<00:03:58.620> or

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
really ideal for every application or

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.360 
really ideal for every application or
every<00:03:59.909> body<00:04:00.120> size<00:04:00.480> so<00:04:01.290> we've<00:04:01.739> realized<00:04:02.129> that

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
every body size so we've realized that

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.220 
every body size so we've realized that
with<00:04:02.609> the<00:04:02.760> bigger<00:04:02.969> blades<00:04:03.359> and<00:04:03.689> the<00:04:03.870> longer

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
with the bigger blades and the longer

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.839 
with the bigger blades and the longer
paddles<00:04:04.680> we<00:04:04.859> really<00:04:05.069> need<00:04:05.219> a<00:04:05.250> little<00:04:05.519> stiffer

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
paddles we really need a little stiffer

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.729 
paddles we really need a little stiffer
shaft<00:04:06.269> so<00:04:07.019> we've<00:04:07.169> come<00:04:07.349> up<00:04:07.379> with<00:04:07.530> some

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810

and<00:05:00.660> then<00:05:00.810> we<00:05:00.960> feel<00:05:01.170> that's<00:05:01.320> gonna<00:05:02.250> be<00:05:02.430> seven

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
and then we feel that's gonna be seven

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
to talk about our handles a little bit

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.360 
to talk about our handles a little bit
here<00:05:17.130> we<00:05:17.760> offer<00:05:18.000> again<00:05:18.750> not<00:05:19.620> one<00:05:19.800> handles<00:05:20.190> and

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
here we offer again not one handles and

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.650 
here we offer again not one handles and
everybody<00:05:20.790> know<00:05:20.970> people<00:05:21.300> have<00:05:21.450> a<00:05:21.480> different

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
everybody know people have a different

everybody know people have a different

palm grip what people refer to handles

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.620 
palm grip what people refer to handles
it<00:05:28.440> really<00:05:28.800> becomes<00:05:29.160> a<00:05:29.460> personal<00:05:30.360> preference

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
it really becomes a personal preference

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.840 
it really becomes a personal preference
and<00:05:31.080> a<00:05:31.290> lot<00:05:31.770> of<00:05:31.800> times<00:05:32.100> it's<00:05:32.310> to<00:05:32.460> handle<00:05:32.730> that

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
and a lot of times it's to handle that

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.340 
and a lot of times it's to handle that
you<00:05:32.940> get<00:05:33.060> comfortable<00:05:33.420> with<00:05:33.540> it<00:05:33.840> feels<00:05:34.080> right

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
you get comfortable with it feels right

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.530 
you get comfortable with it feels right
for<00:05:34.410> you<00:05:34.670> when<00:05:35.670> you<00:05:35.760> change<00:05:36.060> handle<00:05:36.390> Bluff

times because it feels odd or different
in<00:05:38.340> your<00:05:38.430> hand<00:05:38.640> you<00:05:39.120> may<00:05:39.240> not<00:05:39.360> like<00:05:39.420> it<00:05:39.600> at
