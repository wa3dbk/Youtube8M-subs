00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.140 
balanced person those four muscle groups
have<00:02:02.140> to<00:02:02.410> work<00:02:02.770> together<00:02:03.160> synergistically

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
have to work together synergistically

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
have to work together synergistically
all<00:02:05.110> providing<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.860> same<00:02:06.130> amount<00:02:06.520> of<00:02:07.170> effort

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
all providing the same amount of effort

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.220 
all providing the same amount of effort
in<00:02:08.380> order<00:02:08.740> to<00:02:08.979> pro<00:02:09.220> to<00:02:09.850> produce<00:02:10.180> movement

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
in order to pro to produce movement

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.280 
in order to pro to produce movement
so<00:02:11.730> happens<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:12.760> lot<00:02:12.879> of<00:02:13.030> trends<00:02:13.239> is<00:02:13.510> you<00:02:13.989> create

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
so happens a lot of trends is you create

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.380 
so happens a lot of trends is you create
if<00:02:14.530> there's<00:02:14.709> an<00:02:14.830> imbalance<00:02:15.069> where<00:02:15.549> like<00:02:15.760> these

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
if there's an imbalance where like these

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.180 
if there's an imbalance where like these
two<00:02:16.690> guys<00:02:16.870> are<00:02:17.230> working<00:02:17.409> really<00:02:17.799> really

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
two guys are working really really

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.430 
two guys are working really really
really<00:02:18.340> hard<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:19.030> these<00:02:19.659> two<00:02:19.840> guys<00:02:19.959> are<00:02:20.019> weak

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
really hard and these two guys are weak

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.380 
really hard and these two guys are weak
and<00:02:20.650> lazy<00:02:20.860> they<00:02:21.310> just<00:02:21.489> don't<00:02:21.670> do<00:02:21.790> anything<00:02:22.000> and

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
and lazy they just don't do anything and

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.750 
and lazy they just don't do anything and
then<00:02:23.110> you<00:02:23.230> have<00:02:23.440> just<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.129> opposite<00:02:24.549> where

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
then you have just the opposite where

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.729 
then you have just the opposite where
these<00:02:25.180> two<00:02:25.420> guys<00:02:25.599> are<00:02:25.900> really<00:02:26.290> really<00:02:26.409> strong

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
these two guys are really really strong

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.250 
these two guys are really really strong
and<00:02:27.190> these<00:02:27.940> two<00:02:28.120> guys<00:02:28.269> are<00:02:28.599> really<00:02:28.870> really

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
and these two guys are really really

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.320 
and these two guys are really really
weak<00:02:29.440> they<00:02:29.860> weren't<00:02:30.160> your<00:02:30.310> body<00:02:30.489> works<00:02:30.849> and<00:02:31.030> in

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
weak they weren't your body works and in

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.080 
weak they weren't your body works and in
a<00:02:31.420> series<00:02:31.900> of<00:02:32.160> crosses<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.340> pac-man<00:02:33.640> like

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
a series of crosses and pac-man like

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.509 
a series of crosses and pac-man like
cross<00:02:34.690> patterns<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.440> this<00:02:35.830> is<00:02:35.980> just<00:02:36.190> one<00:02:36.400> of

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
cross patterns and this is just one of

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.140 
cross patterns and this is just one of
them<00:02:36.700> so<00:02:37.620> what<00:02:38.620> I've<00:02:38.739> done<00:02:38.950> is<00:02:39.010> I've<00:02:39.370> taken<00:02:39.640> the

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
them so what I've done is I've taken the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.449 
them so what I've done is I've taken the
time<00:02:40.180> taken<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:41.110> two<00:02:41.379> typical<00:02:42.069> types<00:02:42.280> of

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
time taken the two typical types of

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.520 
time taken the two typical types of
imbalances<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.629> one<00:02:43.810> that<00:02:43.959> goes<00:02:44.079> this<00:02:44.319> way

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
imbalances the one that goes this way

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.470 
imbalances the one that goes this way
and<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:44.799> one<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:45.010> goes<00:02:45.129> that<00:02:45.340> way<00:02:45.549> I'm<00:02:46.060> gonna

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
and the one that goes that way I'm gonna

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.910 
and the one that goes that way I'm gonna
number<00:02:46.750> two<00:02:46.989> and<00:02:47.549> and<00:02:48.549> I<00:02:49.450> turned<00:02:49.870> them<00:02:50.140> now<00:02:50.650> I

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
number two and and I turned them now I

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.699 
number two and and I turned them now I
did<00:02:51.790> I<00:02:52.030> stole<00:02:52.540> this<00:02:52.810> this<00:02:53.079> is<00:02:53.200> I<00:02:53.349> got<00:02:53.530> these

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
did I stole this this is I got these

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.979 
did I stole this this is I got these
terms<00:02:54.040> of<00:02:54.250> these<00:02:54.310> ideas<00:02:54.700> from<00:02:54.910> Paul<00:02:55.150> check<00:02:55.420> but

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
terms of these ideas from Paul check but

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.280

they're<00:04:29.970> working<00:04:30.210> way<00:04:30.570> too<00:04:30.600> hard<00:04:31.110> that's<00:04:31.320> why

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
they're working way too hard that's why

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.470 
they're working way too hard that's why
they're<00:04:31.740> always<00:04:31.860> fatigued<00:04:32.310> or<00:04:32.640> or<00:04:33.210> painful

they're always fatigued or or painful
you're<00:04:34.410> also<00:04:34.860> your<00:04:35.010> hip<00:04:35.190> flexors<00:04:35.610> are<00:04:35.790> going

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
you're also your hip flexors are going

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.970 
you're also your hip flexors are going
to<00:04:36.060> be<00:04:36.120> muscles<00:04:36.510> that<00:04:36.570> are<00:04:36.720> extremely<00:04:37.560> tight

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
to be muscles that are extremely tight

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.040 
to be muscles that are extremely tight
because<00:04:38.340> they<00:04:38.760> also<00:04:39.150> contribute<00:04:39.780> to<00:04:39.810> the

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
because they also contribute to the

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.470 
because they also contribute to the
tipping<00:04:40.680> forward<00:04:40.950> of<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:41.220> hip<00:04:41.400> so<00:04:41.700> those<00:04:42.270> are

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
tipping forward of the hip so those are

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.960 
tipping forward of the hip so those are
your<00:04:42.540> really<00:04:42.810> tight<00:04:43.380> strong<00:04:44.160> muscles<00:04:44.760> that's

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
your really tight strong muscles that's

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.210 
your really tight strong muscles that's
a<00:04:45.090> good<00:04:45.300> thing<00:04:45.570> but<00:04:46.230> they<00:04:46.710> need<00:04:46.950> to<00:04:46.980> be

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
a good thing but they need to be

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.370 
a good thing but they need to be
stretched<00:04:47.820> and<00:04:48.240> order<00:04:48.990> because<00:04:49.170> when<00:04:49.320> you

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
stretched and order because when you

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.230 
stretched and order because when you
stretch<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:49.710> muscle<00:04:50.010> you<00:04:50.100> sort<00:04:50.370> of<00:04:50.400> weaken<00:04:51.150> it

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
stretch the muscle you sort of weaken it

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.550 
stretch the muscle you sort of weaken it
or<00:04:51.390> you<00:04:51.480> take<00:04:51.630> a<00:04:51.660> lot<00:04:51.840> of<00:04:51.870> the<00:04:52.050> nervous<00:04:52.380> energy

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
or you take a lot of the nervous energy

or you take a lot of the nervous energy
out<00:04:52.890> of<00:04:52.920> it<00:04:53.160> they<00:04:53.730> need<00:04:53.940> to<00:04:54.030> be<00:04:54.120> stretched<00:04:54.510> in

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
out of it they need to be stretched in

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.700 
out of it they need to be stretched in
order<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:55.580> give<00:04:56.580> way<00:04:56.970> for<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.780> weaker<00:04:58.200> muscles

you can see everybody but it's almost

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:20.589

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:20.599 
like a tucking under of the but that's

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:22.420 
like a tucking under of the but that's
your<00:06:20.990> posterior<00:06:21.409> pelvic<00:06:21.500> tilt<00:06:21.680> the<00:06:22.129> muscles

your posterior pelvic tilt the muscles

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.559 
your posterior pelvic tilt the muscles
that<00:06:22.520> are<00:06:22.580> weak<00:06:22.849> that<00:06:23.150> need<00:06:23.360> to<00:06:23.539> be

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:23.569 
that are weak that need to be

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:25.300 
that are weak that need to be
strengthened<00:06:24.289> you<00:06:24.500> guys<00:06:24.740> are<00:06:24.919> the<00:06:24.979> ones<00:06:25.159> that

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
strengthened you guys are the ones that

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.999 
strengthened you guys are the ones that
need<00:06:25.400> to<00:06:25.550> do<00:06:26.139> hyperextensions<00:06:27.139> any<00:06:27.710> type<00:06:27.979> of

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
back extensions because those muscles

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.529 
back extensions because those muscles
are<00:06:30.409> just<00:06:30.440> not<00:06:30.800> existent<00:06:31.310> because<00:06:31.580> obviously

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:32.539 
are just not existent because obviously

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:34.119 
are just not existent because obviously
because<00:06:33.020> they're<00:06:33.199> not<00:06:33.349> pulling<00:06:33.830> your<00:06:33.919> hips

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:34.129

00:06:59.529 --> 00:06:59.539 
hamstrings and for some freakin reason

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:01.300 
hamstrings and for some freakin reason
everybody<00:06:59.900> thinks<00:06:59.960> when<00:07:00.770> you<00:07:00.860> stretch<00:07:01.129> you

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:01.310 
everybody thinks when you stretch you

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.529 
everybody thinks when you stretch you
should<00:07:01.460> stretch<00:07:01.610> your<00:07:01.729> hamstrings<00:07:02.120> not

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:02.539
