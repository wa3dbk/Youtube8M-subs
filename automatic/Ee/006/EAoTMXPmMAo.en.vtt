from<00:05:13.870> the<00:05:14.020> dish<00:05:14.200> on<00:05:14.350> paracel<00:05:14.740> storm<00:05:14.800> and<00:05:15.280> then

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
from the dish on paracel storm and then

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.640 
from the dish on paracel storm and then
Jack<00:05:15.580> dropped<00:05:15.820> that<00:05:16.030> little<00:05:16.270> die<00:05:16.930> mommy<00:05:17.290> so

Jack dropped that little die mommy so
here<00:05:18.130> we<00:05:18.250> are<00:05:18.370> starting<00:05:18.670> this<00:05:18.820> video<00:05:19.240> over

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
here we are starting this video over

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.080 
here we are starting this video over
again<00:05:20.710> that's<00:05:21.190> a<00:05:21.280> sort<00:05:21.760> of<00:05:21.820> thing<00:05:22.000> the

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
again that's a sort of thing the

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.640 
again that's a sort of thing the
community<00:05:22.480> does<00:05:22.690> somebody<00:05:23.050> will<00:05:23.230> find<00:05:23.410> one

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
community does somebody will find one

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.440 
community does somebody will find one
thing<00:05:23.920> so<00:05:24.370> we<00:05:24.490> will<00:05:24.580> find<00:05:24.730> something<00:05:25.000> else<00:05:25.240> so

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
thing so we will find something else so

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.850 
thing so we will find something else so
he<00:05:25.570> finds<00:05:25.840> like<00:05:25.930> the<00:05:26.020> fifth<00:05:26.260> or<00:05:26.410> sixth<00:05:26.650> piece

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
he finds like the fifth or sixth piece

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.140 
he finds like the fifth or sixth piece
but<00:05:27.100> it's<00:05:27.190> not<00:05:27.340> ready<00:05:27.610> because<00:05:27.820> you<00:05:28.000> don't

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
but it's not ready because you don't

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.420 
but it's not ready because you don't
have<00:05:28.210> the<00:05:28.450> linking<00:05:28.870> material<00:05:29.740> it's<00:05:29.950> always

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
together with us and the distances

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.850 
together with us and the distances
they're<00:05:35.020> willing<00:05:35.380> to<00:05:35.440> go<00:05:35.680> through
