00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
protection for the glass on the iPad now

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.080

installing<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.920> iPad<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.400> very<00:01:14.640> simple<00:01:15.000> I

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
installing the iPad is very simple I

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.179 
installing the iPad is very simple I
have<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.270> do<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.509> snap<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.930> into<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> corners

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:23.660 

there<00:01:23.189> we<00:01:23.280> go

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
there we go

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.030 
there we go
so<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.810> lot<00:01:25.049> easier<00:01:25.080> than<00:01:25.470> trying<00:01:25.770> to

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
so this is a lot easier than trying to

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.490 
so this is a lot easier than trying to
slide<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.880> out<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.840> sleeve<00:01:28.200> style

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
slide this in and out of a sleeve style

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.069 
slide this in and out of a sleeve style
cover<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.460> when<00:01:29.579> you're<00:01:29.670> done<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:30.420> snap<00:01:30.930> this

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
cover so when you're done just snap this

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.749 
cover so when you're done just snap this
back<00:01:32.119> pull<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.270> out<00:01:34.009> so<00:01:35.009> if<00:01:35.130> it's<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.400> easy<00:01:35.430> to

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
back pull it out so if it's so easy to

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.760 
back pull it out so if it's so easy to
take<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.570> out<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.900> cover<00:01:37.140> will<00:01:37.650> it

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
take in and out of the cover will it

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.840 
take in and out of the cover will it
fall<00:01:38.009> out<00:01:38.040> by<00:01:38.400> itself<00:01:38.759> well<00:01:39.360> let's<00:01:39.540> try<00:01:39.780> it

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
fall out by itself well let's try it

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.030 
fall out by itself well let's try it
okay<00:01:41.899> now<00:01:42.899> see<00:01:43.110> what<00:01:43.259> happens<00:01:43.530> when<00:01:43.680> we<00:01:43.799> shake

nothing's happening in fact the more I
shake<00:01:54.650> it<00:01:54.680> and<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:54.979> more<00:01:55.159> I<00:01:55.190> flex<00:01:55.550> it<00:01:55.790> the

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
shake it and the more I flex it the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.850 
shake it and the more I flex it the
tighter<00:01:56.510> this<00:01:56.780> seems<00:01:57.050> to<00:01:57.200> grip<00:01:57.440> on<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.620> the

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
tighter this seems to grip on to the

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.510 
tighter this seems to grip on to the
iPad

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
iPad

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.730 
iPad
there's<00:01:59.510> also<00:01:59.660> completely<00:02:00.110> keeps<00:02:00.410> the<00:02:00.560> face

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
there's also completely keeps the face

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.380 
there's also completely keeps the face
clear<00:02:01.010> so<00:02:01.190> although<00:02:01.400> the<00:02:01.610> light<00:02:01.820> sensors<00:02:02.210> are

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
clear so although the light sensors are

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.149 
clear so although the light sensors are
clear<00:02:02.600> and<00:02:02.840> I'm<00:02:03.260> particularly<00:02:03.590> fond<00:02:03.920> of<00:02:04.010> this

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
clear and I'm particularly fond of this

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.370 
clear and I'm particularly fond of this
low-profile<00:02:04.790> design<00:02:04.910> because<00:02:05.869> covers<00:02:06.200> that

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
low-profile design because covers that

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.590 
low-profile design because covers that
cover<00:02:06.619> the<00:02:06.800> glass<00:02:07.010> also<00:02:07.670> allowed<00:02:08.119> us<00:02:08.149> to

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
cover the glass also allowed us to

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.270 
cover the glass also allowed us to
accumulate<00:02:08.899> along<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:09.530> edge<00:02:09.740> so<00:02:10.130> it's

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
accumulate along the edge so it's

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.250 
accumulate along the edge so it's
difficult<00:02:10.520> to<00:02:10.759> keep<00:02:10.970> clean<00:02:11.030> this<00:02:11.840> is<00:02:12.020> very

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
difficult to keep clean this is very

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.949 
difficult to keep clean this is very
easy<00:02:12.530> to<00:02:12.709> wipe<00:02:13.310> down<00:02:13.340> and<00:02:13.910> all<00:02:14.450> of<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.690> ports

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
easy to wipe down and all of the ports

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.510 
easy to wipe down and all of the ports
are<00:02:15.050> still<00:02:15.080> accessible<00:02:15.290> so<00:02:15.980> we<00:02:16.070> have<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.340> dock

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
are still accessible so we have the dock

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.230 
are still accessible so we have the dock

the<00:02:25.070> microphone<00:02:25.610> now<00:02:26.330> this<00:02:26.450> case<00:02:26.660> has<00:02:26.840> many

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
the microphone now this case has many

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.260 
the microphone now this case has many
fantastic<00:02:27.860> features<00:02:28.489> and<00:02:28.730> one<00:02:28.850> of<00:02:28.940> them<00:02:29.060> are

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
fantastic features and one of them are

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.510 
fantastic features and one of them are
these<00:02:29.480> straps<00:02:29.840> so<00:02:30.650> we<00:02:30.830> can<00:02:31.010> hold<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.340> cover

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
these straps so we can hold the cover

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.460 
these straps so we can hold the cover
closed<00:02:31.820> by<00:02:32.060> pulling<00:02:32.390> these<00:02:32.540> straps<00:02:32.840> from<00:02:33.290> the

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
closed by pulling these straps from the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.550 
closed by pulling these straps from the
inside<00:02:33.800> of<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:33.980> cover<00:02:34.959> as<00:02:35.959> you<00:02:36.050> can<00:02:36.230> see<00:02:36.410> these

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
inside of the cover as you can see these

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.650 
inside of the cover as you can see these
straps<00:02:36.890> hold<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.220> cover<00:02:37.430> closed<00:02:37.790> now<00:02:38.450> these

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
straps hold the cover closed now these

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.449 
straps hold the cover closed now these
straps<00:02:38.900> are<00:02:39.080> reversible<00:02:39.590> so<00:02:39.860> if<00:02:39.920> we<00:02:40.040> flip<00:02:40.250> the

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
straps are reversible so if we flip the

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.100 
straps are reversible so if we flip the
cover<00:02:40.670> around<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.360> want<00:02:41.540> to<00:02:41.570> keep<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:41.900> cover

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
cover around and want to keep the cover

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.380 
cover around and want to keep the cover
open<00:02:42.370> we<00:02:43.370> just<00:02:43.580> pull<00:02:43.760> these<00:02:43.880> straps<00:02:44.180> around

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
open we just pull these straps around

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:51.160 
open we just pull these straps around
the<00:02:44.630> edge<00:02:44.780> so<00:02:49.420> there<00:02:50.420> we<00:02:50.510> go<00:02:50.630> those<00:02:50.840> aren't

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
the edge so there we go those aren't

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.660 
the edge so there we go those aren't
going<00:02:51.380> anywhere<00:02:51.500> one<00:02:51.950> of<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.160> great<00:02:52.310> features

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
going anywhere one of the great features

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.949 
going anywhere one of the great features
about<00:02:52.700> this<00:02:53.060> case<00:02:53.299> is<00:02:53.480> that<00:02:53.600> when<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:53.810> have<00:02:53.900> a

while<00:03:04.519> you're<00:03:04.670> walking<00:03:04.880> around<00:03:05.269> with<00:03:05.390> your

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
while you're walking around with your

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.590 
while you're walking around with your
iPad<00:03:06.160> I'm<00:03:07.160> also<00:03:07.310> finding<00:03:07.640> this<00:03:07.850> strap<00:03:08.180> useful

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
iPad I'm also finding this strap useful

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.020 
iPad I'm also finding this strap useful
for<00:03:08.750> other<00:03:08.870> things<00:03:09.200> so<00:03:09.890> for<00:03:10.010> example<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:10.579> iPad

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
for other things so for example the iPad

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.569 
for other things so for example the iPad
gets<00:03:11.239> quite<00:03:11.600> dirty<00:03:11.930> so<00:03:12.680> if<00:03:12.769> I<00:03:12.860> just<00:03:13.070> carry<00:03:13.489> this

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
gets quite dirty so if I just carry this

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.220 
gets quite dirty so if I just carry this
clean<00:03:13.910> cloth<00:03:14.180> in<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.510> strap<00:03:14.780> at<00:03:14.989> least<00:03:15.140> I

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
clean cloth in the strap at least I

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.199 
clean cloth in the strap at least I
always<00:03:15.500> have<00:03:15.680> it<00:03:15.799> with<00:03:15.950> me<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.940> cyber

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
always have it with me the cyber

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.120 
always have it with me the cyber
acoustic<00:03:17.660> case<00:03:17.870> also<00:03:18.260> features<00:03:18.620> a<00:03:18.650> propping

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
acoustic case also features a propping

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.640 
acoustic case also features a propping
mechanism<00:03:19.670> similar<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.180> that<00:03:20.329> of<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:21.140> Apple

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
mechanism similar to that of the Apple

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.430 
mechanism similar to that of the Apple
iPad<00:03:22.040> case<00:03:22.400> so<00:03:23.120> like<00:03:23.329> the<00:03:23.480> Apple<00:03:23.720> iPad<00:03:24.019> case<00:03:24.260> we

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
iPad case so like the Apple iPad case we

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.930 
iPad case so like the Apple iPad case we
have<00:03:24.530> a<00:03:24.560> crease<00:03:24.950> in<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:25.190> front<00:03:25.430> cover<00:03:25.640> right

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
have a crease in the front cover right

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.000 
have a crease in the front cover right
here<00:03:25.970> that<00:03:26.360> folds<00:03:26.780> under<00:03:26.930> so<00:03:27.620> if<00:03:27.680> you<00:03:27.769> fold

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
here that folds under so if you fold

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.610 
here that folds under so if you fold
that<00:03:28.100> back<00:03:28.450> we<00:03:29.450> also<00:03:29.630> have<00:03:29.930> a<00:03:29.959> little<00:03:30.290> clasp

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
that back we also have a little clasp

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.860 
that back we also have a little clasp
back<00:03:30.980> here<00:03:31.280> that<00:03:31.489> grips<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.970> cover<00:03:32.180> so<00:03:32.780> we'll

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
back here that grips the cover so we'll

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.110 
back here that grips the cover so we'll
just<00:03:33.019> slide<00:03:33.230> that<00:03:33.410> in<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.620> back<00:03:33.829> and<00:03:34.190> there

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
just slide that in the back and there

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.420 
just slide that in the back and there
you<00:03:35.239> go<00:03:35.390> so<00:03:36.350> that's<00:03:36.530> good<00:03:36.680> for<00:03:36.709> laps<00:03:37.100> or<00:03:37.400> a

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
you go so that's good for laps or a

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.490 
you go so that's good for laps or a
desktop<00:03:37.880> of<00:03:38.480> course<00:03:38.720> you<00:03:38.810> can<00:03:38.930> also<00:03:39.049> flip<00:03:39.380> it

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
desktop of course you can also flip it

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.720 
desktop of course you can also flip it
around<00:03:39.620> and<00:03:40.390> stand<00:03:41.390> it<00:03:41.540> up<00:03:42.310> so<00:03:43.310> as<00:03:43.430> you<00:03:43.579> can<00:03:43.670> see

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
around and stand it up so as you can see

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.460 
around and stand it up so as you can see
in<00:03:43.940> this<00:03:44.030> position<00:03:44.239> you<00:03:44.570> can<00:03:44.720> turn<00:03:44.900> your<00:03:45.079> iPad

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
into a little desktop computer you can

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.270 
into a little desktop computer you can
see<00:03:47.299> the<00:03:47.450> side<00:03:47.720> here<00:03:48.220> it's<00:03:49.220> very<00:03:49.519> stable<00:03:51.280> so

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
see the side here it's very stable so

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.039 
see the side here it's very stable so
all<00:03:52.430> you<00:03:52.549> have<00:03:52.670> to<00:03:52.700> do<00:03:52.910> is<00:03:53.120> add<00:03:53.420> an<00:03:53.660> Apple

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
all you have to do is add an Apple

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.289 
all you have to do is add an Apple
wireless<00:03:54.650> keyboard<00:03:55.130> and<00:03:55.310> you<00:03:55.579> have<00:03:55.790> a<00:03:55.820> little

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
wireless keyboard and you have a little

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.319 
wireless keyboard and you have a little
desktop<00:03:56.930> computer<00:03:57.760> so<00:03:58.760> let's<00:03:58.790> compare<00:03:59.180> this

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
desktop computer so let's compare this

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:01.000 
desktop computer so let's compare this
to<00:03:59.389> the<00:03:59.600> application<00:04:00.260> you<00:04:00.320> can<00:04:00.470> see<00:04:00.680> it's<00:04:00.829> a

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
to the application you can see it's a

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.780 
to the application you can see it's a
little<00:04:01.220> dirty<00:04:01.489> up

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
little dirty up

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.369 
little dirty up
try<00:04:01.969> cleaning<00:04:02.569> and<00:04:02.719> I'm<00:04:02.810> always<00:04:02.989> trying<00:04:03.290> to

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
try cleaning and I'm always trying to

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.009 
try cleaning and I'm always trying to
clean<00:04:03.620> this<00:04:03.799> it<00:04:04.310> tracks<00:04:04.640> a<00:04:04.760> lot<00:04:04.939> of<00:04:05.000> dirt<00:04:05.329> this

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
clean this it tracks a lot of dirt this

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.990 
clean this it tracks a lot of dirt this
of<00:04:06.319> course<00:04:06.349> is<00:04:06.709> smooth<00:04:07.219> leather<00:04:07.489> so<00:04:07.730> it's<00:04:07.849> very

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
of course is smooth leather so it's very

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.750 
of course is smooth leather so it's very
easy<00:04:08.209> to<00:04:08.359> clean<00:04:08.540> and<00:04:08.900> maintain<00:04:09.579> so<00:04:10.579> if<00:04:10.670> we

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
easy to clean and maintain so if we

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.580 
easy to clean and maintain so if we
compare<00:04:11.090> them<00:04:11.269> side-by-side<00:04:11.510> we<00:04:12.230> see<00:04:12.439> that

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
compare them side-by-side we see that

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.130 
compare them side-by-side we see that
the<00:04:12.829> iPad<00:04:13.609> cover<00:04:13.879> from<00:04:14.150> cyber<00:04:14.420> acoustic<00:04:14.959> is

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
the iPad cover from cyber acoustic is

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.590 
the iPad cover from cyber acoustic is
quite<00:04:15.500> a<00:04:15.680> bit<00:04:15.920> thicker<00:04:16.280> but<00:04:16.609> it's<00:04:17.180> also<00:04:17.359> more

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
quite a bit thicker but it's also more

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.529 
quite a bit thicker but it's also more
padded<00:04:18.109> and<00:04:18.289> again<00:04:18.650> it<00:04:18.769> has<00:04:18.889> that<00:04:19.329> clasp<00:04:20.329> in

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
padded and again it has that clasp in

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:21.849 
padded and again it has that clasp in
here<00:04:20.720> that<00:04:20.840> holds<00:04:21.139> on<00:04:21.229> to<00:04:21.380> it<00:04:21.500> and<00:04:21.650> adds

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
here that holds on to it and adds

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.129 
here that holds on to it and adds
additional<00:04:22.070> shock<00:04:22.610> protection<00:04:22.900> as<00:04:23.900> you<00:04:24.050> can

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
additional shock protection as you can

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.629 
additional shock protection as you can
see<00:04:24.289> the<00:04:24.410> Apple<00:04:24.740> cover<00:04:24.949> actually<00:04:25.340> covers

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
see the Apple cover actually covers

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:26.950 
see the Apple cover actually covers
everything<00:04:25.910> but<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.479> buttons<00:04:26.810> and<00:04:26.900> controls

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
everything but the buttons and controls

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.260 
everything but the buttons and controls
itself<00:04:27.680> and<00:04:28.340> the<00:04:28.430> important<00:04:28.759> thing<00:04:28.850> for<00:04:29.000> me<00:04:29.120> on

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
itself and the important thing for me on

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.090 
itself and the important thing for me on
the<00:04:29.360> cyber<00:04:29.570> acoustic<00:04:29.960> case<00:04:30.139> is<00:04:30.350> that<00:04:30.919> these

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
the cyber acoustic case is that these

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.590 
the cyber acoustic case is that these
corners<00:04:31.639> provide<00:04:31.970> a<00:04:32.000> lot<00:04:32.270> of<00:04:32.300> shock

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
corners provide a lot of shock

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.089 
corners provide a lot of shock
protection<00:04:32.780> if<00:04:33.259> you're<00:04:33.380> going<00:04:33.530> to<00:04:33.590> drop<00:04:33.830> it

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:34.099 
protection if you're going to drop it

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.070 
protection if you're going to drop it
you're<00:04:34.550> going<00:04:34.669> to<00:04:34.729> impact<00:04:35.060> on<00:04:35.300> the<00:04:35.419> corner<00:04:35.870> and

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
you're going to impact on the corner and

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.719 
you're going to impact on the corner and
that's<00:04:36.349> where<00:04:36.620> you<00:04:36.740> want<00:04:36.949> this<00:04:37.130> to<00:04:37.190> be<00:04:37.310> covered

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
that's where you want this to be covered

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:39.790 
that's where you want this to be covered
now<00:04:37.880> I've<00:04:38.210> had<00:04:38.330> many<00:04:38.570> covers<00:04:38.990> that<00:04:39.320> do<00:04:39.560> not

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
now I've had many covers that do not

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.080 
now I've had many covers that do not
protect<00:04:40.190> the<00:04:40.310> corners<00:04:40.550> and<00:04:40.759> that's<00:04:40.910> always

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
protect the corners and that's always

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.839 
protect the corners and that's always
concerned<00:04:41.599> me<00:04:41.750> so<00:04:42.440> although<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:43.039> sides<00:04:43.340> are<00:04:43.580> a

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:43.849 
concerned me so although the sides are a

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.240 
concerned me so although the sides are a
little<00:04:44.150> exposed<00:04:44.539> the<00:04:45.169> edge<00:04:45.440> of<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:46.039> case

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
little exposed the edge of the case

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.249 
little exposed the edge of the case
itself<00:04:46.639> and<00:04:46.910> these<00:04:47.180> rubber<00:04:47.599> feet<00:04:47.900> will

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:48.259 
itself and these rubber feet will

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.110 
itself and these rubber feet will
protect<00:04:48.680> all<00:04:48.979> the<00:04:49.160> important<00:04:49.580> parts<00:04:49.910> of

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
protect all the important parts of

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.240 
protect all the important parts of
course<00:04:51.050> the<00:04:51.139> cyber<00:04:51.349> acoustic<00:04:51.770> case<00:04:51.949> and<00:04:52.190> the

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
course the cyber acoustic case and the

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.159 
course the cyber acoustic case and the
Apple<00:04:52.550> iPad<00:04:52.849> case<00:04:53.120> have<00:04:53.300> a<00:04:53.389> similar<00:04:53.720> design<00:04:54.050> so

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
Apple iPad case have a similar design so

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.409 
Apple iPad case have a similar design so
they<00:04:54.289> both<00:04:54.470> have<00:04:54.740> this<00:04:54.979> crease<00:04:55.430> in<00:04:55.669> the<00:04:56.180> cover

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
they both have this crease in the cover

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.010 
they both have this crease in the cover
that<00:04:56.570> allows<00:04:56.750> you<00:04:56.900> to<00:04:57.020> fold<00:04:57.289> it<00:04:57.440> under<00:04:58.780> and<00:04:59.780> on

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
that allows you to fold it under and on

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.230 
that allows you to fold it under and on
the<00:05:00.139> back<00:05:00.349> they<00:05:01.009> both<00:05:01.250> have<00:05:01.550> this<00:05:01.789> clasp

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
the back they both have this clasp

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.080 
the back they both have this clasp
design<00:05:03.190> now<00:05:04.190> if<00:05:04.280> we<00:05:04.370> fold<00:05:04.580> it<00:05:04.699> back<00:05:04.820> we<00:05:04.940> see

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
design now if we fold it back we see

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.790 
design now if we fold it back we see
that<00:05:05.270> the<00:05:05.389> cyber<00:05:05.599> koushik<00:05:06.020> case<00:05:06.169> actually<00:05:06.470> has

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
that the cyber koushik case actually has

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.250 
that the cyber koushik case actually has
a<00:05:06.830> larger<00:05:07.310> foot<00:05:07.580> than<00:05:08.060> that<00:05:08.270> of<00:05:08.539> the<00:05:08.690> Apple

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
a larger foot than that of the Apple

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.950 
a larger foot than that of the Apple
iPad<00:05:09.590> case<00:05:09.970> so<00:05:10.970> once<00:05:11.150> again<00:05:11.240> this<00:05:11.419> is<00:05:11.479> Detroit

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
iPad case so once again this is Detroit
