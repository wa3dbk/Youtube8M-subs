00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
lowering the reps down and so I have my

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.870 
lowering the reps down and so I have my
uh<00:03:19.670> what<00:03:20.630> I<00:03:20.660> can<00:03:20.870> handle<00:03:21.520> then<00:03:22.520> after<00:03:22.730> that<00:03:22.820> I

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
uh what I can handle then after that I

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.570 
uh what I can handle then after that I
do<00:03:23.060> three<00:03:23.450> heavy<00:03:23.630> set<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:25.040> reason<00:03:25.340> why<00:03:25.460> I'm

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
do three heavy set the reason why I'm

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.040 
do three heavy set the reason why I'm
doing<00:03:25.610> drop<00:03:26.480> sets<00:03:26.810> is<00:03:27.280> for<00:03:28.280> this<00:03:28.370> reason<00:03:28.430> now

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
doing drop sets is for this reason now

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.870 
doing drop sets is for this reason now
because<00:03:30.050> when<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:30.740> go<00:03:30.890> heavy<00:03:31.160> for<00:03:31.610> three<00:03:31.790> to

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
because when you go heavy for three to

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.940 
because when you go heavy for three to
five<00:03:32.060> reps<00:03:32.560> you're<00:03:33.560> working<00:03:33.710> on<00:03:33.920> your

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
five reps you're working on your

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.070 
five reps you're working on your
strength<00:03:34.400> you're<00:03:35.000> gonna<00:03:35.120> get<00:03:35.330> stronger<00:03:35.660> over

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
strength you're gonna get stronger over

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.950 
strength you're gonna get stronger over
time<00:03:36.110> doing<00:03:36.710> that<00:03:36.830> and<00:03:37.540> your<00:03:38.540> muscles<00:03:38.720> will

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
time doing that and your muscles will

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.600 
time doing that and your muscles will
get<00:03:39.110> bigger<00:03:39.320> but<00:03:39.560> it<00:03:39.680> takes<00:03:39.800> long<00:03:40.100> but<00:03:40.490> you

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
get bigger but it takes long but you

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.270 
get bigger but it takes long but you
will<00:03:40.910> get<00:03:41.060> real<00:03:41.600> strong<00:03:41.990> doing<00:03:42.320> heavy<00:03:42.950> weights

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
will get real strong doing heavy weights

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.530 
will get real strong doing heavy weights
and<00:03:43.780> then<00:03:44.780> I<00:03:44.930> drop<00:03:45.290> said<00:03:45.620> I<00:03:45.800> you<00:03:45.890> know<00:03:46.130> I<00:03:46.540> put

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
and then I drop said I you know I put

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.560 
and then I drop said I you know I put
the<00:03:47.660> way<00:03:47.780> I<00:03:47.810> left<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:49.190> wait<00:03:49.370> about<00:03:50.030> 30<00:03:50.360> pounds

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
the way I left the wait about 30 pounds

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.860 
the way I left the wait about 30 pounds
less<00:03:51.430> or<00:03:52.430> like<00:03:52.880> what<00:03:53.270> they<00:03:53.330> say<00:03:53.480> twenty-five

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
less or like what they say twenty-five

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.110 
less or like what they say twenty-five
percent<00:03:53.990> loss<00:03:54.380> so<00:03:55.190> I<00:03:55.280> go<00:03:55.340> pushing<00:03:55.640> few<00:03:55.970> more

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
percent loss so I go pushing few more

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.449 
percent loss so I go pushing few more
reps<00:03:56.330> taking<00:03:57.110> my<00:03:57.200> muscles<00:03:57.590> to<00:03:57.800> more<00:03:58.010> failure

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
reps taking my muscles to more failure

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.330 
reps taking my muscles to more failure
so<00:03:58.790> they<00:03:58.910> could<00:03:59.030> get<00:03:59.120> bigger<00:03:59.770> eight<00:04:00.770> to<00:04:01.070> twelve

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
so they could get bigger eight to twelve

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.840 
so they could get bigger eight to twelve
reps<00:04:01.640> will<00:04:02.060> make<00:04:02.270> your<00:04:02.390> muscles<00:04:02.630> bigger<00:04:03.850> so

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
reps will make your muscles bigger so

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
and I'm also doing bodybuilding

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.199 
and I'm also doing bodybuilding
basically<00:04:09.650> pushing<00:04:10.040> up<00:04:10.190> my<00:04:10.730> muscles<00:04:10.880> to<00:04:11.180> the

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
basically pushing up my muscles to the

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.960 
basically pushing up my muscles to the
limit<00:04:11.570> and<00:04:11.920> me<00:04:12.920> and<00:04:13.100> try<00:04:13.340> to<00:04:13.400> make<00:04:13.550> them<00:04:13.760> bigger

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
limit and me and try to make them bigger

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.670 
limit and me and try to make them bigger
and<00:04:14.180> stronger<00:04:14.420> at<00:04:14.630> the<00:04:14.690> same<00:04:14.900> time<00:04:15.110> this

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
and stronger at the same time this

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.650 
and stronger at the same time this
allows<00:04:16.070> me<00:04:16.100> to<00:04:16.370> learn<00:04:16.640> a<00:04:16.700> lot<00:04:16.850> more<00:04:17.000> calories

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
allows me to learn a lot more calories

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.860 
allows me to learn a lot more calories
so<00:04:18.470> if<00:04:18.560> I'm<00:04:18.650> burning<00:04:18.920> a<00:04:18.980> lot<00:04:19.100> more<00:04:19.250> calories

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
so if I'm burning a lot more calories

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.400 
so if I'm burning a lot more calories
I'm<00:04:20.870> gonna<00:04:21.109> burn<00:04:21.380> a<00:04:21.410> lot<00:04:21.560> more<00:04:21.739> fat

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
I'm gonna burn a lot more fat
