repeat what I told you yesterday the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.040 
repeat what I told you yesterday the
scientist<00:00:41.790> shouldn't<00:00:42.149> be<00:00:42.270> surprised<00:00:42.719> when<00:00:43.020> a

particles racing towards Earth it was

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.720 
particles racing towards Earth it was
right<00:00:48.930> on<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.110> earth<00:00:49.320> footprint<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.100> warned

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
right on the earth footprint I warned

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.100 
right on the earth footprint I warned
that<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:50.940> was<00:00:51.120> possible<00:00:51.600> before<00:00:51.989> it

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
that this was possible before it

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.010 
that this was possible before it
happened<00:00:52.500> using<00:00:52.980> their<00:00:53.280> own<00:00:53.520> rules<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.210> their

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
happened using their own rules so their

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.130 
happened using their own rules so their
confusion<00:00:55.590> kind<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.190> confuses<00:00:56.850> me<00:00:57.090> we<00:00:57.989> had<00:00:58.109> a
