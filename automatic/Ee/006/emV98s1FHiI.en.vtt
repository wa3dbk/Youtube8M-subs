I<00:05:07.600> don't<00:05:08.600> like<00:05:08.780> the<00:05:08.930> rides<00:05:09.140> set<00:05:09.500> that<00:05:10.400> make<00:05:10.610> you

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
I don't like the rides set that make you

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
sick and they generally are the rides

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.140 
sick and they generally are the rides
that<00:05:12.410> kind<00:05:12.680> of<00:05:12.740> rotate<00:05:13.190> you<00:05:13.370> in<00:05:13.520> in<00:05:13.940> two

that kind of rotate you in in two
directions<00:05:14.720> at<00:05:14.900> one<00:05:15.080> time<00:05:15.380> this<00:05:16.130> ride<00:05:16.400> the

g-forces consistent in one direction and

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.830 
g-forces consistent in one direction and
you're<00:05:19.310> really<00:05:19.580> not<00:05:19.730> spinning<00:05:20.180> in<00:05:20.360> a<00:05:20.420> circle

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.500 
as rapidly as you are on a smaller ride
and<00:05:24.830> definitely<00:05:25.280> this<00:05:25.490> is<00:05:25.550> not<00:05:25.700> a<00:05:25.880> ride<00:05:26.360> that

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510
