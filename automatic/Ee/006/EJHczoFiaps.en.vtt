00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello how are you talking to yadira andrade 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.210
 Welcome to one more episode of the mailbox 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.210
 of the diabetic 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.710
 today's question sends us 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.010
 Juan and tell us 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.580
 because muscle mass is lost 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.460
 mainly in the extremities 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.980
 inferiors and what should be done to 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.380
 win what was lost 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.680
 -juan from the age of 30 most 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.650
 of men starts a decrease in 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.720
 the amount of muscle fibers 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.560
 moreover it is said that men of 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:42.420
 between 25 and 60 years begin to lose 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:44.910
 Up to 5% of muscle mass per year 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.969
 to keep in mind that diabetes is a 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.730
 metabolism disorder people 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.350
 with diabetes can lose weight 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.370
 easily when they do not have a diet 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.920
 balanced 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.579
 by not receiving the necessary proteins 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.120
 the body is forced to take them from 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.220
 muscles and other tissues you mention 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.120
 control your glucose and perform 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.650
 exercise regularly if this is so 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.110
 let's think about what kind of exercises 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.670
 you do and how complete is your 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.770
 feeding 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.680
 you should know that the loss of mass 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.290
 muscle in lower extremities 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.530
 it can be by anatomy the form 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.899
 anatomical man is android and wide 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.479
 from above and narrow from below as in 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:33.479
 cone shape contrary to the 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.670
 women another reason is that if you perform that 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.700
 cardiovascular exercise what more 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.860
 works are the legs when performing 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.740
 cardiovascular exercise what is 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.229
 burn are fats and hydrates but in 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.479
 small quantities are also used 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.659
 the amino acids of proteins 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.810
 muscles especially if the exercise is 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.909
 extends for more than 40 minutes to 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.929
 increase your muscle mass I'll give you 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:04.409
 Three recommendations number 1 exercises 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:06.959
 with weights if our muscles do not have 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.810
 Encourage enough to continue 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:12.360
 growing or staying will come a 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.760
 moment in which our body will know 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.130
 that with less muscle mass is 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.360
 enough to carry out the activities 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.640
 daily 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.560
 then it will begin to decrease number 2 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.260
 balanced feed a consumption 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.380
 adequate protein in quantity and 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.140
 quality with a lot of weight training that 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.840
 let's do if we do not go to the organism that 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.390
 material in the form of amino acids for 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.330
 that build muscle alone never 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.450
 it will do it without the proteins the body 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.990
 resort to cannibalism, that is, using 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.940
 of the muscle itself 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:55.510
 number 3 rest asleep enough 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.130
 and have a good quality sleep 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.010
 activates the hormones that allow the 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.190
 muscle grow if we interfere in this 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:08.600
 phase we can begin to notice the loss 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:11.510
 of muscle mass so train eat 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.000
 well and sleep better are the key to 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.130
 keep the muscle intact 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.680
 I hope my answer is a lot 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.960
 help for you if you want me to respond 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.270
 your doubts and concerns that enters 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.060
 eradicate diabetes dotcom with 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.820
 something they are or leave us a comment with your 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.580
 ask below this video and you 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.459
 I will answer in future episodes has you 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.270
 spoken yadira andrade see you in the
