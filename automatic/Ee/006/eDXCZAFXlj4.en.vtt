you<00:00:28.529> how<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.710> build<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.070> camera<00:00:29.460> slide<00:00:29.760> and

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
you how I build a camera slide and

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.970 
you how I build a camera slide and
there's<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.210> lot<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.449> big<00:00:30.689> one<00:00:30.900> like<00:00:31.679> some<00:00:31.920> of

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
there's a lot of big one like some of

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.590 
there's a lot of big one like some of
the<00:00:32.040> other<00:00:32.130> ones<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.579> i<00:00:32.669> had<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> door

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
the other ones that i had this is a door

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.720 
the other ones that i had this is a door
that<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:34.020> actually<00:00:34.110> carry<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.890> actually

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
that I can actually carry and actually

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.410 
that I can actually carry and actually
use<00:00:35.940> oil<00:00:36.180> every<00:00:36.420> day<00:00:36.600> basis<00:00:41.149> getting<00:00:42.149> close<00:00:42.390> to

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
use oil every day basis getting close to

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.150 
use oil every day basis getting close to
the<00:00:42.660> thorn<00:00:42.899> bills<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.469> paddle<00:00:43.829> oats<00:00:43.980> is

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
the thorn bills and paddle oats is

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.970 
the thorn bills and paddle oats is
pretty<00:00:44.850> well<00:00:45.030> impossible<00:00:45.680> so<00:00:46.680> what<00:00:46.829> I've<00:00:46.950> done

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
pretty well impossible so what I've done

00:00:46.980 --> 00:04:06.289 
pretty well impossible so what I've done
is<00:00:47.250> try<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.579> get<00:00:47.789> them<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.059> come<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.480> me

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.399 

okay<00:04:07.299> it's<00:04:07.540> time<00:04:07.690> to<00:04:07.870> retreat<00:04:08.200> to<00:04:08.230> the

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:08.409 
okay it's time to retreat to the

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.490 
okay it's time to retreat to the
workshop<00:04:09.030> I've<00:04:10.030> built<00:04:10.299> much<00:04:10.510> larger<00:04:10.540> sliders

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
workshop I've built much larger sliders

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.130 
workshop I've built much larger sliders
up<00:04:11.769> to<00:04:11.950> 6<00:04:12.159> meters<00:04:12.340> long<00:04:12.760> with<00:04:13.659> pan<00:04:13.870> and<00:04:14.049> tilt

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
up to 6 meters long with pan and tilt

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.960 
up to 6 meters long with pan and tilt
heads<00:04:14.409> on<00:04:14.590> them<00:04:14.769> but<00:04:15.250> they're<00:04:15.430> just<00:04:15.580> too<00:04:15.730> hard

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
heads on them but they're just too hard

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.460 
heads on them but they're just too hard
to<00:04:16.090> handle<00:04:16.180> by<00:04:16.600> myself<00:04:16.630> and<00:04:17.109> most<00:04:17.320> of<00:04:17.410> my

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
to handle by myself and most of my

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.960 
to handle by myself and most of my
filming<00:04:17.769> is<00:04:17.889> done<00:04:17.919> in<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.220> bush<00:04:18.400> promise<00:04:18.820> I've

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
filming is done in the bush promise I've

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.759 
filming is done in the bush promise I've
sewn<00:04:19.150> to<00:04:19.329> the<00:04:19.359> small<00:04:19.720> slider<00:04:20.350> that<00:04:20.560> I<00:04:20.620> could

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
sewn to the small slider that I could

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.830 
sewn to the small slider that I could
carry<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:21.940> woman<00:04:22.270> that<00:04:22.300> was<00:04:22.479> still<00:04:22.690> big

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
carry the woman that was still big

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.659 
carry the woman that was still big
enough<00:04:22.900> to<00:04:23.169> carry<00:04:23.350> a<00:04:23.530> bigger<00:04:23.770> camera<00:04:24.070> like<00:04:24.340> the

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
enough to carry a bigger camera like the

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:31.379 
enough to carry a bigger camera like the
sony<00:04:24.940> fs700<00:04:29.280> so<00:04:30.280> hence<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.699> design<00:04:31.060> with<00:04:31.360> the

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
sony fs700 so hence the design with the

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.610 
sony fs700 so hence the design with the
carriage<00:04:32.020> running<00:04:32.380> inside<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:33.270> rails

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
carriage running inside the rails

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.020 
carriage running inside the rails
everything's<00:04:35.620> nice<00:04:35.830> and<00:04:35.860> confined<00:04:36.460> inside<00:04:36.610> no

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
everything's nice and confined inside no

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.810 
everything's nice and confined inside no
dude<00:04:37.270> can<00:04:37.510> get<00:04:37.690> in<00:04:37.840> and<00:04:38.740> it's<00:04:39.039> much<00:04:39.370> easier<00:04:39.400> to

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
dude can get in and it's much easier to

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:51.719 
dude can get in and it's much easier to
carry<00:04:40.060> doesn't<00:04:40.419> get<00:04:40.510> caught<00:04:40.720> on<00:04:40.900> things<00:04:41.199> I<00:04:50.729> put

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
carry doesn't get caught on things I put

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.850 
carry doesn't get caught on things I put
extra<00:04:52.000> threaded<00:04:52.389> holes<00:04:52.600> in<00:04:52.810> the<00:04:52.930> end<00:04:53.080> of<00:04:53.229> it<00:04:53.320> so

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
extra threaded holes in the end of it so

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.560 
extra threaded holes in the end of it so
the<00:04:54.039> later<00:04:54.070> stage<00:04:54.520> I<00:04:54.669> can<00:04:54.820> add<00:04:54.940> a<00:04:54.970> motor<00:04:55.270> and

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
the later stage I can add a motor and

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.600 
the later stage I can add a motor and
drive<00:04:55.600> and<00:04:56.080> an<00:04:56.139> XL<00:04:56.500> cable<00:04:56.979> up<00:04:57.070> the<00:04:57.190> center<00:04:57.550> of

carriage the most crucial point of the

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.080 
carriage the most crucial point of the
slider<00:05:03.070> is<00:05:03.250> where<00:05:03.460> the<00:05:03.580> stainless<00:05:04.060> steel

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090

bearings meet the plastic rails I tried

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.810 
bearings meet the plastic rails I tried
a<00:05:07.840> few<00:05:08.050> different<00:05:08.110> things<00:05:08.530> for<00:05:08.860> the<00:05:08.919> rails<00:05:09.190> but

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
a few different things for the rails but

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.029 
a few different things for the rails but

16 by 16 millimeter seem to be the

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:16.110 
16 by 16 millimeter seem to be the
smoothest<00:05:14.560> thing<00:05:14.860> I<00:05:15.070> could<00:05:15.220> find<00:05:15.250> it<00:05:15.789> was<00:05:15.940> also

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
smoothest thing I could find it was also

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.430 
smoothest thing I could find it was also
very<00:05:16.300> cheap<00:05:18.419> the<00:05:19.419> opposed<00:05:19.750> ball<00:05:20.050> bearings

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
very cheap the opposed ball bearings

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.860 
very cheap the opposed ball bearings
also<00:05:20.740> allow<00:05:20.979> the<00:05:21.400> slider<00:05:21.940> to<00:05:22.090> be<00:05:22.270> used<00:05:22.450> upside

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
also allow the slider to be used upside
