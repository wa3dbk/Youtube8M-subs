00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.630
 kids the flea like this 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:21.509
 with this goal first 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.909
 today we learn that he is working eric fiction series 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.329
 it was just this guy 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.199
 Viktor looks at what 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.150
 the eighth recopa in the series 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.740
 it has been seen that in this week 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.640
 obviously he is asking me for pichetto 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.610
 candela hands because 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.770
 the client is the same 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.770
 for now he asked for the same forest new sears store in chicago 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.700
 security 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.700
 obviously you pass without doing casting basically the same 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.490
 and obviously as a transmitter 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.360
 somewhat similar nothing but the voice 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.070
 I met figurillas money according to sotoca and that he heard because I at the beginning 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.070
 I thought 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.240
 It does not turn out that you are presented with a chapter which is going to be cooked and 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.980
 I do not know why 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.170
 photo that koke forlan 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.380
 if there are few changes 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.230
 how I believed global 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.100
 chop on your part 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.780
 out there chilean way in force for him 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.990
 how good is wonderful because after 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.990
 is going to be a character all 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:32.980
 about 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.600
 but those things happen 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.220
 but soon when villanueva has said paco certified eight dates are missing 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.900
 we are invisible it will 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.380
 why do you explore the conference couple reporters who is not partying 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.870
 Becerra behind 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:46.890
 wonderful 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.890
 wonderful I loved this party fifth part I liked it 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.270
 in general of everything 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.860
 the dubbing 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.210
 in the film 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.040
 the production 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.230
 the address or 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.020
 is the improvements is the best book 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.080
 at least for my taste to be from the seas 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.059
 forced to go there 

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:12.549
 and I think that 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.789
 villafuerte and the world 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:17.279
 I am very happy this plan is better 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:19.709
 not because I've felt 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.709
 but the director leaving 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.119
 the closing of a form 

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:30.269
 the result was possible 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.079
 so much did you get involved in this movie 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:33.900
 this hobby 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.900
 good since they made you read the first news 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:40.259
 quique estevanez 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:42.749
 at the beginning they told me 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:44.209
 in the first movie 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.499
 I did not read it 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:49.609
 as I was saying and above 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.509
 little by little with 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:54.509
 Spending time because I was a little better 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.030

00:03:05.029 --> 00:03:08.029

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:15.129
 a day after that love and friendship 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.129
 not very important that we will have to win 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.379

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:31.219
 as a country to talk to others 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.629
 lávrov I got myself 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.049
 to propagate 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.709

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:01.269
 Here I was stung by this 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.679
 They have not dedicated my work to burning it 

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:07.959
 for more than four tenths of the model pj 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.959
