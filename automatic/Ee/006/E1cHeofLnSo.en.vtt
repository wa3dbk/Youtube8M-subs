00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hi to all and the room in this 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.000
 video I was talking to you about a movie that will have 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.890
 probably never take place on gta 5 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.800
 I will also explain why he 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.509
 will never take place so watch this does not 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.340
 not to be confused with the video that I you 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.660
 did the last time in which 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.180
 I told you there was a movie on 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.580
 gta 5 that was going to be done so the movie 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.270
 on the bbc so that the bbc is preparing on 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.279
 GTA 5 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.570
 it's a film that takes the course of 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.029
 gta 5 from the beginning 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.050
 so how was it done below 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.269
 from gta 5 etc 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.880
 everything will be in this movie there basically they 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.290
 want to adapt the story of Gta May 5 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.440
 cinematically while there we 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.579
 talk about an action movie at the gta then 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.079
 there was desire on the part of 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.090
 rockstar to donate it you go 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.440
 see that after as I told you there is 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.840
 very unlikely for a movie 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.559
 adapted from GTA is born in the 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.090
 coming years 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.460
 which does not mean that it will be done 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.949
 never so why that why a 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.469
 movie like that bah will not be or will have to 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.180
 bad to do is to cover the 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.710
 co-chair and co- founder of 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.930
 rockstar games who made a statement 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.940
 at the time of the release of gt5 about it 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.860
 so that's what he said we were told 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.430
 proposed to make this film several times 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.619
 even 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.240
 but every time we meet you with 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.280
 Hollywood convinced us to stay 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.409
 in the video game ever there we 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.900
 would not have the same creative freedom that to 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.430
 our eyes is priceless to the second 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.000
 you sign with hollywood you lose 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.310
 Control 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.320
 they have test methods that are 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.450
 so far from our philosophy 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.130
 so that's what he basically said 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.170
 he does not want to go through hollywood for 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.329
 not lose all the freedom that rockstar 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.340
 games on the game so on it he has 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.930
 not wrong it would be stupid to give 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.540
 stock rights to hollywood while 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.770
 I was at theirs entirely from 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.380
 shot since there is no action movie 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.329
 based on gta there is a trailer that 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.340
 was created from several movies 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.290
 already existing they took over several 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.479
 pieces of movies to make a band 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.000
 announcement that would have looked like that of 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.170
 gta movie if he had existed then this 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.820
 trailer I put you the link in 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.710
 the description of the video for not 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.990
 precisely take the work to his 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.420
 author I prefer that those who want 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.610
 see her look directly at her 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.590
 string of its author so watch this 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.750
 risk of making you dream of seeing this 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.129
 trailer I warn you that would be 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.200
 so good that rockstar finds a 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.670
 agree with hollywood or davet 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.280
 someone else is not necessarily with 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.780
 hollywood to fit gta in movie he 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.120
 need a lot of money so know he 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.890
 needs a good investor with a 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.430
 trilogy it would be not bad or several 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.959
 episodes even of gta the bet stays when 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.019
 even quite risky but I would see well 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.060
 a series with several seasons on gta 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.160
 in film there are things like that that 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.630
 seem huge and impractical and 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.550
 then overnight we have the 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.500
 surprise what happen at once 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.910
 in the meantime do not forget to go in 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.660
 the description of the video to go 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.819
 see the trailer 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.230
 it left me dreamy it will leave you 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.640
 may be dreamy you too there are 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.709
 good actors in the trailers 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.660
 that they finally chose in the mix of 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.860
 movies they chose you'll see 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.319
 it's just huge 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.730
 a gta movie that looks like that 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.650
 it would be beautiful 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.720
 in any case it is not for the moment if 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.760
 never one day there is an agreement that will 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.040
 done or even an early okay I you 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.660
 will share it directly that's all 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.200
 for this video and I tell you to 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.860
 see you later 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.860
 chacha top
