00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
flour on your surface the dough won't

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.839 
flour on your surface the dough won't
absorb<00:02:26.220> more<00:02:26.940> flour<00:02:27.239> than<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.569> can<00:02:27.720> take<00:02:27.930> so

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
absorb more flour than it can take so

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.080

something<00:03:07.230> else<00:03:07.769> I<00:03:07.859> can't<00:03:08.340> just<00:03:08.549> form<00:03:08.790> this

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
something else I can't just form this

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.629 
something else I can't just form this
into<00:03:09.239> a<00:03:09.299> ball<00:03:09.780> push<00:03:10.620> it<00:03:10.739> out<00:03:10.859> again<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.310> try<00:03:11.579> to

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
into a ball push it out again and try to

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.009 
into a ball push it out again and try to
make<00:03:11.880> more<00:03:12.299> viscous<00:03:12.600> out<00:03:12.750> of<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:12.930> because

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
make more viscous out of it because

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.229 
make more viscous out of it because
you'll<00:03:13.260> actually<00:03:13.440> by<00:03:14.069> refolding<00:03:14.700> in<00:03:14.790> emotion

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
you'll actually by refolding in emotion

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.550 
you'll actually by refolding in emotion
you're<00:03:15.420> gonna<00:03:15.540> lose<00:03:15.810> this<00:03:16.019> flaky<00:03:16.410> layers

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
you're gonna lose this flaky layers

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.960 
you're gonna lose this flaky layers
which<00:03:16.829> is<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.040> whole<00:03:17.190> point<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:17.639> biscuit

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
which is the whole point of the biscuit

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.390 
which is the whole point of the biscuit
so<00:03:18.150> this<00:03:18.660> unfortunately<00:03:19.350> we<00:03:19.920> have<00:03:20.069> to<00:03:20.190> be<00:03:20.280> done

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
so this unfortunately we have to be done

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.870 
so this unfortunately we have to be done
with<00:03:20.609> it

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
with it

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.780 
with it

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
so my oven is preheated at 425 degrees

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.610 
so my oven is preheated at 425 degrees
and<00:03:24.000> I'm<00:03:24.090> gonna<00:03:24.209> pop<00:03:24.480> these<00:03:24.720> in<00:03:24.780> until<00:03:25.230> golden
