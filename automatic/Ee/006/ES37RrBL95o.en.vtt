his first or one of his starting probes

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.080 
his first or one of his starting probes
and<00:00:33.480> he<00:00:34.200> was<00:00:34.350> going<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.590> actually<00:00:35.030> create<00:00:36.030> a

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
and he was going to actually create a

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.470 
and he was going to actually create a
pylon<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.570> create<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> forward<00:00:38.040> base<00:00:38.480> very

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
pylon and create a forward base very

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.750 
pylon and create a forward base very
close<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.930> my<00:00:40.110> base<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:41.309> reason<00:00:41.579> why<00:00:41.700> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
close to my base the reason why the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.080 
close to my base the reason why the
people<00:00:42.390> might<00:00:42.840> try<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:44.090> because

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
people might try this is that because

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.029 
people might try this is that because
you've<00:00:45.329> built<00:00:45.600> your<00:00:45.750> gateway<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.410> close<00:00:46.710> to

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
you've built your gateway so close to

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.010 
you've built your gateway so close to
the<00:00:47.219> enemy<00:00:47.399> base<00:00:47.610> there's<00:00:48.600> not<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.809> lot<00:00:48.989> of

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
the enemy base there's not a lot of

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.299 
the enemy base there's not a lot of
running<00:00:49.890> time<00:00:50.129> for<00:00:50.700> your<00:00:51.149> actual<00:00:51.750> units<00:00:52.309> which

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
running time for your actual units which

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.229 
running time for your actual units which
gives<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> bit<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.820> advantage<00:00:55.100> so<00:00:56.149> but<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
gives you a bit of advantage so but the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.630 
gives you a bit of advantage so but the
point<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.899> two<00:00:58.739> things<00:00:58.920> speed<00:00:59.370> and

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
point of this is two things speed and

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.319 
point of this is two things speed and
not<00:00:59.789> being<00:01:00.050> detected<00:01:01.190> so<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.640> far<00:01:02.879> he<00:01:03.030> hasn't

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
not being detected so so far he hasn't

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.590 
not being detected so so far he hasn't
been<00:01:03.539> detected<00:01:04.019> by<00:01:04.140> me<00:01:04.350> I'm<00:01:05.250> used<00:01:05.549> I'm<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:06.240> got

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
been detected by me I'm used I'm I got

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.539 
been detected by me I'm used I'm I got
my<00:01:06.720> first<00:01:06.869> pylon<00:01:07.380> out<00:01:07.439> as<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:08.040> can<00:01:08.100> see<00:01:08.310> I'm<00:01:08.430> up

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
my first pylon out as you can see I'm up

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.600 
my first pylon out as you can see I'm up
to<00:01:08.670> 11<00:01:09.000> probes<00:01:09.299> he<00:01:09.780> only<00:01:09.930> has<00:01:10.140> eight<00:01:10.500> pros<00:01:10.860> so

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
to 11 probes he only has eight pros so

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.969 
to 11 probes he only has eight pros so
there's<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.790> big<00:01:11.939> economy<00:01:12.420> difference<00:01:12.720> already

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
there's a big economy difference already

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.530 
there's a big economy difference already
he<00:01:13.979> gets<00:01:14.159> his<00:01:14.369> first<00:01:14.610> gateway<00:01:15.060> out<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> little

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
he gets his first gateway out a little

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.080 
he gets his first gateway out a little
bit<00:01:15.689> before<00:01:15.869> mine<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.500> get<00:01:17.220> my<00:01:17.369> gateway<00:01:17.759> out<00:01:17.880> and

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
bit before mine I get my gateway out and

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.020 
bit before mine I get my gateway out and
then<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.720> send<00:01:19.020> my<00:01:19.200> probe<00:01:19.560> down<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.979> scout<00:01:20.250> the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
then I send my probe down to scout the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.330 
then I send my probe down to scout the
whole<00:01:21.390> point<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:21.990> at<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.350> point<00:01:22.590> is

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
whole point of that at this point is

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.200 
whole point of that at this point is
that<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.970> have

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
that I have

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.230 
that I have
I've<00:01:26.210> always<00:01:26.450> already<00:01:26.899> have<00:01:27.170> 13<00:01:27.649> probes<00:01:28.240> so

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
I've always already have 13 probes so

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.620 
I've always already have 13 probes so
they're<00:01:29.780> getting<00:01:30.429> boosting<00:01:31.429> my<00:01:31.549> economy<00:01:32.000> but

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
they're getting boosting my economy but

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.569 
they're getting boosting my economy but
I'm<00:01:33.020> letting<00:01:33.350> that<00:01:33.469> one<00:01:33.679> probe<00:01:33.979> go<00:01:34.159> down<00:01:34.369> to

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
I'm letting that one probe go down to

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.100 
I'm letting that one probe go down to
scout<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:36.880> at<00:01:37.880> this<00:01:38.090> point<00:01:38.360> I<00:01:38.600> really<00:01:38.630> should

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
scout and at this point I really should

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.340 
scout and at this point I really should
have<00:01:39.200> recognized<00:01:39.740> that<00:01:39.979> he<00:01:40.600> must<00:01:41.600> be<00:01:41.750> proxying

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
have recognized that he must be proxying

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.429 
have recognized that he must be proxying
me<00:01:42.619> because<00:01:43.369> any<00:01:43.640> Protoss<00:01:44.149> at<00:01:44.719> this<00:01:45.079> point<00:01:45.350> in

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
me because any Protoss at this point in

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.199 
me because any Protoss at this point in
the<00:01:45.500> game<00:01:45.530> will<00:01:45.890> have<00:01:46.039> at<00:01:46.219> least<00:01:46.250> a<00:01:46.640> pylon<00:01:47.030> in

00:01:47.199 --> 00:01:47.209 
the game will have at least a pylon in

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:50.399 
the game will have at least a pylon in
their<00:01:47.360> base<00:01:47.740> probably<00:01:48.740> one<00:01:49.219> to<00:01:49.369> two<00:01:49.520> gateways

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
their base probably one to two gateways

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.440 
their base probably one to two gateways
you<00:01:51.409> know<00:01:51.500> much<00:01:51.799> like<00:01:52.039> how<00:01:52.189> my<00:01:52.369> basis<00:01:52.850> is<00:01:53.179> set

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
you know much like how my basis is set

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.449 
you know much like how my basis is set
up<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:54.289> the<00:01:54.770> fact<00:01:54.979> that<00:01:55.069> he<00:01:55.189> doesn't<00:01:55.369> have

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459 
up so the fact that he doesn't have

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:56.830 
up so the fact that he doesn't have
anything<00:01:55.729> in<00:01:55.909> there<00:01:56.119> really<00:01:56.479> should<00:01:56.750> have

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
anything in there really should have

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.539 
anything in there really should have
told<00:01:57.170> me<00:01:57.380> that<00:01:57.560> he<00:01:57.649> is<00:01:57.739> going<00:01:57.890> to<00:01:57.979> proxy<00:01:58.340> but<00:01:58.489> I

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
told me that he is going to proxy but I

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.270 
told me that he is going to proxy but I
didn't<00:01:59.049> the<00:02:00.049> red<00:02:00.229> flag<00:02:00.409> didn't<00:02:00.709> start<00:02:00.920> waving

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
didn't the red flag didn't start waving

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.229 
didn't the red flag didn't start waving
till<00:02:01.459> just<00:02:02.360> a<00:02:02.450> few<00:02:02.659> more<00:02:02.869> minutes<00:02:03.110> but<00:02:04.119> even<00:02:05.119> as

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:05.239 
till just a few more minutes but even as

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:07.539 
till just a few more minutes but even as
such<00:02:05.420> it<00:02:05.599> didn't<00:02:05.869> really<00:02:05.989> matter<00:02:06.200> I<00:02:06.500> had<00:02:07.399> my

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
such it didn't really matter I had my

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.240 
such it didn't really matter I had my
first<00:02:07.670> gave<00:02:07.939> way<00:02:08.119> out<00:02:08.299> my<00:02:09.170> first<00:02:09.410> zealot<00:02:10.099> is

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
first gave way out my first zealot is

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.059 
first gave way out my first zealot is
being<00:02:10.549> built<00:02:10.959> using<00:02:11.959> the<00:02:12.200> chrono<00:02:12.440> boost<00:02:12.709> so

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
being built using the chrono boost so

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.130 
being built using the chrono boost so
it'll<00:02:13.340> come<00:02:13.489> off<00:02:13.579> faster<00:02:14.060> it's<00:02:14.720> around<00:02:14.959> this

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
it'll come off faster it's around this

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.780 
it'll come off faster it's around this
point<00:02:15.470> in<00:02:15.620> time<00:02:15.799> where<00:02:16.130> I<00:02:16.160> actually<00:02:16.400> realized

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
point in time where I actually realized

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.569 
point in time where I actually realized
that<00:02:17.269> oh<00:02:17.480> there's<00:02:17.810> he<00:02:18.200> must<00:02:18.799> be<00:02:18.890> proxying<00:02:19.430> me

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
that oh there's he must be proxying me

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.150 
that oh there's he must be proxying me
because<00:02:19.760> he<00:02:19.819> has<00:02:19.880> nothing<00:02:20.480> in<00:02:20.569> his<00:02:20.630> base<00:02:21.130> so<00:02:22.130> I

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
because he has nothing in his base so I

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.100 
because he has nothing in his base so I
bring<00:02:22.519> down<00:02:22.700> two<00:02:22.940> probes<00:02:23.239> from<00:02:23.480> my<00:02:23.690> minerals

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
bring down two probes from my minerals

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.920 
bring down two probes from my minerals
to<00:02:24.349> build<00:02:25.099> a<00:02:25.190> gateway<00:02:25.519> and<00:02:25.670> also<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.000> act<00:02:26.599> as<00:02:26.900> a

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
to build a gateway and also to act as a

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.530 
to build a gateway and also to act as a
little<00:02:27.200> bit<00:02:27.290> extra<00:02:27.410> damage<00:02:27.799> in<00:02:28.129> case<00:02:28.310> Oh<00:02:28.549> in

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
little bit extra damage in case Oh in

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.740 
little bit extra damage in case Oh in
case<00:02:29.720> when<00:02:30.380> he<00:02:30.590> attacked<00:02:30.920> for<00:02:31.220> when<00:02:31.340> he<00:02:31.430> attack

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
case when he attacked for when he attack

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.120 
case when he attacked for when he attack
so<00:02:32.750> now<00:02:32.900> I<00:02:32.930> need<00:02:33.200> that<00:02:33.319> I<00:02:33.380> know<00:02:33.709> I<00:02:33.829> need<00:02:34.010> to

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
so now I need that I know I need to

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.940 
so now I need that I know I need to
build<00:02:34.519> big<00:02:35.180> losses<00:02:35.389> furiously<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.440> fast<00:02:36.739> as

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
build big losses furiously and fast as

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.920 
build big losses furiously and fast as
possible<00:02:37.160> so<00:02:37.910> he<00:02:37.940> gets<00:02:38.180> his<00:02:38.329> second<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:38.750> third

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
possible so he gets his second and third

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:39.910 
possible so he gets his second and third
out<00:02:39.079> and<00:02:39.319> now<00:02:39.410> it's<00:02:39.440> time

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
out and now it's time

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.339 
out and now it's time
and<00:02:40.069> charged<00:02:40.430> I'm<00:02:41.270> just<00:02:41.750> kind<00:02:41.990> of<00:02:42.050> wait<00:02:42.319> a

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
and charged I'm just kind of wait a

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.740 
and charged I'm just kind of wait a
little<00:02:42.680> bit<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.099> then<00:02:43.360> attacking<00:02:44.360> because<00:02:44.690> I

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
little bit and then attacking because I

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.870 
little bit and then attacking because I
know<00:02:44.810> my<00:02:45.050> second<00:02:45.440> zealots<00:02:45.770> coming<00:02:46.040> out<00:02:46.190> so

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
know my second zealots coming out so

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.589 
know my second zealots coming out so
will<00:02:47.090> actually<00:02:47.450> kill<00:02:47.690> one<00:02:47.900> of<00:02:47.930> his<00:02:48.200> but<00:02:49.599> we

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
will actually kill one of his but we

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:51.910 
will actually kill one of his but we
know<00:02:50.720> that<00:02:50.900> we're<00:02:51.050> probably<00:02:51.260> no<00:02:51.500> match<00:02:51.739> at

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
know that we're probably no match at

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.979 
know that we're probably no match at
this<00:02:52.040> point<00:02:52.340> for<00:02:52.580> him<00:02:52.730> so<00:02:53.599> we're<00:02:53.750> just<00:02:53.780> going

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
this point for him so we're just going

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.290 
this point for him so we're just going
to<00:02:54.050> run<00:02:54.260> away<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:55.130> try<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:55.400> save<00:02:55.670> that<00:02:55.880> zealot

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
to run away to try to save that zealot

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.800 
to run away to try to save that zealot
and<00:02:56.510> hope<00:02:56.720> that<00:02:56.900> we<00:02:56.959> can<00:02:57.610> now<00:02:58.610> I'm<00:02:59.390> also<00:02:59.630> going

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
and hope that we can now I'm also going

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.699 
and hope that we can now I'm also going
to<00:02:59.870> take<00:03:00.080> quite<00:03:00.440> a<00:03:00.500> few<00:03:00.739> extra<00:03:00.860> probes<00:03:01.310> about

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
to take quite a few extra probes about

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.650 
to take quite a few extra probes about
5526<00:03:03.709> technically<00:03:04.220> and<00:03:04.489> just<00:03:05.209> use<00:03:05.390> them<00:03:05.540> to

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
5526 technically and just use them to

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.290 
5526 technically and just use them to
help<00:03:05.780> with<00:03:05.959> the<00:03:05.989> fence<00:03:06.319> this<00:03:07.190> is<00:03:07.370> ok<00:03:07.790> for<00:03:08.150> me

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
help with the fence this is ok for me

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.089 
help with the fence this is ok for me
because<00:03:08.660> as<00:03:08.870> you<00:03:08.989> remember<00:03:09.349> I<00:03:09.380> have<00:03:09.709> a<00:03:09.739> much

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
because as you remember I have a much

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.360 
because as you remember I have a much
better<00:03:10.370> economy<00:03:11.300> than<00:03:11.450> this<00:03:11.569> man<00:03:11.780> so<00:03:12.220> he's<00:03:13.220> not

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
better economy than this man so he's not

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.920 
better economy than this man so he's not
going<00:03:13.430> to<00:03:13.580> be<00:03:13.640> able<00:03:13.670> to<00:03:13.819> out<00:03:13.940> produce<00:03:14.390> me<00:03:14.630> just

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
going to be able to out produce me just

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.250 
going to be able to out produce me just
because<00:03:15.019> I'm<00:03:15.290> using<00:03:15.500> probes<00:03:17.080> even<00:03:18.080> if<00:03:18.170> he

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
because I'm using probes even if he

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.009 
because I'm using probes even if he
killed<00:03:18.470> all<00:03:18.769> those<00:03:18.920> probes<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:20.510> damages<00:03:20.900> are

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
killed all those probes the damages are

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.500 
killed all those probes the damages are
I've<00:03:21.140> done<00:03:21.350> to<00:03:21.500> his<00:03:21.680> attacking<00:03:22.010> force<00:03:22.400> so<00:03:23.390> at

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
I've done to his attacking force so at

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.350 
I've done to his attacking force so at
this<00:03:23.630> point<00:03:23.900> I<00:03:24.200> mean<00:03:24.350> like<00:03:24.860> I'm<00:03:25.010> already<00:03:25.360> about

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
this point I mean like I'm already about

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.830 
this point I mean like I'm already about
the<00:03:26.540> same<00:03:26.780> level<00:03:27.650> of<00:03:27.950> producing<00:03:28.640> seal<00:03:29.450> off<00:03:29.630> as

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
the same level of producing seal off as

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.970 
the same level of producing seal off as
he<00:03:30.049> is<00:03:30.489> except<00:03:31.489> my<00:03:31.640> economy<00:03:32.209> better<00:03:32.780> place<00:03:33.680> so

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
he is except my economy better place so

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.670 
he is except my economy better place so
I've<00:03:34.250> essentially<00:03:34.730> already<00:03:35.120> won<00:03:38.440> so<00:03:39.440> what<00:03:39.650> I

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
I've essentially already won so what I

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.140 
I've essentially already won so what I
do<00:03:39.830> it<00:03:40.069> you<00:03:40.340> know<00:03:40.459> what<00:03:40.640> you<00:03:40.730> do<00:03:40.850> at<00:03:40.970> this<00:03:41.060> point

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
do it you know what you do at this point

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.000 
do it you know what you do at this point
you<00:03:41.450> just<00:03:41.480> kind<00:03:41.810> of<00:03:41.870> give<00:03:42.530> a<00:03:42.560> little<00:03:42.650> bit<00:03:42.950> of

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
you just kind of give a little bit of

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.039 
you just kind of give a little bit of
time<00:03:43.250> to<00:03:44.000> make<00:03:44.090> sure<00:03:44.299> that<00:03:44.450> you're<00:03:44.600> pumping

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
time to make sure that you're pumping

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.210 
time to make sure that you're pumping
out<00:03:45.230> units<00:03:46.150> faster<00:03:47.150> than<00:03:47.269> he<00:03:47.480> is<00:03:47.630> so<00:03:48.470> for

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
out units faster than he is so for

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.960 
out units faster than he is so for
instance<00:03:49.250> I<00:03:49.609> of<00:03:49.730> for<00:03:50.000> he<00:03:50.239> is<00:03:50.390> three<00:03:51.970> pretty

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
instance I of for he is three pretty

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.370 
instance I of for he is three pretty
soon<00:03:53.120> I'll<00:03:53.329> have<00:03:53.590> a<00:03:54.590> six<00:03:55.370> and<00:03:55.640> he'll<00:03:55.790> have

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
soon I'll have a six and he'll have

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.530 
soon I'll have a six and he'll have
maybe<00:03:57.380> four<00:03:58.070> or<00:03:58.100> five

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.600 

there<00:04:03.540> we<00:04:03.750> go<00:04:03.870> so<00:04:04.830> now<00:04:05.100> that<00:04:05.280> I<00:04:05.310> have<00:04:05.370> an

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
there we go so now that I have an

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.490 
there we go so now that I have an
overpowering<00:04:06.150> force<00:04:06.480> I'm<00:04:06.720> just<00:04:06.900> going<00:04:07.110> to<00:04:07.140> go

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
overpowering force I'm just going to go

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.200 
overpowering force I'm just going to go
ahead<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:07.830> attack<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.460> not<00:04:08.640> really<00:04:08.880> pay<00:04:09.180> much

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
ahead and attack and not really pay much

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.360 
ahead and attack and not really pay much
attention<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:10.020> exact<00:04:10.260> because<00:04:11.130> I<00:04:11.310> know

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
attention to the exact because I know

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.320 
attention to the exact because I know
that<00:04:11.610> I'll<00:04:11.700> be<00:04:11.730> able<00:04:11.880> to<00:04:12.060> beat<00:04:12.240> them

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.970 

with<00:04:15.570> the<00:04:15.660> end<00:04:15.780> of<00:04:15.900> that<00:04:15.990> that's<00:04:16.260> really<00:04:16.560> into

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
with the end of that that's really into

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.430 
with the end of that that's really into
the<00:04:17.100> game

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.730 

so<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:21.209> key<00:04:21.390> to<00:04:21.630> defending<00:04:22.350> against<00:04:22.680> a

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
so the key to defending against a

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.430 
so the key to defending against a
Protoss<00:04:23.130> proxy<00:04:23.670> is<00:04:23.930> one<00:04:24.930> scout<00:04:25.560> and<00:04:25.920> then<00:04:26.640> to

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
Protoss proxy is one scout and then to

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.390 
Protoss proxy is one scout and then to
obviously<00:04:28.440> once<00:04:28.680> you<00:04:28.770> know<00:04:28.920> that<00:04:29.100> your<00:04:29.220> paint

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
obviously once you know that your paint

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.240 
obviously once you know that your paint
proxy<00:04:29.910> you<00:04:30.780> need<00:04:30.930> to<00:04:31.050> make<00:04:31.650> a<00:04:31.680> change<00:04:31.770> to<00:04:32.220> your

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
proxy you need to make a change to your

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.250 
proxy you need to make a change to your
defense<00:04:32.610> and<00:04:32.910> to<00:04:33.330> feel<00:04:33.540> free<00:04:33.780> to<00:04:33.900> use<00:04:34.080> your

can block that initial push you really

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.700 
can block that initial push you really
put<00:04:40.980> yourself<00:04:41.100> in<00:04:41.430> a<00:04:41.520> good<00:04:41.640> position
