 [ti: Define this relationship /DTR (Define the Relationship)] 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.210
 [ar:jason chu] 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.750
 [al:Much Love.] 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.560
 When you have that special friend, you want to have a relationship with him that is more than your friend. 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.990
 It’s time to define this relationship 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.600
 This is also called: DTR 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.730
 I seem to like you, but I don't know how you feel about me. 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.230
 This is a bit tricky, how can we handle it naturally? 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.140
 We are going, going, going, going to define this relationship 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.880
 It's time to go to D, D, D, D, DTR 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.260
 We are going, going, going, going to define this relationship 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.950
 It's time to go to D, D, D, D, DTR 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.850
 You have been in a group (together!) Biology Lab (together!) 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.210
 Class (together!) Eat breakfast (together!) 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.620
 During the retreat, you didn’t sleep and chat until dawn. 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.850
 You give her a lot of shoulder hugs 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.040
 You like her but you don't know how to flirt 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.580
 In order to express your feelings, you teach her to do homework. 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.810
 Late at night, you carry her home 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.180
 And she has a unique ringtone on your phone. 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.780
 You asked all your friends and asked your young pastor. 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.890
 Looking for guidelines – they say you should ask her 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.070
 To develop, you have to act 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.310
 Don't be the strange friend who is watching her secretly. 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.960
 (Sometimes, I saw you smile with me) 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.900
 (But sometimes, I also smiled with Andrew Lee) 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.410
 (Now I am nervous, and I am very anxious) 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.910
 (So ​​I texted you – would you like to have a meal together?) 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.410
 I seem to like you, but I don't know how you feel about me. 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.070
 This is a bit tricky, how can we handle it naturally? 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.670
 We are going, going, going, going to define this relationship 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.770
 It's time to go to D, D, D, D, DTR 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.490
 You should dress up, but don't be too grand 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.820
 Show it to her, everything is normal 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.780
 Just chatting, not a formal date 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.320
 It’s your date to meet her before the date. 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.690
 At a critical juncture, it may be very embarrassing 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.990
 Will you shake her hand – or give her a hug? 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.100
 When she sat down, help her pull the chair 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.520
 Let everyone know that there is a gentleman here. 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.760
 About chat, I am a little hint to give you 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.990
 Hold back your desire to show off the familiarity of the scriptures 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.040
 Don't say: "God said that you made my life complete" 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.450
 Don't tell her, your parents think she will be a lovely wife. 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.430
 [My heart jumps faster when the main dish is served] 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.000
 [I tried to pretend that nothing, but I prayed hard in my heart] 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.560
 [When you take the knife and fork, we gossip home] 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.970
 [When you eat the first bite, I confess with you] 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.760
 I seem to like you, but I don't know how you feel about me. 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.410
 This is a bit tricky, how can we handle it naturally? 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.960
 We are going, going, going, going to define this relationship 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.170
 It's time to go to D, D, D, D, DTR 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.710
 She seems to have never expected that you would say this. 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.880
 She said she thought you were just a good friend [girl said:] "I thought you were just a good friend" 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.490
 But you said to her: Wait! 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:59.820
 Pause 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.540
 Can you pray for this? 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.660
 Then we will meet again later. 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.470
 Then look at what God said to us. . . [Girl said:] I think so? 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.450
 OK... 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.510
 I like you a bit, but you don't feel the same for me. 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.110
 This is how embarrassing, I knew I left you at KFC. 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.780
 We can go - go - go - go - go - go - go - go - go - define this relationship 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.400
 Why do I think this is a good idea? 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.900
 A week later, I went to Facebook and sent you a message. 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.590
 You said that you have prayed, and we should talk about it. How about coffee? 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.390
 It’s time to go, go, go, and define this relationship. 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.700
 The second time D, D, D, D, DTR 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.330
 We are going, going, going, going to define this relationship 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.930
 It's time to go to D, D, D, D, DTR 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.720
 We have to go, go, go, and define this relationship. 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.790
 It's time to go to D, D, D, D, DTR 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.190
 We will see you next week - good luck.
