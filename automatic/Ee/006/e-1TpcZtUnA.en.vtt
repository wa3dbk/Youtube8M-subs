00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
is out in this case this is screw

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.860 
is out in this case this is screw
obviously<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:40.950> you'll<00:00:41.100> see<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.280> use<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.870> couple

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
obviously so you'll see I use a couple

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.540 
obviously so you'll see I use a couple
different<00:00:43.020> tools<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.680> was<00:00:44.070> kind<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.280> pain<00:00:44.460> in

different tools I was kind of pain in

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.130 
different tools I was kind of pain in
the<00:00:44.610> butt<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.879> then<00:00:45.120> now<00:00:45.270> once<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.840> screw<00:00:46.110> or

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
the butt and then now once the screw or

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.560 
the butt and then now once the screw or
nail<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.469> out<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:47.370> want<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.700> kind<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.180> score

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
nail is out you want to kind of score

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.250 
nail is out you want to kind of score
the<00:00:49.050> hole<00:00:49.230> with<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.430> tool<00:00:50.640> right<00:00:50.850> here

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
the hole with the this tool right here

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.049 
the hole with the this tool right here
now<00:00:52.340> whenever<00:00:53.340> I've<00:00:53.579> done<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.030> past

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
now whenever I've done this in the past

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.380 
now whenever I've done this in the past
it's<00:00:54.390> always<00:00:54.420> been<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.690> much<00:00:54.840> smaller<00:00:55.050> hole<00:00:55.289> so

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
it's always been a much smaller hole so

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.310 
it's always been a much smaller hole so
this<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.480> going<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.690> be<00:00:57.750> harder<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.020> do<00:00:58.199> this

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
this is going to be harder to do this

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.049 
this is going to be harder to do this
part<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.920> do<00:00:59.039> want<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.399> get<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.879> in

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
part but you do want to get that in

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.209 
part but you do want to get that in
there<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.719> move<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.199> around<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:02.010> can

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
there and move it around so that you can

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.880 
there and move it around so that you can
more<00:01:02.910> easily<00:01:02.940> put<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.480> plug<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.860> okay<00:01:04.860> and

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
more easily put the plug in okay and

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.800 
more easily put the plug in okay and
once<00:01:05.280> that's<00:01:05.729> been<00:01:05.880> done<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.450> take<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
once that's been done you take the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.740 
once that's been done you take the
little<00:01:07.080> clip<00:01:07.530> tool<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:08.700> see<00:01:08.880> here<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.450> you're

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
little clip tool you see here and you're

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.820 
little clip tool you see here and you're
going<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.900> have<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> problem<00:01:10.439> with<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.650> if<00:01:10.740> you

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
going to have a problem with it if you

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.940 
going to have a problem with it if you
don't<00:01:10.939> widen<00:01:11.939> up<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.270> part<00:01:12.540> right<00:01:12.659> there<00:01:12.950> so

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
don't widen up that part right there so

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.380 
don't widen up that part right there so
I<00:01:14.010> use<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> other<00:01:14.400> tool<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.939> you'll<00:01:15.060> see<00:01:15.360> a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
I use the other tool and you'll see a

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.060 
I use the other tool and you'll see a
little<00:01:15.900> slo-mo<00:01:16.380> shot<00:01:16.650> here

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070
