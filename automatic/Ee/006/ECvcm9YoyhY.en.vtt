for a cream eyeshadow and it is it is as
good<00:00:40.230> if<00:00:40.469> not<00:00:40.530> better<00:00:40.770> than<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.790> 242<00:00:42.559> so<00:00:43.559> I've

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
good if not better than the 242 so I've

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.060 
good if not better than the 242 so I've
sort<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.129> compared<00:00:44.700> them<00:00:45.000> together<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.469> I've

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
sort of compared them together and I've

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.709 
sort of compared them together and I've
had<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.579> look<00:00:47.789> up<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.030> try<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.300> find<00:00:48.450> out<00:00:48.629> about

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
had a look up to try and find out about

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.150 
had a look up to try and find out about
materials<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.649> but<00:00:49.800> there's<00:00:49.920> not<00:00:50.039> an

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
materials and that but there's not an

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.470 
materials and that but there's not an
awful<00:00:50.489> lot<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.730> say<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:50.940> think<00:00:51.239> they're<00:00:51.360> both

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
awful lot to say I think they're both

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.950 
awful lot to say I think they're both
synthetic<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.850> obviously<00:00:53.850> Mac<00:00:54.180> has<00:00:54.420> got<00:00:54.629> like

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
synthetic and obviously Mac has got like

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.869 
synthetic and obviously Mac has got like
different<00:00:55.379> material<00:00:55.920> wood<00:00:56.190> it's<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.520> bit<00:00:56.670> more

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
different material wood it's a bit more

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.790 
different material wood it's a bit more
quality<00:00:57.270> wood<00:00:57.480> but<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.960> know<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.680> me

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
quality wood but I you know that to me

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.170 
quality wood but I you know that to me
doesn't<00:00:59.070> make<00:00:59.129> an<00:00:59.309> awful<00:00:59.579> lot<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.699> difference

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
doesn't make an awful lot of difference

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.660 
doesn't make an awful lot of difference
and<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:00.960> I'd<00:01:01.140> have<00:01:01.260> found<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.890> barium<00:01:02.399> one

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
and if I'd have found this barium one

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.609 
and if I'd have found this barium one
first<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.480> used<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.019> would<00:01:04.260> not<00:01:04.439> have

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
first and used it I would not have

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.530 
first and used it I would not have
bought<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:04.979> one<00:01:05.189> for<00:01:05.369> sure<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.790> one<00:01:06.000> was

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
bought this one for sure this one was

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.570 
bought this one for sure this one was
recommended<00:01:07.080> by<00:01:07.110> somebody<00:01:07.560> on<00:01:07.619> YouTube<00:01:08.040> but<00:01:08.490> I

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
recommended by somebody on YouTube but I

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.649 
recommended by somebody on YouTube but I
definitely<00:01:08.760> wouldn't<00:01:09.180> have<00:01:09.299> bought<00:01:09.450> this

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
definitely wouldn't have bought this

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.390 
definitely wouldn't have bought this
because<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.049> think<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.650> actually<00:01:10.770> prefer<00:01:11.189> this

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
because I think I actually prefer this

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.719 
because I think I actually prefer this
one<00:01:11.869> when<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.020> read<00:01:13.290> about<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:14.040> two<00:01:14.340> for<00:01:14.549> two

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
one when you read about the two for two

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.429 
one when you read about the two for two
on<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.970> map<00:01:15.119> website<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.869> says<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.409> is

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
on the map website it says that it is

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.679 
on the map website it says that it is
for<00:01:16.799> powder<00:01:18.950> powder<00:01:19.950> cream<00:01:20.520> or<00:01:20.759> concealer<00:01:21.330> and

powder or cream eyeshadows or concealer

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.910 
powder or cream eyeshadows or concealer

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
and then this one is just a concealer

and then this one is just a concealer
brush<00:01:26.040> but<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.790> can<00:01:27.030> see<00:01:27.270> if<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.600> put<00:01:27.810> them

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
brush but you can see if I put them

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:28.929 
brush but you can see if I put them
together

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
together

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.480 
together
I'll<00:01:29.939> show<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.920> that's<00:01:31.920> what<00:01:32.189> they<00:01:32.310> look<00:01:32.460> like

together so you can see they look

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.590 
together so you can see they look
identical

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
identical

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.390 
identical
they<00:01:37.020> only<00:01:37.409> difference<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.189> can<00:01:38.220> say<00:01:39.049> is<00:01:40.400> that

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
they only difference I can say is that

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.670 
they only difference I can say is that
the<00:01:42.530> barium<00:01:43.530> one<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.640> marginally<00:01:45.570> taller

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
the barium one is like marginally taller

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.649 
the barium one is like marginally taller

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.800 
millimeter or so and if you put them one
behind<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.329> other

slimmer<00:01:59.850> than<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.600> one<00:02:00.840> but<00:02:01.110> for<00:02:01.799> me<00:02:01.920> that

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
slimmer than this one but for me that

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.060 
slimmer than this one but for me that
actually<00:02:02.280> works<00:02:02.729> better<00:02:03.030> because<00:02:03.829> this<00:02:04.829> one

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
actually works better because this one

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.249 
actually works better because this one
is<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.250> little<00:02:05.460> bit<00:02:05.700> wide<00:02:05.909> if<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.329> want<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.840> as<00:02:07.110> I

the right eye and this one on the left
eye<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.260> see<00:02:13.530> if<00:02:13.620> there<00:02:13.770> was<00:02:13.860> any<00:02:14.100> difference

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
eye to see if there was any difference

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.360 
eye to see if there was any difference
in<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.790> way<00:02:14.910> that<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.270> put<00:02:15.570> product<00:02:16.380> on<00:02:16.590> or<00:02:16.890> the

in the way that it put product on or the

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.700

way that it felt or anything like that

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.200 
way that it felt or anything like that
but<00:02:19.710> this<00:02:19.830> one<00:02:19.890> is<00:02:20.130> just<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.520> little<00:02:20.790> bit<00:02:20.940> too

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
but this one is just that little bit too

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.120 
but this one is just that little bit too
wide<00:02:21.540> if<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:22.140> just<00:02:22.380> wanted<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:22.770> get<00:02:23.040> your

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
little bit of the crease and I wanted to

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.700

kind<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.360> buff<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.660> out<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:27.990> it<00:02:28.050> wasn't<00:02:28.320> too<00:02:28.500> bad

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
kind of buff it out so it wasn't too bad

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.850 
kind of buff it out so it wasn't too bad

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
but feeling wise they're both pretty

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.260 
but feeling wise they're both pretty
much<00:02:32.070> as<00:02:32.250> firm<00:02:32.460> as<00:02:32.610> each<00:02:32.730> other<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.000> can<00:02:33.120> see

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
much as firm as each other you can see

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.600 
much as firm as each other you can see
if<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.450> kind<00:02:33.660> of<00:02:33.750> flick<00:02:33.960> them<00:02:34.170> they're<00:02:34.350> both<00:02:34.610> the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
if I kind of flick them they're both the

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.910 
if I kind of flick them they're both the
same<00:02:35.640> amount<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.570> firmness<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:37.350> see<00:02:37.770> no

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
same amount of firmness I see no

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.630 
same amount of firmness I see no
difference<00:02:37.950> there<00:02:38.630> that<00:02:40.340> they're<00:02:41.340> almost

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
difference there that they're almost

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.460 
difference there that they're almost
identical<00:02:41.910> there's<00:02:42.720> no<00:02:42.930> difference<00:02:43.320> that<00:02:43.380> I

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
identical there's no difference that I

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.110 
identical there's no difference that I
can<00:02:43.560> see<00:02:43.890> between<00:02:44.040> these<00:02:44.370> two<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.760> I<00:02:44.790> think<00:02:45.030> if

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
can see between these two and I think if

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.570 
can see between these two and I think if
you<00:02:45.210> are<00:02:45.360> looking<00:02:45.630> for<00:02:45.780> something<00:02:46.140> for<00:02:46.580> cream

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
you are looking for something for cream

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.750 
you are looking for something for cream
eyeshadow<00:02:48.060> or<00:02:48.420> or<00:02:48.690> basis<00:02:49.260> cream<00:02:50.010> basis<00:02:50.520> or<00:02:50.730> a

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
eyeshadow or or basis cream basis or a

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.430 
eyeshadow or or basis cream basis or a
concealer<00:02:51.450> then<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.200> are<00:02:52.290> thinking

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
concealer then and you are thinking

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.200 
concealer then and you are thinking
about<00:02:52.650> getting<00:02:52.950> this<00:02:53.220> one<00:02:53.430> maybe<00:02:53.820> give<00:02:54.090> this

about getting this one maybe give this
one<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.420> try<00:02:54.510> because<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.230> difference<00:02:55.530> in

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
one a try because the difference in

one a try because the difference in
price<00:02:55.920> is<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.400> is<00:02:56.490> the<00:02:56.610> main<00:02:56.760> thing<00:02:57.030> this
