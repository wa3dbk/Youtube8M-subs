that<00:00:56.889> game<00:00:57.309> looks<00:00:57.579> the<00:00:57.940> problem<00:00:58.329> is<00:00:58.510> when<00:00:58.749> you

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
that game looks the problem is when you

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:00.629 
that game looks the problem is when you
go<00:00:58.959> back<00:00:59.109> and<00:00:59.170> look<00:00:59.529> at<00:00:59.709> battlefield<00:01:00.279> 3

go back and look at battlefield 3
there's<00:01:01.239> really<00:01:01.420> not<00:01:01.719> too<00:01:01.779> much<00:01:02.139> of<00:01:02.319> a

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
there's really not too much of a

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:03.509 
there's really not too much of a
difference<00:01:02.739> if<00:01:02.949> you<00:01:02.979> look<00:01:03.159> at<00:01:03.249> the<00:01:03.279> gap

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
difference if you look at the gap

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.099 
difference if you look at the gap
between<00:01:03.699> the<00:01:04.059> other<00:01:04.180> games<00:01:04.479> there's<00:01:05.019> a

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:05.109 
between the other games there's a

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:06.990 
between the other games there's a
significant<00:01:05.829> leap<00:01:06.100> in<00:01:06.369> technological

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
significant leap in technological

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.660

advances<00:01:07.990> and<00:01:08.170> there<00:01:08.680> I'm<00:01:08.950> not<00:01:09.219> seeing<00:01:09.520> I'm

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
advances and there I'm not seeing I'm

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.690 
advances and there I'm not seeing I'm
just<00:01:09.850> not<00:01:10.180> seeing<00:01:10.930> it<00:01:11.399> don't<00:01:12.399> get<00:01:12.549> me<00:01:12.670> wrong
