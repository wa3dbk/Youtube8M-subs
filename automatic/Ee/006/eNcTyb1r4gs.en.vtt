on himself
well<00:00:04.799> he's<00:00:04.950> sinking<00:00:05.160> in<00:00:05.370> his<00:00:05.460> mind<00:00:05.730> that<00:00:05.850> he

was pretty unlucky that hand he's
running<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:07.919> scenarios<00:00:08.550> and<00:00:08.760> if<00:00:08.880> he<00:00:09.000> would

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150
