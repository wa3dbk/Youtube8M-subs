then the original recipe but you can
basically<00:01:37.920> just<00:01:38.159> do<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.759> can't<00:01:39.000> really<00:01:39.180> do

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
basically just do this I can't really do

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.289 
basically just do this I can't really do
so<00:01:39.750> take<00:01:39.900> about<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.200> cup<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.829> sugar<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.000> pour<00:01:42.180> it

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
so take about a cup of sugar and pour it

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.880 
so take about a cup of sugar and pour it
into<00:01:42.450> your<00:01:42.600> bowl<00:01:42.930> you're<00:01:43.619> going<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.799> get

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
into your bowl you're going to get

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.620 
into your bowl you're going to get
started<00:01:44.100> with<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.399> dry<00:01:44.610> ingredients<00:01:44.670> and

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
started with the dry ingredients and

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.700 
started with the dry ingredients and
then<00:01:45.780> you're<00:01:45.899> just<00:01:46.020> going<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.229> add<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.530> little

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
then you're just going to add a little

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.310 
then you're just going to add a little
bit<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.979> cinnamon<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:48.149> can<00:01:48.210> add<00:01:48.450> more<00:01:48.780> or<00:01:48.840> less

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
bit of cinnamon you can add more or less

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.200 
bit of cinnamon you can add more or less
alliteration<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.250> want<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.850> be<00:01:50.939> like

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
alliteration you want it to be like

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.410 
alliteration you want it to be like
stability<00:01:51.659> or<00:01:51.869> not<00:01:52.670> so<00:01:53.670> strain<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.090> around

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
stability or not so strain this around

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.450 
stability or not so strain this around
and<00:01:54.689> kind<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.140> mix<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.500> up<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:55.920> it's<00:01:56.189> nice

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
and kind of mix it up so that it's nice

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.530 
and kind of mix it up so that it's nice
and

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.990 

because<00:01:59.260> we're<00:01:59.710> gonna<00:01:59.830> get<00:02:00.100> some<00:02:00.520> ginger

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
because we're gonna get some ginger

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.680 
because we're gonna get some ginger
fresh<00:02:01.780> ginger<00:02:02.050> use<00:02:02.890> mm<00:02:03.640> fresh<00:02:03.910> ginger<00:02:04.150> but<00:02:04.540> I

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
fresh ginger use mm fresh ginger but I

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.840 
fresh ginger use mm fresh ginger but I
think<00:02:04.900> pretty<00:02:05.200> nice<00:02:05.410> fresh<00:02:05.650> cut<00:02:06.400> up<00:02:06.520> a<00:02:06.670> little

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
think pretty nice fresh cut up a little

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.510 
think pretty nice fresh cut up a little
bit<00:02:07.120> about<00:02:07.720> it<00:02:07.870> 2<00:02:08.020> spoon<00:02:08.290> of<00:02:08.320> it<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:09.190> then<00:02:09.340> cut

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
bit about it 2 spoon of it and then cut

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.250 
bit about it 2 spoon of it and then cut
it<00:02:09.550> up<00:02:10.230> let<00:02:11.230> me<00:02:11.380> chop<00:02:11.680> it<00:02:12.210> now<00:02:13.240> you<00:02:13.600> can<00:02:13.780> chop<00:02:14.110> it

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
it up let me chop it now you can chop it

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.530 
it up let me chop it now you can chop it
really<00:02:14.440> fine<00:02:14.590> yourself<00:02:15.100> but<00:02:15.850> I<00:02:15.880> decided<00:02:16.360> to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
really fine yourself but I decided to

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.210 
really fine yourself but I decided to
use<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.690> little<00:02:16.960> bit<00:02:17.020> of<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.230> tool<00:02:17.560> for<00:02:17.860> this<00:02:18.040> I'm

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
use a little bit of a tool for this I'm

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.920 
use a little bit of a tool for this I'm
not<00:02:18.370> sure<00:02:18.580> what<00:02:18.700> it's<00:02:18.820> called<00:02:18.880> you<00:02:19.570> probably

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
not sure what it's called you probably

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.320 
not sure what it's called you probably
recognize<00:02:20.380> this<00:02:20.560> but<00:02:20.740> I<00:02:20.800> use<00:02:21.010> this<00:02:21.190> tool<00:02:21.490> to

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
recognize this but I use this tool to

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:30.150 
recognize this but I use this tool to
make<00:02:23.230> it<00:02:23.410> really<00:02:23.710> nice<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.130> fine<00:02:28.830> there<00:02:29.830> we<00:02:29.980> go

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
make it really nice and fine there we go

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:39.690 
make it really nice and fine there we go
so<00:02:30.520> I'm<00:02:30.640> chopping<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:38.250> now<00:02:39.250> when<00:02:39.400> you're<00:02:39.580> doing

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
so I'm chopping it now when you're doing

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.730 
so I'm chopping it now when you're doing
this<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:40.060> lot<00:02:40.480> of<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.780> jinx<00:02:41.050> is<00:02:41.170> gonna<00:02:41.410> come<00:02:41.590> out

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
this a lot of the jinx is gonna come out

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.680 
this a lot of the jinx is gonna come out
it's<00:02:42.070> not<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.280> problem<00:02:42.640> you<00:02:43.210> really<00:02:43.450> don't<00:02:43.600> need

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
it's not a problem you really don't need

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.780 
it's not a problem you really don't need
to<00:02:43.750> use<00:02:43.930> as<00:02:44.110> much<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.650> like<00:02:45.070> they're<00:02:45.520> probably

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
to use as much to like they're probably

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.070 
to use as much to like they're probably
going<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.120> be<00:02:46.180> some<00:02:46.360> stuff<00:02:46.600> but<00:02:46.960> you<00:02:47.050> don't

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
going to be some stuff but you don't

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.630 
going to be some stuff but you don't
need<00:02:47.470> too<00:02:47.680> much<00:02:47.860> ginger<00:02:48.070> it's<00:02:48.370> gonna<00:02:48.490> be

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
need too much ginger it's gonna be

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.370 
need too much ginger it's gonna be
really<00:02:48.820> overwhelming<00:02:49.030> if<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:49.720> do<00:02:49.900> use<00:02:50.080> a<00:02:50.230> lot

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
really overwhelming if you do use a lot

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.580 
really overwhelming if you do use a lot
plus<00:02:51.040> if<00:02:51.520> it<00:02:51.850> gets<00:02:52.060> in<00:02:52.240> your<00:02:52.270> eyes<00:02:52.540> you<00:02:53.350> really

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
plus if it gets in your eyes you really

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.050 
plus if it gets in your eyes you really
don't<00:02:53.740> want<00:02:53.920> that<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.100> use<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.430> little<00:02:54.670> bit<00:02:54.760> now

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
don't want that to use a little bit now

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.960 
don't want that to use a little bit now
pour<00:02:55.420> it<00:02:55.480> in<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.770> mixture<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.459> then<00:02:57.700> start

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
pour it in to the mixture and then start

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.699 
pour it in to the mixture and then start
mixing<00:02:58.150> it<00:02:58.480> up<00:02:58.540> really<00:02:58.840> nicely<00:02:59.170> until<00:02:59.560> it's

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
mixing it up really nicely until it's

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.190 
mixing it up really nicely until it's
not<00:02:59.860> so<00:03:00.070> clumpy<00:03:00.490> anymore<00:03:00.850> it's<00:03:01.060> it's<00:03:01.720> slightly

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
not so clumpy anymore it's it's slightly

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.330 
not so clumpy anymore it's it's slightly
you'd<00:03:02.470> applied<00:03:02.830> it<00:03:03.010> over<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.550> mixture<00:03:03.880> you

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.740 

got<00:03:09.340> that<00:03:09.459> done<00:03:09.730> we're<00:03:10.000> gonna<00:03:10.120> use<00:03:10.390> a<00:03:10.420> little

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
got that done we're gonna use a little

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.260 
got that done we're gonna use a little
bit<00:03:10.840> of<00:03:10.900> oil<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:12.340> recipe<00:03:12.730> has<00:03:12.910> all<00:03:13.150> the

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
bit of oil the recipe has all the

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.720 
bit of oil the recipe has all the
measurements<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:13.930> kind<00:03:14.200> of<00:03:14.260> you<00:03:15.250> know<00:03:15.280> try

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
measurements and kind of you know try

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:22.290 
measurements and kind of you know try
and<00:03:15.850> scale<00:03:16.330> it<00:03:20.610> we're<00:03:21.610> gonna<00:03:21.700> pour<00:03:22.030> that<00:03:22.060> in

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
and scale it we're gonna pour that in

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.430 
and scale it we're gonna pour that in
and<00:03:23.580> then<00:03:24.580> mix<00:03:24.790> it<00:03:25.000> up<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:25.300> use<00:03:25.480> olive<00:03:25.720> oil<00:03:26.050> by

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
and then mix it up I use olive oil by

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.640 
and then mix it up I use olive oil by
the<00:03:26.470> way<00:03:26.590> it<00:03:27.489> should<00:03:27.550> look<00:03:27.760> slightly<00:03:28.330> a<00:03:28.900> little

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
the way it should look slightly a little

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.050 
the way it should look slightly a little
bit<00:03:29.769> clumpy<00:03:29.980> it<00:03:30.280> still<00:03:30.519> shouldn't<00:03:30.820> stick

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
bit clumpy it still shouldn't stick

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.550 
bit clumpy it still shouldn't stick
together<00:03:31.239> ago<00:03:31.780> it<00:03:32.470> should<00:03:32.709> be<00:03:32.830> wet<00:03:33.220> yet<00:03:34.560> that

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
together ago it should be wet yet that

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.440 
together ago it should be wet yet that
rhymes<00:03:35.769> now<00:03:36.040> we're<00:03:36.250> going<00:03:36.400> to<00:03:36.580> use<00:03:36.730> our<00:03:37.000> syrup

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
rhymes now we're going to use our syrup

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.390 
rhymes now we're going to use our syrup
I<00:03:37.600> think<00:03:38.170> I<00:03:38.200> have<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.380> different<00:03:38.739> name

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
I think I have a different name
