00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
spawning so an important piece of

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.630 
spawning so an important piece of
information<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.439> should<00:01:16.500> know<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:17.070> there<00:01:17.520> as

a ranking order for these helicopters in
GTA<00:01:19.740> online<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.310> when<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.610> reach<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.970> certain

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
GTA online so when you reach a certain

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.359 
GTA online so when you reach a certain
rank<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.780> new<00:01:22.170> helicopter<00:01:22.799> will<00:01:22.890> start<00:01:23.159> to

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
rank a new helicopter will start to

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.370 
rank a new helicopter will start to
spawn<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.180> will<00:01:24.270> actually<00:01:24.570> overlap<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
spawn and it will actually overlap the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.469 
spawn and it will actually overlap the
previous<00:01:25.409> once<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.340> buzzard<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.820> as<00:01:27.330> I've

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
previous once the buzzard is as I've

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.210 
previous once the buzzard is as I've
said<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.900> currently<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.439> highest<00:01:28.619> ranked

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
said that currently the highest ranked

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.160 
said that currently the highest ranked
helicopter<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.909> can<00:01:30.030> get<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.600> once<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.900> reach

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
helicopter you can get so once you reach

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.410 
helicopter you can get so once you reach
Frank<00:01:31.530> 43<00:01:32.130> or<00:01:32.250> high<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.490> will<00:01:32.759> replace<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
Frank 43 or high it will replace the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.480 
Frank 43 or high it will replace the
lower<00:01:33.600> rank<00:01:33.900> ones<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.590> think<00:01:34.710> as<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.189> now<00:01:35.340> it

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
lower rank ones so I think as of now it

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.920 
lower rank ones so I think as of now it
might<00:01:35.670> actually<00:01:35.759> be<00:01:36.000> impossible<00:01:36.630> for<00:01:36.780> me<00:01:36.900> to

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
might actually be impossible for me to

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.749 
might actually be impossible for me to
get<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.259> cargobob<00:01:37.860> because<00:01:38.189> I'm<00:01:38.310> such<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.549> high

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759

is a hello enough rank to unlock the
cargobob<00:01:58.979> but<00:01:59.189> not<00:01:59.310> high<00:01:59.520> enough<00:01:59.549> for<00:01:59.820> the
