00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
how would i how would I go about

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.130 
how would i how would I go about
developing<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.979> race<00:01:08.159> plan<00:01:08.399> first<00:01:09.329> thing<00:01:09.570> -<00:01:09.780> 13

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
developing a race plan first thing - 13

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.469 
developing a race plan first thing - 13
mile<00:01:10.320> race<00:01:10.530> that's<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.829> long<00:01:11.009> time<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.549> would

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
mile race that's a long time I would

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.050 
mile race that's a long time I would
suggest<00:01:12.659> not<00:01:12.960> breaking<00:01:13.680> things<00:01:14.070> into<00:01:14.460> mile<00:01:14.729> by

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
suggest not breaking things into mile by

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.280 
suggest not breaking things into mile by
mile<00:01:15.270> chumps<00:01:15.750> that's<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.470> know<00:01:16.590> 13<00:01:17.159> 14<00:01:18.290> pieces

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
mile chumps that's you know 13 14 pieces

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.250 
mile chumps that's you know 13 14 pieces
which<00:01:19.950> can<00:01:20.400> be<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.550> little<00:01:20.700> daunting<00:01:21.140> as<00:01:22.140> you

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
which can be a little daunting as you

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.410 
which can be a little daunting as you
get<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.530> your<00:01:22.560> third<00:01:22.830> piece<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.970> know<00:01:24.060> up

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
get to your third piece and you know up

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.570 
get to your third piece and you know up
which<00:01:24.630> still<00:01:24.870> got<00:01:24.990> ten<00:01:25.290> more<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.650> go

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
which still got ten more to go

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.190 
which still got ten more to go
I<00:01:26.640> think<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.090> good<00:01:27.240> idea<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.750> break<00:01:27.930> grace

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
I think a good idea is to break grace

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.860 
I think a good idea is to break grace
into<00:01:28.530> slightly<00:01:29.040> bigger<00:01:29.400> chunks<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.690> can

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
into slightly bigger chunks that you can

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.380 
into slightly bigger chunks that you can
produce<00:01:31.080> on<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:32.430> at<00:01:32.520> one<00:01:32.640> point<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.150> you

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
produce on so it's at one point and you

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.960 
produce on so it's at one point and you
may<00:01:33.930> be<00:01:33.990> aware<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:35.040> miles<00:01:35.370> that<00:01:35.729> you're

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
may be aware the miles that you're

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.570 
may be aware the miles that you're
passing<00:01:36.360> one<00:01:36.810> by<00:01:37.020> one<00:01:37.229> checking<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.340> with<00:01:38.400> your

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
passing one by one checking in with your

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.610 
passing one by one checking in with your
splits<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.060> see

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
splits to see

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.920 
splits to see
is<00:01:39.860> going<00:01:40.040> but<00:01:40.730> in<00:01:40.820> terms<00:01:41.030> like<00:01:41.240> mentally

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
is going but in terms like mentally

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.270 
is going but in terms like mentally
breaking<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:42.410> rate<00:01:42.530> stuff<00:01:42.740> I<00:01:42.890> suggest

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
breaking the rate stuff I suggest

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.550 
breaking the rate stuff I suggest
slightly<00:01:43.670> larger<00:01:43.910> pieces<00:01:44.120> in<00:01:44.480> for<00:01:45.290> the<00:01:45.440> way

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
slightly larger pieces in for the way

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.980 
slightly larger pieces in for the way
that<00:01:45.800> this<00:01:45.950> course<00:01:46.220> runs<00:01:46.490> I<00:01:47.420> would<00:01:47.810> suggest

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
that this course runs I would suggest

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.420 
that this course runs I would suggest
before<00:01:48.350> following<00:01:49.150> chunks<00:01:50.150> the<00:01:50.780> first<00:01:51.020> one<00:01:51.170> is

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
before following chunks the first one is

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.610 
before following chunks the first one is
simply<00:01:52.430> the<00:01:52.640> first<00:01:52.880> mile<00:01:53.120> so<00:01:53.870> the<00:01:53.960> first<00:01:54.200> verse

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
simply the first mile so the first verse

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.070 
simply the first mile so the first verse
the<00:01:54.770> poor<00:01:54.950> pieces<00:01:55.280> is<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:56.390> start<00:01:56.720> to<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:56.960> one

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
the poor pieces is the start to the one

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.620 
the poor pieces is the start to the one
mile<00:01:57.550> and<00:01:58.550> I<00:01:58.700> think<00:01:58.940> that's<00:01:59.090> very<00:01:59.180> important

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
mile and I think that's very important

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.320 
mile and I think that's very important
so<00:01:59.660> I<00:01:59.780> give<00:01:59.990> it<00:02:00.020> you<00:02:00.440> know<00:02:00.470> a<00:02:00.980> lot<00:02:01.850> of<00:02:01.970> attention

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
so I give it you know a lot of attention

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.780 
so I give it you know a lot of attention
the<00:02:02.660> second<00:02:03.050> is<00:02:03.230> from<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.980> mile<00:02:04.250> mark<00:02:04.550> to

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
the second is from the mile mark to

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.050 
the second is from the mile mark to
around<00:02:05.030> 10k<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:07.250> third<00:02:07.550> chunk<00:02:07.730> that<00:02:07.970> I'll

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
around 10k the third chunk that I'll

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.150 
around 10k the third chunk that I'll
describe<00:02:08.330> is<00:02:08.600> the<00:02:08.660> ten<00:02:09.350> case<00:02:09.590> to<00:02:09.800> ten<00:02:09.979> mile

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
describe is the ten case to ten mile

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.460 
describe is the ten case to ten mile
mark<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:10.580> then<00:02:11.240> finally<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.810> last<00:02:11.840> five<00:02:12.200> pick

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
mark and then finally the last five pick

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.520 
mark and then finally the last five pick
from<00:02:12.770> ten<00:02:13.040> until<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.550> finish<00:02:13.730> so<00:02:14.660> first<00:02:15.320> mile

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
from ten until the finish so first mile

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.000 
from ten until the finish so first mile
very<00:02:16.340> very<00:02:16.580> important<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:18.380> deal<00:02:18.620> with<00:02:18.680> this

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
very very important to deal with this

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.750 
very very important to deal with this
you<00:02:19.850> know<00:02:19.910> pretty<00:02:20.510> fairly<00:02:21.200> steep<00:02:21.560> as<00:02:22.490> far<00:02:22.700> as

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
you know pretty fairly steep as far as

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.280 
you know pretty fairly steep as far as
this<00:02:22.850> course<00:02:23.030> goes<00:02:23.150> a<00:02:23.890> decline<00:02:25.300> so<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:27.020> first

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
this course goes a decline so the first

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.710 
this course goes a decline so the first
thing<00:02:27.470> I<00:02:27.710> would<00:02:27.830> do<00:02:28.070> is<00:02:28.340> consider<00:02:29.210> this<00:02:29.480> as

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
thing I would do is consider this as

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.980 
thing I would do is consider this as
part<00:02:30.080> of<00:02:30.230> your<00:02:30.290> form<00:02:30.710> up<00:02:31.300> because<00:02:32.300> you<00:02:32.660> could

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
part of your form up because you could

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.040 
part of your form up because you could
potentially<00:02:33.470> run<00:02:33.980> down<00:02:34.460> this<00:02:34.610> very<00:02:34.820> fast<00:02:35.120> I

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
potentially run down this very fast I

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.290 
potentially run down this very fast I
think<00:02:36.440> if<00:02:36.830> you<00:02:37.010> maybe<00:02:37.430> cut<00:02:37.670> back<00:02:37.820> on<00:02:37.970> your<00:02:38.000> warm

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
think if you maybe cut back on your warm

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.360 
think if you maybe cut back on your warm
up<00:02:38.390> a<00:02:38.510> little<00:02:38.690> bit<00:02:38.870> show<00:02:39.440> yourself<00:02:39.770> needs<00:02:40.250> at

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
up a little bit show yourself needs at

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.160 
up a little bit show yourself needs at
first<00:02:40.580> my<00:02:40.730> normal<00:02:41.210> that's<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:41.810> good<00:02:41.930> idea

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
first my normal that's a good idea

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.020 
first my normal that's a good idea
because<00:02:42.320> you<00:02:42.590> can<00:02:42.620> run<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:42.950> pretty<00:02:43.400> good<00:02:43.610> split

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
because you can run a pretty good split

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.810 
because you can run a pretty good split
without<00:02:44.420> putting<00:02:44.630> out<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:44.870> lot<00:02:45.260> of<00:02:45.290> effort<00:02:45.820> if

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
without putting out a lot of effort if

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.880 
without putting out a lot of effort if
your<00:02:47.000> run<00:02:47.239> is<00:02:47.360> hard<00:02:47.570> you<00:02:48.020> can<00:02:48.170> probably<00:02:48.410> run<00:02:48.739> an

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
your run is hard you can probably run an

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.710 
your run is hard you can probably run an
extra<00:02:49.190> thirty<00:02:49.459> seconds<00:02:49.880> or<00:02:49.970> so<00:02:50.030> we're

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
extra thirty seconds or so we're

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.660 
extra thirty seconds or so we're
trusting<00:02:51.020> about<00:02:51.170> thirty<00:02:51.410> Seconds<00:02:51.890> won't<00:02:52.550> be

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
trusting about thirty Seconds won't be

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.979 
trusting about thirty Seconds won't be
worth<00:02:52.850> it<00:02:53.000> in<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.180> end<00:02:53.330> you<00:02:53.720> will<00:02:53.840> probably

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
worth it in the end you will probably

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.670 
worth it in the end you will probably
pay<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.560> price<00:02:54.770> in<00:02:55.550> age<00:02:55.760> you've<00:02:56.209> given<00:02:56.600> or<00:02:57.290> may

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
pay the price in age you've given or may

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.900 
pay the price in age you've given or may
have<00:02:57.800> slowed<00:02:57.980> down<00:02:58.160> a<00:02:58.190> lot<00:02:58.400> more<00:02:58.430> than<00:02:58.730> what

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
have slowed down a lot more than what

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.630 
have slowed down a lot more than what
the<00:02:59.180> relatively<00:02:59.930> little

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
the relatively little

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.570 
the relatively little
by<00:03:00.850> going<00:03:01.030> out<00:03:01.180> too<00:03:01.360> fast<00:03:02.710> another<00:03:03.220> thing<00:03:03.460> is

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
by going out too fast another thing is

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.460 
by going out too fast another thing is
you<00:03:03.819> know<00:03:03.880> it<00:03:04.150> might<00:03:04.330> be<00:03:04.360> a<00:03:04.510> little<00:03:04.690> crowded<00:03:04.870> so

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
you know it might be a little crowded so

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.050 
you know it might be a little crowded so
that's<00:03:05.650> another<00:03:05.860> reason<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.490> consider<00:03:06.640> the

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
that's another reason to consider the

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.360 
that's another reason to consider the
first<00:03:07.209> mile<00:03:07.480> as<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:07.810> warm-up<00:03:08.200> you<00:03:08.740> know<00:03:08.860> try<00:03:09.160> not

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
first mile as a warm-up you know try not

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.280 
first mile as a warm-up you know try not
this<00:03:09.520> exact<00:03:09.910> all<00:03:10.150> across<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:10.660> road<00:03:10.870> just<00:03:11.170> to

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
this exact all across the road just to

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.740 
this exact all across the road just to
get<00:03:11.410> around<00:03:11.650> a<00:03:11.860> few<00:03:12.010> people<00:03:12.480> things<00:03:13.480> pretty

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
get around a few people things pretty

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.390 
get around a few people things pretty
much<00:03:13.840> shake<00:03:14.319> out<00:03:14.500> as<00:03:14.680> long<00:03:14.830> as<00:03:14.920> you<00:03:15.010> in<00:03:15.130> general

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
much shake out as long as you in general

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.640 
much shake out as long as you in general
right<00:03:15.760> area<00:03:16.750> you<00:03:17.110> know<00:03:17.200> based<00:03:17.410> on<00:03:17.590> your

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
right area you know based on your

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.000 
right area you know based on your
projected<00:03:18.340> paced<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:20.260> know<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.500> crowd<00:03:20.709> will

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
projected paced you know the crowd will

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.060 
projected paced you know the crowd will
work<00:03:21.130> themselves<00:03:21.370> out<00:03:22.680> by<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.740> end<00:03:23.920> of<00:03:23.980> that

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
work themselves out by the end of that

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.100 
work themselves out by the end of that
first<00:03:24.310> mile<00:03:24.490> it<00:03:24.760> starts<00:03:25.240> to<00:03:25.330> smooth<00:03:25.600> out<00:03:25.750> a

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
first mile it starts to smooth out a

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.190 
first mile it starts to smooth out a
little<00:03:26.380> bit<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:27.120> by<00:03:28.120> now<00:03:28.239> you're<00:03:28.720> more<00:03:28.840> warmed

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
little bit and by now you're more warmed

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.320 
little bit and by now you're more warmed
up<00:03:29.350> and<00:03:29.590> you've<00:03:30.130> hit<00:03:30.220> a<00:03:30.280> reasonable<00:03:30.910> first

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
up and you've hit a reasonable first

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.100 
up and you've hit a reasonable first
mile<00:03:31.600> split<00:03:32.020> and<00:03:32.290> so<00:03:33.160> then<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.670> next<00:03:34.110> five

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
mile split and so then the next five

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.080 
mile split and so then the next five
miles<00:03:35.410> hey<00:03:35.650> look<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.340> course<00:03:36.550> broke<00:03:36.730> off<00:03:36.880> it's

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
miles hey look the course broke off it's

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.280 
miles hey look the course broke off it's
it's<00:03:37.420> fairly<00:03:39.150> it's<00:03:40.150> really<00:03:40.450> flat<00:03:40.720> some<00:03:41.110> down

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
it's fairly it's really flat some down

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.380 
it's fairly it's really flat some down
hills<00:03:41.560> but<00:03:42.340> I<00:03:42.550> think<00:03:42.820> this<00:03:42.940> is<00:03:43.090> a<00:03:43.120> stretch

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
hills but I think this is a stretch

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.820 
hills but I think this is a stretch
where<00:03:43.600> you<00:03:43.690> can<00:03:43.810> really<00:03:43.989> start<00:03:44.440> to<00:03:44.680> get<00:03:44.769> into

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
where you can really start to get into

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.940 
where you can really start to get into
your<00:03:45.190> rhythm<00:03:45.540> you've<00:03:46.540> done<00:03:46.750> called<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:47.709> plan

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
your rhythm you've done called the plan

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.740 
your rhythm you've done called the plan
you've<00:03:48.160> done<00:03:48.310> a<00:03:48.340> number<00:03:48.550> of<00:03:48.700> tempo<00:03:49.450> of

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
you've done a number of tempo of

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.500 
you've done a number of tempo of
workouts<00:03:50.620> or<00:03:50.830> tempo<00:03:51.100> runs<00:03:51.310> this<00:03:51.910> is<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.239> quiet

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
workouts or tempo runs this is the quiet

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.870 
workouts or tempo runs this is the quiet
where<00:03:52.720> you<00:03:52.900> want<00:03:53.050> to<00:03:53.140> really<00:03:53.320> recollect<00:03:54.250> on<00:03:54.489> on

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
where you want to really recollect on on

during those number ones defined with

proper effort the right rhythm and just
really<00:04:02.830> lock<00:04:03.010> in<00:04:03.420> because<00:04:04.420> you<00:04:04.570> can<00:04:04.720> hit<00:04:04.870> some

really lock in because you can hit some
fairly<00:04:05.620> even<00:04:06.430> case<00:04:07.360> miles<00:04:07.720> and<00:04:08.320> in<00:04:08.440> your

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
fairly even case miles and in your

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.050 
fairly even case miles and in your
splits<00:04:08.829> are<00:04:08.980> not<00:04:09.160> going<00:04:09.340> to<00:04:09.400> bury<00:04:09.579> too<00:04:09.850> too

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
splits are not going to bury too too

much<00:04:10.180> in<00:04:10.480> this<00:04:11.049> section<00:04:11.549> because<00:04:12.549> the<00:04:12.730> course

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
much in this section because the course

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.960 
much in this section because the course
is<00:04:13.480> fairly<00:04:14.049> even<00:04:14.590> about<00:04:15.250> in<00:04:15.370> terms<00:04:15.459> of<00:04:15.670> ups<00:04:15.820> and

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
is fairly even about in terms of ups and
