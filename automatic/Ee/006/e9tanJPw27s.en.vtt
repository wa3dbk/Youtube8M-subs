00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
like the way it turns out with the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.010 
like the way it turns out with the
pearlescent<00:01:46.790> on<00:01:47.790> top<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.299> red<00:01:48.570> color<00:01:48.840> on

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020
