00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:10.069
 Today we look at the processor mdf x 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:17.269
 6200 exactly modecom 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.269
 I will demonstrate 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:31.400
 We look that here as I do not have 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.550
 characteristics clock frequency 3 8 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:40.190
 gigahertz 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:44.379
 socket am3 plus their options for 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:49.780
 overclocking is unlocked here multiplier 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.780
 version is already black edition 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:01:00.409
 here is the security module itself 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.729
 stickers look like this has 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:03.729
 corr cube 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:11.310
 here you can see the hole 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.229
 briefly about the characteristics of this package 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.090
 includes mdm processor instructions for 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.310
 setting conditional information 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.070
 warranty and cooling system for 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.979
 desktop use 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.000
 that is, in this box goes 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:36.509
 box cooler box cooler 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.479
 shipped directly with 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:47.250
 CPU cooler is pretty good 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:49.600
 has four cooling tubes and 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.270
 manufacturer with cooling for this 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.149
 The processor is very, very good 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.630
 since this model and if 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:02.819
 compare version 6100 v frequency 33 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:06.479
 megahertz then in this model mg fix 6200 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:11.230
 125 watt heat dissipation although in model 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:13.049
 6100 is only 95 therefore given 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.820
 the processor is really enough 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:18.519
 hot but still box cooler 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:22.840
 coped well with it even when 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:27.130
 heavy loads example boot at 90 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.470
 percent when working so critical 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.280
 load processor warmed up 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.519
 as much as possible 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.799
 to a temperature of sixty two sixty 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:39.210
 four degrees opened the box we 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.450
 find out 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:51.240
 another pack which is 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:53.460
 directly box cooler itself and it 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.970
 covered here is such a plastic 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:03:00.750
 by the box 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:04.980
 it has a look and here on the side 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:10.790
 fixed in the hole the processor itself it 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:14.300
 that's just such a plastic box 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.310
 opened it will be here 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:26.880
 the processor is already installed 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:30.590
 so I just pack it also 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.590
 here is the paper documentation 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.740
 here is such 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.740
 the view 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.410
 detailed installation instructions 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.710
 more processor information 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.940
 and of course the scheme itself 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.940
 montage
