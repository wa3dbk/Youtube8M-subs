00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
and three ordinary chest so why you

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.069 
and three ordinary chest so why you
should<00:00:52.530> kill<00:00:52.829> mimic<00:00:53.670> because<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.420> mimic<00:00:54.780> has

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
should kill mimic because the mimic has

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.860 
should kill mimic because the mimic has
a<00:00:55.440> chance<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.129> drop<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.969> class<00:00:57.180> mode<00:00:57.510> appear

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
a chance to drop the class mode appear

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.920 
a chance to drop the class mode appear
looking<00:00:58.289> for<00:00:58.640> so<00:00:59.640> you<00:01:00.629> should<00:01:01.100> try<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.539> kill<00:01:03.539> it

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
looking for so you should try to kill it

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.020 
looking for so you should try to kill it
so<00:01:04.619> just<00:01:05.580> evade<00:01:06.240> other<00:01:06.570> enemies<00:01:07.310> don't<00:01:08.310> even

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
so just evade other enemies don't even

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.500 
so just evade other enemies don't even
bother<00:01:09.210> with<00:01:09.390> them<00:01:10.100> and<00:01:11.100> we<00:01:11.460> are<00:01:11.490> going<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
bother with them and we are going to the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.670 
bother with them and we are going to the
second<00:01:12.960> chest<00:01:13.580> second<00:01:14.580> chest<00:01:16.250> and

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
second chest second chest and

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.950 
second chest second chest and
it<00:01:18.950> is<00:01:19.220> pretty<00:01:19.580> pretty<00:01:19.820> hard<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.420> find<00:01:20.780> this

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
it is pretty pretty hard to find this

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.390 
it is pretty pretty hard to find this
glass<00:01:21.380> move<00:01:22.390> you're<00:01:23.390> going<00:01:23.660> to<00:01:23.990> go<00:01:24.950> for<00:01:25.280> the

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
glass move you're going to go for the

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.800 
glass move you're going to go for the
six<00:01:25.670> points<00:01:26.150> in<00:01:27.040> money<00:01:28.040> shot<00:01:28.400> five<00:01:29.030> points<00:01:29.600> in

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
six points in money shot five points in

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.980 
six points in money shot five points in
asbestos<00:01:30.230> and<00:01:30.970> the<00:01:31.970> one<00:01:32.150> that<00:01:32.420> boosts<00:01:32.840> your

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
asbestos and the one that boosts your

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.100 
asbestos and the one that boosts your
critical<00:01:33.590> hit<00:01:33.830> damage<00:01:33.940> along<00:01:34.940> with<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.870> fire

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
critical hit damage along with the fire

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.760 
critical hit damage along with the fire
rate<00:01:36.410> so<00:01:37.370> here<00:01:37.880> I<00:01:38.060> got<00:01:38.450> a<00:01:38.510> class<00:01:38.870> mode<00:01:39.200> but<00:01:39.440> it

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
rate so here I got a class mode but it

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.490 
rate so here I got a class mode but it
is<00:01:40.070> not<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:41.150> one<00:01:41.300> we<00:01:41.510> are<00:01:41.630> looking<00:01:41.840> for<00:01:42.970> and

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
is not the one we are looking for and

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.880 
is not the one we are looking for and
the<00:01:45.500> other<00:01:45.620> trust<00:01:46.010> is<00:01:46.160> here<00:01:46.580> and<00:01:47.570> we<00:01:48.380> got<00:01:48.620> to

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
the other trust is here and we got to

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:49.570 
the other trust is here and we got to
mimics

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
mimics

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.760 
mimics
so<00:01:50.390> we<00:01:50.840> should<00:01:51.140> get<00:01:52.510> two<00:01:53.510> more<00:01:53.770> ordinary

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
so we should get two more ordinary

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.130 
so we should get two more ordinary
chests<00:01:57.460> when<00:01:58.460> we<00:01:58.640> go<00:01:58.850> through<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.930> whole

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
chests when we go through the whole

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.910 
chests when we go through the whole
world<00:02:00.560> course<00:02:02.050> so<00:02:03.050> I<00:02:03.290> can<00:02:03.619> avoid<00:02:04.460> all<00:02:04.729> enemies

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
world course so I can avoid all enemies

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.040 
world course so I can avoid all enemies
so<00:02:06.920> this<00:02:07.190> part<00:02:07.460> is<00:02:07.729> it<00:02:08.119> is<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:08.540> hardest

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
so this part is it is the hardest

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.960 
so this part is it is the hardest
because<00:02:09.229> these<00:02:09.679> works<00:02:09.950> are<00:02:10.310> pretty<00:02:10.670> pretty

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
because these works are pretty pretty

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.710 
because these works are pretty pretty
fast<00:02:11.360> and<00:02:11.830> then<00:02:12.830> they<00:02:13.340> can<00:02:13.700> damage<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.600> lot

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
fast and then they can damage you a lot

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.130 
fast and then they can damage you a lot
but<00:02:17.720> even<00:02:18.530> though<00:02:19.130> try<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:20.030> get<00:02:20.240> past<00:02:20.600> them<00:02:20.959> and

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
but even though try to get past them and

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.479 
but even though try to get past them and
don't<00:02:21.620> fight<00:02:21.950> them

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:31.000 

the<00:02:25.489> fort<00:02:25.820> rest<00:02:26.209> is<00:02:26.450> here<00:02:27.760> so<00:02:28.760> not<00:02:29.000> in<00:02:29.239> here<00:02:30.010> we

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
the fort rest is here so not in here we

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.420 
the fort rest is here so not in here we
are<00:02:31.040> going<00:02:31.430> to

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
are going to

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.030 
are going to
go<00:02:34.430> up<00:02:35.030> but<00:02:35.540> I<00:02:35.569> have<00:02:35.959> to<00:02:36.170> conserve<00:02:36.590> because

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
go up but I have to conserve because

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.500 
go up but I have to conserve because
they<00:02:37.250> would<00:02:37.459> kill<00:02:38.030> me<00:02:38.239> and<00:02:39.400> here<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:40.549> have

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
points in one shot and it is not really

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.520 
points in one shot and it is not really
good<00:04:32.200> you<00:04:33.010> can<00:04:33.250> see<00:04:33.430> that<00:04:33.580> I<00:04:33.610> got<00:04:34.200> class<00:04:35.200> mode

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
good you can see that I got class mode

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:42.000 
good you can see that I got class mode
for<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:36.160> other<00:04:36.310> characters<00:04:37.120> too<00:04:40.590> so<00:04:41.590> really

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
for the other characters too so really

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.330 
for the other characters too so really
this<00:04:42.250> this<00:04:42.580> one<00:04:43.360> and<00:04:43.690> this<00:04:44.350> one<00:04:44.410> class<00:04:44.980> mode

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
this this one and this one class mode

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.540 
this this one and this one class mode
are<00:04:45.550> really<00:04:46.000> the<00:04:46.150> find<00:04:46.480> of<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:46.690> day<00:04:47.280> this<00:04:48.280> one

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
are really the find of the day this one

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.210 
are really the find of the day this one
would<00:04:48.760> be<00:04:49.000> really<00:04:49.630> really<00:04:49.810> great<00:04:50.260> if<00:04:50.650> it<00:04:50.920> had

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
would be really really great if it had

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.420 
would be really really great if it had
only<00:04:53.460> 35%<00:04:54.460> in<00:04:54.840> fire<00:04:55.840> rate<00:04:56.140> and<00:04:56.440> not<00:04:56.740> in<00:04:57.010> weapon

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
only 35% in fire rate and not in weapon

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.600 
only 35% in fire rate and not in weapon
accuracy<00:04:58.350> so<00:04:59.350> really<00:04:59.860> after<00:05:00.010> all<00:05:00.250> this

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
accuracy so really after all this

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.170 
accuracy so really after all this
farming<00:05:01.210> I<00:05:01.540> can<00:05:02.530> say<00:05:02.770> that<00:05:03.070> the<00:05:03.430> first<00:05:03.700> chest

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
farming I can say that the first chest

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.260 
farming I can say that the first chest
has<00:05:04.660> the<00:05:05.040> lowest<00:05:06.040> chance<00:05:06.520> of<00:05:06.820> containing

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
has the lowest chance of containing

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.430 
has the lowest chance of containing
class<00:05:07.750> modes<00:05:08.140> and<00:05:08.490> those<00:05:09.490> mimics<00:05:10.080> that<00:05:11.080> you

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
class modes and those mimics that you

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.680 
class modes and those mimics that you
should<00:05:11.650> kill<00:05:12.750> have<00:05:13.750> also<00:05:14.130> low<00:05:15.130> drop<00:05:16.090> rate<00:05:16.270> of

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
should kill have also low drop rate of

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.640 
should kill have also low drop rate of
the<00:05:16.900> class<00:05:17.170> modes<00:05:18.090> so<00:05:19.090> comment<00:05:19.930> share<00:05:20.260> to

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
the class modes so comment share to

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.870 
the class modes so comment share to
