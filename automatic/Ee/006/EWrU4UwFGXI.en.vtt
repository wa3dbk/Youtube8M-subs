controller<00:02:26.430> feels<00:02:27.090> really<00:02:27.510> comfortable<00:02:27.810> it's

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
controller feels really comfortable it's

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.410 
controller feels really comfortable it's
shaped<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.770> same<00:02:28.800> as<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.220> 360<00:02:29.790> controller<00:02:30.120> but

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
shaped the same as a 360 controller but

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.320 
shaped the same as a 360 controller but
the<00:02:31.380> grooves<00:02:31.740> on<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.070> back<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.610> could<00:02:33.090> tell

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
the grooves on the back you could tell

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330 
the grooves on the back you could tell
they're<00:02:33.570> slightly<00:02:34.080> different<00:02:34.770> and<00:02:34.950> actually

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
they're slightly different and actually

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.980 
they're slightly different and actually
actually<00:02:35.940> think<00:02:36.270> this<00:02:36.420> is<00:02:36.510> more<00:02:36.660> comfortable

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
actually think this is more comfortable

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.170 
actually think this is more comfortable
than<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.500> 360<00:02:37.980> controller<00:02:38.340> but<00:02:38.940> I'm<00:02:39.030> actually

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
than the 360 controller but I'm actually

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.240 
than the 360 controller but I'm actually
going<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.510> be<00:02:39.600> doing<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.990> you<00:02:40.770> know<00:02:40.890> separate
