00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.170 
do with this pattern we've been playing
for<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.900> while<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.560> would<00:00:50.190> exploit<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.670> move<00:00:51.090> it

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
for a while I would exploit that move it

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.230 
for a while I would exploit that move it
around<00:00:51.950> even<00:00:52.950> play<00:00:53.130> changes<00:00:53.610> moving<00:00:53.910> scales

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.240 
around even play changes moving scales

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.000 
around even play changes moving scales
to<00:00:54.480> change<00:00:54.720> chords<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.470> can<00:00:55.500> bring<00:00:55.740> up<00:00:55.860> that

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
to change chords you can bring up that

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.610 
to change chords you can bring up that
side<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.400> your<00:00:56.520> solos<00:00:56.910> absolutely<00:00:57.870> it's<00:00:58.500> the

so<00:03:27.390> we<00:03:27.480> talked<00:03:27.660> about<00:03:27.690> how<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:27.900> build<00:03:28.110> and

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
so we talked about how to build and

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.380 
so we talked about how to build and
construct<00:03:28.650> your<00:03:28.980> ideas<00:03:29.430> taking<00:03:30.090> a<00:03:30.180> simple

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
construct your ideas taking a simple

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.460 
construct your ideas taking a simple
little<00:03:30.660> phrase<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:32.720> maybe<00:03:33.720> amending<00:03:34.320> it<00:03:34.440> a

time

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.220 
time
play<00:03:37.010> it<00:03:37.100> again<00:03:37.190> do<00:03:37.580> you<00:03:37.730> think<00:03:38.080> that<00:03:39.080> maybe

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
play it again do you think that maybe

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.300 
play it again do you think that maybe
change<00:03:39.500> a<00:03:39.620> little<00:03:39.680> bit<00:03:40.780> and<00:03:41.830> how<00:03:42.830> to<00:03:42.890> take<00:03:43.130> that

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
change a little bit and how to take that

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.430 
change a little bit and how to take that
in<00:03:43.430> stack<00:03:43.790> each<00:03:44.120> one<00:03:44.450> layer<00:03:44.720> after<00:03:44.959> layer<00:03:45.110> and

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
in stack each one layer after layer and

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.710 
in stack each one layer after layer and
evolve<00:03:45.770> that<00:03:46.069> your<00:03:46.819> soul<00:03:47.120> will<00:03:47.300> see<00:03:47.450> your

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
sentences become paragraphs and we

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.229 
sentences become paragraphs and we
construct<00:03:51.830> a<00:03:52.069> little<00:03:52.430> on<00:03:52.520> Jeff<00:03:52.730> Keith<00:03:52.910> waters
