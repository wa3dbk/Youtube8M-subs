00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.990
 hello how about I'm a link law and today I'm going to 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.709
 talk about some of the many 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:12.950
 expos which I use on my phone 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:17.240
 I have an engine or motorcycle with a 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:20.290
 Android version 4.4 point 4 with the 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.290
 rumba stock 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.450
 or the official of my company as you 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.430
 want to say first that nothing is going to 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.770
 the ejector installer 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.460
 and well of the first module that I am going to 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:39.130
 talk is the blu-ray system uy that 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.560
 It serves to make this effect in the bar 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.310
 of notifications that is an effect like 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.960
 of 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:51.440
 of blurring is how he is very similar 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.440
 to which they have the iphones and he has left 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.450
 very well to the notification bar of 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.430
 Android looks very beautiful and aesthetic 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.220
 in the second way what I want them 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.590
 to speak is the gravity box 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.600
 I use the kitkat version but there 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.770
 versions for other versions of 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.229
 android 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.320
 and here is the box adds many 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.680
 Personalization functionalities at 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.660
 Android phone 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.150
 like for example some of the things 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.080
 what I have done is in the bar 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:29.450
 navigation make it smaller 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.430
 and add a module of d 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.470
 an advanced restart module in my 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:39.420
 phone add is also 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.299
 transparency at the time of it go down or 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.700
 increase volume that likewise to the 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.500
 touching the keys no longer lowers the volume 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.360
 does not raise the volume of calls but rather 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.600
 is the multimedia volume that we use 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.970
 to play videos or listen to music 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.740
 also if I keep tight the 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.140
 volume up or down keys 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.740
 when I'm listening to music and with the 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:06.040
 phone off I changed the song 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.160
 no need to turn on the phone and 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:13.300
 changing the song in the same way is 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.790
 centered the clock in my bar 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.100
 notifications I changed some 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.200
 icons like that of 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.950
 as the d 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.690
 battery among other things that allows you 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.980
 do is 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.870
 this module of zeta 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.140
 comes the next module that we are going to 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.720
 see is the heads up notifications that 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.090
 It serves for the following when it reaches you 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.510
 a notification will no longer have to 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.019
 slide the notification bar but 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.430
 you're going to get a pop-up ad 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.430
 here here is 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.080
 that you can expand it in the same way 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:01.360
 like the normals 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.360
 and it's very very useful for me 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.450
 comes the next module that I have to 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.450
 I want to teach you is the dye of 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.910
 status bar that serves for the following 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.440
 if I make an application like for example 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.990
 this one is going to put him 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.320
 Notifications tab of the same 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:29.800
 color of the application we will do 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:34.000
 another test with another application like 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.740
 cleaner and come served perfectly in 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.560
 some applications serve us but 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.810
 you can change the color of the one you want 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.590
 is that they put that application in 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.590
 specific 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.709
 comes the next module that I want them 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.540
 teach is the wifi that he saw that adds 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.879
 a very good phone functionality 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.860
 which is the next one if we 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.860
 we go to wifi settings 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:07.500
 and we press on the name 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.600
 of any connection is going to put the 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.890
 show password option is the 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:16.150
 functionality that adds 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:20.040
 that module exposed to the phone and so 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:25.120
 we can see the password of the 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:26.830
 connection that we have and the next module 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.640
 What I want to teach you is YouTube 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.860
 adware that serves simply so that 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.470
 youtube do not give us notices 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:40.550
 advertising and we can continue to see the 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:42.770
 video without those annoying ads 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.990
 well that would be all for today's video 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.080
 I hope you liked it later 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.590
 more tutorials come on android 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.590
 until next time
