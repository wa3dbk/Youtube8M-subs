00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello everyone welcome on my sweater 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.160
 youtube channel of the guides 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.569
 punchers to have watched passionate to 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.540
 the computer end of the trees and everything 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.630
 that goes bad like Toumai and will get 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.460
 So welcome everyone welcome 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.240
 today today today we 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.960
 tackles a boxing unpacking on 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.890
 casing hundred i ii at corsair so that's 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.410
 hydro series is like we can see 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.660
 it is a harbor of 240 with possible 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.309
 at corsair the bright pump 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.200
 here 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:37.110
 I had h80 who we see a little bit and 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.370
 here a little bit of issues that has messed up 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.600
 every day we ask for it 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.670
 light disappeared 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.300
 who is going to leave in a little deg 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.200
 because you know it's expensive 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.550
 especially since there are barely two months late 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.570
 in short I took an accent and I hope that 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.030
 it will not be a problem for that one 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.320
 because otherwise it's going to shit go 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.320
 good truce joke in attack 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.630
 each step 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:34.460
 so here I have the boiboite box that 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:37.350
 is rather nice special thing 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.850
 good all this is grated lift 1 this is the 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.900
 pub from corsair produce his mass 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:49.380
 elevated best this is what we unpack 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:51.869
 all that so what are we first 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.670
 place attention we go back and there this 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.040
 produced directly at corsair for 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.410
 shop yeah nice except that know it 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.540
 and barks to his bomb sent a CV 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.869
 certainly they have beautiful and know it's great 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.540
 fast efficient but it's expensive because 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:11.010
 they are not in France 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:14.910
 so do we have a little bit and then 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.720
 case of problem with warranty 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.280
 for the Australians 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.769
 we do not care what is a little bit of 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:31.019
 ad one of course it's free why 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:37.310
 to deprive yourself of the installation guide that 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:37.310
 tell you how it is provided any case 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.380
 I think you know you if anything from 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.459
 that and we do not attack anymore we have 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.670
 super plastic 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:54.739
 evil wow good then 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:57.080

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.790
 many climbs or 120 of sir 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.400
 Corsair I did not use because 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:05.470
 they are super bright points 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:12.380
 negative of the corset deyris verrines noize 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:13.600
 there the booster the pirate fang forgiveness 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.500
 the corsair inc 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:20.090
 for direct cable the motherboard that 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:27.700
 it's for the fans to plug in 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:33.170
 down payment installation kits 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:35.900
 rather nice here is pleased effective at this 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.400
 clip it's really quickly that's it 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.450
 it is to put this answer to these 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.790
 attacks 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:50.720
 ar it's for amd anyway thank you 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:58.450
 is finally theirs we forgot the distri 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:58.450
 that provides the not bad is enough to do 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.450
 then Europe in 240 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:23.960
 we already have the pump from corsair 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:28.910
 it looks like she's slightly different 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:30.320
 mine strangely it's copper 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.400
 the thermal paste that I'm not going 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.490
 use that I had to stake that ever 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.760
 that mine to feed it is not 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.490
 molex is sata so I hope that 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.669
 you have a certain book and that is 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.360
 the three pina connect on the cpu 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:49.880
 story they were calm who 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:52.520
 invokes so here is the rhode then 140 of 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.470
 at corsair we can see it is not 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:05:01.280
 very thick and a little thinner than the h 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:03.590
 sometimes cowardly 86.38 the cdu 27.3 the 36th 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.919
 38th it's more in bresse managed to manage 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.200
 way it's already pretty big 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.570
 so that's pretty beautiful it's not 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.160
 badly it's full black 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.479
 we will test that we see what you 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.010
 I hope I will not have the faults of the 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.720
 hash 80 and who still has enough 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:22.910
