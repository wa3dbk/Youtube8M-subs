00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.000
 I think yesterday Americans I know 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.869
 not if they are looking for 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.730
 I think they're looking for something 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.560
 something that may be a very small 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.439
 little the equivalent of their Americans 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.960
 with a little more than two 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.970
 stuff at 6 2 i would say so i do not know 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.410
 how do I define it for example what 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.030
 which was amazing if I take my 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.829
 experience there are other people who have 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.960
 been hired a bit on the same criteria 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.489
 I had an experience in pictures of 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.320
 synthesis he founds computer graphics that 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.980
 was almost nil where I had very 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.809
 little does two things 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.789
 and that's what interested them it's 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.629
 finally the mama part realization that 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.180
 Nevertheless, they hired me as 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.030
 that animator but it was really this 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.379
 spontaneity that I could have in 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.640
 in different short films even 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.559
 in advertisements that's things that 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.750
 liked them well and then for example 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.129
 for animators there is what we 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.730
 calls the acting ie the way 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.379
 to play a character 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.189
 the Americans a way necessarily to them 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.369
 to play 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.600
 and then but who is for example I 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.369
 check them out on asterix which is very 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.950
 different when we start doing a 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.950
 animation on a French law and had 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.570
 in fact one another way a real one 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.909
 real other way of working and I 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.310
 think that at times they can when 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.080
 we are surrounded in the same way as we 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.330
 will be surrounded by French French French 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.950
 them to really make stereotypes 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.520
 American animation and I 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.259
 the impression that i with the french 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.939
 European and in any case maybe more 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.680
 mostly with the French there are 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.549
 there is a kind of minimalism in 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.090
 animation whose acting which their 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.490
 suits well 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.799
 so I came back to France after 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.939
 three years before I got there 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.950
 a project occurred because 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.540
 I wanted to rest in France 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.970
 with my wife and we said we were 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.350
 we will recover and I continued to 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.119
 do other things be animated 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.979
 on solarization storyboard and then 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.990
 came asterix but actually on 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.210
 asterix even though I was not a director 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.799
 in the united states 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.180
 we can see many things 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.250
 can hear a lot of things and we 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.400
 takes very participatory tests there 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.140
 down weirdly less pyramidal than in 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.569
 France in the organization even if it's 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.350
 very well organized but we can have 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.700
 bridges we can go 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.950
 directly spoken to the director knows 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.060
 things that I did not find there 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.470
 had no problem ego ya no 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.489
 problem of older gilles more than 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.780
 Well, well, I thought it was enough 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.310
 well and that's something I have 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.380
 tried to institute very modestly and 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.450
 then I think it was also the spirit 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.410
 of the team we had at the Mikros studio 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.050
 for asterix 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.819
 we really have really develop 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.410
 I tried it either 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.989
 naturally done and I think it has 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.160
 helped also angers the returns of 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.940
 all the technicians of all people 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.550
 what we want is another film 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.209
 that there was a real simplicity of 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:51.150
 to exchange without this without 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.620
 afraid of this way not feeling too much 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.690
 allowed what eventually by being enough 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.040
 free from what can be said that we have a 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.230
 little less in a bubble than the 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.880
 Americans in the Americans finally 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.540
 it became the standard film 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.930
 international 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.599
 I think that in France we have 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.010
 we do not have this culture myself 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.469
 if it takes more and more scale 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.909
 since when they come to make 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:12.140
 movies here it's to make movie 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.000
 American I mean it's true that 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.969
 me ugly and nasty even if we like 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.040
 a lot it's still a product 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:20.510
 dear for the purposes that I know well go 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.019
 hate you but it's still a product 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.090
 American 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.500
 for me messi and pasta small 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.310
 things here and there that are different 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.310
 here
