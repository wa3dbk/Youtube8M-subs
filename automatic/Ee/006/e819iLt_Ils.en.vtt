00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
can come out of the reservoir when you

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.859 
can come out of the reservoir when you
start<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.730> because<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.269> disconnect<00:00:27.689> all<00:00:27.840> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
start it because you disconnect all the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.729 
start it because you disconnect all the
hoses<00:00:28.349> in<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.740> process<00:00:33.500> gotta<00:00:34.500> wait<00:00:34.590> for<00:00:34.620> the

pigtails to turn off let them injectors

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.450 
pigtails to turn off let them injectors
warm<00:00:40.320> up<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.559> best<00:00:40.800> they<00:00:40.980> can

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
warm up the best they can

00:00:41.460 --> 00:01:06.920 
warm up the best they can
we're<00:00:41.820> going<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.000> go<00:00:42.090> far

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.810 

yeah<00:01:10.740> fluid<00:01:11.740> went<00:01:11.890> down<00:01:12.070> a<00:01:12.100> little<00:01:12.280> bit<00:01:12.460> so

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
yeah fluid went down a little bit so

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.690 
yeah fluid went down a little bit so
that's<00:01:13.000> good<00:01:13.270> it's<00:01:13.479> taking<00:01:13.960> in<00:01:14.080> fluid

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
that's good it's taking in fluid

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.749 
that's good it's taking in fluid
yeah<00:01:16.680> yeah<00:01:17.680> I've<00:01:17.860> had<00:01:18.100> those<00:01:18.250> high<00:01:18.490> pressure

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
yeah yeah I've had those high pressure

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.960 
yeah yeah I've had those high pressure
lines<00:01:19.119> off<00:01:19.420> of<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.720> Express<00:01:20.530> Duramax<00:01:21.520> vans

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
lines off of the Express Duramax vans

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.420 
lines off of the Express Duramax vans
and<00:01:22.420> it<00:01:23.170> takes<00:01:23.500> a<00:01:23.649> while<00:01:23.770> to<00:01:23.830> get<00:01:24.190> them<00:01:24.280> going

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
and it takes a while to get them going

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.350 
and it takes a while to get them going
with<00:01:24.670> all<00:01:24.789> that<00:01:24.940> air<00:01:25.090> in<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.270> line<00:01:25.450> so<00:01:25.479> I

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
with all that air in the line so I

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.210 
with all that air in the line so I
figured<00:01:28.360> I<00:01:28.420> left<00:01:28.659> to<00:01:28.840> let<00:01:29.439> the<00:01:29.530> pump<00:01:29.740> run<00:01:29.950> a<00:01:29.979> bit

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
figured I left to let the pump run a bit

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:37.050 
figured I left to let the pump run a bit
try<00:01:30.850> again<00:01:33.180> get<00:01:34.180> started<00:01:34.689> or<00:01:34.810> restive<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.850> is

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
try again get started or restive that is

00:01:37.060 --> 00:02:13.490 
try again get started or restive that is
bombers<00:01:37.659> at<00:01:37.899> 100

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.009

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
I'm going to check for codes just to

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:36.430 
I'm going to check for codes just to
make<00:02:18.670> sure<00:02:22.379> what's<00:02:23.379> smoking

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.750 

what<00:02:37.440> is<00:02:37.560> that<00:02:37.710> smoking<00:02:38.220> you<00:02:38.340> see<00:02:38.550> that

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.070 

where<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:44.910> razor<00:02:45.090> blade<00:02:45.360> way<00:02:45.480> right<00:02:45.690> there<00:02:45.840> -

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
where that razor blade way right there -

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
where that razor blade way right there -
oh<00:02:47.600> it<00:02:48.600> is<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.810> starter<00:02:49.380> yeah<00:02:49.590> we<00:02:49.740> better<00:02:49.920> let

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
oh it is the starter yeah we better let

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.150 
oh it is the starter yeah we better let
it<00:02:50.250> cool<00:02:50.430> right<00:02:53.660> this<00:02:54.660> time<00:02:54.870> what<00:02:55.860> a<00:02:55.890> crack

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
it cool right this time what a crack

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.660 
it cool right this time what a crack
I'll<00:02:56.430> crack<00:02:56.760> this<00:02:56.910> time<00:02:57.180> today<00:02:58.310> next<00:02:59.310> going<00:02:59.610> to

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
I'll crack this time today next going to

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.160 
I'll crack this time today next going to
give<00:02:59.790> it<00:02:59.910> the<00:02:59.940> magic<00:03:00.360> touch<00:03:02.960> probably<00:03:03.960> ready

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
give it the magic touch probably ready

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:17.480 
give it the magic touch probably ready
with<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.440> coolant<00:03:16.280> sounds<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.340> lot<00:03:17.430> better

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
with the coolant sounds a lot better

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.190 
with the coolant sounds a lot better
yeah<00:03:18.390> some<00:03:19.170> deeper<00:03:20.450> yeah<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:21.510> can<00:03:21.780> even<00:03:22.020> hear

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
yeah some deeper yeah you can even hear

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.680 
yeah some deeper yeah you can even hear
it<00:03:22.290> in<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.440> tailpipe<00:03:22.680> yeah<00:03:23.340> I'll<00:03:24.209> keep<00:03:24.420> an<00:03:24.600> eye

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
it in the tailpipe yeah I'll keep an eye

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.949 
it in the tailpipe yeah I'll keep an eye
on<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:25.080> starter<00:03:25.770> here<00:03:26.360> but<00:03:27.360> yeah<00:03:27.510> just<00:03:27.720> kind

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
on the starter here but yeah just kind

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.460 
on the starter here but yeah just kind
of<00:03:28.020> like<00:03:28.200> crack<00:03:28.860> rest<00:03:29.280> crank<00:03:29.730> rest<00:03:30.060> I<00:03:30.470> figured

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
of like crack rest crank rest I figured

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.710 
of like crack rest crank rest I figured
it<00:03:31.560> was<00:03:31.650> going<00:03:31.770> to<00:03:31.860> take<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.040> while<00:03:32.570> good<00:03:33.570> nice

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
it was going to take a while good nice

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.400 
it was going to take a while good nice
and<00:03:33.750> solid

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
and solid

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.060 
and solid
I<00:03:34.620> mean<00:03:35.420> fairly<00:03:36.420> it<00:03:36.959> softens<00:03:37.500> up<00:03:37.650> after<00:03:38.040> a

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
I mean fairly it softens up after a

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:50.640 
I mean fairly it softens up after a
while<00:03:38.310> here<00:03:38.760> we<00:03:38.880> go

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650
