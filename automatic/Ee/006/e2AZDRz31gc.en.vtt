utmost ease and grace whilst Daniel and

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.900 
utmost ease and grace whilst Daniel and
I<00:00:37.190> struggled<00:00:38.190> along<00:00:38.340> at<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.579> back<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
I struggled along at the back of the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.459 
I struggled along at the back of the
class<00:00:39.120> but<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.870> thought<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.350> would

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
class but I thought that that would

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.530 
class but I thought that that would
provide<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.800> funny<00:00:41.370> framework<00:00:41.850> for<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.210> piece

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
provide a funny framework for this piece

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.720 
provide a funny framework for this piece
and<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.620> bit<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.860> tribute<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.190> Tatiana

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
and it's a bit of a tribute to Tatiana

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.700 
and it's a bit of a tribute to Tatiana
and<00:00:44.969> hopefully<00:00:45.570> now<00:00:45.719> we've<00:00:46.050> got<00:00:46.230> warm<00:00:46.440> up<00:00:46.559> we'd
