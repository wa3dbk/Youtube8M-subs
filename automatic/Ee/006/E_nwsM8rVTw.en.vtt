00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:06.299
 I think everyone experiences at some point 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.920
 a wonder 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.530
 Mainz was that I calculated 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:15.119
 opposite marga mirror man lived 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.890
 she was undoubtedly the most gorgeous 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.690
 that God ever created 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.390
 Mahler's life consisted of a series 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.440
 incredible adventure do you want this 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.420
 girl until the end of high school 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.890
 to put on the weather until shortly before ours 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.170
 I'm leaving school and I'm driving 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.700
 virtually strangers until that night what 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.170
 I need your dare what I have to 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.219
 stop doing new things 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.390
 you do not use your friend for it 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.390
 meanwhile my ex-boyfriend 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.550
 my friend cheated on me 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.969
 vengeance does not make me so terrible 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.969
 looks 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:57.170
 until totally crazy 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.510

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.000

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.550
 feel whole life 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.410
 beautiful plastic instead of plastic 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.800
 houses and plastic people everything 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.880
 reliable less you will not come 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.420
 always thinking about everything early 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.100
 I hope that at least marco always has 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.900
 so loved maybe even talk like that 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.550
 very much she herself became one 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.080
 she disappeared when it was warmer 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.729
 Last seen you were in her 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.500
 she must have something last night 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.360
 means what hangs the markus window 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.399
 she left no traces like 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.020
 breadcrumbs I 've discovered something that 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:37.009

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.990

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.570

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.259

 I'm with you as well 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.090
 I always play it safe 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.649
 risk something 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.890
