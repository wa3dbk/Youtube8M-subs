00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
I just I can't see the logic in some of

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.760 
I just I can't see the logic in some of
the<00:01:34.829> places<00:01:34.950> like<00:01:35.280> de<00:01:35.490> baile<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.200> 90<00:01:37.200> k<00:01:37.380> which

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
the places like de baile is 90 k which

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.010 
the places like de baile is 90 k which
blows<00:01:38.700> while<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.090> don't<00:01:39.299> maybe<00:01:39.390> even<00:01:39.570> hundred<00:01:39.930> K

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
blows while I don't maybe even hundred K

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.499 
blows while I don't maybe even hundred K
but<00:01:40.439> still<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:40.829> some<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.549> silver<00:01:42.000> team

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
but still like some of the silver team

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.330 
but still like some of the silver team
of<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.720> seasons<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.140> would<00:01:43.290> probably<00:01:44.040> go

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
of the seasons that would probably go

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.810 
of the seasons that would probably go
for<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:45.500> 750<00:01:46.500> 800<00:01:47.070> maybe<00:01:47.220> even<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.610> million

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
for like 750 800 maybe even a million

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.460 
for like 750 800 maybe even a million
coins<00:01:48.210> if<00:01:48.540> they<00:01:48.780> were<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:49.079> released

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
coins if they were just released

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.330 
coins if they were just released

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
doesn't that is probably the one thing

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.849 
doesn't that is probably the one thing
that<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.769> really<00:02:53.310> really<00:02:53.870> want<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:55.260> be<00:02:55.410> changed

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
that I really really want to be changed

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.030 
that I really really want to be changed
by<00:02:55.980> they<00:02:56.099> just<00:02:56.340> all<00:02:56.579> they<00:02:56.819> need<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:56.970> do<00:02:57.150> is<00:02:58.040> two

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
by they just all they need to do is two

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.420 
by they just all they need to do is two
things<00:02:59.069> either<00:02:59.609> remove<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.810> minimum<00:03:01.430> that

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
things either remove the minimum that

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.839 
things either remove the minimum that
would<00:03:02.579> solve<00:03:02.879> the<00:03:03.359> ones<00:03:03.599> that<00:03:03.840> don't<00:03:04.019> sell<00:03:04.319> and

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
would solve the ones that don't sell and

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.930 
would solve the ones that don't sell and
to<00:03:05.849> just<00:03:06.390> have<00:03:07.079> some<00:03:07.349> logic<00:03:07.890> behind<00:03:08.129> the<00:03:08.609> price

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
to just have some logic behind the price

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.080 
to just have some logic behind the price
ranges<00:03:09.690> like<00:03:09.930> I'm<00:03:10.260> not<00:03:10.709> having<00:03:11.069> that<00:03:11.310> much<00:03:11.909> of

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
ranges like I'm not having that much of

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.149 
ranges like I'm not having that much of
a<00:03:12.150> loan<00:03:12.359> but<00:03:12.690> it<00:03:13.230> really<00:03:13.620> really<00:03:13.920> would<00:03:14.069> be

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
a loan but it really really would be

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.050 
a loan but it really really would be
nice<00:03:14.310> because<00:03:14.430> there<00:03:14.579> are<00:03:14.670> some<00:03:14.849> awesome

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
nice because there are some awesome

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.199 
nice because there are some awesome
awesome<00:03:15.959> players<00:03:16.200> I<00:03:16.530> just<00:03:17.340> I'd<00:03:17.519> love<00:03:17.849> to<00:03:17.910> try
