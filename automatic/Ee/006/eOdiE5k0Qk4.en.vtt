00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.930

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.930
 same discussion 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.430

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.990
 tatiana chip because 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.430
 on some shots they call without really no ntic racket for the 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.770
 push in the field 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.770
 to play a little more his opponent 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:22.069
 Quebec is for sure 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.319

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.760
 catherine concluded this meeting 8-6 at tie-break 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:35.569
 this time Tuesday because last summer 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.419
 we do not say anything about what is called a vote in chada 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:42.019
 yes yes yes she was not soon enough rihanna gets angry law that's right 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:43.960

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.709
 and from the character jury 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.250
 hello public obviously to have listened to some whistles because the 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:52.039
 contest 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:55.519
 * insurers 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.519
 very important a lot of supporters 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.519
 in this short stalair Breton dances 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:06.089
 funny end of the match and tatyana 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.519
 we owe this victory 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.959
 difficult victory but we know lately they are difficult 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.599
 get these important victories pull off this year 2005 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.939
 and m obviously for her it's a big relief to qualify 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.939
 for the round of 16 of this us open 

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:31.139
 Tottenham went far - this match and I think it can be a 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.479
 match reference could perhaps in store 

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:36.479
 because we do not play very well especially the end of the second set 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:37.689
 with this tension 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:40.790
 she managed to get out and that's where we see the champions is that 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.129
 when we do not play very well to win a match it is so it is 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:45.969
 where we progress 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:48.849
 and it is the group is a shareholder 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.839
 petiet has had with 6 wins in two sets she returns from very very 

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:56.799
 far in this match without giving persuaded the next thing there is still a duel 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:57.579
 interesting 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.869
 and the EU since it will be opposed 

00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:03.520
 to another french nathalie dechy, who is the deceiver of their works 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.160
 the American, which therefore requires a new Franco-French duel for 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.229
 nathalie dechy 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:11.309
 who will be the next quality opponent of the kitchen? 

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:14.019
 a detour on the plateau with guillaume di grazia we learn very 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.349
 quick direction of flushing meadows
