00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:17.759 
just a piece of paper so that I can make

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:21.800 
just a piece of paper so that I can make
my<00:00:17.939> pattern<00:00:18.450> I<00:00:18.630> folded<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.590> in<00:00:19.740> half<00:00:20.689> and<00:00:21.689> then

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
my pattern I folded it in half and then

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.650 
my pattern I folded it in half and then
I<00:00:21.900> just<00:00:22.110> drew<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.439> design<00:00:22.860> on<00:00:23.160> here<00:00:23.460> so<00:00:24.210> whatever

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
I just drew a design on here so whatever

cut<00:00:37.380> out<00:00:37.559> for<00:00:37.890> your<00:00:38.010> patterns

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.400 

and<00:00:47.950> that<00:00:48.940> would<00:00:49.120> be<00:00:49.270> a<00:00:49.300> pattern<00:00:49.600> the<00:00:50.110> fold

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
and that would be a pattern the fold

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.250 
and that would be a pattern the fold
your<00:00:50.650> cardstock<00:00:50.950> line<00:00:51.730> up<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.270> crease<00:00:52.660> right

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.920 
there and there and you're just going to
lightly<00:00:57.070> trace<00:00:57.580> around<00:00:57.880> your<00:00:58.330> pattern<00:00:58.840> and

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
lightly trace around your pattern and

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:12.480 
lightly trace around your pattern and
you<00:01:01.930> cut<00:01:02.110> that<00:01:02.290> out

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.719 

you

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.050 

you're<00:01:18.659> going<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.189> glue<00:01:20.189> them<00:01:20.369> together<00:01:20.549> in

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
you're going to glue them together in

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.749 
you're going to glue them together in
groups<00:01:21.329> of<00:01:21.539> two<00:01:21.899> brush<00:01:22.890> some<00:01:23.100> Elmer's<00:01:23.490> white

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
groups of two brush some Elmer's white

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.429 
groups of two brush some Elmer's white
glue<00:01:24.119> on<00:01:24.450> one<00:01:24.930> side<00:01:25.229> like<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:27.200> glue<00:01:28.200> two

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
glue on one side like this glue two

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.310 
glue on one side like this glue two
together<00:01:28.679> like<00:01:29.219> that<00:01:29.780> so<00:01:30.780> then<00:01:30.929> after<00:01:31.229> you

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
together like that so then after you

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.580 
together like that so then after you
have<00:01:31.530> your<00:01:32.070> groups<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.579> two<00:01:32.850> together

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.980 

one<00:01:36.770> of<00:01:36.920> your<00:01:37.070> groups<00:01:37.310> of<00:01:37.520> two<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:38.119> you're

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
one of your groups of two and you're

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.789 
one of your groups of two and you're
going<00:01:39.020> to

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:51.429 

like<00:01:45.579> that<00:01:45.820> in<00:01:46.090> groups<00:01:46.329> of<00:01:46.479> four

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.220
