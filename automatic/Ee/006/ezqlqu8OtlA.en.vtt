00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:06.700
 hello tankers this is a pilot issue 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.500
 transfer the pros and cons and in this video 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.559
 we will look very interesting 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.480
 french tank and mx sitis will not 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:18.359
 delay walk on the merits and 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.359
 disadvantages of this st well go 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.890
 so the positive side of the middle 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.320
 Tank and we to Sidisi 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.660
 plus number one mobility and quite good 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.879
 maximum speed buying given 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.530
 tank you must understand that it is very 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.660
 significant advantage for this 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.180
 Medium tank slip on comfortable 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.829
 position to start a fight or circle someone 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.519
 at a crucial moment, always welcome 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.739
 plus number two precision implements hop from 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:54.019
 precision guns are great because of this 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:58.670
 the expression is perfect for this tank 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:01:02.119
 flutter like a butterfly and pity like a bee plus 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.460
 number three pierce and namely 212 

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:06.590
 millimeters normal projectile I understand 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.810
 what to go into detailed numbers pretty 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.880
 tedious but still not stressed 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.189
 breakthrough of this tanchik is impossible 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.080
 most of the time you oh enough with 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.149
 head on my own I want to add that 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.670
 penetration rate for a premium tank 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.710
 extremely important because less goldovyh 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.060
 shells slaughter you shoot those 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.149
 less cost and as a result, higher farm 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.590
 plus number four in v.n. 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:34.009
 American tanks used to be kings 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.490
 in this but then the Japanese and now pulled up 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.080
 Our cheerful Frenchman Dauren can be excellent 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.280
 to use with great success 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:46.429
 various bumps plus number 5 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.520
 review see a formidable enemy whether 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:52.670
 isu-152 or worse as they are by t 10 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.190
 level keep such an enemy at a distance 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.830
 just be aware that if you drive up 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.959
 a little closer than you need is a hangar 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.539
 case of detection get you not 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:06.769
 no trouble and you will 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:08.599
 destroyed very quickly destroyed what 

00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:10.640
 at first glance it seems to you that 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.080
 you have a great tank with ease 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.120
 get to fill mountains of damage and 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.140
 loans but don't rush to consider 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.700
 disadvantages of this tank minus number one 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.670
 lack of any 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.390
 booking punch everything always everywhere 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.700
 constantly and anywhere ricochet enough 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.040
 use magic of course a little 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.909
 I exaggerate but I donâ€™t hope on the armor 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.340
 it should have been awarded to them and 1 minus the number 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:39.709
 two sizes like when you look at it 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.049
 by nothing special but i think 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.150
 the drivers of this technique felt how 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.040
 the tank is great for its class so 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.959
 this tank is my understanding of some 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.160
 remote similarity of lore 40t 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:54.050
 That is a very large cardboard 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.240
 minus number three lack of preferential 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.440
 the level of fights is actually pretty 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.690
 weighty minus 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.210
 after all, when not throwing at 2 levels 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.370
 above it is very nice there is room for 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.220
 action so to speak so be 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.790
 extremely attentive with 10 levels 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.830
 I 'm especially afraid of maneuvering tanks 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.980
 these are all the main pros and cons that 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.260
 I selected Vai exedy network can tell 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.930
 that the tank has good qualities 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.090
 but there is one big but extremely tank 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.459
 skill dependent position aggravates and not 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.560
 preferential level of battles and weak armor 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.360
 Yes, and good mobility, too, can 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.610
 bring an inexperienced player as soon as possible 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.489
 to hangar but surely 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.220
 mx sitis very interesting good prem 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.709
 the tank of his dignity overlaps 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.630
 all faults i think most 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.160
 the tank players will like 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.100
 but at the same time I want to warn 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.140
 novice players by its complexity because 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.900
 you have to oh so much to analyze 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.900
 battle but if generally insidious breakthroughs 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.570
 rear of the enemy carousel illuminated as actively 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.510
 did passive support team here in 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:02.030
 what is st good but choice to buy 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.890
 it or not is always yours it 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.140
 all i wanted to tell you in this 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.239
 video I want to remind you that the video 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.150
 introduced bread diesel point and on 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.730
 throughout the video you have heard the voice 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.440
 gi huron if you liked this video
