00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.649
 I feed 6 times a week here is one such 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.980
 dry feed 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.519
 christ 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.230
 how to call but I do not know if such 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.100
 somewhere else we are basically a firm 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.250
 known from the nucleus this is their normal food and 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.970
 here it is pampered for a change two 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.609
 times a week 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.349
 eat rabbis and daphne have all sorts of different 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:31.500
 microscopic crustaceans why do we like them 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.930
 in general they are called in the vest popova 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.780
 such a package I speak to them now as 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.000
 once is that once a week is two 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.710
 times a week on wednesdays with 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.260
 and soups and saturday give me this today 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:48.590
 saturday just so you take that snack 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.750
 so for her it is purely up to the delicacy not 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:55.800
 especially happy for them 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.680
 variety in theory is necessary like this 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.899
 little by little but I lack patience 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:06.439
 I take it on the finger and rub it slightly 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:13.130
 to quality 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:19.560
 This type of almost on how the kitchen skoda 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:22.020
 for running for running and that first one was 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.240
 dry yes and it is given every day 6 times a 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.159
 week then sunday you do 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.810
 Pereryvchik not feed anything and twice in 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.790
 here this week lived here 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.790
 respectfully yes so -called 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.730
 so and what about what we clean water was 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.730
 a question 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.230
 understandably a lake on ordinary water and 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.970
 drugs 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.340
 let's show you that ring over us 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.520
 we have a specialized shop 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:01.530
 ask you give some type 1 he 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:05.340
 does n't even clean it just removes harmful 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:09.780
 substances from water such as such as that 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:15.660
 I do not know chlorine in general, all the filth 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:20.280
 removes from the water here such a name 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.380
 as it is, what it means is not 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.630
 horizontal bar 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.630
 protect fish just protect protect it 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:40.620
 tomorrow but wow excitement what 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:44.910
 a lot was given to share 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:55.820
 fine-tune the snow already would have it in fish 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:03:01.950
 equivalent and Malikov well, thank you all 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:04.640
 we will apply more but also some 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.640
 raised 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.270
 here in one big butt bright years is written 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.270
 5 milliliters I add this once a week 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.790
 fertilizer for plants 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:22.550
 but this plant is pretty unpretentious 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.090
 so they are kind that they did not fertilize 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.590
 grow at all crazy then 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.360
 I also advise you to add 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:34.670
 every day, too, one by one 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:39.680
 ml of liquid co2 in Russian a little bit 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:43.459
 Conchita where oxide is generally yes in Russian 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.880
 said it in german 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:50.780
 but not over his eagle is shorter understandable 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.489
 liquid liquid is so transparent a couple 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.290
 drops add this, too, on the stock exchange 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.670
 carbon dioxide immediately sour gas 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.700
 right for plants for plants 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.820
 useful if they are missing out there 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.890
 carbon dioxide although the population is what they 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.190
 in my opinion it is enough in general for him 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.910
 immediately visible if they start inspire 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.830
 what does not need oxygen is not lower 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:16.280
 plants for them from them here now 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:20.239
 germinate and speaking about the birth of which men 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.280
 carbon dioxide oxygen to anyone so all fish 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.500
 fine and how much do you add 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.030
 Carbon is also impossible to milliliter 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.620
 a day made it right every day yes and 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.950
 5 milliliters 1 week of this 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.720
 fertilizer for plants 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:39.860
 that's all well sone through this again 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.200
 say about about this one in your pocket 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.080
 I just ran out I went for a new one 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:50.780
 he is advised to take cereal in cereal 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:52.580
 because he he slowly settles and the fish 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.240
 has time to eat it for kv-1 he 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.850
 short bubbles on the grazing part 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.040
 multitouch just did not have another I took 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.710
 can not be when you quickly settles on 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:08.030
 the floor is not so good in principle so 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.900
 the same as he looks like casting do not pay 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.880
 attention working hands 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.940
 toha factories so for 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.920
 shorter like this but this is not my 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.260
 look redeem better if there is feed 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:25.810
 cereal better take spears yes it 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:31.930
 everything is optimal now everything is exactly yes 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:34.650
 thank you lasted such a master class 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.650
 small
