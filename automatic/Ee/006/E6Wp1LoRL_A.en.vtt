00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
feeder now what happens is I can put in

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.800 
feeder now what happens is I can put in
bird<00:02:17.189> sits<00:02:17.400> inside<00:02:17.579> there<00:02:17.909> it<00:02:18.390> will<00:02:18.480> call<00:02:18.659> like

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
bird sits inside there it will call like

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.759 
bird sits inside there it will call like
that<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:19.579> drop<00:02:20.579> the<00:02:20.730> foot<00:02:21.049> four<00:02:22.049> times<00:02:22.319> in<00:02:22.620> a

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
that and drop the foot four times in a

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.530 
that and drop the foot four times in a
day<00:02:22.920> right<00:02:23.870> four<00:02:24.870> times<00:02:25.079> in<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.349> day<00:02:25.530> so

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
day right four times in a day so

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.569 
day right four times in a day so
teaspoon<00:02:27.540> each<00:02:27.780> time<00:02:28.109> for<00:02:28.379> two<00:02:29.010> birds<00:02:29.280> that's

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
teaspoon each time for two birds that's

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.940 
teaspoon each time for two birds that's
just<00:02:30.030> nice<00:02:30.209> right<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:31.079> what's<00:02:31.349> working<00:02:31.530> fine

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
just nice right and what's working fine

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.270 
just nice right and what's working fine
for<00:02:31.980> about<00:02:32.659> three<00:02:33.659> days<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:34.859> can<00:02:35.010> stretch<00:02:35.250> it

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
for about three days you can stretch it

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.280 
for about three days you can stretch it
to<00:02:35.519> three<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.819> half<00:02:35.970> days<00:02:36.180> so<00:02:36.959> that<00:02:37.140> was<00:02:37.260> a

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
to three and a half days so that was a

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
to three and a half days so that was a
problem<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:37.920> encountered<00:02:38.040> while<00:02:40.310> the

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
problem I encountered while the

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.339 
problem I encountered while the
sunflower<00:02:41.760> seeds<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:42.420> bigger<00:02:42.629> bigger

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
sunflower seeds and the bigger bigger

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.050 
sunflower seeds and the bigger bigger
things<00:02:43.560> get<00:02:43.889> stuck<00:02:44.129> inside<00:02:44.370> there<00:02:44.639> and<00:02:44.849> I

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
things get stuck inside there and I

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.080 
things get stuck inside there and I
think<00:02:45.269> gems<00:02:45.510> are<00:02:45.689> so<00:02:46.560> if<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:47.489> happens<00:02:47.849> on<00:02:48.000> the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
think gems are so if that happens on the

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.789 
think gems are so if that happens on the
first<00:02:48.329> day<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.900> rest<00:02:49.079> of<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.349> three<00:02:49.620> days

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
first day the rest of the three days

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.610 
first day the rest of the three days
they<00:02:49.980> won't<00:02:50.159> have<00:02:50.310> fun<00:02:50.870> however<00:02:51.870> sometime<00:02:52.590> I

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
they won't have fun however sometime I

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.099 
they won't have fun however sometime I
have<00:02:52.769> to<00:02:52.950> go<00:02:53.220> over<00:02:53.430> see<00:02:53.609> say<00:02:53.849> seven<00:02:54.510> days<00:02:54.659> so

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
have to go over see say seven days so

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.470 
have to go over see say seven days so
what<00:02:55.290> do<00:02:55.379> I<00:02:55.439> do<00:02:55.530> that<00:02:55.799> right<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:56.909> looked<00:02:57.269> for

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
what do I do that right I looked for

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.140 
what do I do that right I looked for
many<00:02:57.689> opportunities<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.530> couldn't<00:02:58.889> get<00:02:58.980> a

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
many opportunities and I couldn't get a

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.849 
many opportunities and I couldn't get a
solution<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:00.840> came<00:03:00.959> up<00:03:01.139> with<00:03:01.379> this<00:03:01.500> on<00:03:01.709> my

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
solution so I came up with this on my

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.559 
solution so I came up with this on my
own<00:03:01.889> design<00:03:02.370> here<00:03:02.639> it's<00:03:02.970> not<00:03:03.060> quite<00:03:03.299> a<00:03:03.329> simple

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
own design here it's not quite a simple

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.509 
own design here it's not quite a simple
design<00:03:03.989> you<00:03:04.650> can<00:03:04.829> see<00:03:06.290> this<00:03:07.290> is<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.680> same<00:03:07.980> fish

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
design you can see this is the same fish

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.179 
design you can see this is the same fish
freedom<00:03:08.849> an<00:03:09.000> old<00:03:09.209> fish<00:03:09.450> feeder<00:03:09.689> I<00:03:09.780> have<00:03:10.189> the

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
freedom an old fish feeder I have the

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.399 
freedom an old fish feeder I have the
same<00:03:11.400> as<00:03:11.549> that<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:12.450> only<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:13.049> color<00:03:13.260> is

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
same as that that only the color is

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.679 
same as that that only the color is
different<00:03:13.560> so<00:03:14.250> I<00:03:14.280> can<00:03:14.519> set<00:03:14.790> when<00:03:15.269> I<00:03:15.299> want<00:03:15.629> to

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:15.689 
different so I can set when I want to

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:17.990 
different so I can set when I want to
feed<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.079> fish<00:03:16.409> sorry<00:03:17.099> when<00:03:17.310> when<00:03:17.609> I<00:03:17.639> want<00:03:17.879> to

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
feed the fish sorry when when I want to

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.920 
feed the fish sorry when when I want to
activate<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:19.340> food<00:03:20.340> dispenser<00:03:20.819> okay<00:03:21.690> so<00:03:21.750> I

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
activate the food dispenser okay so I

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.170 
activate the food dispenser okay so I
came<00:03:22.229> up<00:03:22.379> with<00:03:22.409> my<00:03:23.129> own<00:03:23.310> design<00:03:23.669> here<00:03:23.879> look<00:03:24.060> at

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
came up with my own design here look at

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.599 
came up with my own design here look at
this

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
this

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.159 
this

see but now I just show it how it was
then<00:03:30.750> I'll<00:03:30.870> take<00:03:31.019> it<00:03:31.109> out<00:03:31.229> to<00:03:31.379> show<00:03:31.409> you<00:03:31.560> so<00:03:32.310> I

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
then I'll take it out to show you so I

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.170 
then I'll take it out to show you so I
mean<00:03:34.319> it<00:03:34.379> you<00:03:34.470> made<00:03:34.620> this<00:03:34.769> oh<00:03:34.979> I<00:03:35.280> see

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
mean it you made this oh I see

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.449 
mean it you made this oh I see
so<00:03:38.180> this<00:03:39.080> paper<00:03:39.349> will<00:03:39.680> push<00:03:39.950> this<00:03:40.189> liver<00:03:41.439> and

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
so this paper will push this liver and

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.119 
so this paper will push this liver and
this<00:03:43.459> liver<00:03:43.819> is<00:03:43.909> the<00:03:44.560> hinged<00:03:45.560> and<00:03:45.739> a<00:03:45.829> spring

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
this liver is the hinged and a spring

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:51.720 
this liver is the hinged and a spring
here<00:03:46.579> the<00:03:47.150> foot<00:03:47.329> will<00:03:47.510> come<00:03:47.720> off<00:03:47.870> of<00:03:47.989> here

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.660 

can<00:03:52.730> see<00:03:52.879> that<00:03:53.030> it<00:03:53.180> works<00:03:53.360> right<00:03:53.930> now<00:03:54.640> so<00:03:55.640> I

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
can see that it works right now so I

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.610 
can see that it works right now so I
will<00:03:56.150> put<00:03:56.360> in<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:56.540> bird<00:03:56.870> seats<00:03:57.079> inside<00:03:57.349> here

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
will put in the bird seats inside here

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.949 
will put in the bird seats inside here
the<00:03:57.980> top<00:03:58.159> here<00:03:58.400> we<00:03:59.180> go<00:03:59.329> down<00:03:59.510> there<00:03:59.690> it's

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
the top here we go down there it's

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.420 
the top here we go down there it's
spring<00:04:00.230> loaded<00:04:00.260> so<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:00.829> door<00:04:01.190> will<00:04:01.310> always

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
spring loaded so the door will always

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.869 
spring loaded so the door will always
stay<00:04:02.150> close

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
stay close

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:08.009 
stay close
so<00:04:04.879> the<00:04:05.090> preset<00:04:05.810> time<00:04:06.079> the<00:04:06.829> dog<00:04:07.010> will<00:04:07.189> open<00:04:07.549> and

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
so the preset time the dog will open and

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.240 
so the preset time the dog will open and
this<00:04:09.019> entire<00:04:09.349> thing<00:04:09.590> will<00:04:09.739> be<00:04:09.890> put<00:04:10.099> into

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
this entire thing will be put into

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.680 
this entire thing will be put into
something<00:04:10.579> like<00:04:10.819> that<00:04:10.970> I<00:04:11.150> will<00:04:11.299> make<00:04:11.480> it<00:04:11.599> a

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
something like that I will make it a

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.870 
something like that I will make it a

lever okay I need to spring load this a

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:18.600 
lever okay I need to spring load this a
little<00:05:17.300> bit<00:05:17.389> more<00:05:17.539> I<00:05:17.659> need<00:05:17.840> to<00:05:17.930> fine-tune<00:05:18.169> this

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
little bit more I need to fine-tune this

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.760 
little bit more I need to fine-tune this
design<00:05:19.610> here<00:05:19.819> so<00:05:20.419> you'll<00:05:20.960> push<00:05:21.319> this<00:05:21.499> lever

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:34.219 
is just attached to a plywood simple

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:36.189 
is just attached to a plywood simple
plywood<00:05:34.580> now<00:05:35.150> here<00:05:35.479> this<00:05:35.689> this<00:05:35.960> thing<00:05:36.169> is

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
telescopic fishing rod right so I just

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.519 
telescopic fishing rod right so I just
made<00:05:44.029> an<00:05:44.150> angle<00:05:44.449> here<00:05:44.599> so<00:05:44.839> that<00:05:45.020> all<00:05:45.199> the<00:05:45.349> food

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:45.529 
made an angle here so that all the food

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:47.469 
made an angle here so that all the food
will<00:05:45.650> get<00:05:45.800> funneled<00:05:46.460> into<00:05:46.699> this<00:05:46.939> area<00:05:47.300> head

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
will get funneled into this area head

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.700 
will get funneled into this area head
opening<00:05:47.900> and<00:05:49.689> this<00:05:50.689> thing<00:05:50.930> is<00:05:51.050> nice<00:05:51.289> I<00:05:51.529> can

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
opening and this thing is nice I can

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.300 
opening and this thing is nice I can
easily<00:05:52.069> secure<00:05:52.430> this<00:05:53.770> you<00:05:54.770> can<00:05:54.979> see<00:05:55.129> that

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
easily secure this you can see that

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.480 
easily secure this you can see that
working<00:05:55.490> I<00:05:56.180> just<00:05:57.080> put<00:05:57.469> two<00:05:57.650> flaps<00:05:57.949> here<00:05:58.189> so

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
working I just put two flaps here so

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.749 
working I just put two flaps here so
that<00:05:58.580> I<00:05:58.610> can<00:05:58.819> secure<00:05:59.389> to<00:05:59.719> my<00:05:59.979> wire<00:06:00.979> there<00:06:01.129> it's

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 
that I can secure to my wire there it's

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:04.059 
that I can secure to my wire there it's
pretty<00:06:01.999> easy<00:06:02.270> so<00:06:02.810> the<00:06:02.960> tight<00:06:03.259> thing<00:06:03.499> I<00:06:03.710> think

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:04.069 
pretty easy so the tight thing I think

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:06.189 
pretty easy so the tight thing I think
it'll<00:06:04.219> work<00:06:04.430> but<00:06:04.759> I<00:06:04.819> may<00:06:05.060> need<00:06:05.270> to<00:06:05.419> fine-tune

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199 
it'll work but I may need to fine-tune

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:09.429 
it'll work but I may need to fine-tune
some<00:06:06.500> of<00:06:06.830> this<00:06:06.979> design<00:06:07.370> and<00:06:08.319> find<00:06:09.319> out

00:06:09.429 --> 00:06:09.439 
some of this design and find out

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:13.230 
some of this design and find out
delivery<00:06:09.800> to<00:06:10.069> that<00:06:10.250> green<00:06:10.669> box<00:06:10.909> over<00:06:11.180> there

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
delivery to that green box over there

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.879 
delivery to that green box over there
should<00:06:14.240> be<00:06:14.360> okay<00:06:14.889> hmm<00:06:15.889> I<00:06:16.039> think<00:06:16.610> so

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:17.889 
should be okay hmm I think so

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:24.369 
should be okay hmm I think so
anyway<00:06:19.210> I'll<00:06:20.210> see<00:06:20.270> how<00:06:20.599> this<00:06:20.779> works<00:06:21.050> and<00:06:23.379> if

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:24.379
