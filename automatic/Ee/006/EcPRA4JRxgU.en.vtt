00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.739
 good 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.670
 his hand 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:04.000
 right now and with a hungry and you know 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.000
 something to eat 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.660
 I'm sorry friend your creator but you 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.660
 they will destroy 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.170
 detected an incoming ship 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.310
 they are going to shoot 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.950
 toni you're fine 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.250
 with these cosmic bricks dominate the 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.250
 world 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.690
 but first I'll have to avoid what 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.090
 destroy this would have been much more 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.260
 easy if they had captured it intact 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:39.560
 instead of flying you start you arrived 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:45.130
 the avengers know how to ruin every 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:47.500
 evil plan your plan is fantastic 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.250
 bad choice of words god of the 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.610
 years 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.920
 I prefer to say it's spectacular 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.640
 probably super 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.370
 I've hired all the bad villains 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.060
 guys and dark minions I could 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.060
 find 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.760
 do not 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.750
 a little tongue twister but it's okay 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.450
 talking about that silence now we should 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.990
 trace more of these cosmic bricks 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:22.540
 powerful to energize my weapon their 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.540
 wishes are orders my lord 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.459
 Ok I'll let him go 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.459
 how much do you bring me some kisses 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.060
 of cosmic liters because I do not 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:41.950
 they named the supervisor here that 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.950
 boy has sand in the brain 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.840
 attack the big center at rush hour that 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.840
 yes that is something criminal 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.550
 you should look before jumping 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.050
 meters 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.759
 the bad guys the boys of Seoul 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.030
 they think we should formulate a plan of 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:40.030
 attack 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.810
 or we can simply crush all good 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:44.810
 plan
