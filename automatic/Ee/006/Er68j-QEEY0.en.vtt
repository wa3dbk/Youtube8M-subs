00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.519

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:02.640
 tossal then if not one how to say a 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:05.640
 flash of color but without this hairstyle 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.050
 it's super or be simple beautiful we live 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.820
 you can use it for any 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.280
 occasion can be for a little girl to 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.900
 a little meeting for anyone who is 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.420
 quick and easy 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.430
 come back as the set makes 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.550
 that I've been straight hair without seeing 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.710
 If we want you do not understand me I'm not a 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.570
 Uncle Maquilla Chito with a touch of color 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.430
 let's leave handsome days 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.440
 ok first let's go with the hairstyle that is 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.330
 an easy thing long but really if 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.220
 It looks nice and the only thing we have 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.320
 what to do first your hair has to 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.050
 be moist let's take a little 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.160
 cream to comb the perfect amount 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.160
 It is the size of a walnut 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.580
 something like that until they take the data the 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.800
 cream we have to always apply 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.570
 always from means to ends 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.580
 I love this cream because it does not leave you 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.830
 that feeling that you were your faith and the 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.050
 hair like all rigid shine is going to 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.400
 Protect your hair from the environment 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.470
 and it's going to make the hairstyle last 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.000
 much more besides, that's not why 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.040
 using this so that I do not get 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.740
 sponge but do not worry because there 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.020
 creams for all types of hair 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.000
 they have it Chinese straight those dangers that 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.980
 they always leave, they know they're going to 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.750
 find in any super and apart 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.300
 they are very accessible and this is going to do 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.010
 that I was left wavy but not shaped 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.840
 I know how to explain it right now I will see how 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.150
 I have left and here is something like that 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.160
 let it dry a little bit naturally or 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.590
 be a few seconds and what I'm going to do 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.240
 is to take two sections of hair this 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.100
 is to make some braids 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.240
 The most common train of life 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.240
 some on one side 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.680
 and at the end and held him with the pin 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.030
 and others the other and at the end the subject 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.800
 also with a pin he quoted what 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.140
 we have to do now and what is going to 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.790
 give as the extra uses what you are going to do 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.070
 colombi remains as it is and there is the 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.200
 super simple braids we will take 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.480
 just a section of hair to 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.040
 every train fold whether or not I know how 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.590
 explain it is not sure what they see with the 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.360
 image and we're going to take it out you know how to 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.910
 We are going to make the braids well 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.680
 disheveled but without an order 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.480
 perfect and that what we're going to have to 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.520
 do until you get to the fairy party and already 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.500
 that we did this in the 23 citations what 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.820
 we are going to do is cross the part 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.710
 from behind that is and what we have to 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.960
 to take them is to take the pin 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.150
 site and accommodate it but it can saturate 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.430
 with a limit or with what you want to me 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.250
 I like doing it with die pins 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.170
 look like more stressed out by in mind 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.000
 this is a hairstyle is stressed and since 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.340
 it does not last very well to give it as a 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.560
 touch if I offer good I have this 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.690
 diadem that since the year of the Bear I 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.000
 it's very old what I did was remove the 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.860
 flowers like that and took a pin and 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.890
 Then, as you already have that 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.630
 nice touch and more like romantic to the 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.510
 pine this hairstyle I like to do it 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.159
 a lot because 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.879
 super simple to do and I see myself 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.879
 fix and is 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.690
 ok the first thing I'm going to do is get 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.220
 that the base or the powder if you 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.840
 they want me to do a tutorial that what 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.670
 that I am putting myself in this time 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.400
 put in the comments and now we go 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.170
 with the eyes that this is like a 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.910
 very strong step for me because they know that 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.650
 I'm not very colorful but I loved it 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.870
 I really loved what I did 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.880
 the first one can put a first one that 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.710
 this thing is magical because it makes you 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.000
 lasted all day the shadow and that is not 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.070
 move you and make folds 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.960
 then it's like a creampie that I put it 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.550
 because the eyelid and a little bit down 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.380
 because I'm also going to put shadow 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.690
 so I did exactly that both 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.250
 little eyes and now this step is very easy 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.470
 of the day because the only thing we have 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.630
 what to do is look for a shadow class if 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.880
 it's like tanned or it's not 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.350
 as a very intense color you know that 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.150
 go well with your skin color I by 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.220
 example I have these two and I mix them 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.750
 so that you see a subtle color bone 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.060
 that he did not give himself a coffee so for the 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.790
 wedding or strong with these two colors 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.800
 and I put them in the account you already know that in 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.510
 that double quote from the eye but now not 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.400
 nothing bad leave a corner but also 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.950
 I put it on the inside then 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.870
 with a good fortune- telling skewer 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.610
 let's move from one place to another 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.710
 without going to the part of the 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.630
 eyelashes further down the basin we're going to 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.670
 mark it very well beautiful and for the 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.680
 bottom part I took the same colors and 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.820
 with a brush as you mark those of 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.820
 sanitas already saw 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.610
 Take a little with a wet brush 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:26.800
 Here we can put water from which 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.839
 we have or ore or we can also 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.389
 put thermal water and has exposed in the 

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:33.460
 little color with super subtle touches 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.649
 let's put no more in the middle of the 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.210
 eye already saw rose and eyelashes towards 

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:39.939
 up without going over what we had 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.369
 previously worked like that 

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:44.319
 and of the same color I put exactly the 

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:46.059
 tabs below you already saw how to the 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:48.490
 same height now what we're going to do 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:50.740
 is to take the same brush from the beginning 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.419
 with the same colors and we are going to 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.249
 blur the top part so that it does not 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.080
 it has gone a little blue already 

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:58.629
 to finish pure water we are going to take 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.459
 a color with light with lights and then 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:02.319
 let's apply it just in the 

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:04.360
 lacrimal this cause is as 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:06.309
 tender the look to finish with the 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.099
 eyes I put some eyeliner on the 

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:10.809
 Tabs back and super super little 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:12.759
 nothing else is for you to mark well 

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:14.619
 eye and I put some mask on 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:16.360
 eyelashes this is so that our eye 

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:18.490
 will be bigger in our look this 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.559
 like super margarita and in the end you can 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.930
 put a little bit of god on the road 

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:26.189
 but claritos because the center as 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.189
 the attention is in the eyes 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:35.469
 Well basically, this is what I say 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.479
 it's like more colorful than ever 

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:39.249
 we do but risk suddenly is 

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:41.229
 father, I loved it, that is, I never 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:42.759
 I put colors or anything these things but 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:44.289
 I really liked that it is something 

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:45.999
 what will I do more often and the hairstyle 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:48.980
 it is something that I always do always 

00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:51.560
 so I think it 's nice 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.450
 how everything was for today 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.460
 I hope it serves them well enough 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.990
 apply this hairstyle the same as they are 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.000
 at school they can apply for 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:01.550
 any day you make a two for three 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.680
 we do not need to use so many things 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.660
 they make it super simple pretty to have 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.610
 a makeup I would love to see photos

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:15.170

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.150
