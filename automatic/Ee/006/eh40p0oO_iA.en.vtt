fun playing this game anymore therefore

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.920 
fun playing this game anymore therefore

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
I'm not gonna play it so I thought I

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.200 
I'm not gonna play it so I thought I
would<00:00:19.109> do<00:00:19.320> my<00:00:19.470> final<00:00:19.710> stats<00:00:20.039> video<00:00:20.310> now<00:00:20.520> I'm

would do my final stats video now I'm
it's<00:00:21.869> highly<00:00:22.170> unlikely<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.650> I'll<00:00:22.980> get<00:00:23.220> more

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939

it's highly unlikely that I'll get more
kills<00:00:24.150> than<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.330> have<00:00:24.539> right<00:00:24.720> now<00:00:24.779> maybe<00:00:25.439> you

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
kills than I have right now maybe you

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.509 
kills than I have right now maybe you
could<00:00:25.890> add<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.340> couple<00:00:26.849> hundred<00:00:27.420> kills<00:00:27.869> if<00:00:28.109> I

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
could add a couple hundred kills if I

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.500 
could add a couple hundred kills if I

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
it but you know as you can see the

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.330 
it but you know as you can see the
accuracy<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.470> KD<00:03:15.830> was<00:03:16.010> actually

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
accuracy and the KD was actually

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.370 
accuracy and the KD was actually
relatively<00:03:16.850> high<00:03:17.180> for<00:03:17.959> both<00:03:18.140> of<00:03:18.290> these

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
relatively high for both of these

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.500 
relatively high for both of these
weapons<00:03:18.890> you<00:03:19.070> know<00:03:19.190> the<00:03:19.550> accuracy<00:03:19.910> with<00:03:20.060> DSR<00:03:20.480> I

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
weapons you know the accuracy with DSR I

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.170 
weapons you know the accuracy with DSR I
think<00:03:20.810> I<00:03:20.870> had<00:03:21.020> it<00:03:21.170> under<00:03:21.380> like<00:03:22.370> 45<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.150> I

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
think I had it under like 45 and I

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.699 
think I had it under like 45 and I
brought<00:03:23.390> it<00:03:23.510> all<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:23.630> way<00:03:23.750> up<00:03:23.840> to<00:03:24.050> 52<00:03:24.380> so

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
brought it all the way up to 52 so

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.850 
brought it all the way up to 52 so
that's<00:03:24.860> not<00:03:24.950> that<00:03:25.130> bad<00:03:25.660> xpr<00:03:26.660> I<00:03:26.930> use<00:03:27.470> it<00:03:27.650> quite<00:03:27.740> a

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
that's not that bad xpr I use it quite a

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.400 
that's not that bad xpr I use it quite a
bit<00:03:27.950> but<00:03:28.370> not<00:03:28.520> as<00:03:28.640> much<00:03:28.820> as<00:03:29.030> these<00:03:29.330> two<00:03:29.390> I<00:03:29.990> just

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
bit but not as much as these two I just

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.810 
bit but not as much as these two I just
scrolled<00:03:30.770> through<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.070> rest<00:03:31.640> of<00:03:31.700> these

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
scrolled through the rest of these

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.880 
scrolled through the rest of these
weapons<00:03:32.030> I<00:03:32.420> think<00:03:32.750> I<00:03:32.959> have<00:03:33.110> a<00:03:33.140> kill<00:03:33.410> with<00:03:33.560> every

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
weapons I think I have a kill with every

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.060 
weapons I think I have a kill with every
single<00:03:34.070> weapon<00:03:34.310> to<00:03:34.550> the<00:03:34.640> game<00:03:35.020> even<00:03:36.020> the<00:03:36.380> fhj<00:03:37.040> I

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
single weapon to the game even the fhj I

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.930 
single weapon to the game even the fhj I
have<00:03:37.250> a<00:03:37.280> couple<00:03:37.520> with<00:03:37.850> those<00:03:39.220> yep<00:03:40.220> three<00:03:40.760> kids

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
have a couple with those yep three kids

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.920 
have a couple with those yep three kids
with<00:03:41.030> fhj<00:03:41.770> let's<00:03:42.770> move<00:03:42.980> on<00:03:43.130> to<00:03:43.750> equipment

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
with fhj let's move on to equipment

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.479 
with fhj let's move on to equipment
I<00:03:45.080> pretty<00:03:45.350> much<00:03:45.440> the<00:03:45.620> stack<00:03:45.830> and<00:03:45.980> sir<00:03:46.130> that's

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
I pretty much the stack and sir that's

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.040 
I pretty much the stack and sir that's
all<00:03:46.670> I<00:03:46.700> use<00:03:47.000> I<00:03:47.150> used<00:03:47.330> some<00:03:47.480> text<00:03:47.810> and<00:03:47.930> stuff

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
all I use I used some text and stuff

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.240 
all I use I used some text and stuff
like<00:03:48.200> that<00:03:48.350> at<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.560> beginning<00:03:48.890> of<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.070> game

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
like that at the beginning of the game

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.610 
like that at the beginning of the game
and<00:03:49.489> then<00:03:50.090> that's<00:03:50.330> it<00:03:50.570> EMP<00:03:50.840> grenades<00:03:51.290> is<00:03:51.440> so

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
and then that's it EMP grenades is so

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.190 
and then that's it EMP grenades is so
high<00:03:51.800> because<00:03:51.830> I<00:03:52.160> have<00:03:52.400> it<00:03:52.550> on<00:03:52.610> my<00:03:52.930> my<00:03:53.930> class

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
high because I have it on my my class

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.830 
high because I have it on my my class
where<00:03:54.410> I<00:03:54.470> destroy<00:03:54.970> stuff<00:03:55.970> like<00:03:56.209> sentry<00:03:56.600> guns

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
where I destroy stuff like sentry guns

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.930 
where I destroy stuff like sentry guns
and<00:03:57.170> killstreaks<00:03:57.410> and<00:03:57.739> stuff<00:03:57.860> like<00:03:57.980> that<00:03:58.220> so

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
and killstreaks and stuff like that so

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.270 
and killstreaks and stuff like that so
that's<00:03:59.360> the<00:03:59.810> reason<00:03:59.989> it's<00:04:00.290> so<00:04:00.470> high<00:04:00.680> and<00:04:01.010> I

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
that's the reason it's so high and I

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.949 
that's the reason it's so high and I
have<00:04:01.400> to<00:04:01.610> so<00:04:01.880> why<00:04:02.090> not<00:04:02.270> throw<00:04:02.480> both<00:04:02.660> all<00:04:02.870> the

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
have to so why not throw both all the

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:03.850 
have to so why not throw both all the
time

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
time

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.800 
time

kill shrieks I usually ran with UAV

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.440 
kill shrieks I usually ran with UAV
counter<00:04:06.230> UAV<00:04:06.440> and<00:04:06.830> something<00:04:07.820> like<00:04:07.970> orbital

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.540 
visa which I have like 810 which is
quite<00:04:11.239> a<00:04:11.270> bit<00:04:11.540> but<00:04:12.320> I<00:04:12.680> never<00:04:13.100> seem<00:04:13.280> to<00:04:13.310> get<00:04:13.489> a
