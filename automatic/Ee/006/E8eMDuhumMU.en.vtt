 Hello everyone, today I will show you the next ones 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:17.770
 running lights on viburnum means regular 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.990
 place on the knees are on the bumper such 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:24.900
 here is the cap as it stands here and so 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.900
 there is a cap we get a cap 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:36.489
 cut here such a rhombus 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:38.199
 on the contour put plexiglass trial fen 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.960
 little heated to make it so 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:46.300
 bulging slightly here and pasted 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:49.449
 white-white diode tapes mean 6 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.699
 years old sick got hooked up principle 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.969
 glass can be made frosted to not 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:01:04.299
 you could see all these shoals when it costs 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:10.899
 on the bumper and so can not see anything here 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:13.030
 that plexiglass and exactly the size first 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:15.840
 make a hole such a hole made 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.340
 then they put glass on their hands and 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.820
 compasses spent either needles on 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.549
 scratched square then cut zhor 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.369
 clap such a necessary piece then it 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.399
 we put it on thickness experience on thickness 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:35.859
 better pick the same as the bumper 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:39.280
 here we insert solder then I here still 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:41.820
 my opinion made a rim of such 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.039
 shoulder made and filled with epoxy 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:51.159
 I completely succeeded in cooling 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:54.280
 fastener of the year isolation he is now so everything 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.549
 in a hurry in principle 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.259
 it turned out well yes by the way here I am 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.719
 something overdone slightly 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.189
 the channel of the legs of the grid she did not get up 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:05.020
 a regular place had a little 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.920
 file work 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.470
 as usual with a jigsaw I sawed 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:16.260
 here is this place here a little sawed with 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:23.230
 using scary she gets up very well 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:30.420
 as usual snaps already at home now 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:30.420
 show you how it shines 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.200
 hard to see shines cool on camera 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:52.829
 responds very strongly when you are through 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:52.829
 tint or something like that 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:00.510
 looks like 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.579
 the light is pretty bright there is nothing 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.400
 nobody stops look 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:08.819
 beautiful 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.099
 picked up this time just from turning on 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.049
 Ignition so they shone before 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:17.700
 usually did through re2 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:19.799
 from exciting the generator machine like 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.440
 you don't start retiring yourself 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:27.329
 now show how to do it here 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:32.659
 in size I have three years old too 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:35.430
 on the aluminum plate seen badly 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:39.389
 around the bulb did a plate and and 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:42.170
 Diodik and stuck for a long time 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:45.540
 not done them good cooling 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:48.170
 looks good to yourself like this 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.170
 it looks
