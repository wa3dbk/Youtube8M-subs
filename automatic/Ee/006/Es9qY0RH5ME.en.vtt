really<00:05:20.690> easy<00:05:20.900> for<00:05:21.169> her<00:05:21.289> to<00:05:21.319> stand<00:05:21.740> I<00:05:22.069> can<00:05:22.729> get

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
really easy for her to stand I can get

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.769 
really easy for her to stand I can get
her<00:05:23.090> to<00:05:23.240> stand<00:05:23.650> but<00:05:24.650> your<00:05:25.460> best<00:05:25.819> bet<00:05:26.029> is<00:05:26.509> just

this<00:06:02.539> legendary<00:06:02.990> Rider<00:06:03.319> series<00:06:03.440> I<00:06:03.979> thought

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
this legendary Rider series I thought

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.550 
this legendary Rider series I thought
the<00:06:04.610> concept<00:06:04.849> was<00:06:05.150> so<00:06:05.539> lame<00:06:06.020> at<00:06:06.259> the<00:06:06.349> time

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
the concept was so lame at the time

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.640 
the concept was so lame at the time
because<00:06:06.889> it's<00:06:07.490> like<00:06:07.930> why<00:06:08.930> are<00:06:08.990> you<00:06:09.080> gonna<00:06:09.139> do

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
because it's like why are you gonna do

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.110 
because it's like why are you gonna do
all<00:06:09.770> these<00:06:09.919> build<00:06:10.219> of<00:06:10.310> figures<00:06:10.610> and<00:06:10.819> then<00:06:10.909> take

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
all these build of figures and then take

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.909 
all these build of figures and then take
them<00:06:11.270> away<00:06:11.509> and<00:06:11.690> give<00:06:11.839> us<00:06:11.960> this<00:06:12.139> instead<00:06:12.680> you

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 
them away and give us this instead you

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:15.219 
them away and give us this instead you
know<00:06:13.009> what<00:06:13.099> I<00:06:13.159> mean<00:06:13.339> like<00:06:14.089> I<00:06:14.449> can<00:06:14.810> much<00:06:15.020> rather

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:15.229 
know what I mean like I can much rather

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:17.140 
know what I mean like I can much rather
have<00:06:15.529> like<00:06:15.830> these<00:06:16.069> little<00:06:16.129> writer<00:06:16.669> thing<00:06:17.029> you

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
have like these little writer thing you

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.309 
have like these little writer thing you
said<00:06:17.389> I<00:06:17.419> never<00:06:17.930> use<00:06:18.169> in<00:06:18.289> my<00:06:18.409> setups<00:06:18.889> you<00:06:19.219> know

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319 
said I never use in my setups you know

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:22.450 
said I never use in my setups you know
instead<00:06:21.319> of<00:06:21.379> a<00:06:21.500> build<00:06:21.710> a<00:06:21.800> figure<00:06:21.949> so<00:06:22.279> yeah

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
instead of a build a figure so yeah

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.490 
instead of a build a figure so yeah
that's<00:06:22.669> basically<00:06:22.789> it<00:06:23.060> not<00:06:23.659> much<00:06:23.839> left<00:06:24.229> to<00:06:24.319> say

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.500 
that's basically it not much left to say

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.019 
that's basically it not much left to say
about<00:06:24.680> this<00:06:24.830> figure<00:06:25.190> I<00:06:25.400> mean<00:06:25.729> it's<00:06:25.940> a

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:26.029 
about this figure I mean it's a

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:28.149 
about this figure I mean it's a
must-have<00:06:26.330> if<00:06:26.719> you<00:06:26.839> have<00:06:27.020> if<00:06:27.319> you're<00:06:28.069> all

00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:28.159 
must-have if you have if you're all

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:30.189 
must-have if you have if you're all
about<00:06:28.370> the<00:06:28.520> Avengers<00:06:28.940> and<00:06:29.330> you<00:06:29.539> know<00:06:29.690> or

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
your point of view but it's not really

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.890 
your point of view but it's not really
