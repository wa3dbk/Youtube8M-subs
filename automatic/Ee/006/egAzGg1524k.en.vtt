00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.009
 if not 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.180
 I bring a tutorial to do three soft 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.190
 for starters 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.230
 Well, first here you have my 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.900
 classes of trick shots is worth 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.420
 it's usually to be realistic with 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.190
 laser chargers with a second I have 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.710
 a tactical lightweight car for not 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.500
 fall down and nimble hands to do more 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.080
 fast what to throw shock charges is 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.800
 entity set cetera and change weapon more 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:39.489
 fast and good because these classes are 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.650
 for people who have no idea what to do 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.630
 trick soft that's why 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.540
 then I'll start is a tutorial from 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.310
 zero we go for people who do not know what 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.880
 it's a text that people do not know 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.230
 well a 3-3 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:57.130
 from a high place 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.450
 and take two more turns doing things in 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.420
 the air that 'not a burden of fact that 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.940
 a play most taking it out by slashing 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.550
 things and good so here you have my 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.250
 typical trico classes that you can 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.230
 copy if you like and good 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.200
 well, that 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.360
 and here the game starts the first try 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.280
 shot that can not be called a sad 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.730
 but the first thing you have to do is 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.470
 give at least two laps because there 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.300
 people that do a one- turn trick and 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.810
 it's not a soto trick even if that one hundred 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.220
 a thousand things in the air is not a tris or 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.800
 well here the first tribute that 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.680
 they can be and the first thing has to be 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.320
 to say that enough sensitivity what 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.680
 more important so I recommend you with 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:47.270
 put it on 14 which is the highest 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:50.990
 Well what you have to do to 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.650
 to start is to do a 720 give two 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:58.310
 I advise you to do it with 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.770
 friends here you have the one that the camp is worth 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.110
 it's pretty simple if it does not go to the 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.510
 First you can keep practicing doing it 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.509
 first with friends now they will help us 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.849
 much this is a setup 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.799
 here you see that he had a pulse but good 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:16.700
 as it is a tutorial no then nothing 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:20.000
 well then to see the next wheat that 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.819
 this is a bit more complicated than the 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.450
 another but hey it is very easy 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:30.300
 simply 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:33.569
 a double tap tap is to give twice to the 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.250
 triangle is to say change twice of 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.450
 good soul because here I leave you with the 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.459
 click the truth is pretty good 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.870
 if you combine it with another low plus this 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.870
 simpler than there are of the three shots 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.790
 I still agree with something is very good 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:56.150
 Well, there is the partner who 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.420
 I was helping from the manga I want to leave 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.090
 that with him in the description well then 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:05.090
 this sad is the last and the most 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.750
 difficult of those that I will teach you but 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.930
 it's still a trip they 're pretty easy 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:15.400
 this crucible of what it consists is 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:19.450
 recharge and hit the triangle twice 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.150
 it's a triumph that looks pretty good 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.340
 for those who do not know you can go 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.430
 practicing this double triangle recharge 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.379
 and it is a piece of the truth as you will see 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.540
 an acrylic looks pretty good 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.579
 pretty cool 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.519
 It is not so much as what you will see in face 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.439
 but to learn is enough and 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.840
 as always the two rounds and good 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:45.579
 after this is all give the live 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.579
