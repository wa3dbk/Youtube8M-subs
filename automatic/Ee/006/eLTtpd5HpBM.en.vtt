00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.550 
you something it's never too late today
we<00:01:49.770> we<00:01:50.220> are<00:01:50.939> faced<00:01:51.149> with<00:01:51.329> with<00:01:51.780> with<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.229> couple

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
we we are faced with with with a couple

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.899 
we we are faced with with with a couple
of<00:01:52.619> facts<00:01:52.950> one<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.250> facts<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.880> have

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
of facts one of the facts that you have

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.870 
of facts one of the facts that you have
to<00:01:54.060> take<00:01:54.210> into<00:01:54.360> consideration<00:01:54.740> is<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:56.130> the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
to take into consideration is that the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.230 
to take into consideration is that the
length

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
length

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.610 
length
our<00:01:57.420> life<00:01:57.750> length<00:01:58.140> is

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
our life length is

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.670 
our life length is
increasing<00:01:59.270> life<00:02:00.270> expectancy<00:02:00.320> every<00:02:01.320> year<00:02:01.530> is

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
increasing life expectancy every year is

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.890 
increasing life expectancy every year is
increasing<00:02:02.280> by<00:02:02.400> a<00:02:02.430> number<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.760> years<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.240> when

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
increasing by a number of years so when

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.140 
increasing by a number of years so when
you<00:02:03.990> think<00:02:04.260> that<00:02:04.410> you're<00:02:04.560> 35<00:02:05.160> you<00:02:05.970> are

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
you think that you're 35 you are

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.560 
you think that you're 35 you are
actually<00:02:06.360> really<00:02:06.840> 25<00:02:07.850> if<00:02:08.850> we<00:02:09.060> had<00:02:09.180> to<00:02:09.300> compare

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
actually really 25 if we had to compare

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.840 
actually really 25 if we had to compare
those<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.960> 50<00:02:10.290> years<00:02:10.500> ago<00:02:10.710> so<00:02:11.490> you've<00:02:11.670> got<00:02:11.820> a

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
those to 50 years ago so you've got a

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.850 
those to 50 years ago so you've got a
lot<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.120> time<00:02:12.330> ahead<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.050> as<00:02:13.290> the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
lot of time ahead of you and as the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.380 
lot of time ahead of you and as the
technology<00:02:14.400> progress<00:02:14.670> we've<00:02:15.000> got<00:02:15.150> more<00:02:15.330> and

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
technology progress we've got more and

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.540 
technology progress we've got more and
more<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.690> more<00:02:15.780> done<00:02:16.050> so<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.040> can<00:02:17.340> actually

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
more and more done so you can actually

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.910 
more and more done so you can actually
do<00:02:18.000> many<00:02:18.420> things<00:02:18.750> in<00:02:18.930> one<00:02:18.960> lifetime<00:02:19.320> so<00:02:19.770> if<00:02:19.800> you

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
do many things in one lifetime so if you

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.710 
do many things in one lifetime so if you
want<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.130> look<00:02:20.280> at<00:02:20.400> reading<00:02:20.730> time<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.540> you

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
want to look at reading time and you

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.570 
want to look at reading time and you
will<00:02:21.870> need<00:02:21.960> to<00:02:22.080> put<00:02:22.230> in<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.440> effort<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:23.400> can

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
will need to put in the effort you can

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.720 
will need to put in the effort you can
absolutely<00:02:23.990> reach<00:02:24.990> your<00:02:25.200> goals<00:02:25.410> but<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.490> must

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
absolutely reach your goals but you must

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.260 
absolutely reach your goals but you must
be<00:02:26.880> willing<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:28.160> use<00:02:29.160> applied<00:02:29.610> faith<00:02:29.970> now

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
be willing to use applied faith now

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.020 
be willing to use applied faith now
faith<00:02:30.570> is<00:02:31.010> calling<00:02:32.010> those<00:02:32.220> things<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:32.760> are

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
faith is calling those things that are

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.630 
faith is calling those things that are
not<00:02:33.210> as<00:02:33.420> if<00:02:33.690> they<00:02:33.870> were<00:02:34.110> if<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:34.890> can<00:02:35.040> do<00:02:35.400> those

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
not as if they were if you can do those

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.270 
not as if they were if you can do those
and<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.180> can<00:02:36.390> believe<00:02:36.570> in<00:02:37.110> things<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:38.070> you

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
and you can believe in things and you

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.890 
and you can believe in things and you
can<00:02:38.430> visualize<00:02:38.880> yourself<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.660> believe<00:02:39.870> you

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
can visualize yourself and believe you

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.660 
can visualize yourself and believe you
become<00:02:40.320> that<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.680> speak<00:02:41.190> that<00:02:41.370> you'll<00:02:41.520> become

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
become that and speak that you'll become

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.900 
become that and speak that you'll become
bats<00:02:42.590> then<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:43.740> will<00:02:43.920> eventually<00:02:44.100> get<00:02:44.490> that's

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
bats then you will eventually get that's

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.090 
bats then you will eventually get that's
that's<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.330> mindset<00:02:45.690> but<00:02:46.050> then<00:02:46.770> you've<00:02:46.920> got

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
that's the mindset but then you've got

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.380 
that's the mindset but then you've got
the<00:02:47.220> training<00:02:47.520> you've<00:02:47.790> got<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.060> get<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.270> right

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.020 
the training you've got to get the right
training<00:02:48.840> if<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:49.140> get<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.380> right<00:02:49.560> training

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
training if you get the right training

you then you will develop to the right
level<00:02:58.350> of<00:02:58.500> course<00:02:59.280> make<00:02:59.490> sure<00:02:59.520> you<00:02:59.910> get<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.120> spot

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
level of course make sure you get a spot

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.170 
level of course make sure you get a spot
lots<00:03:00.600> of<00:03:00.720> structure<00:03:00.990> because<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:02.400> level<00:03:03.120> of

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
lots of structure because the level of

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.970 
lots of structure because the level of
instruction<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:04.050> receive<00:03:04.410> will<00:03:04.620> also

instruction that you receive will also

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.350 
instruction that you receive will also
determine<00:03:05.370> how<00:03:05.730> far<00:03:06.209> you<00:03:06.420> can<00:03:06.630> and<00:03:06.900> will<00:03:07.080> go<00:03:08.360> so

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
determine how far you can and will go so

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.880 
determine how far you can and will go so
