00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.309
 I bought three things 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.019

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.349
 only new products I do not like yet 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.179
 I mean and I start 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.630
 First of all, I went for 91 times 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.580

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.140

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.000
 and I've always used that 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.949
 still a driving machine for a 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.449
 Exciting day and I will take you then 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.560
 can get through better that is 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.080
 without playing out and this is now 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.329
 for unruly frizzy hair and me 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.309
 on the one hand, they are always very good 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.390
 and I also spend what you do 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.680
 it can really make hair better 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.110
 durchkämmt therefore finds that one 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.510
 I bought again for 21 years 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.649
 from valea the asylum in the smidt arena 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.180
 taken back 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.860
 I have that right now under the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.110
 air it smells very willing very much 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.989
 sweet and I like it very much I like the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.390
 shower what you deliver because he is very 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.579
 like and dfl their purpose absolutely and 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.870
 also very good and for 65 cents 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.520
 I have a soap again 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.350
 bought from valea we have in the new one 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.180
 Bad stand and that now the direction 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.369
 papaya and buttermilk and I think so 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.560
 smells very good i like being so exotic 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.330
 Smells very much and does not like such a 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.260
 Delicious milkshake or something I like 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.970
 very well 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.380
 this fragrance direction does not fit that right now 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.240
 good my bathroom on the color 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.890
 but no matter 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.180
 yes , you can not say anything about that 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.650
 So I bought more new 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.299
 have not tried to have at 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.860
 I once bought a shampoo from ibm 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.500
 this is the volume care shampoo 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.630
 volume sensation and should the hair 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.970
 Give and pay visible volume 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.159
 smooth and just without 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.840
 silicones for fine hair and hair 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.810
 is yes, I absolutely have it 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.829
 smells very good and I think the nivea 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.600
 shampoos are also extremely wet 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.549
 the smell in the tap forest and I think so 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.930
 beautiful I have never had one 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.250
 unions so that like 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.579
 I only have good ones to try 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.130
 belongs 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.780
 and that cost a 170 and that 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.189
 I'll try where you can 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.990
 I throw myself a bit dead with 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.210
 shampoos i still have quite a few but 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.640
 that's the last one for now 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.790
 I bought so by Garnier 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.200
 fructis the powerful build-up conditioner 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.969
 harm holes played for much the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.090
 have much on a bottle in my opinion 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.260
 and the whole direction is through curiosity 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.420
 and it was kind of lengthy 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.770
 remember and I'm less fueled 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.500
 I am very much looking forward to that 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.780
 Euro monthly and should be next to 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.340
 they also strengthen from inside and outside 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.720
 but to go once I want it once 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.370
 definitely try it and that 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.260
 third product is again a few 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.670
 products ossi that is a brand the 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.900
 i had shampoo before 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.430
 and flushing was not so 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.530
 Satisfied, however , I made the fragrance 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.110
 always very happy and that is here 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.110
 the michel michael fritz treml the 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.330
 Intensive cure and that was just reduced 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.820
 this actually costs 97 now 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.260
 still cost 550 and is still 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.810
 relatively expensive as I think for 200 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.180
 milliliters 250 milliliters but I have 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.090
 currently be very problematic but mine 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.310
 have damaged and therefore thought 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.020
 I can not hurt that and I love 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.150
 as I said the fragrance and show even 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.040
 and tame let's see whether the Sun 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.440
 works for me then i was one 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.480
 a bit commercial victims again 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.920
 I have of gillette venus this 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.959
 bought razor he is in fact straight 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.240
 very much in advertising respectively 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.760
 many blogs also advertise with it or 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.340
 write about it and that's just what 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.770
 this snap razor and it is the same 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.200
 a small mini shaver I think that 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.730
 sector 98 and the only provide a 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.450
 That's why I think so 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.489
 that is very expensive 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.959
 but I think it's very convenient 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.360
 for on the road that has just one more 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.920
 small travel packaging and that's how it looks 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.060
 So little money in laos really 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.380
 sweet and very small 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.530
 how to have also read 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.360
 every head so everybody shave copper - 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.930
 smoke fit so it was very 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.209
 practical and very small now 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.940
 handy and very good for traveling and 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.010
 david morgan at lienz video seht it is 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.019
 So I'll be traveling tomorrow 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.190
 holiday and of course that is the 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.959
 of course, then of course I could 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.519
 do not leave without a game 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.290
 to take with me and unfortunately I had to 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.580
 realize that my palmolive all 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.410
 Favorite games from the assortment 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.790
 has taken the way it looks like me 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.350
 hopefully shocked in this 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.850
 pretty bottle I have often times 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.260
 have shown that are all from the 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.360
 assortment were replaced by 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.420
 These you later are now like this 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.580
 and those are of the so probably the 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.840
 Fragrances are very similar 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.780
 even if I have the same first I have 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.490
 in panic 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.740
 they really smell all completely 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.200
 but they have exchanged for advents 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.820
 only the name is like rad and 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.320
 also see some packing now 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.139
 They look like that and I have those now 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.940
 direction much gremmels taken there 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.620
 should be in it brawn their closeness to the people 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.970
 and dragonfruit and there are three 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.770
 fragrance I like a lot and it 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.520
 you clearly still smell about 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.410
 the causes are those bigger ones 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.790
 chewing gum as I that you play 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.310
 but a bit stronger 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.990
 a bit of a real fruit year 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.550
 I like calling very good and 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.810
 I'll try that out and 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.130
 look if that's as good as that 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.140
 previous from paroli 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.730
 that's before the last month costs and 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.010
 is from chicken now like blueberry 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.740
 memories you play is with a size 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.390
 because the tricks are ok 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.490
 in its very huge packaging and 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.140
 wanted to try the first time 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.630
 bought small and I think you can 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.250
 Not so on all fronts 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.440
 I like it a lot better 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.050
 this is a nice might be relative 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.400
 little and tasty but a bit 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.060
 Christmassy but me sometime 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.669
 Christmas 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.810
 why whatsoever and that's why I am 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.090
 glad that I am sharing in large 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.620
 power off but also this completely in 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.630
 order for me then I have two 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:23.260
 lipstick wants to buy with ease 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.360
 24 295 of the soft news lipstick in the 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.100
 color softic that is a really nice 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.470
 to do for myself and I like those 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.970
 beauty very much and understand 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.950
 taken away and the second is also very 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.600
 similar though a bit and 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.560
 more natural or after about that 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.229
 twice cost 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.800
 namely 6 to 55 and zvs of maybelline 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:44.919
 the cola drama in terrible penselin the 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:48.310
 color 140 minimalist and that's the way it is 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:50.770
 a sound so rather a covered for 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.360
 to say calmly and also very much to the war 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.740
 very nice and I think this foundation 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.510
 very interesting and that's what I wanted him to do 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.610
 like to try and that's all 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.550
 facial products and the first one is 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.830
 from valea the paradise island mask and 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.960
 it's just for every skin type 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.660
 limited and should be next to the very good 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.130
 smell this maskat cost 45 cents and 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.440

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:14.590
 Try and then have the family 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.900
 I just do everything from valea that 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.350
 is sometimes that's what valeo does that 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:22.350
 perfect for a booster they 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:25.350
 why that has cost 395 and is it just 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:27.360
 a serum what the skin with enhancer 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.220
 should be and has such a funny 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.800
 packed as well a very funny 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.540
 Applicator actually with the one then 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.580
 just to wear very precisely 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:38.340
 and if you go in the morning and on the 2nd after the 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.920
 Cleaning and that was also a problem 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:43.110
 minimize and so is very good as well 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.250
 suitable as a make-up base and yes 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.210
 I will definitely do that 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.160
 I'm looking forward to it 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.230
 very limited to that, it also means limited and 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.740

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:54.540

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.700
 people yes looks very different says 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.470
 now just from noon a bear 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.360
 Extract that refine the main picture 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.620
 and I currently have a peeling from 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.430
 I do not want to gamble with that 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.750
 more satisfied 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.520
 and that's why I have it now 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.590
 taken and that's just normal 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.390
 and mixed skin fits so perfectly 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.250
 my skin type and it has only one 

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.180
 That's why I have to pay € 45 euro 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.530
 taken away 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.210
 I'm really looking forward to it 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:17.130
 The next one basically has 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:19.440
 tasted and is also from valea 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.940
 cleaning boat invites I already have that 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.530
 Cleaning needs to be barriered with that 

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.700
 I was very happy and wanted the animal 

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.780
 I also try it myself 

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.450
 Maybe that's not how it is 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.920
 dries out and I clean as well 

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.270
 respectively and facial care 

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.640
 very like to try if I products 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:34.560
 that took us one last one 

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.480
 cleaning product that also before some 

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.520
 Years ago was very much hyped and that 

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.790
 still highly recommended to us by 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.650
 Ballet the soaps free washing lotions 

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:45.360
 for sensitive skin I have now 

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:47.190
 you can not find your skin but that is 

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.290
 just very cheap product costs 85 

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:51.300
 cent for I think yes 300 milliliters 

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.890
 and he also has a practical one 

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.150
 That's why I wanted to score that 

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:56.670
 also like to try 

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:58.290
