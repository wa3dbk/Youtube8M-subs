00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:12.349
 in season 1 of the story of stuff 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.639
 we look at a system that creates too many 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.949
 things and very little of what 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.359
 we really want now we will begin to 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.350
 see the stories behind the story 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.510
 of things 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.160
 in this way we will begin to find 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.110
 ways to turn this situation 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.110
 Welcome to the second season 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.090
 why 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.570
 since I learned where they come from 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.340
 actually our things and how this 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.410
 system is destroying people and the 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.480
 planet I was trying to imagine how 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.820
 we can change what I've read a lot 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.160
 about this 100 ways to save the 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.809
 Planet without leaving your home 50 things 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.790
 simple things you can do to save the 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.949
 land the little green book to do the 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.629
 shopping I thought they could have the 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.550
 answers but all your advice 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.170
 they started by buying better things and 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.659
 they ended up recycling all those things 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.399
 when I had finished with them but 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.320
 when it comes to making a change this 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.670
 tale of hesse green even when what 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.130
 we see everywhere has some 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.899
 serious deficiencies says that if I 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.759
 I come back a smarter buyer and I 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:11.950
 I tell my friends to do the same 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.810
 complied with my part and if I do not buy 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.039
 all these green things then is my 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.880
 He blames the planet is being 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:20.560
 destroyed wait a moment my fault I 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.420
 I did not choose to put toxic products in 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.670
 shelves or allow work is 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.750
 clear factories throughout the world do not 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.280
 I chose to fill the stores with 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.530
 electronic devices that can not be repaired 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.880
 and they must be discarded and a chosen one 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.770
 a world in which some people 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.420
 can face green living by leaving 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.460
 to the rest of us as irresponsible 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.080
 destroyers of the planet clear that 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.880
 when we buy we should 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.650
 choose the least toxic products and more 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.270
 just as we can but here are not the 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.520
 bad buyers the source of the problem 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.800
 it's not the bad policies and the bad 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.390
 business practices and that is why 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.730
 the solutions that we really need 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.110
 they are not for sale in the supermarket 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.820
 if we really want to change the world 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.380
 we can not talk about consumers 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.270
 voting with our dollars 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.950
 the real change happens when the 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.650
 citizens come together to claim 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.230
 rules that work looks important 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.330
 try to live green like Gandhi said if 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.700
 the change live our values â€‹â€‹in 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.860
 small scale shows us and 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.080
 others that we care so 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.330
 they are a very good starting point but it is 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.340
 a very bad place to stop after 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.990
 of all we would know who was gandhi if he 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.520
 he would only have knitted his boots and 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.280
 I would have been sitting waiting 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.390
 the British will leave India 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.060
 then how do we make a big change 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.950
 to answer this question I went towards 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.030
 back and watching the anti movement 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.709
 apartheid in south africa 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.090
 the North American movement for 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.180
 civil rights and triumphs 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.860
 environmental issues here in the 70s not only 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.050
 they insisted people to improve 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.360
 in their daily decisions they 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.920
 they changed the rules of the game it turns out 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.110
 that there are three things that we find 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.459
 people come together and really change the 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.050
 world 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.330
 first they share a great age about 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.560
 how things could be better not only 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.170
 a little better for a few people 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.190
 but much better for everyone and I do not know 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.080
 they are experimenting with 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.239
 superficialities go straight to the heart 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.470
 of the problem even when it means 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.380
 change systems that do not want to be 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.510
 changed and this can give chills to 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.920
 millions of us already share a 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.200
 great insight on how things can 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.060
 be better instead of this economy 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.739
 dinosaur that focuses only on the 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.300
 corporate profits we want a 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.340
 new economy that puts products 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.590
 sure happy people and a healthy planet in 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.770
 first place is no longer for that 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.570
 it should be the economy 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.670
 try to live perfectly 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.600
 ecological in the current system is like 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.700
 try to swim against the current 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.620
 when the current is pushing us to 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.610
 all in the opposite direction but 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.220
 changing what our economy 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.630
 prioritize we can change the current of 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.300
 so that the right thing becomes what 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.680
 easier to make second the millions 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.090
 of ordinary people who did 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.100
 these extraordinary changes do not 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.430
 they tried to do it alone they not only said 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.230
 be more responsible they said let's 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.570
 to work together until the problem 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.940
 is solved today is easier than ever 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.320
 work together you can imagine what 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.650
 difficult to make a message 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.690
 cross india in 1930 now we can 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.790
 do it in less than a second and 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.380
 finally these movements achieved 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.690
 generate the change because they took their great 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.610
 idea and their commitment to act together and 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.050
 then they went into action 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.730
 Did you know that when Martin Luther King 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.560
 junior organized his demonstration in 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.870
 Washington was followed by less than a quarter 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.250
 of the Americans but that's enough 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.200
 to generate change because those 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.560
 followers went into action they did 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.120
 things today 74% of Americans 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.670
 support tougher laws against 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.520
 toxic chemicals 83 percent want 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.199
 clean energy laws 85 percent 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.599
 that corporations should have 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:36.210
 less influence on government we have 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:37.650
 the great idea and the commitment just that 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.259
 we have not yet transformed it into action 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.169
 massive and this is the only thing that we lack 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:44.699
 so let's make it change 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.129
 Real needs all kinds of 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.629
 citizens not only protesters when 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:50.280
 you realize that you are good and that you 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:52.560
 like to fit do not seem so 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.159
 difficult whatever it is that you have to 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.990
 offer a better future you need it 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:59.769
 so ask yourself what kind of agent 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:04.659
 I am change 

00:04:59.769 --> 00:05:06.729
 we need communicating researchers 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:08.900
 builders 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:13.060
 and resistant 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:15.220
 educators and organizers 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.110
 a story faith staff dot org you can 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.419
 explore these types of change agent 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.910
 and find your first or next step 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:24.520
 to take action to be a citizen 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.080
 committed starts by launching that is 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.150
 one of the basic things that everyone 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.250
 must do but it gets much more 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.990
 exciting and funny script when 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.610
 we put our unique skills and 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.969
 interests to work together with thousands of 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.919
 others 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:39.860
 I do not know what to change an economic system 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.569
 whole is a gigantic challenge is not 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.919
 easy to see clearly the way from 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:45.259
 where are we today to where we should 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:47.149
 get there and there are not ten simple things that 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:49.489
 we can do without leaving our sofas 

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:51.829
 but at the beginning the road was not 

00:05:49.489 --> 00:05:53.839
 clear for all these other men the 

00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:55.549
 doctor king said the faith is going up the 

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:57.309
 first step even if you do not see the 

00:05:55.549 --> 00:05:59.929
 whole staircase 

00:05:57.309 --> 00:06:01.939
 so they worked hard to be 

00:05:59.929 --> 00:06:03.769
 organized they performed small acts 

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:05.449
 that formed their citizen muscles and 

00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:07.519
 they stayed focused on their great idea 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:09.829
 when the time was right they were 

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:11.209
 prepared is the time for us 

00:06:09.829 --> 00:06:13.009
 let's also prepare to prepare for 

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:16.659
 make the change and write the next 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:16.659
 chapter in the history of things
