00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.069 
entertained and everything like that I
don't<00:02:05.280> really<00:02:05.640> want<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.060> argue<00:02:06.240> with<00:02:06.630> anybody

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
don't really want to argue with anybody

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.600 
don't really want to argue with anybody
I<00:02:07.200> mean<00:02:07.380> ultimately<00:02:07.590> all<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.160> us<00:02:08.399> will<00:02:08.520> never

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
I mean ultimately all of us will never

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.630 
I mean ultimately all of us will never
be<00:02:08.729> able<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.030> get<00:02:09.119> away<00:02:09.209> from

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
be able to get away from

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.580 
be able to get away from
to<00:02:09.759> be<00:02:09.910> in<00:02:10.030> our<00:02:10.119> lives<00:02:10.360> but<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:10.960> thing<00:02:11.170> is<00:02:11.200> at

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
to be in our lives but the thing is at

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.530 
to be in our lives but the thing is at
least<00:02:11.860> we<00:02:12.010> could<00:02:12.130> try<00:02:12.490> to<00:02:12.550> minimize<00:02:13.180> it<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:13.480> I

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
least we could try to minimize it and I

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.580 
least we could try to minimize it and I
think<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.840> first<00:02:13.990> step<00:02:14.110> of<00:02:14.260> that<00:02:14.380> is<00:02:14.560> just

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
think the first step of that is just

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.740 
think the first step of that is just
building<00:02:15.160> a<00:02:15.280> positive<00:02:15.459> fan<00:02:15.910> base<00:02:16.120> not<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.450> fan

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
building a positive fan base not a fan

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.809 
building a positive fan base not a fan
base<00:02:16.990> that's<00:02:17.290> built<00:02:17.770> around<00:02:17.890> bringing<00:02:18.580> other

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
base that's built around bringing other

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.130 
base that's built around bringing other
people<00:02:19.150> down<00:02:19.330> I'm<00:02:19.600> definitely<00:02:19.900> gonna<00:02:19.959> be

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
people down I'm definitely gonna be

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.630 
people down I'm definitely gonna be
going<00:02:20.350> to<00:02:20.410> MLG<00:02:20.770> events<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.160> stuff<00:02:21.340> like<00:02:21.459> that

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
going to MLG events and stuff like that

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.160 
going to MLG events and stuff like that
when<00:02:21.790> I<00:02:21.819> quit<00:02:22.030> my<00:02:22.120> job<00:02:22.150> it's<00:02:22.720> just<00:02:22.780> I've<00:02:23.140> never

between<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:31.209> that's<00:02:31.450> one<00:02:31.570> of<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.720> reasons<00:02:31.990> I

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
between it that's one of the reasons I

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.449 
between it that's one of the reasons I
really<00:02:32.290> didn't<00:02:32.470> like<00:02:32.590> school<00:02:32.770> either<00:02:33.130> just

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
really didn't like school either just

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.310 
really didn't like school either just
it's<00:02:33.700> just<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:34.150> whole<00:02:34.390> bunch<00:02:34.540> of<00:02:34.690> drama<00:02:34.840> and

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
it's just a whole bunch of drama and

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.710 
it's just a whole bunch of drama and
negativity<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:36.250> just<00:02:36.430> dumb<00:02:36.880> shit<00:02:37.480> I<00:02:37.510> don't

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
negativity and just dumb shit I don't

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.540 
negativity and just dumb shit I don't
want<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:37.959> be<00:02:38.050> any<00:02:38.200> part<00:02:38.470> of<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.620> I<00:02:38.890> really

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
want to be any part of that I really

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.979 
want to be any part of that I really
don't<00:02:39.700> like<00:02:40.000> I<00:02:40.090> said<00:02:40.120> before<00:02:40.390> I<00:02:40.569> think<00:02:40.810> if<00:02:40.870> I

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
don't like I said before I think if I

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.320 
don't like I said before I think if I
just<00:02:41.500> surround<00:02:41.830> myself<00:02:41.980> by<00:02:42.280> positive<00:02:43.090> people

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
just surround myself by positive people

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.610 
just surround myself by positive people
that<00:02:43.450> just<00:02:43.630> aren't<00:02:43.840> dealing<00:02:44.230> with<00:02:44.350> any<00:02:44.500> of

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
that just aren't dealing with any of

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.470 
that just aren't dealing with any of
