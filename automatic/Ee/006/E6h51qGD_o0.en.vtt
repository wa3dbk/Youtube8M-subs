but<00:02:35.030> this<00:02:35.120> is<00:02:35.299> primarily<00:02:35.720> due<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:35.989> the<00:02:36.170> fact

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
but this is primarily due to the fact

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:37.809 
but this is primarily due to the fact
that<00:02:36.500> it's<00:02:36.739> supposed<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:37.129> be<00:02:37.250> incredibly

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
that it's supposed to be incredibly

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
difficult and they don't want people I

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.910 
difficult and they don't want people I
guess<00:02:40.099> dropping<00:02:40.730> out<00:02:40.879> of<00:02:41.090> this<00:02:41.569> raid<00:02:42.110> lock
