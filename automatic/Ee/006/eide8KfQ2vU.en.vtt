than you might think looks like a very
challenging<00:00:05.069> an<00:00:05.430> advanced<00:00:05.819> trick<00:00:06.089> but<00:00:06.750> in

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
challenging an advanced trick but in

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.780 
challenging an advanced trick but in
reality<00:00:07.020> it's<00:00:07.680> just<00:00:07.740> a<00:00:07.919> variation<00:00:08.220> on<00:00:08.490> Mills

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790

mess<00:00:08.970> at<00:00:09.690> this<00:00:09.780> point<00:00:09.990> you<00:00:10.469> must<00:00:10.920> not<00:00:11.190> have

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
mess at this point you must not have

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.150 
mess at this point you must not have
performed<00:00:11.580> Mills<00:00:12.030> mess<00:00:12.240> with<00:00:12.540> ease<00:00:13.160> it

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
performed Mills mess with ease it

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.400 
performed Mills mess with ease it
doesn't<00:00:14.820> have<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:14.969> same<00:00:15.089> flow<00:00:15.660> as<00:00:15.929> Mills<00:00:16.230> mess

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
doesn't have the same flow as Mills mess

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.290 
doesn't have the same flow as Mills mess
because<00:00:17.100> all<00:00:17.430> you're<00:00:17.550> doing<00:00:17.789> is<00:00:17.910> throwing<00:00:18.029> in

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
because all you're doing is throwing in

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.230 
because all you're doing is throwing in
some<00:00:18.539> unnecessary<00:00:18.840> steps<00:00:19.520> it's<00:00:20.520> really<00:00:20.820> not

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
some unnecessary steps it's really not

that<00:00:21.300> great<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.900> trick<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.199> perform<00:00:22.560> I

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
that great of a trick to perform I

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.580 
that great of a trick to perform I
barely<00:00:23.460> ever<00:00:23.609> use<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.300> fact<00:00:24.689> it's<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.320> pretty

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
barely ever use it in fact it's a pretty

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.700 
barely ever use it in fact it's a pretty
useless<00:00:25.859> trick<00:00:27.019> it<00:00:28.019> doesn't<00:00:28.320> have<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.500> nice

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
useless trick it doesn't have a nice

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.370 
useless trick it doesn't have a nice
flow<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.279> looks<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:30.060> little<00:00:30.240> fancy<00:00:30.750> but

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
flow to it looks a little fancy but

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.040 
flow to it looks a little fancy but
other<00:00:31.650> than<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:31.980> it's<00:00:32.309> not<00:00:32.399> really<00:00:32.960> you<00:00:33.960> know

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
other than that it's not really you know

other than that it's not really you know
you're<00:00:34.200> not<00:00:34.320> going<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.530> use<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.680> much

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
you're not going to use that much

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.500 
you're not going to use that much
definitely<00:00:35.579> not<00:00:35.790> one<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.000> my<00:00:36.090> favorites<00:00:36.440> so<00:00:38.510> in

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
just do that in a different order you

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.100 
just do that in a different order you
bring<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:28.950> under<00:01:29.130> then<00:01:29.520> go<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.820> ball<00:01:30.110> so

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
bring it under then go to the ball so

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:42.880 
bring it under then go to the ball so

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
so as you can see looks sort of fast

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.120 
so as you can see looks sort of fast
just<00:01:45.380> because<00:01:45.409> you<00:01:45.650> bring<00:01:45.740> me<00:01:45.860> your<00:01:45.890> hands

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
in those mess this one just has a bit of

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.660 
in those mess this one just has a bit of
hep<00:01:50.270> emphasis<00:01:50.930> on<00:01:51.229> I'm<00:01:52.070> crossing<00:01:52.520> your<00:01:52.640> arms
