me<00:02:43.020> this<00:02:43.170> type<00:02:43.350> of<00:02:43.380> us<00:02:43.560> figure<00:02:43.890> going<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.340> rig

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
me this type of us figure going to rig

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.870 
me this type of us figure going to rig
this<00:02:44.820> piece<00:02:45.090> out<00:02:45.240> like<00:02:46.020> that<00:02:46.430> split<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.459> arms

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
this piece out like that split the arms

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.930 
this piece out like that split the arms
and<00:02:48.150> rotate<00:02:48.690> them<00:02:48.810> forward<00:02:49.370> just<00:02:50.370> like<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:50.700> and

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
and rotate them forward just like so and

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.760 
and rotate them forward just like so and
then<00:02:50.970> we're<00:02:51.780> almost<00:02:51.870> done<00:02:52.140> just<00:02:52.350> need<00:02:52.650> to

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
then we're almost done just need to

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.440 
then we're almost done just need to
rotate<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.340> arms<00:02:53.550> around<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.910> way<00:02:54.239> and

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
rotate the arms around that way and

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.430 
rotate the arms around that way and
rotate<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:56.130> forearm<00:02:56.820> like<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.660> without<00:02:58.170> the

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
rotate the forearm like that without the

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.640 
rotate the forearm like that without the
fist<00:02:58.940> there's<00:02:59.940> one<00:03:00.030> on<00:03:00.350> these<00:03:01.350> going<00:03:01.590> to

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
fist there's one on these going to

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.210 
fist there's one on these going to
decide<00:03:01.920> rotate<00:03:02.640> that<00:03:02.910> around<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:04.680> then<00:03:04.890> it's

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
decide rotate that around and then it's

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.190 
decide rotate that around and then it's
just<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.459> mush<00:03:05.610> rotating<00:03:06.150> rotating<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.020> floor

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
just a mush rotating rotating the floor

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.320 
just a mush rotating rotating the floor
and<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.950> joints<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:08.610> they<00:03:08.700> are<00:03:08.760> really<00:03:09.120> tight

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
and the joints and they are really tight

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.470 
and the joints and they are really tight
so<00:03:10.110> it<00:03:10.470> does<00:03:10.739> take<00:03:10.770> a<00:03:10.950> bit<00:03:11.100> you<00:03:11.700> know<00:03:11.730> movement

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
so it does take a bit you know movement

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.390 
so it does take a bit you know movement
to<00:03:12.570> get<00:03:12.690> it<00:03:12.780> done<00:03:12.900> all<00:03:13.530> right<00:03:13.680> just<00:03:13.890> put<00:03:14.280> the

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.210 
of people have been bashing it but I
really<00:03:30.390> just<00:03:30.570> don't<00:03:30.870> see<00:03:31.200> why<00:03:31.380> I<00:03:31.680> mean<00:03:31.860> it<00:03:32.010> is<00:03:32.190> a

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
really just don't see why I mean it is a

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.009 
really just don't see why I mean it is a
really<00:03:32.459> nice-looking<00:03:32.700> a<00:03:33.120> curable<00:03:33.540> mode<00:03:33.810> I

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
really nice-looking a curable mode I

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.170 
really nice-looking a curable mode I
mean<00:03:34.470> in<00:03:34.680> comparison<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.580> first<00:03:35.820> edition

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
mean in comparison to the first edition

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.320 
mean in comparison to the first edition
yes<00:03:36.570> it's<00:03:36.810> not<00:03:36.959> that<00:03:37.230> accurate<00:03:37.440> but<00:03:38.030> still<00:03:39.030> it

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
yes it's not that accurate but still it

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.120 
yes it's not that accurate but still it
is<00:03:39.450> a<00:03:39.510> fairly<00:03:39.870> decent<00:03:40.040> representation<00:03:41.040> of

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
is a fairly decent representation of

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.759 
is a fairly decent representation of
bulkhead<00:03:41.640> now<00:03:42.239> I<00:03:42.660> think<00:03:43.049> if<00:03:43.260> we<00:03:43.470> didn't

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
bulkhead now I think if we didn't

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.410 
bulkhead now I think if we didn't
actually<00:03:43.890> have<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.489> first<00:03:44.640> edition<00:03:45.120> this

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
actually have the first edition this

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.000 
actually have the first edition this
would<00:03:45.570> have<00:03:45.660> been<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:46.049> really<00:03:46.290> nice<00:03:46.500> figure<00:03:46.860> and

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
would have been a really nice figure and

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.229 
would have been a really nice figure and
everyone<00:03:47.280> would<00:03:47.400> have<00:03:47.519> liked<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.820> lot<00:03:48.060> more

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
everyone would have liked a lot more

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.060 
everyone would have liked a lot more
it's<00:03:48.930> because<00:03:49.110> we<00:03:49.350> have<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.530> first<00:03:49.680> edition

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
it's because we have the first edition

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.250 
it's because we have the first edition
to<00:03:50.190> actually<00:03:50.459> compare<00:03:50.820> this<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.299> that<00:03:51.870> people

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
to actually compare this to that people

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.380 
to actually compare this to that people
are<00:03:52.350> bashing<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:52.950> anyway<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:54.000> was<00:03:54.150> come<00:03:54.269> with

mechtech<00:04:35.400> weapons<00:04:35.820> that<00:04:35.970> they<00:04:36.120> make<00:04:36.300> the

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
mechtech weapons that they make the

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.570 
mechtech weapons that they make the
actual<00:04:36.510> toy<00:04:36.900> smaller<00:04:37.380> and<00:04:37.650> give<00:04:38.160> us<00:04:38.280> a

articulation<00:04:41.190> his<00:04:41.520> head<00:04:41.580> is<00:04:41.940> on<00:04:42.060> a<00:04:42.090> ball<00:04:42.150> joint

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
articulation his head is on a ball joint

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.730 
articulation his head is on a ball joint
so<00:04:42.660> it<00:04:42.750> can<00:04:42.870> rotate<00:04:42.960> any<00:04:43.320> which<00:04:43.470> way<00:04:43.500> you<00:04:43.620> want

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
so it can rotate any which way you want

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.970 
so it can rotate any which way you want
it's<00:04:44.280> got<00:04:44.520> a<00:04:44.810> joint<00:04:45.810> up<00:04:45.990> here<00:04:46.260> now<00:04:46.560> these

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
it's got a joint up here now these

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.350 
it's got a joint up here now these
aren't<00:04:47.220> actually<00:04:47.520> ball<00:04:47.730> joints<00:04:48.180> on<00:04:48.330> his

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
aren't actually ball joints on his

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.600 
aren't actually ball joints on his
shoulders<00:04:48.870> and<00:04:49.050> there<00:04:49.590> is<00:04:49.770> like<00:04:50.040> it's<00:04:50.490> a

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
shoulders and there is like it's a

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.730 
shoulders and there is like it's a
little<00:04:50.730> swivel<00:04:51.060> joint<00:04:51.420> in<00:04:51.540> there<00:04:51.750> it's<00:04:52.470> also<00:04:52.620> a

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
little swivel joint in there it's also a

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.110 
little swivel joint in there it's also a
little<00:04:52.950> joined<00:04:53.160> a<00:04:53.250> lot<00:04:53.430> you<00:04:53.580> bending<00:04:53.880> it<00:04:54.000> out

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
little joined a lot you bending it out

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.090 
little joined a lot you bending it out
it's<00:04:54.330> not<00:04:54.510> a<00:04:54.540> ball<00:04:54.780> joint<00:04:54.990> it<00:04:55.650> does<00:04:55.860> swivel

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
it's not a ball joint it does swivel

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.510 
it's not a ball joint it does swivel
here<00:04:56.700> he<00:04:57.390> can<00:04:57.690> bend<00:04:57.870> in<00:04:58.020> two<00:04:58.140> places<00:04:58.380> at<00:04:58.800> the

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
kind of sucks no waste articulation is

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.000 
kind of sucks no waste articulation is
our<00:05:06.150> board<00:05:06.450> right<00:05:06.630> here<00:05:06.660> bend<00:05:07.530> the<00:05:07.710> knee<00:05:07.830> and

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
our board right here bend the knee and

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.150 
our board right here bend the knee and
they<00:05:08.100> feed<00:05:08.340> do<00:05:08.550> not<00:05:08.850> pivot<00:05:09.800> here<00:05:10.800> is<00:05:11.010> just

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
they feed do not pivot here is just

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.950 
they feed do not pivot here is just
compared<00:05:11.550> to<00:05:11.700> Wheeljack<00:05:12.300> now<00:05:12.480> you<00:05:12.540> can<00:05:12.750> see

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
compared to Wheeljack now you can see

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.560 
compared to Wheeljack now you can see
that<00:05:12.990> because<00:05:13.350> this<00:05:13.800> figure<00:05:14.160> is<00:05:14.340> smaller<00:05:14.820> it

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
that because this figure is smaller it

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.510 
that because this figure is smaller it
does<00:05:15.810> actually<00:05:15.930> compare<00:05:16.500> well<00:05:16.770> to<00:05:17.040> Wheeljack

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
does actually compare well to Wheeljack

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.610 
does actually compare well to Wheeljack
in<00:05:17.670> it<00:05:17.760> it's<00:05:17.850> a<00:05:17.910> lot<00:05:18.060> more<00:05:18.090> size<00:05:18.480> accurate<00:05:19.050> so<00:05:19.590> I

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
in it it's a lot more size accurate so I

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.200 
in it it's a lot more size accurate so I
do<00:05:19.770> like<00:05:20.100> that<00:05:20.310> that's<00:05:20.580> one<00:05:20.790> thing<00:05:20.940> I<00:05:21.030> do<00:05:21.090> like

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
do like that that's one thing I do like

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.690 
do like that that's one thing I do like
about<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:21.630> figure<00:05:22.340> they<00:05:23.340> do<00:05:23.400> look<00:05:23.580> really

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
about the figure they do look really

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.300 
about the figure they do look really
cool<00:05:23.910> together<00:05:24.560> now<00:05:25.560> I'm<00:05:25.650> not<00:05:25.800> too<00:05:26.010> sure<00:05:26.190> our

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
cool together now I'm not too sure our

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.160 
cool together now I'm not too sure our
way<00:05:26.460> consider<00:05:26.970> but<00:05:27.180> he<00:05:27.270> does<00:05:27.450> have<00:05:27.720> like<00:05:28.140> a

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
way consider but he does have like a

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.680 
way consider but he does have like a
little<00:05:28.410> like<00:05:29.100> translucent<00:05:29.850> ridges<00:05:30.360> in<00:05:30.480> there

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
little like translucent ridges in there

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.720 
little like translucent ridges in there
that<00:05:31.650> looks<00:05:31.800> pretty<00:05:31.980> cool<00:05:32.190> i<00:05:32.250> really<00:05:32.370> like

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
that looks pretty cool i really like

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.180 
that looks pretty cool i really like
that<00:05:32.760> effect<00:05:33.560> now<00:05:34.560> here<00:05:34.740> is<00:05:34.830> just<00:05:34.980> a<00:05:35.100> really

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
that effect now here is just a really

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.710 
that effect now here is just a really
quick<00:05:35.400> close<00:05:35.670> with<00:05:35.850> the<00:05:35.940> head<00:05:36.060> sculpt<00:05:36.360> she<00:05:36.600> can

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
quick close with the head sculpt she can

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.600 
quick close with the head sculpt she can
see<00:05:36.960> it<00:05:37.020> and<00:05:37.290> the<00:05:37.710> mouth<00:05:37.950> plate<00:05:38.220> does<00:05:38.460> actually

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
see it and the mouth plate does actually

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.780 
see it and the mouth plate does actually
move<00:05:39.500> so<00:05:40.500> you<00:05:40.560> can<00:05:40.860> position<00:05:41.220> error<00:05:41.550> if<00:05:41.700> you

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
move so you can position error if you

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.040 
move so you can position error if you
want<00:05:41.940> you<00:05:42.060> can<00:05:42.120> actually<00:05:42.270> put<00:05:42.570> it<00:05:42.660> over<00:05:42.810> its

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
want you can actually put it over its

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.870 
want you can actually put it over its
eyes<00:05:43.910> so<00:05:44.910> face<00:05:45.390> mask<00:05:45.630> I<00:05:45.900> don't<00:05:46.110> know<00:05:46.880> but

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
eyes so face mask I don't know but

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.600 
eyes so face mask I don't know but
that's<00:05:48.060> about<00:05:48.270> it<00:05:48.330> for<00:05:48.480> bulkhead<00:05:49.320> row

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
that's about it for bulkhead row

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
that's about it for bulkhead row

the<00:06:02.550> arms<00:06:02.730> first<00:06:02.970> anyway<00:06:03.930> I'm<00:06:03.990> going<00:06:04.200> to<00:06:04.320> do

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.410 
the arms first anyway I'm going to do

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.090 
the arms first anyway I'm going to do
rotate<00:06:05.160> these<00:06:05.340> arms<00:06:06.410> back<00:06:07.410> like<00:06:07.650> that<00:06:07.800> and

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
rotate these arms back like that and

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.880 
rotate these arms back like that and
back<00:06:09.030> in<00:06:09.210> would<00:06:09.330> like<00:06:09.840> so<00:06:10.080> and<00:06:10.440> we<00:06:10.530> can<00:06:10.680> fold

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:10.890 
back in would like so and we can fold

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.430 
back in would like so and we can fold
that<00:06:10.980> back<00:06:11.040> just<00:06:11.820> like<00:06:11.940> that<00:06:12.200> rotate<00:06:13.200> this

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
that back just like that rotate this

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.780 
that back just like that rotate this
back<00:06:14.010> then<00:06:14.690> rotate<00:06:15.690> that<00:06:15.780> in<00:06:15.990> and<00:06:16.500> we<00:06:17.370> can<00:06:17.400> fold

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:17.790 
back then rotate that in and we can fold

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.900 
back then rotate that in and we can fold
them<00:06:17.910> back<00:06:18.090> and<00:06:19.310> head<00:06:20.310> get<00:06:20.490> them<00:06:20.640> together

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 
them back and head get them together

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.240 
them back and head get them together
just<00:06:21.570> like<00:06:21.750> so<00:06:21.960> then<00:06:22.620> we<00:06:22.740> can<00:06:22.860> actually<00:06:22.950> flip

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
just like so then we can actually flip

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.210 
just like so then we can actually flip
up<00:06:23.370> the<00:06:23.400> fists<00:06:24.320> and<00:06:25.320> there<00:06:25.470> are<00:06:25.680> the<00:06:25.890> arms

basically we're just going to shove them

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.680 
basically we're just going to shove them
up<00:06:28.530> in<00:06:28.680> there<00:06:28.860> and<00:06:29.160> that's<00:06:30.030> where<00:06:30.120> they<00:06:30.540> are

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
up in there and that's where they are

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.780 
up in there and that's where they are
and<00:06:30.960> just<00:06:31.020> leave<00:06:31.260> that<00:06:31.440> then<00:06:32.070> take<00:06:32.700> this

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:32.790 
and just leave that then take this

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.740 
and just leave that then take this
please<00:06:33.200> rotate<00:06:34.200> it<00:06:34.560> around<00:06:35.180> and<00:06:36.180> sort<00:06:36.630> of

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
please rotate it around and sort of

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.010 
please rotate it around and sort of
angle<00:06:36.990> it<00:06:37.260> in<00:06:37.470> there

angle it in there
like<00:06:38.740> that<00:06:39.060> similar<00:06:40.060> side<00:06:40.270> rotate<00:06:40.930> us<00:06:41.169> around

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 
like that similar side rotate us around

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:45.350 
like that similar side rotate us around
peg<00:06:42.639> that<00:06:42.789> in<00:06:42.940> just<00:06:43.360> like<00:06:43.539> so<00:06:43.750> and<00:06:44.530> rotate<00:06:45.039> out

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 
peg that in just like so and rotate out

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.439 
peg that in just like so and rotate out
these<00:06:46.360> pieces<00:06:46.889> lift<00:06:47.889> that<00:06:48.009> up<00:06:48.210> rotate<00:06:49.210> the<00:06:49.240> leg

these pieces lift that up rotate the leg

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:52.200 
these pieces lift that up rotate the leg
around<00:06:50.129> just<00:06:51.129> like<00:06:51.250> that<00:06:51.430> now<00:06:51.639> I<00:06:51.669> always<00:06:51.970> end

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.210 
around just like that now I always end

up getting this wrong and I'm an idiot
think<00:06:56.229> it's<00:06:56.379> supposed<00:06:56.470> to<00:06:56.590> go<00:06:56.710> back<00:06:56.949> this<00:06:57.220> way

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650 
think it's supposed to go back this way

don't worry about that anyway row two
that<00:07:13.930> bound<00:07:14.139> take<00:07:14.979> this<00:07:15.210> call<00:07:16.229> these<00:07:17.229> pieces

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:17.470 
that bound take this call these pieces

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:21.110 
that bound take this call these pieces
in<00:07:18.000> like<00:07:19.000> so<00:07:19.240> then<00:07:19.990> we<00:07:20.110> can<00:07:20.229> take<00:07:20.380> this<00:07:20.470> piece

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 
in like so then we can take this piece

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.200 
in like so then we can take this piece
fold<00:07:22.120> it<00:07:22.240> up<00:07:22.360> and<00:07:22.889> leave<00:07:23.889> p<00:07:24.069> sort<00:07:24.280> of<00:07:24.340> pain<00:07:25.030> to
