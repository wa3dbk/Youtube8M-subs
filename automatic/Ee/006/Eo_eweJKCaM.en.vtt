00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.850
 so here we are before the 12th main role to talk to you this time 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.780
 of dragon ball z raging blast 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.740
 yet yes so that the engine said blue blues two forgiveness his style 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.200
 a lot compared to the previous tier l agent tell him how one 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.359
 could be expected 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:18.669
 practically not 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:23.159
 already on the one hand in terms of gameplay we must know that we have no return 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:27.249
 of transformation fighting if there is too much to choose from transformation six people 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:29.269
 gathered before selecting it 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.899
 to the approach of so much in terms of pure gameplay 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:36.820
 no change no smell around some things when we regretted 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.050
 already disappearance a few years ago of this particular she does it 

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:44.519
 to be able to remove it or block the opponent we wanted there we are 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:49.670
 under contract to stay on the go with the random camera movements that 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.960
 this naturally results in so we did not notice any change really 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.519
 price-wise, even the return of 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.780
 things you regret adventure disappear before so that's 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.820
 really very bad anyway for now good here it is with these words 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.060
 partial impression we hope olfeo generator thereafter 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.270
 learn what he was happy with the realization of together we started 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.680
 by the sets and bodies 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.880
 to many more elements of more destructible elements than before 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.390
 no more gold note anyway for a small rise of finishing rome on 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.400
 only this is so good yeah that a little bit more mouth 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.750
 but it's not that either in its early days the cases compared to what we 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.070
 knew in the series 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.079
 and then for the benefit of the characters 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.470
 so we find 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.700
 the sp2 distort the Kenyan shilling one tries to give a side of the years 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.830
 without resorting to the time of reading cg 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.830
 holder activity by activity the sahara is pretty like maria riesch child one is 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.830
 still very very very very very far we have quality and 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.020
 of order in all the tibet that killed you storme of 3 for example those who him in 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.480
 return the sauce at this level so it can be as vaultier the man 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.480
 how the ol does something from a technical point of view 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.460
 % 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.890
 little his quick thesis so on what we saw 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.290
 that fans are waiting 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.330
 reassure themselves namco bandaÃ¯ still has not decided to move to change 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.379
 things then we go where 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:16.199
 this is exactly the same theme full evaluation the very same 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:18.239
 approaching trait 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.200
 there is not much that makes me want to know anyway for little 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.299
 much more on this rating place for the moment
