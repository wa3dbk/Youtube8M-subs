00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.490
 hello everyone I hope you go 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.099
 alright so today I'm going to you 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.290
 show what I do the night before 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.389
 to go to bed and the morning before 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.779
 to go to work 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.100
 so I'm a real idler 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.990
 I do not like spending too much time on my 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.570
 hair and then on top of that I bump 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.550
 not bad I go to the gym after work 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.560
 so when I come home at night I do not have 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.099
 want to spend time doing 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.230
 devani twists or whatever so my routine 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.879
 in the evening it is quite simple 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.250
 I tie my hair with a champion a 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.290
 been a little enlarged and so I'm doing a 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.989
 bun or height so that to allow 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.710
 my hair good stretch for 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.829
 next morning 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.899
 and as I do not like to sleep 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.420
 directly on my pillow 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:57.840
 I tie my hair with a scarf and 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.910
 I work it tight enough to prevent 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.660
 the next morning I wake up and the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:07.159
 scarf the parterres qualcomm of which 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.159
 I tie the scarf correctly 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.580
 and so the next morning same thing 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.160
 pretty simple I will remove my scarf 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.560
 i'm retiring elena sic too and i'm going 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.820
 start by shaking well my info for 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.820
 start to get in shape 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.610
 and then I'll go little by little 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.100
 one section per section 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:49.810
 I will start by separating but 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:51.850
 curls and then we put a little child 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.910
 which we use in mountain info at the 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.770
 root 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:00.250
 so I continue little by little so I 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.880
 do not shake a little I know by the 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:07.690
 loops and then after which I'm going 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.630
 to pass my loincloth arrco to the root so 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.320
 in the morning it takes me about ten 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.040
 minutes 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.240
 and if in the middle of the week or at the end of 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.800
 week I feel that my hair 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.470
 start to be a little dry 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.040
 I do not have to spray a little water on 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.350
 my hair 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:31.090
 and then I add a little oil to the 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:33.210
 end I do not paint either my 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.130
 hair during the week because 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.920
 I already like having an acid 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.840
 afro and then I noticed that combed 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.170
 my dirty hair and kas russian other than 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.110
 thing 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:48.780
 so I pay my hair only when 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:52.390
 I make my shampoo and dirty and suffer 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.970
 if in the day it rained where he did 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.940
 very wet take place attached to my 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.650
 hair in a bun it to pull injured 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.020
 but not enough 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.970
 I will rather attach them in case of 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.580
 China hu and just squeeze and the 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.709
 next morning I'm going to find my 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.709
 length and want it that I like 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.470
 so now that I have almost finished 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.900
 to put my hair again I'm going 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.650
 finish by spraying a little xingshan 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.210
 from kevin marty i love this product because 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.390
 that it is full of vitamins from 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.640
 the essentials and vegetable oils and 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.620
 also small brilliants so in 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.630
 I apply happens on my hair 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.730
 so not only would he not go but 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.670
 it makes my hair super bright and 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.070
 I love the smell league in general I 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.860
 sprays it in the morning and it also serves me 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:49.510
 perfect so here is the result 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:52.120
 even having last on my hair I 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.350
 find me the next day with a lot of 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.200
 volume I still have my little ones 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:59.940
 curls and then the chinese china the 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.620
 end it gives me a lot of shine 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.400

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.940
