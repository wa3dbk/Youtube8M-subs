going<00:00:58.770> until<00:00:58.949> I'd<00:00:59.160> actually<00:00:59.340> traveled<00:00:59.789> about

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
going until I'd actually traveled about

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.760 
going until I'd actually traveled about
nine<00:01:00.120> miles<00:01:00.420> by<00:01:00.719> max<00:01:01.020> speed<00:01:01.320> was<00:01:01.500> just<00:01:01.680> about

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
nine miles by max speed was just about

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.789 
nine miles by max speed was just about
620<00:01:02.129> miles<00:01:02.399> per<00:01:02.640> hour<00:01:02.809> overall<00:01:03.809> since<00:01:04.619> it

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
620 miles per hour overall since it

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.940 
620 miles per hour overall since it

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
started going by moving averages 33

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.359 
started going by moving averages 33
traffic<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.010> was<00:01:08.130> kind<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.930> pulsing<00:01:09.930> up<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.830> 55

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
traffic it was kind of pulsing up to 55

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.160 
traffic it was kind of pulsing up to 55
60<00:01:11.670> miles<00:01:11.820> per<00:01:12.000> hour<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.390> then<00:01:12.510> slowing<00:01:12.869> two

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
60 miles per hour and then slowing two

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.109 
60 miles per hour and then slowing two
sections<00:01:13.710> there<00:01:13.860> were<00:01:13.979> five<00:01:14.430> ten<00:01:14.670> miles<00:01:14.909> per

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
sections there were five ten miles per

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.480 
sections there were five ten miles per
hour<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:16.229> also<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.680> can<00:01:16.799> see<00:01:16.920> what's<00:01:17.070> raining

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
hour so also you can see what's raining

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.730 
hour so also you can see what's raining
here<00:01:17.970> ahead<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.659> lights<00:01:18.930> on<00:01:19.170> during<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
here ahead of lights on during the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.660 
here ahead of lights on during the
lights<00:01:20.869> energy<00:01:21.869> management<00:01:22.369> got<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.400> pretty<00:01:23.610> a

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
lights energy management got a pretty a

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.590 
lights energy management got a pretty a
charge<00:01:23.909> at<00:01:24.090> work<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.720> down<00:01:25.229> forty<00:01:25.590> percent<00:01:25.950> on

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
charge at work so down forty percent on

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.789 
charge at work so down forty percent on
this<00:01:27.600> particular<00:01:27.840> drive<00:01:28.259> which<00:01:28.619> was

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
this particular drive which was

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.280 
this particular drive which was
traveling<00:01:29.549> about<00:01:29.700> 30<00:01:30.030> miles<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.780> mixed<00:01:31.049> mode

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
traveling about 30 miles in mixed mode

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.530 
traveling about 30 miles in mixed mode
so<00:01:32.070> used<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.520> forty<00:01:33.000> percent<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.390> big

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
so used a forty percent of the big

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.230 
so used a forty percent of the big
battery<00:01:33.960> traveling<00:01:34.409> over<00:01:34.560> about<00:01:34.650> 30<00:01:34.829> miles

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
battery traveling over about 30 miles

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.120 
battery traveling over about 30 miles
speeds<00:01:36.240> up<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.450> 60<00:01:36.780> miles<00:01:36.930> per<00:01:37.049> hour<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.680> as<00:01:37.890> we

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
speeds up to 60 miles per hour and as we

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.460 
speeds up to 60 miles per hour and as we
show<00:01:38.310> them<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.520> energy<00:01:38.759> bars<00:01:38.970> they're<00:01:39.470> quite

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
show them the energy bars they're quite

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.630 
show them the energy bars they're quite
a<00:01:40.530> bit<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.770> last<00:01:40.979> bit<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.159> an<00:01:41.280> electric

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
a bit of the last bit of an electric

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.600 
a bit of the last bit of an electric
mode<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.600> once<00:01:43.170> again<00:01:43.320> over<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.159> thousand

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
mode and once again over a thousand

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.789 
mode and once again over a thousand
miles<00:01:44.729> does<00:01:45.030> take<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.210> gas<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.899> twenty<00:01:46.380> percent

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
miles does take a gas and twenty percent

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.359 
miles does take a gas and twenty percent
left<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.610> go<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:48.810> estimating<00:01:49.350> roughly<00:01:50.189> and

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
left to go just estimating roughly and

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.749 
left to go just estimating roughly and
probably<00:01:50.579> getting<00:01:51.049> 125<00:01:52.049> miles<00:01:52.439> per<00:01:52.560> gallon<00:01:52.860> so

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
probably getting 125 miles per gallon so

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.179 
probably getting 125 miles per gallon so
in<00:01:54.000> about<00:01:54.090> ten<00:01:54.990> days<00:01:55.020> when<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.740> have<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.950> fill<00:01:56.159> up

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
in about ten days when I have to fill up

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.190 
in about ten days when I have to fill up
I'll<00:01:56.640> do<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.909> calculation<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.869> put<00:01:58.079> on

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
I'll do the calculation and put on

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.219 
I'll do the calculation and put on
report<00:01:58.350> with<00:01:58.969> my<00:01:59.969> ending<00:02:00.450> miles<00:02:00.659> wasn't<00:02:01.170> this

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
report with my ending miles wasn't this
