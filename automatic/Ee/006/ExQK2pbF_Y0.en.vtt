00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.309
 Hello friends with you vulture and this 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.260
 another 16 5 podcast means and 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.380
 tell about the news about what 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.750
 it happened as for the montages 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.180
 in the fact that lately too 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.189
 quite rare and last went more 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.250
 two weeks ago and I honestly don't even 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.840
 was taken for the next is not something that is not 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.210
 mount games of the series did not watch 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.090
 these did not shake therefore give comers 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.430
 time is not worth it but still say the actor 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.950
 why so rarely care installations and what 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.240
 will be on the channel and about yet 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.930
 some news 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.430
 The fact that this was not just a horrible 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.520
 the important thing is that I do 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.620
 montage for over a year and really 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.340
 do the same thing 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.500
 bored but bored i'm not talking about 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.780
 that there will be no more montages on the channel 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.270
 write off the channel and without any garbage 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.540
 I just decided to do something else 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.850
 for the channel I had 2 things to do 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.030
 on the channel and one by one I worked more 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.860
 two months he made half of that 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.750
 I wanted and understood that no one would 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.000
 wait so long when not to spend it 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.430
 the strength of this is not very much and hunting therefore 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.549
 I have come up with this supernova 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.710
 but rather interesting for me I do not know 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.479
 how do you perceive this video 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.400
 will go for about two or three minutes 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.320
 pretty interesting once a week 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.460
 themes which 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.159
 probably until the end of it until the end of it 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.310
 week i master words 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:39.090
 but in general it is probably in the 20,000 spectators at 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.070
 I am pleased to gather at this rate 20,000 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.220
 Need to see in general until say no 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.140
 I'll be talking about this video and blah blah blah kill 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.690
 It will be interesting to look but rather 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.910
 of all, she is unlikely to be as 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.960
 popular as mounting and watching it 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.880
 there will be maxi i don't know you 4 people this 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.110
 thousand accounts will be mine here I did 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.119
 because I like it I want 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.399
 do something else to do your own 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.110
 with my own knives I could of course but 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.180
 the computer does not allow and why 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.560
 move from someone else's montage to your thoughts 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.390
 I'm already tired of strangers 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.820
 well, not exactly tired of what is said 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.610
 then i'm tired and study a little more 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.190
 their are pretty stupid, I mean 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.650
 to myself naturally also 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.420
 i'm not doing anytime soon 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.760
 under do something else why 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.010
 of course I won't tell you too many 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.170
 probably already seen i wandered lx 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.900
 left in the VKontakte group a link to 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.739
 The video in which I took from on 3 parts 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.970
 and created 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:38.519
 the video series there was generally top 3 and by march 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.850
 for channel ard radio now i will 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.920
 do and by trace 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.670
 shared with other channels and gaming 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.860
 news 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.960
 And the history of the gaming industry will get 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.340
 it's just for now I'm bored 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.490
 do the same 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.890
 and I decided to do something new because 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.410
 that when I was involved in video porting at 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.080
 the three best games of march i did today 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.020
 I sat down because I delivered it wildly 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.810
 don't do the same editing me 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.880
 blah blah blah about something new so i don't 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.340
 I know when you podcast most likely 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.560
 new video came out 1 and all links in 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.690
 Iâ€™m starting a video description who can 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.150
 interesting in general, such montages 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.550
 will i just put them on then when 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.870
 I have a desire to do, I do not want 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.270
 do and in through power because not 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.410
 get your danish so last 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.080
 part of the fallout 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.050
 the beginning was good and the middle went the same 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.510
 so on the main thing that came out on and in general 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:37.020
 shorter than I wanted to say all this 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:40.170
 the podcast as a result of the video will go out 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.390
 more but there will be no more through people on 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.370
 my channel on the other guys channel for 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.890
 those who are now wondering at 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.300
 the hell I need something if the video goes 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.220
 on my channel with me even 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.020
 for it pays nothing i do it 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.450
 just because i like it like that 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.020
 things well, and it was all my Grisha 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.020
 remember 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.060
 this
