00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.930
 and the challenge I show today how 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.629
 make this make up so if that makes you 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.459
 I leave you with the rest 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.770
 so I start with the rms lighthouse 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:20.010
 beauty with the solar tint that I'm going 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.000
 apply directly to the fingers at 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.000
 center of my eyelid 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.120
 then I take the planet 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.520
 a nice knight and I'm going to use 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.379
 their blush cream which is this one that is 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.810
 pretty awesome and I take a brush 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:44.480
 group to take the material I 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.480
 worked at the outer and inner corner 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.790
 so the cream parks that serve me as a base 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:10.780
 for makeup be really very 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:12.960
 very intense a master already below 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.960
 mourning 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.990
 Then I'll take it the lighthouse 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.970
 it is a lighthouse mac goodwin cap d'agde 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:37.540
 who's called is a little bit too 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.720
 just in the middle term and I'm going to take 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.930
 me the black makeup of laval is a 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:49.320
 battle so if I start tapping 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.320
 to fix well with the cream 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.229
 then put the lighthouse 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.060
 mourning powder 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.950
 I'm going to take a clean brush 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.770
 so always months to pure lima that 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.409
 I really use to fade 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.289
 all together I take 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:11.280
 golden glitter 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:16.290
 he has these are the glitter black up 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.290
 comes to pose on the lighthouse 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.800
 I 'm just a beautiful lighthouse 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.410
 so on the arcade rotten the look 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:40.959
 but also to finish degrading 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:46.120
 memory a black kohl pencil you in the 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:52.690
 mucosa and also in the mucosa 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:54.370
 higher then I'm not going to put any 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.750
 liner since I want it to be 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.120
 still something a little bit 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:03.280
 smoked so I'm just going to put a little 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:06.660
 little gold pencil anyway 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.660
 redefine a little bit the look 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.720
 so I had the first one 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:21.970
 greenpride mascara one of the tools but 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:24.310
 so there civil just even worse so 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:29.140
 that's it for the eyes I'm going to put so 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.269
 a small fringe of fossils well so 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.400
 there I preferred to take a half 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.709
 cross m view on the outer corner 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.420
 in fact everything to tell you 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.170
 full fringes in general I the 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.930
 not support all the evening that annoys me 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:48.190
 so after putting some glue I pose 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.780
 false eyelashes to the lash so 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.970
 as close as possible for it to be 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:58.379
 the most natural in fact and I'm finishing 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.379
 just with a tip of gloss 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.310
 it's a gloss in the towers must 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:05.109
 nothing with the make up 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.629
 here is the look is over so not so 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.889
 complicated finally pretty easy and 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.840
 quite fast to achieve 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:12.459
 in any case I hope he will you 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.980
 inspire for your end makeup 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.389
 of year if you ever realize this look 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.150

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.260

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.010
