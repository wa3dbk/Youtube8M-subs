00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:22.669 
juice fast at this point I'm feeling

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:27.040 
juice fast at this point I'm feeling
pretty<00:00:22.880> hungry<00:00:23.710> but<00:00:24.710> it's<00:00:25.070> okay<00:00:25.460> I<00:00:25.820> knew<00:00:26.509> that

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
pretty hungry but it's okay I knew that

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.689 
pretty hungry but it's okay I knew that
the<00:00:27.439> first<00:00:27.470> few<00:00:27.919> days<00:00:28.130> were<00:00:28.340> going<00:00:28.460> to<00:00:28.609> be

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
the first few days were going to be

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.480 
the first few days were going to be
difficult<00:00:29.240> for<00:00:29.480> me<00:00:29.630> so<00:00:30.289> I<00:00:30.680> was<00:00:30.800> prepared<00:00:31.250> for

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
difficult for me so I was prepared for

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.660 
difficult for me so I was prepared for
this<00:00:31.580> mentally<00:00:32.150> and<00:00:32.449> I<00:00:33.260> believe<00:00:34.190> that<00:00:34.220> I<00:00:34.460> can

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
this mentally and I believe that I can

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.930 
this mentally and I believe that I can
work<00:00:35.330> my<00:00:35.570> way<00:00:35.720> through<00:00:35.989> it<00:00:36.519> this<00:00:37.519> is<00:00:37.580> the

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
work my way through it this is the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
work my way through it this is the
second<00:00:38.600> juice<00:00:38.809> fast<00:00:39.170> that<00:00:39.830> I've<00:00:39.980> done<00:00:40.309> and<00:00:40.960> the

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
second juice fast that I've done and the

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.140 
second juice fast that I've done and the
first<00:00:42.199> time<00:00:42.470> I<00:00:42.500> did<00:00:42.769> a<00:00:42.800> deuce<00:00:43.040> fast<00:00:43.400> I<00:00:43.760> actually

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
first time I did a deuce fast I actually

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:52.299 
first time I did a deuce fast I actually
used<00:00:44.690> a<00:00:45.610> Breville<00:00:46.720> juicer<00:00:47.720> and<00:00:49.839> so<00:00:50.839> that<00:00:51.049> was<00:00:51.320> a

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
used a Breville juicer and so that was a

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.479 
used a Breville juicer and so that was a
different<00:00:52.970> experience<00:00:53.059> from<00:00:53.629> what<00:00:53.839> I'm<00:00:53.989> doing

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
different experience from what I'm doing

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.060 
different experience from what I'm doing
with<00:00:55.489> this<00:00:55.729> juice<00:00:56.030> fast<00:00:56.299> because<00:00:57.260> this<00:00:57.799> juice

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
with this juice fast because this juice

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.660 
with this juice fast because this juice
fast<00:00:58.280> I'm<00:00:58.580> actually<00:00:58.850> using<00:00:59.299> a<00:00:59.809> Vitamix

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
fast I'm actually using a Vitamix

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.250 
fast I'm actually using a Vitamix
blender<00:01:01.670> to<00:01:02.210> create<00:01:03.170> my<00:01:03.470> whole<00:01:03.920> food<00:01:05.260> blended

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
blender to create my whole food blended

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.080 
blender to create my whole food blended
smoothies<00:01:06.830> I<00:01:06.860> guess<00:01:07.270> so<00:01:08.270> I<00:01:08.299> I<00:01:09.790> guess<00:01:10.790> you<00:01:10.939> could

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
smoothies I guess so I I guess you could

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.760 
smoothies I guess so I I guess you could
say<00:01:11.240> this<00:01:11.450> isn't<00:01:11.630> necessarily<00:01:12.229> a<00:01:12.439> traditional

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
say this isn't necessarily a traditional

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.630 
say this isn't necessarily a traditional
juice<00:01:13.369> fast<00:01:13.750> but<00:01:14.750> since<00:01:15.020> I'm<00:01:15.229> I'm<00:01:15.560> only<00:01:16.549> in

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
juice fast but since I'm I'm only in

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.569 
juice fast but since I'm I'm only in
taking<00:01:16.929> vegetable<00:01:17.929> and<00:01:18.109> fruit<00:01:18.350> juice<00:01:18.679> it's

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
taking vegetable and fruit juice it's

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.440 
taking vegetable and fruit juice it's
the<00:01:19.880> same<00:01:20.090> basic<00:01:20.659> principle<00:01:21.219> so<00:01:22.420> when<00:01:23.420> I

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
the same basic principle so when I

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.319 
the same basic principle so when I
decided<00:01:23.869> to<00:01:24.320> change<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.189> way<00:01:25.219> I<00:01:25.700> was<00:01:26.000> going<00:01:26.060> to

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
decided to change the way I was going to

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:28.419 
decided to change the way I was going to
do<00:01:26.479> this<00:01:26.630> fast<00:01:26.929> I<00:01:27.409> looked<00:01:27.979> at<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:28.280> two

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 
do this fast I looked at the two

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:31.359 
do this fast I looked at the two
different<00:01:28.460> options<00:01:29.289> one<00:01:30.289> being<00:01:30.799> using<00:01:31.280> a

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
different options one being using a

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.429 
different options one being using a
juicer<00:01:31.609> as<00:01:32.119> I<00:01:32.509> said<00:01:32.689> I<00:01:32.719> have<00:01:32.929> a<00:01:32.960> Breville

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
juicer as I said I have a Breville

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.639 
juicer as I said I have a Breville
juicer<00:01:33.829> and<00:01:34.100> then<00:01:34.820> the<00:01:34.999> second<00:01:35.479> using<00:01:36.200> a

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
juicer and then the second using a

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.559 
juicer and then the second using a
blender<00:01:37.429> like<00:01:37.820> my<00:01:37.969> Vitamix<00:01:38.509> blender<00:01:38.929> and

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
blender like my Vitamix blender and

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:43.569 
blender like my Vitamix blender and
basically<00:01:41.569> the<00:01:42.109> primary<00:01:42.530> difference<00:01:43.159> between

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
basically the primary difference between

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.749 
basically the primary difference between
the<00:01:43.759> two<00:01:43.939> types<00:01:44.210> of<00:01:44.390> fats<00:01:44.630> is<00:01:45.159> with<00:01:46.159> the<00:01:46.310> juicer

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
the two types of fats is with the juicer

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.309 
the two types of fats is with the juicer
you're<00:01:47.359> going<00:01:47.749> to<00:01:47.929> remove<00:01:48.729> the<00:01:49.729> fiber<00:01:50.539> from

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
you're going to remove the fiber from

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.399 
you're going to remove the fiber from
the<00:01:51.649> fruits<00:01:52.009> and<00:01:52.249> vegetables<00:01:52.789> that<00:01:52.939> you're

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
the fruits and vegetables that you're

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.800 
the fruits and vegetables that you're
juicing<00:01:54.409> whereas<00:01:55.369> with<00:01:55.609> a<00:01:55.639> blender<00:01:56.149> you're

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
juicing whereas with a blender you're

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.109 
juicing whereas with a blender you're
able<00:01:57.109> to<00:01:57.200> actually<00:01:57.380> keep<00:01:57.920> all<00:01:58.249> of<00:01:58.310> that<00:01:58.670> fiber

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
able to actually keep all of that fiber

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.569 
able to actually keep all of that fiber
in<00:01:59.659> the<00:02:00.200> juice<00:02:00.229> and<00:02:01.659> at<00:02:02.659> least<00:02:02.869> for<00:02:03.079> me<00:02:03.319> I<00:02:03.679> view

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
in the juice and at least for me I view

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.749 
in the juice and at least for me I view
that<00:02:04.729> as<00:02:04.969> a<00:02:05.299> benefit<00:02:05.780> because<00:02:06.100> as<00:02:07.100> I<00:02:07.249> said<00:02:07.429> I'm

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
that as a benefit because as I said I'm

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.500 
that as a benefit because as I said I'm
getting<00:02:08.060> very<00:02:08.179> hungry<00:02:08.330> right<00:02:08.840> now<00:02:08.899> I<00:02:09.470> know

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
getting very hungry right now I know

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.780 
getting very hungry right now I know
having<00:02:11.510> done<00:02:11.750> this<00:02:11.900> in<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.170> past<00:02:12.200> that<00:02:12.790> that's

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
having done this in the past that that's

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.910 
having done this in the past that that's
something<00:02:14.300> that's<00:02:14.480> an<00:02:14.660> issue<00:02:14.810> with<00:02:15.140> me<00:02:15.350> not

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
something that's an issue with me not

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.780 
something that's an issue with me not
feeling<00:02:16.430> full<00:02:16.910> and<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:18.860> thought<00:02:19.459> that

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
feeling full and and I thought that

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.440 
feeling full and and I thought that
trying<00:02:20.480> this<00:02:20.840> juice<00:02:21.110> fast<00:02:21.380> with<00:02:21.770> a<00:02:21.800> blender

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
trying this juice fast with a blender

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.050 
trying this juice fast with a blender
would<00:02:23.450> allow<00:02:23.660> me<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:23.900> feel<00:02:24.170> more<00:02:24.470> full

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
would allow me to feel more full

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.750 
would allow me to feel more full
because<00:02:25.300> I'm<00:02:25.450> going<00:02:25.599> to<00:02:25.690> keep<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:26.050> fiber<00:02:26.319> and

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
because I'm going to keep the fiber and

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.000 
because I'm going to keep the fiber and
into<00:02:27.760> those<00:02:27.940> juices<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:29.170> hopefully<00:02:29.830> that

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
into those juices and and hopefully that

one you'll see that I'm down over five

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.189 
one you'll see that I'm down over five
pounds<00:05:12.370> after<00:05:13.370> two<00:05:13.699> days<00:05:13.880> on<00:05:14.120> my<00:05:14.300> juice<00:05:14.509> fast<00:05:14.810> I

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 
pounds after two days on my juice fast I

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:18.640 
pounds after two days on my juice fast I
realized<00:05:16.039> at<00:05:16.310> this<00:05:16.430> point<00:05:17.110> those<00:05:18.110> results

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
realized at this point those results

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.129 
realized at this point those results
aren't<00:05:19.240> going<00:05:20.240> to<00:05:20.360> be<00:05:20.830> common<00:05:21.830> results<00:05:22.280> for<00:05:22.490> me

aren't going to be common results for me
obviously<00:05:24.139> I<00:05:24.169> would<00:05:24.410> expect<00:05:24.740> to<00:05:24.830> lose<00:05:25.039> less<00:05:25.479> in

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
obviously I would expect to lose less in

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:29.200 
obviously I would expect to lose less in
the<00:05:26.660> future<00:05:27.020> however<00:05:27.800> you<00:05:28.280> know<00:05:28.430> that's<00:05:28.610> some

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210

good<00:05:29.389> motivation<00:05:30.080> up<00:05:30.440> front<00:05:30.830> seeing<00:05:31.699> that

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
good motivation up front seeing that

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.510 
good motivation up front seeing that
kind<00:05:32.840> of<00:05:32.990> difference<00:05:33.199> on<00:05:33.530> the<00:05:33.650> scale<00:05:33.680> and<00:05:34.310> and

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
kind of difference on the scale and and

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.450 
kind of difference on the scale and and
sometimes<00:05:35.389> that<00:05:35.690> can<00:05:35.750> be<00:05:36.310> something<00:05:37.310> that

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
sometimes that can be something that

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.510 
sometimes that can be something that
