here you can see I am will be charging
my<00:00:07.770> batteries<00:00:08.300> these<00:00:09.300> are<00:00:13.219> 850<00:00:14.219> million

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
my batteries these are 850 million

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:25.910 
my batteries these are 850 million
they're<00:00:15.350> called<00:00:16.350> are<00:00:17.029> three<00:00:23.539> AAA<00:00:24.920> triple-a

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
they're called are three AAA triple-a

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.210 
they're called are three AAA triple-a
batteries<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:27.390> they<00:00:27.599> totally<00:00:28.109> fit<00:00:28.500> right<00:00:28.920> in

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
batteries so they totally fit right in

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.670 
batteries so they totally fit right in
here<00:00:30.199> this<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.949> five<00:00:32.279> sport<00:00:32.700> tony<00:00:33.090> hawk's

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
here this is the five sport tony hawk's

here this is the five sport tony hawk's
camera<00:00:35.750> let<00:00:36.750> me<00:00:36.840> open<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:42.559> you<00:00:43.559> can<00:00:43.770> see

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
camera let me open this you can see

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.360 
camera let me open this you can see
inside<00:00:45.480> there<00:00:45.780> there<00:00:46.230> are<00:00:46.320> two<00:00:46.950> springs<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:48.079> was

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
inside there there are two springs I was

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.790 
inside there there are two springs I was
wondering<00:00:50.370> if<00:00:50.690> they<00:00:51.690> shouldn't<00:00:51.989> have<00:00:52.289> placed

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
wondering if they shouldn't have placed

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.279 
wondering if they shouldn't have placed
one<00:00:53.070> spring<00:00:53.399> right<00:00:53.610> here<00:00:54.890> this<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.160> memory

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
one spring right here this is the memory

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.349 
one spring right here this is the memory
just<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.410> SD<00:00:58.770> memory<00:00:58.949> card<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.910> came<00:01:00.300> with

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
just the SD memory card that came with

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:07.399 
just the SD memory card that came with
it<00:01:04.460> so<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.729> green<00:01:06.030> light<00:01:06.240> says<00:01:06.570> it's<00:01:07.049> fully

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
it so the green light says it's fully

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.630 
it so the green light says it's fully
charged<00:01:07.890> I'm<00:01:08.310> gonna<00:01:08.960> flip<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.170> out<00:01:13.460> here<00:01:14.460> is

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
charged I'm gonna flip it out here is

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:24.289 
charged I'm gonna flip it out here is
this<00:01:15.049> Plus<00:01:16.049> on<00:01:16.350> top<00:01:19.159> first<00:01:20.159> off<00:01:20.340> top<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:23.299> minus

this Plus on top first off top and minus

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:32.510 
this Plus on top first off top and minus
on<00:01:24.479> top<00:01:25.759> so<00:01:28.189> closely<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:30.560> it<00:01:31.560> should<00:01:32.220> work

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
on top so closely and it should work

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.460 
on top so closely and it should work
when<00:01:33.509> i<00:01:33.540> press<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.229> one<00:01:34.470> here<00:01:34.790> and<00:01:36.470> it

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
when i press this one here and it

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.880 
when i press this one here and it
doesn't<00:01:37.950> work<00:01:38.220> no<00:01:39.000> sign<00:01:41.810> I'll<00:01:42.810> press<00:01:43.770> it

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
doesn't work no sign I'll press it

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.950 
doesn't work no sign I'll press it
longer<00:01:45.979> there<00:01:46.979> are<00:01:47.130> nothing<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.950> these

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
longer there are nothing and these

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.920 
longer there are nothing and these
batteries<00:01:51.960> they<00:01:52.920> are<00:01:53.270> specially<00:01:54.270> made<00:01:54.479> for

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
batteries they are specially made for

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.850 
batteries they are specially made for
photo<00:01:55.530> cameras<00:01:56.180> because<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.630> LCD<00:01:58.439> display

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
photo cameras because the LCD display

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:07.219 
photo cameras because the LCD display
has<00:01:59.189> lots<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:01.219> energy<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:03.590> so<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:04.920> on<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.960> N

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
has lots of energy and so this on the N

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.960 
has lots of energy and so this on the N
I<00:02:07.740> mhm<00:02:08.520> types

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
I mhm types

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.470 
I mhm types
I<00:02:10.110> don't<00:02:11.110> see<00:02:11.290> if<00:02:11.380> you<00:02:11.500> can<00:02:11.680> see<00:02:11.920> clearly

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
I don't see if you can see clearly

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.170 
I don't see if you can see clearly
either<00:02:13.500> ni-mh<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:15.520> those<00:02:15.670> are<00:02:15.850> pretty

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
either ni-mh and those are pretty

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.910 
either ni-mh and those are pretty
powerful<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:18.340> they<00:02:18.550> last<00:02:18.790> longer<00:02:19.150> for<00:02:19.960> get

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
powerful so they last longer for get

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
powerful so they last longer for get
your<00:02:21.160> cat<00:02:21.400> digital<00:02:22.060> cameras<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:25.090> know<00:02:26.670> no<00:02:27.670> use

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
your cat digital cameras you know no use

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:38.400 
your cat digital cameras you know no use
I<00:02:28.240> mean<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:29.860> does<00:02:30.070> work<00:02:30.310> on<00:02:30.580> you<00:02:30.730> with<00:02:30.910> be<00:02:37.410> as

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
I mean it does work on you with be as

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.570 
I mean it does work on you with be as
you<00:02:38.620> can<00:02:38.770> see<00:02:39.190> i'm<00:02:39.610> gonna<00:02:40.980> try<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.100> take<00:02:42.400> them

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
you can see i'm gonna try to take them

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.980 
you can see i'm gonna try to take them
out<00:02:42.850> so<00:02:43.330> i<00:02:43.570> take<00:02:44.170> them<00:02:44.380> up<00:02:44.530> like<00:02:44.770> this<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.250> I'll

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
out so i take them up like this and I'll

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.710 
out so i take them up like this and I'll
turn<00:02:46.990> them<00:02:48.209> in<00:02:49.209> case<00:02:49.690> but<00:02:50.290> I<00:02:50.470> don't<00:02:50.680> think<00:02:50.950> so

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
turn them in case but I don't think so

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:59.370 
turn them in case but I don't think so
in<00:02:52.720> case<00:02:53.200> I<00:02:53.380> have<00:02:53.830> it<00:02:54.360> wrong<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:58.380> still

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
in case I have it wrong and still

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:11.670 
in case I have it wrong and still
nothing<00:03:06.240> so<00:03:07.240> yeah<00:03:07.720> I<00:03:08.190> think<00:03:09.190> this<00:03:10.680> production

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
nothing so yeah I think this production

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.120 
nothing so yeah I think this production
mistake<00:03:12.130> I<00:03:13.320> could<00:03:14.320> fix<00:03:14.890> it<00:03:15.269> with<00:03:16.269> some

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
mistake I could fix it with some

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.320 
mistake I could fix it with some
aluminium<00:03:18.130> paper<00:03:18.820> so<00:03:19.360> I<00:03:19.630> can<00:03:19.810> make<00:03:20.590> some<00:03:21.330> fake

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
aluminium paper so I can make some fake

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.920 
aluminium paper so I can make some fake
metal<00:03:23.140> plate<00:03:23.560> at<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.310> bottom<00:03:24.760> so<00:03:24.970> the

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
metal plate at the bottom so the

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.890 
metal plate at the bottom so the
connection<00:03:26.610> so<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:27.730> connection<00:03:28.150> here<00:03:28.600> at<00:03:28.750> the

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
connection so the connection here at the

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.920 
connection so the connection here at the
tip<00:03:29.340> goes<00:03:30.340> down<00:03:30.640> as<00:03:30.940> a<00:03:31.570> fully<00:03:32.170> connection<00:03:32.680> and

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
tip goes down as a fully connection and

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.880 
tip goes down as a fully connection and
then<00:03:34.930> it<00:03:35.200> should<00:03:36.010> work<00:03:37.170> because<00:03:38.170> I've<00:03:38.440> done<00:03:38.709> it

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
then it should work because I've done it

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.770 
then it should work because I've done it
before<00:03:39.010> with<00:03:39.430> remote<00:03:39.970> controllers<00:03:40.600> for<00:03:41.049> TVs

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
before with remote controllers for TVs

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.170 
before with remote controllers for TVs
but<00:03:43.780> since<00:03:44.290> I<00:03:44.500> have<00:03:44.530> a<00:03:44.739> 30<00:03:45.130> days<00:03:45.489> warranty<00:03:45.820> I

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
but since I have a 30 days warranty I

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:53.820 
but since I have a 30 days warranty I
just<00:03:46.570> Scotty's<00:03:47.049> like<00:03:49.769> day<00:03:50.769> or<00:03:50.920> two<00:03:51.160> and<00:03:52.830> I

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
just Scotty's like day or two and I

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.530 
just Scotty's like day or two and I
don't<00:03:54.010> think<00:03:54.190> I<00:03:54.310> should<00:03:54.340> mess<00:03:55.269> with<00:03:55.299> it

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
don't think I should mess with it

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.670 
don't think I should mess with it
because<00:03:56.530> I<00:03:56.799> have<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.549> state's<00:03:57.820> fancy<00:03:58.330> sauce

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
because I have the state's fancy sauce

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.000 
because I have the state's fancy sauce
instead<00:03:59.680> I've<00:03:59.950> make<00:04:00.250> use<00:04:00.459> of<00:04:00.489> that<00:04:03.510> so<00:04:04.510> yeah<00:04:04.720> I

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
instead I've make use of that so yeah I

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.340 
instead I've make use of that so yeah I
owe<00:04:06.630> this<00:04:07.630> although<00:04:07.870> I<00:04:09.150> don't<00:04:10.150> think<00:04:10.540> they<00:04:11.140> use

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
owe this although I don't think they use
