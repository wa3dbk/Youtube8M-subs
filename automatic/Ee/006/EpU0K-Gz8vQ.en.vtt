 I think I grew up in the 90s then he is from us 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.500
 and 8 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.120
 no wonder the FC St 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.360
 St Dietz 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.329
 the topic 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.520
 unbelievable the 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.690
 on 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.240
 but also criticism 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.240
 Scott Sutter 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.240
 the game demands 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.490
 Not 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.120
 we are not against the main proofs but are also ready 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.300
 the world the arguments 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.510
 because his Ronny because the terror continue to increase 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.430
 Robin Dutt with his brother wants to know too 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.020
 who are in these areas 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.000
 and overcomes 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.780
 the first time in my life never exactly 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.149
 of it become 2 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.450
 Justitia et Pax 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.250
 to 1 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.780
 he can happily meet his sport again around small objects 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.300
 muster 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.170
 Photo Reuters Berlin as controversial 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.260
 This variant still needs a lot of ground 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.780
 we will have to evaluate 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.030
 but once we got the hang of it 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.220
 very helpful 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.299
 to the charge but a whole lot higher jump 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.770
 important is 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.730
 but also not practice 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.950
 that's okay 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.950
 to 7 30 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.540
 Red 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.090
 nothing happened 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.420
 Abensberg 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.420
 what am I doing maybe 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:18.290
 keeping one of the best single devotional is empty like this for many years 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.900
 while in most cases, it's only where you speak from left to right 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.560
 right back 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.810
 We always hear different ways to the goal and sometimes need or certain 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.309
 Items collected 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:30.619
 the victim 

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:32.030
 the whole thing is over 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.779
 sometimes even other countries have to be visited 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:36.539
 to be able to enter 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:40.029
 In addition, the latte are also stuffed full of secrets and 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:40.620
 estimate 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.639
 literally on every corner trying to decide 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.499
 who wants to see the best here 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:48.139
 it should therefore rather from the age 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:49.539
 the president 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:52.039
 the stock of Teva different 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:55.039
 to appreciate and choose the night together 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.559
 Speaking of difficulty 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:00.979
 rather a mega men will make the chair very heavy at first 

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:04.239
 especially one and three lie and one continent 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.949
 jumped twice and there plays 4 

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:08.779
 but if you want 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:10.509
 and once recorded 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:13.539
 Protests from consumers could be advised 

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:16.539
 especially if we have the fastest possible way through the line 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:20.299
 So you get better the longer you deal with the game 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.900
 What could be better than to realize that you have not been one recently 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.370
 impossible to keep well he fled without problems solve 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.719
 By the way, Megamind does not come 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:37.389
 the producer of Bertelsmann none other than Nativity groups Chihuahua 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:41.789
 who also produced many parts of the blue bomber, including the one of 

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:45.089
 Fans particularly popular second and third goals 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:48.769
 and also the Composer should Ballweg in the end pondering 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.769
 because no one is less for the brilliant soundtrack 

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:54.969
 Birthday is responsible MTI 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:57.969
 or should I say better Goar dpa 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.239
 but even if we do not do anything with the name 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:02.489
 this possibility becomes 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.489
 say this sunday 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.019
 Huber 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.599
 Stanek 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:32.009
 to 11 dpa 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.330
 upbeat 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.979
 we have 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:14.029
 hectic 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.319
 Cham 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:20.789
 Has
