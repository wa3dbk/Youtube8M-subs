00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.140 

routed<00:00:39.530> the<00:00:39.590> truss<00:00:39.800> rod<00:00:39.920> channel<00:00:40.460> found<00:00:40.970> the

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150 
routed the truss rod channel found the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.760 
routed the truss rod channel found the
headstock<00:00:45.730> seemed<00:00:46.730> like<00:00:46.850> so<00:00:47.030> much<00:00:47.180> more

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
headstock seemed like so much more

wings<00:02:09.470> are<00:02:09.679> on<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:11.620> angle<00:02:12.620> which<00:02:12.980> was<00:02:13.190> here

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
wings are on the angle which was here

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.210 
wings are on the angle which was here
was<00:02:14.300> already<00:02:14.510> there<00:02:14.810> in<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:14.959> last

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
you've got your nice two degree angle

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.440 
you've got your nice two degree angle
the<00:02:21.010> headstock<00:02:22.010> is<00:02:22.040> bound<00:02:22.459> like<00:02:22.850> I<00:02:22.880> want<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.239> be

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
the headstock is bound like I want to be

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.020 
the headstock is bound like I want to be
and<00:02:24.230> I've<00:02:24.709> got<00:02:24.860> a<00:02:24.890> little<00:02:25.160> bit<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.370> drawings<00:02:25.880> on

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
and I've got a little bit of drawings on

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.050 
and I've got a little bit of drawings on
layout<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:26.870> where<00:02:27.170> I<00:02:27.200> want<00:02:27.440> things<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:27.680> go

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
layout and and where I want things to go

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.390 
layout and and where I want things to go
as<00:02:29.060> you<00:02:29.180> can<00:02:29.330> see<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:30.530> body<00:02:30.680> has<00:02:30.890> been<00:02:31.070> shaped

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
as you can see the body has been shaped

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.710 
as you can see the body has been shaped
and<00:02:31.730> dialed<00:02:32.720> in<00:02:36.519> yeah<00:02:37.550> so<00:02:38.269> what<00:02:38.510> are<00:02:38.570> we<00:02:38.630> gonna

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
and dialed in yeah so what are we gonna

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.990 
and dialed in yeah so what are we gonna
do<00:02:38.840> next<00:02:38.989> well<00:02:39.380> I'm<00:02:39.620> going<00:02:39.920> to<00:02:39.950> put<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.850> front

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
do next well I'm going to put the front

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.890 
do next well I'm going to put the front
truss<00:02:41.570> rod<00:02:41.780> in<00:02:41.930> with<00:02:42.800> the<00:02:42.890> fretboard<00:02:43.100> on<00:02:43.459> I

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
truss rod in with the fretboard on I

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.390 
truss rod in with the fretboard on I
will<00:02:44.900> also<00:02:45.290> get<00:02:45.830> some<00:02:45.890> of<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.819> the<00:02:47.540> routing

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
will also get some of the the routing

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.949 
will also get some of the the routing
channels<00:02:49.400> cut<00:02:49.730> for<00:02:50.150> you<00:02:50.720> know<00:02:50.780> like<00:02:50.900> the

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
channels cut for you know like the

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.890 
channels cut for you know like the
switch<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.470> go<00:02:51.590> to<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.950> control<00:02:52.310> cavity<00:02:52.900> as

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
switch to go to the control cavity as

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.740 
switch to go to the control cavity as
well<00:02:54.080> as<00:02:54.350> the<00:02:54.739> channels<00:02:55.370> for<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:56.030> wiring<00:02:56.360> from

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
well as the channels for the wiring from

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.509 
well as the channels for the wiring from
pickup<00:02:57.170> to<00:02:57.319> pick<00:02:57.500> up<00:02:57.680> and<00:02:57.860> then<00:02:57.980> into<00:02:58.430> the

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
pickup to pick up and then into the

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.750 
pickup to pick up and then into the
control<00:02:58.850> cavity<00:02:59.180> as<00:02:59.269> well<00:03:00.130> so<00:03:01.130> it<00:03:01.310> changed<00:03:01.640> up

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
control cavity as well so it changed up

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.000 
control cavity as well so it changed up
a<00:03:01.910> little<00:03:02.120> bit<00:03:02.329> from<00:03:03.140> what<00:03:03.350> my<00:03:03.530> initial<00:03:03.890> plan

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
a little bit from what my initial plan

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.259 
a little bit from what my initial plan
was<00:03:04.510> as<00:03:05.510> it<00:03:05.750> relates<00:03:06.019> to<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.700> top<00:03:07.910> going

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
was as it relates to the the top going

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.030 
was as it relates to the the top going
around<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.660> end<00:03:08.780> of<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.170> prep<00:03:09.590> work<00:03:09.620> you<00:03:09.920> can

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
around the end of the prep work you can

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.110 
around the end of the prep work you can
do<00:03:10.100> this<00:03:10.220> a<00:03:10.250> couple<00:03:10.310> different<00:03:10.790> ways<00:03:10.820> and

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
do this a couple different ways and

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.780 
do this a couple different ways and
initially<00:03:11.510> what<00:03:11.630> I<00:03:11.690> was<00:03:11.780> going<00:03:11.930> to<00:03:12.019> do<00:03:12.140> was

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
initially what I was going to do was

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.720 
initially what I was going to do was
make<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:14.560> portion<00:03:15.560> of<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:15.799> top<00:03:16.130> go

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
make the portion of the top go

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.720 
make the portion of the top go
underneath<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.540> fret<00:03:17.780> board<00:03:18.489> but<00:03:19.489> the<00:03:19.610> other

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
underneath the fret board but the other

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.220 
underneath the fret board but the other
thing<00:03:19.880> you<00:03:19.910> can<00:03:20.060> do<00:03:20.180> is<00:03:20.420> make<00:03:21.079> a<00:03:21.110> little

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
thing you can do is make a little

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.420 
thing you can do is make a little
template<00:03:21.650> for<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:24.070> fret<00:03:25.070> board<00:03:25.100> to<00:03:25.310> fit

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
template for the fret board to fit

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.830 
template for the fret board to fit
around<00:03:27.609> go<00:03:28.609> from<00:03:28.820> there<00:03:28.970> so<00:03:29.239> that's<00:03:29.630> what<00:03:29.750> I'm

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
around go from there so that's what I'm

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.020 
around go from there so that's what I'm
doing<00:03:30.079> and<00:03:31.390> once<00:03:32.390> they<00:03:32.480> get<00:03:32.600> these<00:03:34.030> channels

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
doing and once they get these channels

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.090 
doing and once they get these channels
and<00:03:35.150> stuff<00:03:35.329> routed<00:03:36.049> like<00:03:36.260> I<00:03:36.470> previously

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
and stuff routed like I previously

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.400 
and stuff routed like I previously
mentioned<00:03:37.459> I<00:03:37.820> can<00:03:38.570> have<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:38.810> top<00:03:38.989> and<00:03:41.410> yeah

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
mentioned I can have the top and yeah

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.259 
mentioned I can have the top and yeah
it's<00:03:43.010> pretty<00:03:43.100> much<00:03:43.220> it<00:03:43.430> I'm<00:03:43.850> gonna<00:03:44.030> get<00:03:44.150> to

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
it's pretty much it I'm gonna get to

00:03:44.269 --> 00:04:25.660 
it's pretty much it I'm gonna get to
work

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.810 

okay<00:04:26.670> so<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.690> fretboard<00:04:28.200> is<00:04:28.410> trimmed<00:04:28.820> found

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
okay so the fretboard is trimmed found

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.660 
okay so the fretboard is trimmed found
because<00:04:30.720> some<00:04:30.930> blue<00:04:31.620> glow<00:04:31.980> in<00:04:32.100> the<00:04:32.190> dark<00:04:32.430> side
