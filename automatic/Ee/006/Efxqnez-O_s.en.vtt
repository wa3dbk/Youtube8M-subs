00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
the NBA game well / poppy be a game just

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.979 
the NBA game well / poppy be a game just
kind<00:04:14.530> of<00:04:14.560> similar<00:04:14.950> here<00:04:15.370> to<00:04:16.269> international

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
kind of similar here to international

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.710 
kind of similar here to international
ball<00:04:17.169> such<00:04:17.590> as<00:04:17.709> in<00:04:17.829> Europe<00:04:18.130> and<00:04:18.250> Asia<00:04:18.720> nothing

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
ball such as in Europe and Asia nothing

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.170 
ball such as in Europe and Asia nothing
is<00:04:19.810> just<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.140> physical<00:04:20.440> talent<00:04:21.039> yeah<00:04:21.519> the

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
is just the physical talent yeah the

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.480 
is just the physical talent yeah the
physical<00:04:22.450> talent<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:22.900> skills<00:04:23.320> I<00:04:23.680> don't<00:04:24.340> see

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
physical talent the skills I don't see

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.060 
physical talent the skills I don't see
as<00:04:24.610> being<00:04:24.870> drastically<00:04:25.870> different<00:04:26.440> in<00:04:26.650> the

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
as being drastically different in the

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.700 
as being drastically different in the
NBA<00:04:27.370> I<00:04:28.090> think<00:04:28.840> it's<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.080> physical<00:04:29.440> town<00:04:29.590> the

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
NBA I think it's the physical town the

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.430 
NBA I think it's the physical town the
physical<00:04:30.070> capabilities<00:04:30.639> to<00:04:30.820> speed<00:04:31.440> the

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
physical capabilities to speed the

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.990 
physical capabilities to speed the
jumping<00:04:32.830> ability<00:04:33.280> of<00:04:33.460> the<00:04:33.610> overwrought

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
jumping ability of the overwrought

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.760 
jumping ability of the overwrought
lettuces<00:04:34.479> and<00:04:34.539> that's<00:04:34.870> where<00:04:35.110> really<00:04:35.320> changes

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
lettuces and that's where really changes

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.200 
lettuces and that's where really changes
things<00:04:35.800> because<00:04:36.039> now<00:04:36.400> you<00:04:36.460> take<00:04:36.729> players<00:04:37.000> who

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
things because now you take players who

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.450 
things because now you take players who
are<00:04:37.330> fundamentally<00:04:37.900> sound<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:38.950> now<00:04:39.160> to<00:04:39.220> have

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
are fundamentally sound and now to have

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.430 
are fundamentally sound and now to have
the<00:04:40.060> athleticism<00:04:40.479> will<00:04:40.840> go<00:04:40.930> along<00:04:41.139> with<00:04:41.380> that

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
the athleticism will go along with that

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.090 
the athleticism will go along with that
and<00:04:42.220> I<00:04:42.280> think<00:04:42.490> that's<00:04:42.700> just<00:04:42.789> as<00:04:43.600> training<00:04:44.100> you

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
and I think that's just as training you

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.320 
and I think that's just as training you
know<00:04:45.190> it's<00:04:45.310> kind<00:04:45.460> of<00:04:45.580> figuring<00:04:46.150> out

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
know it's kind of figuring out

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.969 
know it's kind of figuring out
understanding<00:04:47.050> how<00:04:47.080> the<00:04:47.169> best<00:04:47.410> use<00:04:47.620> your<00:04:47.800> body

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
understanding how the best use your body

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.909 
understanding how the best use your body
and<00:04:48.190> nutrition<00:04:48.700> and<00:04:49.270> that<00:04:49.389> comes<00:04:49.860> you<00:04:50.860> know

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
and nutrition and that comes you know

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.409 
and nutrition and that comes you know
