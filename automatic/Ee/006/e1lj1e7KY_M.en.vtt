appropriately devastating you feel like
you<00:05:21.870> are<00:05:21.900> doing<00:05:22.139> bad<00:05:22.680> things<00:05:22.949> to<00:05:23.430> other<00:05:23.580> human

you are doing bad things to other human

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.430 
you are doing bad things to other human
beings<00:05:24.360> when<00:05:24.630> you<00:05:24.750> when<00:05:25.020> you<00:05:25.050> let<00:05:25.319> these

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.030 

so<00:05:50.810> the<00:05:50.900> one<00:05:51.020> major<00:05:51.200> knock<00:05:51.470> against<00:05:51.770> call<00:05:51.950> of

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.040 
so the one major knock against call of

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.320 
so the one major knock against call of
duty<00:05:52.220> 4<00:05:52.250> is<00:05:52.550> that<00:05:52.700> it's<00:05:52.820> single<00:05:53.120> player

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
duty 4 is that it's single player

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.660 
duty 4 is that it's single player
campaign<00:05:53.900> is<00:05:54.080> really<00:05:54.590> quite<00:05:54.830> short<00:05:55.250> maybe

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670 
campaign is really quite short maybe

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.160 
campaign is really quite short maybe
about<00:05:55.790> half<00:05:55.880> as<00:05:56.270> long<00:05:56.420> as<00:05:56.660> the<00:05:56.810> average

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
about half as long as the average

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.440 
about half as long as the average
shooter<00:05:57.470> in<00:05:57.710> the<00:05:57.830> market<00:05:58.130> today<00:05:58.250> but<00:05:59.090> a<00:05:59.120> lot<00:05:59.330> of

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450 
shooter in the market today but a lot of

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.940 
shooter in the market today but a lot of
that<00:05:59.570> is<00:05:59.690> mitigated<00:06:00.200> by<00:06:00.230> the<00:06:00.350> fact<00:06:00.470> that<00:06:00.740> the

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
that is mitigated by the fact that the

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.590 
that is mitigated by the fact that the
quality<00:06:01.310> of<00:06:01.580> that<00:06:01.790> single<00:06:01.970> player<00:06:02.210> campaign

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 
quality of that single player campaign

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.960 
quality of that single player campaign
is<00:06:02.750> really<00:06:03.320> really<00:06:03.560> over<00:06:03.950> the<00:06:04.040> top<00:06:04.070> when<00:06:04.880> you
