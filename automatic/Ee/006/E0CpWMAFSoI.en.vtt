 let's get to such a start gay and us here 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.180
 same subject to the plot component of the road 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.399
 diary i am a journalist my career in general 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.210
 not really 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:48.059
 growing flowers japan me 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:50.100
 he decided that he should decide the case 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.219
 murder which was committed in some kind 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.000
 hairy years this de de de de hÃ´ 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.760
 de in general goes somewhere there he 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.899
 will consider recording police 30 years 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.150
 back not a damn it is not clear general want 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.290
 man not to do for the sake of career in short 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.080
 If you say well, it is clear in general, our 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.170
 the main character that is also like the main one 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.540
 hero of the formation as miles of logic head 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.610
 not friendly and decided at your own risk 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.259
 your ass raise your career 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.650
 the journalist to extraordinary heights 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:30.650
 seamstress material on some 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.650
 incomprehensible 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.439
 the house because here you look at the houses 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.969
 quite a lot of them you and by the way I do not 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.390
 I know why now exactly here 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:42.399
 straight ran maybe there is a pass 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.619
 so a space does not mean to jump 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:48.520
 We are not allow to jump on and not 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.740
 give but it seems to me friends that the game 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.780
 it will even be quite simple and 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.200
 normal a day maybe even nothing 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.479
 serious will not be so meanwhile we 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.030
 these three houses do not enter 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:06.159
 can music while threatening it very 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:11.819
 even curious but in general the game looks 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:14.920
 like budget version indie budget game 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.590
 roughly save save rhythmically 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.769
 agree so well here it is seen 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.690
 passage and just the same all hints at 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:26.380
 what exactly we need here but 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.870
 let's try our luck like that 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.430
 fact whose quantity is great but today 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.430
 Not a day for a car to admire him 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.570
 since it is very suspicious house order 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:43.380
 more then broke down the door but let's 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:47.000

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.780
 Only here I am a little bit of course 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:58.760
 confused by this music 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:03:01.100
 overly so mildly gloomy and 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.380
 straining but she is given to us 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.750
 to scare us friends and ask to 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.100
 go i have it just confuses our 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.489
 the main character just doesn't go about running but 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.260
 doors like this don't open or i'm an idiot 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:19.860

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:25.380

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.700
 dry on me or like nothing 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.860
 I understand myself but the music is as if 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.670
 now right here it will try 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.110

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:55.100

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.620
 now right here and sit by but somehow 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:03.460

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.570
