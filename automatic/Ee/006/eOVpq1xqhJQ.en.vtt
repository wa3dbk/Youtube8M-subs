you one of the 65 gallon
I've<00:00:09.780> been<00:00:10.110> I<00:00:10.469> don't<00:00:10.740> think<00:00:10.980> I've<00:00:11.160> ever<00:00:11.190> been

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
I've been I don't think I've ever been

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.829 
I've been I don't think I've ever been
happier<00:00:11.929> with<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.769> state<00:00:14.009> this<00:00:14.190> tanks<00:00:14.580> in<00:00:14.839> I

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
happier with the state this tanks in I

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.340 
happier with the state this tanks in I
just<00:00:16.529> think<00:00:17.130> I've<00:00:17.279> found<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.699> perfect

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
just think I've found the perfect

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.580 
just think I've found the perfect
balance<00:00:19.350> with<00:00:19.740> water<00:00:20.160> changes<00:00:20.699> fertilizer

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
balance with water changes fertilizer

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.839 
balance with water changes fertilizer
photo<00:00:22.590> period<00:00:22.980> recently<00:00:24.920> just<00:00:25.920> about<00:00:26.160> three

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
photo period recently just about three

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.670 
photo period recently just about three
weeks<00:00:27.090> ago<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.330> think<00:00:27.480> maybe<00:00:27.900> even<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.260> month<00:00:28.410> I

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
weeks ago I think maybe even a month I

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.189 
weeks ago I think maybe even a month I
put<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.099> tank<00:00:29.519> on<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> timer<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.929> think

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
put this tank on a timer and I think

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.590 
put this tank on a timer and I think
it's<00:00:31.349> made<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> huge<00:00:31.679> difference

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
it's made a huge difference

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.729 
it's made a huge difference
I've<00:00:34.050> had<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.829> tank<00:00:35.130> now<00:00:35.340> for<00:00:35.670> years<00:00:36.000> and

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
I've had this tank now for years and

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.440 
I've had this tank now for years and
I've<00:00:37.739> never<00:00:38.100> kept<00:00:38.489> any<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.879> my<00:00:39.000> tanks<00:00:39.329> on

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
I've never kept any of my tanks on

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.709 
I've never kept any of my tanks on
timers<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.469> now<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.829> keep<00:00:41.129> them<00:00:41.370> all<00:00:41.700> timed<00:00:42.390> and

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
timers and now I keep them all timed and

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.720 
timers and now I keep them all timed and
I<00:00:43.200> really<00:00:43.770> do<00:00:43.890> think<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.280> makes<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.550> big

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
I really do think it makes a big

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.080 
I really do think it makes a big
difference<00:00:45.149> just<00:00:45.239> just<00:00:46.200> those<00:00:46.379> slight

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
difference just just those slight

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.860 
difference just just those slight
fluctuations<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:49.910> light<00:00:50.910> schedule<00:00:51.449> keep

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
fluctuations in the light schedule keep

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.630 
fluctuations in the light schedule keep
you<00:00:52.020> sleep<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.500> or<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.860> end<00:00:52.980> up<00:00:53.129> staying<00:00:53.460> up

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
you sleep in or you end up staying up

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.670 
you sleep in or you end up staying up
late<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:54.149> think<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.780> really<00:00:55.020> does<00:00:55.230> make<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.559> big

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
late I think it really does make a big

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.430 
late I think it really does make a big
difference<00:00:56.629> in<00:00:57.629> how<00:00:58.530> your<00:00:58.710> plants<00:00:59.190> react<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.449> I

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
difference in how your plants react so I

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.500 
difference in how your plants react so I
would<00:01:02.010> recommend<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.760> anyone<00:01:02.969> who<00:01:03.149> doesn't

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
would recommend it to anyone who doesn't

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.399 
would recommend it to anyone who doesn't
already<00:01:03.660> have<00:01:03.960> their<00:01:04.140> tanks<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> timer<00:01:06.409> yeah

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
already have their tanks on a timer yeah

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.170 
already have their tanks on a timer yeah
so<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.740> mean<00:01:08.040> there's<00:01:08.189> not<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.400> whole<00:01:08.670> lot<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:08.939> say

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
so I mean there's not a whole lot to say

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.410 
so I mean there's not a whole lot to say
things<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.930> pretty<00:01:10.140> much<00:01:10.350> stayed<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.710> same

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
things that pretty much stayed the same

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.120 
things that pretty much stayed the same
in<00:01:12.420> my<00:01:12.600> last<00:01:12.810> video<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.619> mentioned<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.100> was

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
in my last video I mentioned I was

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.570 
in my last video I mentioned I was
putting<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.760> some<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.840> extra<00:01:16.350> dwarf<00:01:17.280> hair

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
putting in some of the extra dwarf hair

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.039 
putting in some of the extra dwarf hair

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
grass from the planted Nano and it

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.830 
grass from the planted Nano and it
hasn't<00:01:22.229> spread<00:01:22.619> but<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.009> hasn't<00:01:23.189> died<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.939> I'll

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
hasn't spread but it hasn't died so I'll

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.789

and unfortunately has wreaked havoc on

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.730 
and unfortunately has wreaked havoc on
our<00:01:55.430> the<00:01:56.430> new<00:01:56.610> growth<00:01:56.909> on<00:01:57.210> an<00:01:57.509> Tobias<00:01:58.170> leaves

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
our the new growth on an Tobias leaves

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.100 
our the new growth on an Tobias leaves
I<00:01:58.880> haven't<00:01:59.880> had<00:02:00.060> very<00:02:00.240> much<00:02:00.450> new<00:02:00.689> growth<00:02:00.899> on

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
I haven't had very much new growth on

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.100 
I haven't had very much new growth on
these<00:02:01.290> because<00:02:01.820> they<00:02:02.820> just<00:02:03.030> eat<00:02:03.270> them<00:02:03.450> I'll

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
these because they just eat them I'll

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.499 
these because they just eat them I'll
try<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.469> show<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:05.000> like<00:02:06.000> you'll<00:02:06.149> see<00:02:06.240> that

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.919 
try and show you like you'll see that
this<00:02:06.689> leaf<00:02:06.990> here<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:08.190> all<00:02:08.910> nibbled<00:02:09.300> on<00:02:09.420> and

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
this leaf here is all nibbled on and

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.820 
this leaf here is all nibbled on and
that<00:02:10.410> one<00:02:10.619> as<00:02:10.770> well<00:02:11.000> so<00:02:12.000> they<00:02:12.150> do<00:02:12.209> eat<00:02:12.480> them

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
that one as well so they do eat them

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.820

the<00:04:02.730> fact<00:04:03.000> that<00:04:03.090> there's<00:04:03.329> not<00:04:03.450> much<00:04:03.690> plant

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
the fact that there's not much plant

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.199 
the fact that there's not much plant
cover<00:04:04.230> up<00:04:04.440> there<00:04:04.650> might<00:04:05.280> make<00:04:05.519> hit<00:04:05.819> her

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209
