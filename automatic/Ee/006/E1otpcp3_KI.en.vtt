00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:09.480
 finally found the time to put the camera 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:15.240
 the rear view set it lower out 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:21.150
 from the eyes the monitor thought still here might 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.170
 put or somewhere here well decided 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.250
 to put 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.250
 away that the less conspicuous and 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.360
 then go hooligans would think more 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.530
 what is it any registrar or 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:47.670
 navigator camera turns on when 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:58.739
 back speed on 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:01:02.609
 Ignition here on the monitor there 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:06.000
 mark from the red line to the bottom and and 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.740
 it 's hard to see this red line before 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.590
 cars 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.600
 remains about 30 centimeters very 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.990
 useful thing when you need to park 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:24.119
 ass especially when the car is behind 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:29.930
 hood forward when not really clear 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.930
 where is where the machine ends 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.530
 here came the red line 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.709
 Now here it is able to stay here 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.269
 if you watch the rearview mirror or 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:32.359
 look back 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:34.989
 it is not clear how much is left before 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:34.989
 cars behind 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.150
 in the monitor everything is quite clear 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:59.200
 here it is the camera itself is almost invisible 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.500
 as the camera is a little off center 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.770
 then the picture monitors slightly shifted 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.390
 it is as if the role does not play much of course 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:13.280
 if there is an opportunity to better put 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:19.240
 in the middle it will be more convenient camera itself 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:23.720
 connected to the wire of the reverse lamp 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:25.160
 the monitor is connected to the cigarette lighter where 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.790
 voltage is applied only when 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.790
 ignition on 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:44.930
 the most inconvenient in this case was to shoot 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:46.570
 trim and carry the wires outside the window 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:52.030
 night 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.030
 This is how the picture looks like at night 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.180
 well seen 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.050
 thanks for watching 9 videos were for 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.050
 you useful
