00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.850
 today in auvergne we tested the 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:29.739
 mountainbike downhill and mountain biking Super Besse 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:30.340
 we have six senses if we went upstairs 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.930
 from the resort 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.910
 yeah the partridge's well pass that 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:38.670
 when you're upstairs you see the volcanoes 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.670
 sure enough up about 3.76 because 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.650
 it's gone so that turns me I 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.090
 did a little bit of mountain bike listening it was 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.570
 really nice it's on the bottom of the 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.370
 station 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.370
 the landscapes are varied 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.790
 for michel angot I thought you 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.410
 could possibly advise me on the 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.310
 path I should take the a3 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.050
 so sulk at different levels 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.760
 tallec green loop the blue buckle and 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.590
 the red loop so next but on 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.150
 the difficulties it will join 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:17.170
 itineraries so 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:20.470
 tagged and that this country I am 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:28.570
 descended on first a blue runway 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:30.270
 yes import its not too taken there are six 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.460
 tracks in drawings that were 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.530
 arranged 23 blue 2 red and one black 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.810
 okay so the black must be fine 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.620
 well body argues if that is they 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.620
 knew the Coupe de France 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.150
 who 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.140
 tata steel buy target councils 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.970
 jean michel is quite fascinating you can 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.010
 to make talent jumps and pif paf them 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.490
 families so you go to one side then 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.260
 the other who pays well in late for you 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.010
 be a good reception afterwards 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.010
 So, where did you go 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.430
 the next shot so we could from his 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.340
 goods this mix of activity and then we 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.590
 would go hiking mountain bike too 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.490
 quite benefit I think that's 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.490
 would be very nice hard
