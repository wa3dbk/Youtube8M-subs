 Hello dear friends viewers and 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.819
 subscribers of my channel with you andrik and 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.290
 we keep playing minecraft on 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.139
 server gamai.ru 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.690
 and just a couple of minutes ago updated 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.070
 client gamai.ru and here finally 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.190
 added new servers 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.750
 God, how long have I been waiting for this unfortunately 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.820
 only one working server so far 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.220
 the rest of the server will open soon 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.039
 time and in general today we will see 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.650
 what kind of new server is this server 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.109
 there is absolutely no anarchy 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.600
 no rules no police 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.550
 just clean hardcore steal kill 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.760
 today we play a little bit on it 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.200
 fooling around let's see what happens with us 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.969
 so let's see what new ones 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.600
 the server must add it in the first place 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.160
 hunger games 5 6 here they are finally 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.920
 new hunger games i'm there too 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.539
 be sure to play in the future as well 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.739
 3 more cronos servers 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.870
 gefest and pandora hope this 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.510
 there will be cherished servers with mods on 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.699
 which we will have season 3 in general, then 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.799
 In the future we will learn everything, but for now let's 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.110
 let's try to go finally to anarchy 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.540
 because here all the places are taken i'm bye 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.790
 that I can't break through and in general 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.369
 let's go as soon as I go there we will 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.189
 see you and finally i 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.530
 I could finally come in and let me go 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.409
 let's see what it is 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.659
 server so spawn pvp disabled 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.990
 it's good lord what picked up 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.420
 wheat so we still have the same starting 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.329
 set as on all servers and 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.040
 then by the way the legs have updated textures 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.930
 my God as I did not notice earlier 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.170
 pretty cool but let's now 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.820
 me the textures and the server so well 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.159
 probably let's go somewhere out 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.950
 although let's start by reading 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.280
 tablets so privates no in general then we 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.670
 know that there is a weapon sell on is included 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.310
 everywhere and at any time of the day or night in 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.439
 general everywhere not everywhere but in sleep 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.420
 there is no him okay let's get somewhere from 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.580
 run and try a little fight 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.910
 before 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.260
 not here also here in their let's 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.600
 probably in some portal 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.700
 him somewhere else in general for today 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.900
 let's run a little fooling around 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:19.800
 but already seriously play on asgard 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.160
 Western portal go there Western 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.530
 portals where do you translate me 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.320
 so style maz get money in general 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.110
 I understand that here a little bit in the middle 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.050
 construction here we are no houses 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:38.930
 we will not do this 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:41.600
 let's play like this in childhood from portal and 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.760
 something seems to have cheated me a little 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:51.140
 there is no portal damn it 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:53.550
 Come right now some way find a way 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.310
 Gaspra I went to the new server and can not 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.170
 get out of the full well it is so to 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.810
 east portal to block shops 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.540
 let's go even to the eastern can 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.910
 be here something is so oriental 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:12.780
 portals oh yes everything is very bad 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:15.239
 there's nothing here either so let 's 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.610
 a little run no unfortunately 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.590
 here, too, there is nothing well maybe here 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.070
 in the future there will be portals for now 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.350
 maybe not working okay we go 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.610
 let's see where else you can go 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.400
 let 's go up there 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.260
 maybe it's going out and in general 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.150
 there we will fight a little bit and 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:39.660
 fooling around so go here so what have u 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.330
 us day night night more precisely either sunset 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.880
 either dawn in the course of dawn 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.920
 ok anyway when choosing here 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:51.760
 turned on around the clock so go 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.650
 Now we will fight to the 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.760
 players they are finally and one after another and 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:02.980
 no, okay, so to something set up 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:05.709
 oh my god what a mess lobster so alright 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.400
 let's go a little there now probably 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:11.379
 oh my god here everything is surrounded by mountains now 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.370
 I will try to get out on some mountain then 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:18.190
 so coal here so me someone 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:22.389
 pursuing now we may 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.580
 fight back feel like we already 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.169
 hunger games 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:30.389
 although there are no hungry games at all but 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:33.490
 yet a little something like that is so 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:37.630
 okay then let's search for the victim 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.610
 and try someone to drain the coins first 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:43.150
 killing on regular servers not on 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:48.180
 hungry games so two of you 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:51.250
 and I'm alone here is not stupid my God 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:59.830
 prokorosti begins and than somewhere 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:05:02.880
 next so let's try to climb 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.480
 somewhere here nobody is chasing us 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.020
 So 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.970
 what do we have here about ocelot hi ocelot 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:16.630
 damn i don't have raw fish one more 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:19.900
 ocelot I want you you will kill 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:22.750
 come here we are so maybe so by the way my 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.980
 Subscriber is likely to have okay 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:29.260
 let yourself so far live here damn 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.420
 take it here is still locked here 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.580
 still slept ok let's go then 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:37.030
 I guess I'll stop recording so you won't 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.980
 torment and then already find some sacrifice 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:45.430
 I will find some territory then we already 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:47.370
 continued so see you in seconds what 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:51.190
 it's there for party hard 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:54.210
 let's go there like this mode 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:59.200
 berserk first kill included 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:02.670
 we go further so who else wants there 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:07.240
 good lord go and see 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:10.300
 so far further understood mode 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.840
 berserk kill a little life so where to them 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:17.400
 I loved all of the first murder 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:20.110
 the first death vote i want blood 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.630
 okay in general, then at least such a server 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:25.450
 here, as you can see, complete 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:27.190
 Anarchy is a complete hardcore server in general 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:30.310
 just to be here a little bit 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.970
 run to fight for hardcore type 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.640
 survive 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.770
 but in general it is unlikely to build here 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.530
 something normal will succeed because 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.790
 privat unfortunately not but such a server 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.850
 of course I needed 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:45.340
 if in general everything got you want something 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:48.580
 eat and then go to the anarchy 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:50.980
 steal kill and you will have everything very much 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.290
 ok, and on this I guess I'll be with you 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.660
 say goodbye such a short review 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:57.730
 can you tell the server nothing we are here 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.460
 we will not do anything else with us 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:03.010
 a lot of things on asgard and wait for tomorrow 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:06.130
 a full series of asgard will 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:08.680
 survive there thank you so much for 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.460
 browsing with you was andrew kc and we are very 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.920
 see you soon 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:14.880
 play minecraft on gamai.ru servers 

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.880
 bye everyone 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.490

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.159
 everything
