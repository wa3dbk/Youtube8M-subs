00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.400
 calling as organizers as Star Sport has theirs too 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.219
 professional side and we show you now 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.219
 and wood 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.970
 Heise Martins 37 years old 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.000
 in their function as a youth guard in the club will have kicker 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.330
 bring along if you want to start in Kehl 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.100
 Now by the summer of being roses they also have a cub from now on 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.490
 sometimes 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.269
 Bernd Schroeder occupied and even that one can the 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.719
 Bowling and how did you come to bow to my parents against both and 

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:07.950
 with my grandparents on counter 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.750
 that he alone 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.050
 the own country would have said that profit 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.010
 that happened 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.550
 So whoever finds many that he's pretty uncool because 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.460
 for most footballers or 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.430
 find it better almost everywhere 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.520
 Obama has as the district court to catch up 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.050
 Stani right 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.609
 the least of which we certainly German champion in saving 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:33.609
 yes that's just the site Langeoog rice corn or something 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.960
 additional advantages 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.370
 leads everywhere in Germany equal bowed or plasterer differences one 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.369
 There are differences here in the north seeking a bolat 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.450
 playing in the west so the middle of Germany was not her style and in the south 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.570
 plays Marne 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.540
 There was little bowling in the asphalt or class 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.480
 and the scissors Artists little percent like a Bolat just stops the bands something 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.640
 shorter and plays a role with Diego 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.920
 through their place not the Ulmer players use service 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.590
 The ball has to be over there, then the next one has to go over to the right 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.690
 attack 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.540
 here it is quite normal 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.660
 So twice a week or how often and how ring ripping always works 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.380
 throwing up Brigida while warming up Skinner they need to warm it up 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.920
 Very important because we also take care of all the muscles and songs 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.459
 only then the name steps practiced more and more content 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:24.609
 now be the little boy red t-shirt 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:27.979
 he also has to concentrate so well explained 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:31.459
 starting from the user even a year on the pattern Tobias Luh the basic steps in 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.219
 Kirner must be very important three steps he runs 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:37.709
 So three-step FN conditional 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.250
 and then goes deeper and deeper then puts the police either right or 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:42.919
 left on the pole 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:45.779
 the punch is not easy 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:49.799
 the bowling alley, which you can not see, is a pole again 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.259
 put the ball or is it the Bonner 

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:55.309
 for the good of it is in principle 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:58.479
 It is about one percent of all muscles when you athletes at level one 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:00.659
 Sometimes forget muscle 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.099
 here are really all 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.810
 I smile so I have one more opponent I do now once more 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.279
 Sore muscles on the butt 

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:07.560
 exactly at AHS pack 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.600
 that is also so Lörrach it is it does not heal the special muscle 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.349
 really to be eligible for a sport 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.569
 but when bowling itself Mettmanner already because the professional players give in especially 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.199
 good form or relieve 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.599
 I can not judge 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.060
 I guess it was taste Sarah Palin is generally considered fun 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.279
 Sport where it is sometimes humorous Cheerful to the point how rolled with this 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:32.649
 Advantage on 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:33.899
 when it gets difficult 

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:37.429
 SMA in the youth area there is this advantage was right the kids come 

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:38.939
 completely unencumbered he 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:42.229
 how did the players get closer? 

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:46.299
 and I know that ensures that Pröll it is here is not a small 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.849
 Greetings sports but in exactly the same as every footballer also ours why 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.259
 Starz and older 

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:54.489
 and dry mobile after the death 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.489
 but then it's just a whole new story the Beat Wildi is all about 

00:03:58.089 --> 00:04:01.789
 on the other hand, he also calls such certain terms as jams 

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:03.579
 on the ingot or all around 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.029
 The term you just did not spin the web but far right or 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:09.459
 on the left you will find the Hattinger 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.579
 Passing the empty space as I read the book 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.149
 like when you blow everyone away 

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:16.149
 all nine 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.350
