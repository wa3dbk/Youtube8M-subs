you<00:02:21.260> can<00:02:21.530> see<00:02:21.829> the<00:02:22.250> consistency<00:02:22.730> is<00:02:23.239> quite

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
you can see the consistency is quite

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.160 
you can see the consistency is quite
thick<00:02:23.840> and<00:02:25.030> another<00:02:26.030> way<00:02:26.209> you<00:02:26.269> can<00:02:26.450> tell<00:02:26.750> that

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
thick and another way you can tell that

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.370 
thick and another way you can tell that
it's<00:02:27.350> ready<00:02:27.920> is<00:02:28.340> that<00:02:28.700> if<00:02:28.819> it<00:02:29.000> coats<00:02:29.299> a<00:02:29.630> spoon

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
it's ready is that if it coats a spoon

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.629 
it's ready is that if it coats a spoon
and<00:02:31.040> I<00:02:31.819> don't<00:02:32.060> know<00:02:32.180> if<00:02:32.269> you<00:02:32.359> can<00:02:32.480> see<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:34.459> can

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:34.639 
and I don't know if you can see you can

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:39.400 
and I don't know if you can see you can
see<00:02:34.940> that<00:02:34.970> it's<00:02:35.359> coated<00:02:37.900> but<00:02:38.900> that's<00:02:39.109> ready

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.569 
see that it's coated but that's ready
and<00:02:39.650> then<00:02:39.709> once<00:02:39.920> we<00:02:40.130> put<00:02:40.310> it<00:02:40.400> in<00:02:40.489> the

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579

sterilized jar we seal it and put it in
the<00:02:42.530> fridge<00:02:42.769> then<00:02:43.010> I'll<00:02:43.100> just<00:02:43.250> set<00:02:43.459> nicely<00:02:44.380> so

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
the fridge then I'll just set nicely so

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.720
