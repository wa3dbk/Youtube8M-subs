good<00:00:01.260> morning<00:00:01.620> folks<00:00:01.860> I'm<00:00:02.100> going<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.370> be

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
good morning folks I'm going to be

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.039 
good morning folks I'm going to be
showing<00:00:02.610> you<00:00:02.820> the<00:00:02.970> flare<00:00:03.270> from<00:00:03.480> three<00:00:03.840> days

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
showing you the flare from three days

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.050 
showing you the flare from three days
ago<00:00:04.290> we<00:00:04.770> had<00:00:04.920> an<00:00:05.040> unusually<00:00:05.819> beautiful

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
ago we had an unusually beautiful

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.629 
ago we had an unusually beautiful
imaging<00:00:06.930> not<00:00:07.109> only<00:00:07.379> because<00:00:07.710> it<00:00:07.859> was<00:00:07.890> huge<00:00:08.400> but

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
imaging not only because it was huge but

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.089 
imaging not only because it was huge but
we<00:00:09.179> got<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.360> perfect<00:00:09.900> side<00:00:10.170> view<00:00:10.500> as<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.769> active

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
we got a perfect side view as the active

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.430 
we got a perfect side view as the active
region<00:00:11.250> turned<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.849> limb<00:00:12.059> but<00:00:13.019> also<00:00:13.170> because

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
region turned the limb but also because

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.709 
region turned the limb but also because
it's<00:00:13.740> raining<00:00:13.980> fire<00:00:14.490> one<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.480> sun's
