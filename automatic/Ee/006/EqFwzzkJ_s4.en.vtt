00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.170 

difficult<00:02:09.879> for<00:02:09.970> for<00:02:11.190> plastic<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:12.459> not<00:02:12.819> tear

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
difficult for for plastic to not tear

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.020 
difficult for for plastic to not tear
all<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.690> way<00:02:13.840> down<00:02:14.349> when<00:02:14.620> you<00:02:14.709> pour<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.129> down

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.960 

once<00:02:19.030> you<00:02:19.299> do<00:02:19.840> that<00:02:19.870> just<00:02:20.470> peel<00:02:21.099> it<00:02:21.129> back<00:02:21.489> maybe

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
once you do that just peel it back maybe

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.190 
once you do that just peel it back maybe
about<00:02:22.269> a<00:02:22.659> third<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:24.580> a<00:02:24.640> half<00:02:24.750> it's<00:02:25.750> about<00:02:25.930> half

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
about a third to a half it's about half

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.259 
about a third to a half it's about half
here<00:02:26.519> you<00:02:27.519> can<00:02:27.700> see<00:02:30.720> here<00:02:31.720> where<00:02:32.170> where<00:02:32.920> the

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.839 
installation is the reverse of taking
out<00:03:23.189> the<00:03:23.370> mirror<00:03:23.609> so<00:03:23.969> it<00:03:24.120> just<00:03:24.329> work<00:03:25.849> American

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
out the mirror so it just work American

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:32.910 
out the mirror so it just work American
to<00:03:26.969> two<00:03:27.180> corners<00:03:27.629> of<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.900> plastic<00:03:28.530> and

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.470 

and<00:03:33.720> hasn't<00:03:34.720> gone<00:03:35.020> in<00:03:35.200> all<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.620> way<00:03:35.770> and<00:03:36.480> you

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
and hasn't gone in all the way and you

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.900 
and hasn't gone in all the way and you
can<00:03:39.780> work<00:03:40.780> around<00:03:40.960> the<00:03:41.200> edges<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:41.920> just<00:03:41.980> kind

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
can work around the edges and just kind

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.220 
can work around the edges and just kind
of<00:03:43.110> push<00:03:44.110> the<00:03:44.350> mirror<00:03:44.650> back<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:46.750> once<00:03:47.050> the

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
of push the mirror back and once the

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.810 
of push the mirror back and once the
last<00:03:47.440> corner<00:03:47.800> goes<00:03:48.070> in<00:03:50.190> be<00:03:51.190> careful<00:03:51.580> not<00:03:51.760> to

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
last corner goes in be careful not to

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.240 
last corner goes in be careful not to
exert<00:03:52.210> too<00:03:52.600> much<00:03:52.630> pressure<00:03:53.050> on<00:03:53.170> the<00:03:53.250> glass

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
exert too much pressure on the glass

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.030 
exert too much pressure on the glass
since<00:03:55.030> it<00:03:55.270> can<00:03:55.570> break<00:03:55.930> and<00:03:56.850> be<00:03:57.850> careful<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:59.680> get

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
since it can break and be careful to get

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.130 
since it can break and be careful to get
all<00:04:00.280> the<00:04:00.430> plastic<00:04:00.640> around<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.300> edges<00:04:01.780> not

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
all the plastic around the edges not

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.400 
all the plastic around the edges not
just<00:04:02.380> the<00:04:02.470> corners<00:04:03.690> that's<00:04:04.690> how<00:04:05.110> it<00:04:05.260> should

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
just the corners that's how it should

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.470 
just the corners that's how it should
look<00:04:05.440> like<00:04:05.590> and<00:04:06.040> as<00:04:06.370> you<00:04:06.490> can<00:04:06.640> see<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:08.910> LED<00:04:09.910> kit

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
look like and as you can see the LED kit

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.050 
look like and as you can see the LED kit
is<00:04:10.690> pretty<00:04:11.020> thin<00:04:11.320> so<00:04:11.350> it<00:04:12.310> doesn't<00:04:12.640> add<00:04:12.760> too

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
is pretty thin so it doesn't add too

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.460 
is pretty thin so it doesn't add too
much<00:04:13.180> thickness<00:04:14.010> to<00:04:15.010> the<00:04:15.220> actual<00:04:15.580> mirrors<00:04:16.470> now

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
much thickness to the actual mirrors now

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.880 
much thickness to the actual mirrors now
we'll<00:04:17.650> test<00:04:18.040> it<00:04:18.220> a<00:04:18.310> final<00:04:18.669> time<00:04:22.440> oops

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
we'll test it a final time oops

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:30.570 
we'll test it a final time oops
came<00:04:24.790> off<00:04:25.980> test<00:04:26.980> it<00:04:27.190> and<00:04:27.660> as<00:04:28.660> you<00:04:28.690> can<00:04:28.900> see<00:04:29.580> it

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
came off test it and as you can see it

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.460 
came off test it and as you can see it
works<00:04:31.050> perfectly

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.500 

ah
