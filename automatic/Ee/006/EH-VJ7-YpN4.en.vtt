these<00:02:33.610> gardens<00:02:34.060> is<00:02:34.209> that<00:02:34.390> they<00:02:34.540> actually<00:02:34.720> came

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
these gardens is that they actually came

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.440 
these gardens is that they actually came
about<00:02:35.319> at<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.739> hands<00:02:36.130> of<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.370> children<00:02:36.610> all

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
out here from helping stack the brick to

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.880 
out here from helping stack the brick to
getting<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.299> mortar<00:02:46.720> mixed<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.440> put<00:02:47.739> in

getting the mortar mixed and put in

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.309 
getting the mortar mixed and put in
between<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.250> bricks<00:02:48.700> they<00:02:49.690> had<00:02:49.840> great<00:02:50.079> math

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
between the bricks they had great math

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.259 
between the bricks they had great math
lessons<00:02:50.829> as<00:02:51.010> they<00:02:51.160> estimated<00:02:51.760> how<00:02:51.940> many<00:02:52.120> it

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
lessons as they estimated how many it

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.000 
lessons as they estimated how many it
was<00:02:52.360> going<00:02:52.599> to<00:02:52.690> take<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:53.110> make<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.470> three<00:02:53.739> beds

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
was going to take to make the three beds

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.670 
was going to take to make the three beds
and<00:02:54.700> so<00:02:54.880> all<00:02:55.120> of<00:02:55.299> the<00:02:55.450> variety<00:02:55.959> is<00:02:56.110> out<00:02:56.349> here

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
and so all of the variety is out here

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.890
