00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
seal the threads if you have a little

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.590 
seal the threads if you have a little
tiny<00:00:36.690> drip<00:00:36.960> out<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> threads<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:38.600> what

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
tiny drip out of the threads so what

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.290 
tiny drip out of the threads so what
I'll<00:00:39.719> show<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.260> how<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:41.000> how<00:00:42.000> this<00:00:42.180> will

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
I'll show you is how this how this will

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.910 
I'll show you is how this how this will
work<00:00:42.329> for<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.750> you're<00:00:43.410> basically<00:00:43.680> going<00:00:43.860> to

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
work for you you're basically going to

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.549 
work for you you're basically going to
go<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.100> your<00:00:44.340> your<00:00:44.820> old<00:00:44.969> can<00:00:45.239> cuz<00:00:46.050> you're<00:00:46.440> going

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
go to your your old can cuz you're going

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.990 
go to your your old can cuz you're going
to<00:00:46.620> be<00:00:46.739> switching<00:00:47.070> out<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.340> cap<00:00:47.520> assemblies

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
to be switching out the cap assemblies

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.680 
to be switching out the cap assemblies
so<00:00:49.399> so<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.460> will<00:00:50.640> take<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.910> cap<00:00:51.059> assembly<00:00:51.210> off

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
so so you will take the cap assembly off

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:00.470 
so so you will take the cap assembly off
of<00:00:51.989> your<00:00:52.230> old<00:00:52.350> can<00:00:53.480> like<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:59.090> and<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.359> will

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
of your old can like so and you will

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.920 
of your old can like so and you will
take<00:01:00.629> your<00:01:00.780> new<00:01:01.020> cap<00:01:01.260> assembly

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.950 

and<00:01:08.450> install<00:01:09.450> it

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.680 

like<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:13.910> takes<00:01:14.910> a<00:01:15.000> little<00:01:15.120> bit<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.390> effort<00:01:15.660> to

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
like so takes a little bit of effort to

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.930 
like so takes a little bit of effort to
get<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.050> retaining<00:01:16.770> collar<00:01:17.070> under<00:01:17.550> the<00:01:17.700> lip

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
get the retaining collar under the lip

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.270 
get the retaining collar under the lip
at<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.120> bottom<00:01:18.770> it<00:01:19.770> sounds<00:01:20.010> like<00:01:20.130> we're

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
at the bottom it sounds like we're

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.260 
at the bottom it sounds like we're
getting<00:01:20.340> rained<00:01:20.670> on<00:01:25.460> screw<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.670> once

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
getting rained on screw that on once

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.580 
getting rained on screw that on once
again<00:01:27.390> when<00:01:27.660> you're<00:01:27.810> laying<00:01:27.960> these<00:01:28.200> cans<00:01:28.410> on

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
again when you're laying these cans on

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.080 
again when you're laying these cans on
their<00:01:28.710> side<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:29.160> the<00:01:29.250> dispensing<00:01:29.670> systems

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
their side for the dispensing systems

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.060 
their side for the dispensing systems
you're<00:01:30.660> likely<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.140> need<00:01:31.260> a<00:01:31.320> wrench<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.890> order

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
you're likely to need a wrench in order

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.320 
you're likely to need a wrench in order
to<00:01:32.160> get<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.400> caps<00:01:32.580> tight<00:01:32.850> enough<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.210> they

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
to get the caps tight enough that they

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.270 
to get the caps tight enough that they
don't<00:01:33.360> leak<00:01:33.780> they<00:01:34.650> don't<00:01:34.830> cause<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.130> any

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
don't leak they don't cause you any

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.230 
don't leak they don't cause you any
problems<00:01:37.369> unscrew<00:01:38.369> your<00:01:38.400> main<00:01:38.729> cap<00:01:39.000> which

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
problems unscrew your main cap which

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.109 
problems unscrew your main cap which
will<00:01:39.420> reveal<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.930> modification<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.800> cap

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
will reveal the modification to this cap

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.520 
will reveal the modification to this cap
which<00:01:42.119> are<00:01:42.270> threads<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.020> are<00:01:43.110> cut<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:43.440> the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
which are threads that are cut on the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.520 
which are threads that are cut on the
inside<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:45.210> hole<00:01:45.390> for<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.780> for<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
inside of the hole for the for the

inside of the hole for the for the
polypropylene<00:01:47.210> hose<00:01:48.210> barb<00:01:51.229> then<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.290> simply

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
polypropylene hose barb then you simply

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.160 
polypropylene hose barb then you simply
screw<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:53.970> if<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.420> find<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.899> drips

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
screw this in if you find that it drips

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.480 
screw this in if you find that it drips
or<00:01:55.320> leaks<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.800> bothers<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.250> use<00:01:56.460> a

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
or leaks and that bothers you use a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:05.069 
or leaks and that bothers you use a
little<00:01:56.759> bit<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.910> the<00:01:57.030> grease<00:01:57.240> on<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.479> threads

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.080 

and<00:02:05.229> that's<00:02:05.740> basically<00:02:05.950> it<00:02:06.399> and<00:02:06.549> I've<00:02:06.759> got<00:02:06.939> one

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
and that's basically it and I've got one

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.160 
and that's basically it and I've got one
setup<00:02:07.299> over<00:02:07.600> here<00:02:07.630> that<00:02:07.869> I'd<00:02:07.990> like<00:02:08.140> to

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
setup over here that I'd like to

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.320 
setup over here that I'd like to
demonstrate<00:02:08.739> the<00:02:09.160> initial<00:02:09.759> startup<00:02:10.149> on

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
demonstrate the initial startup on

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.640 
demonstrate the initial startup on
because<00:02:10.660> this<00:02:10.750> is<00:02:10.899> one<00:02:11.050> where<00:02:11.230> you<00:02:11.260> have<00:02:11.500> to

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
because this is one where you have to

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.259 
because this is one where you have to
have<00:02:11.769> the<00:02:11.920> vent<00:02:12.129> on<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.310> can<00:02:12.550> open<00:02:12.970> just<00:02:13.180> a

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
have the vent on the can open just a

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:21.800 
have the vent on the can open just a
little<00:02:13.480> bit<00:02:14.040> for<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.099> to<00:02:15.220> flow<00:02:15.400> nicely<00:02:19.620> okay

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
little bit for it to flow nicely okay

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.430 
little bit for it to flow nicely okay
when<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:23.019> initially<00:02:23.970> start<00:02:24.970> your<00:02:25.120> flow

when you initially start your flow

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.890 
when you initially start your flow
you'll<00:02:26.440> open<00:02:27.069> the<00:02:27.250> valve<00:02:27.519> and<00:02:28.480> you'll<00:02:28.599> see<00:02:28.750> the

you'll open the valve and you'll see the

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.390 
you'll open the valve and you'll see the
drip<00:02:29.110> flow<00:02:29.230> nicely<00:02:29.470> for<00:02:29.799> a<00:02:29.830> minute<00:02:30.069> until<00:02:30.280> it

drip flow nicely for a minute until it

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.119 
drip flow nicely for a minute until it

down when it starts to slow down and
then<00:02:40.319> you<00:02:41.319> will<00:02:41.709> open<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.250> vent<00:02:42.489> a<00:02:43.530> little<00:02:44.530> bit

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
I called this a two-handed unit because

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.119 
I called this a two-handed unit because
you<00:03:09.959> kind<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.230> need<00:03:10.379> to<00:03:10.500> hold<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.769> valve<00:03:10.950> you

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
you kind of need to hold the valve you

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.130 
you kind of need to hold the valve you
can<00:03:11.250> do<00:03:11.400> it<00:03:11.519> one-handed<00:03:11.849> but<00:03:12.269> you<00:03:12.870> end<00:03:13.019> up

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140

pushing this around the valve it's

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.610 
pushing this around the valve it's

the vent from leaking so let's just

it'll stay that way and then you get a

open because they can be open the other
direction<00:04:29.010> also<00:04:31.130> you<00:04:32.130> know<00:04:32.190> there<00:04:32.430> you<00:04:32.520> have

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
direction also you know there you have

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.670 
direction also you know there you have
it<00:04:32.760> that's<00:04:32.940> the<00:04:33.090> basics<00:04:33.450> of<00:04:33.539> this<00:04:33.720> system<00:04:34.139> it's

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
it that's the basics of this system it's

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.379 
it that's the basics of this system it's
setup<00:04:34.950> with<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:35.370> vent<00:04:35.580> open<00:04:35.970> and<00:04:36.180> if<00:04:36.240> it's

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
setup with the vent open and if it's

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:37.969 
setup with the vent open and if it's
open<00:04:36.630> to<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:36.750> right<00:04:36.900> amount<00:04:37.050> it<00:04:37.470> won't<00:04:37.710> leak

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
open to the right amount it won't leak

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.070 
open to the right amount it won't leak
it<00:04:38.729> develops<00:04:39.150> a<00:04:39.210> negative<00:04:39.570> pressure<00:04:39.750> and

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
it develops a negative pressure and

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.810 
it develops a negative pressure and
stays<00:04:40.620> at<00:04:40.860> a<00:04:40.889> low<00:04:41.039> negative<00:04:41.250> pressure<00:04:41.610> inside

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
stays at a low negative pressure inside

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.610 
stays at a low negative pressure inside
the<00:04:42.090> can<00:04:42.120> that<00:04:42.450> won't<00:04:42.660> leak<00:04:42.810> and<00:04:43.410> you<00:04:43.500> can

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
the can that won't leak and you can

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.170 
the can that won't leak and you can
continue<00:04:44.010> to<00:04:44.130> use<00:04:44.160> this<00:04:44.460> until<00:04:44.760> the<00:04:44.820> can<00:04:45.000> is

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
continue to use this until the can is

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.620 
continue to use this until the can is
empty<00:04:45.800> or<00:04:46.800> if<00:04:47.250> you<00:04:47.400> wanted<00:04:47.669> to<00:04:47.849> you<00:04:48.419> can<00:04:48.570> use

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
empty or if you wanted to you can use

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.070 
empty or if you wanted to you can use
this<00:04:48.990> as<00:04:49.200> a<00:04:49.880> straight<00:04:50.880> out<00:04:52.430> pour<00:04:53.430> spout

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
this as a straight out pour spout

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.420 
this as a straight out pour spout
although<00:04:55.080> with<00:04:55.260> the<00:04:55.410> shorter<00:04:55.770> hose<00:04:55.979> which<00:04:56.310> is

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
although with the shorter hose which is

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.189 
although with the shorter hose which is
what<00:04:56.550> was<00:04:56.639> necessary<00:04:56.849> to<00:04:57.210> get<00:04:57.419> this<00:04:57.570> assembly

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
what was necessary to get this assembly

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.010 
what was necessary to get this assembly
to<00:04:58.229> work<00:04:59.060> if<00:05:00.060> you<00:05:00.210> open<00:05:00.449> your<00:05:00.539> vent<00:05:00.750> all<00:05:00.870> the

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
to work if you open your vent all the

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.860 
to work if you open your vent all the
way<00:05:01.139> you<00:05:01.199> can<00:05:01.500> use<00:05:01.740> this<00:05:02.419> as<00:05:03.419> a<00:05:03.510> pour<00:05:03.840> spout

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
way you can use this as a pour spout

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.430 
way you can use this as a pour spout
this<00:05:04.260> way<00:05:04.470> but<00:05:04.680> I<00:05:04.710> have<00:05:04.919> another<00:05:05.190> unit<00:05:05.610> that

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
this way but I have another unit that

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.860 
this way but I have another unit that
has<00:05:07.440> a<00:05:07.470> higher<00:05:07.740> flow<00:05:08.160> rate<00:05:08.510> this<00:05:09.510> hose<00:05:09.690> barb

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
has a higher flow rate this hose barb

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.360 
has a higher flow rate this hose barb
has<00:05:10.110> a<00:05:10.140> slightly<00:05:10.440> smaller<00:05:10.740> inside<00:05:11.159> diameter

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
has a slightly smaller inside diameter

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.230 
has a slightly smaller inside diameter
in<00:05:11.969> order<00:05:12.539> to<00:05:12.719> accomplish

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
in order to accomplish

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.550 
in order to accomplish
what<00:05:13.360> I<00:05:13.389> needed<00:05:13.660> to<00:05:13.990> create<00:05:14.199> the<00:05:14.410> vacuum

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
what I needed to create the vacuum

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.400 
what I needed to create the vacuum
inside<00:05:15.009> the<00:05:15.069> canyon<00:05:15.370> and<00:05:15.870> and<00:05:16.870> get<00:05:17.080> it<00:05:17.199> to<00:05:17.289> do

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
inside the canyon and and get it to do

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.180 
inside the canyon and and get it to do
what<00:05:17.560> I<00:05:17.590> wanted<00:05:17.979> so<00:05:18.300> that's<00:05:19.300> this<00:05:19.569> basic<00:05:19.960> setup

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
what I wanted so that's this basic setup

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:26.700 
what I wanted so that's this basic setup
which<00:05:24.870> run<00:05:25.870> right<00:05:26.020> now<00:05:26.169> it's<00:05:26.319> running<00:05:26.440> with

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
which run right now it's running with

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.270 
which run right now it's running with
the<00:05:26.830> pack<00:05:27.150> closed<00:05:28.860> some<00:05:29.860> of<00:05:29.949> the<00:05:30.009> waters

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
the pack closed some of the waters

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.499 
the pack closed some of the waters
beneath<00:05:30.430> it<00:05:30.699> out<00:05:30.819> so<00:05:31.000> it<00:05:31.090> might<00:05:31.210> take<00:05:31.360> a<00:05:31.389> little

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:31.509 
beneath it out so it might take a little

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:34.080 
beneath it out so it might take a little
bit<00:05:31.660> longer<00:05:31.930> for<00:05:32.080> the<00:05:32.699> negative<00:05:33.699> pressure<00:05:33.880> to

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
bit longer for the negative pressure to

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.159 
bit longer for the negative pressure to
develop<00:05:36.300> you<00:05:37.300> can<00:05:37.449> see<00:05:37.599> it's<00:05:37.780> starting<00:05:37.990> to

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
develop you can see it's starting to

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:49.469 
develop you can see it's starting to
slow<00:05:38.440> down<00:05:47.880> that's<00:05:48.880> about<00:05:49.120> your<00:05:49.270> flow<00:05:49.449> rate

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
slow down that's about your flow rate

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:53.779 
slow down that's about your flow rate
under<00:05:49.840> this<00:05:50.020> one<00:05:51.090> when<00:05:52.090> it's<00:05:52.240> set<00:05:52.449> correctly

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
under this one when it's set correctly

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:55.740 
under this one when it's set correctly
and<00:05:54.789> you<00:05:54.909> should<00:05:55.090> find<00:05:55.270> that<00:05:55.449> you<00:05:55.509> shouldn't

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
and you should find that you shouldn't

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:56.999 
and you should find that you shouldn't
have<00:05:55.810> any<00:05:56.020> trouble<00:05:56.050> with<00:05:56.409> this<00:05:56.530> one<00:05:56.680> leaking

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:57.009 
have any trouble with this one leaking

00:05:57.009 --> 00:05:58.409 
have any trouble with this one leaking
out<00:05:57.130> of<00:05:57.159> the<00:05:57.280> vent<00:05:57.460> you<00:05:57.699> can<00:05:57.849> just<00:05:58.030> stay<00:05:58.150> on<00:05:58.180> the

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
out of the vent you can just stay on the

00:05:58.419 --> 00:05:59.879 
out of the vent you can just stay on the
table<00:05:58.569> or<00:05:58.870> the<00:05:58.960> truck<00:05:59.139> or<00:05:59.289> wherever<00:05:59.440> you<00:05:59.710> put
