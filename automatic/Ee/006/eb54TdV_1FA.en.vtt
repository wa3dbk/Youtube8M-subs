00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.170
 now something special with the 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.090
 bridge why I stand because he has 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.140
 no pillars and air earned yourself 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.360
 over there 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.279
 I am above the German A9 the quick something 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.720
 become sounds and therefore the reason for it 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.340
 be quick is in fact made in the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.090
 1930s a ranch in this dessauer 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.680
 to pull 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.840
 perfectly straight and made for speed 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.210
 support region and there were even plans 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.649
 for a car with 3000 hp 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.260
 well they never came and then have this one 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.730
 also not where the s63 amg coupÃ© is all too 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.730
 good for 5 dogs 85 hp 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.350
 it was funny in the 30s 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.309
 of course a lot of national 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.600
 prestige 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.400
 in England love speed 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.050
 record well here somewhere in germany 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.579
 so four have nothing at all 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.660
 he just comes a lot of campaign money 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.220
 in 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.449
 because we pick up the shorter germany 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.089
 the x development at the car brands 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.220
 but the English could use 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.600
 the kind of planes in hjoed to america 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.759
 dupont little light can 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.890
 Germany could not 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:10.300
 so hitler did yes the a9 there was on it 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.400
 behind must type reserve runway 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.810
 so he was already right that way 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.490
 bridges were already suitable aircraft 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.560
 underneath and so rebuilt one more 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.410
 times that cars there the record attempt 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.630
 can do infinitely long in straight 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.039
 around very wide concrete slabs and that became 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.140
 which lies dessauer and scope highway 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.550
 still there and the true plan in that 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.860
 time for mercedes to make a car 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.440
 with the 3000 hp my giant 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.440
 Liquid-cooled V12 with the special 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.080
 methanol and methanol mixer in 3,000 ek 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.729
 it on paper 700 km per hour 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.710
 that work has been made precisely for you 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.420
 but it was the war in the late 1930s 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.830
 broke out and it didn't matter 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.270
 try the prototype 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.459
 is still in the Mercedes-Benz 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.190
 and so hard will we be with this 

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:53.369
 car never go he is starts at 257 km 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.369
 per hour 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.560
 yes the sgp i want the successor of the 70cl 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.770
 that will not go back for long 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.970
 to the old name sp and amg version 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.860
 quickly became very important 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.800
 because that makes you the ultimate in mercedes 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.060
 and are busy enough markets and 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.780
 enough people who need it 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.000
 to have 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.130
 from america russia also recently china 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.720
 all big mercedesses 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.020
 how funny is the china that will sail 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.190
 for the 600 versions and russia and especially 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.530
 categories that goes more often for the 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.240
 indicate versions and actually this is it 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.780
 top model because yes you say then there is also 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.610
 an s65 that's right but it has a v12 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.630
 and two turbos and this v8 with two 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.590
 turbos 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.750
 but those four tables are actually whole 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.920
 old and that v8 is the new engine that is 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.600
 a new development in the only one 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.730
 reason that they still deliver v12 is whole 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.940
 simple there is demand for there are people 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.810
 they must and will and will have a v12 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.280
 to get 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.900
 yes and if you are over there that 100,000 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.610
 can ask for euros there are we are so 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.470
 be crazy if you don't deliver if you have one 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.370
 have a choice in you go into normal thinking 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.370
 actually want the better car 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.769
 around itself from the previous model of 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.900
 Mrs. how much better he sends that 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.519
 was also impressive 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.920
 is also wrong not so wrong that we before 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.659
 because he looks nice from the piece 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.540
 fewer errors over it still 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.650
 extremely impressive but it runs smoothly 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.090
 tighter 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.739
 this is the form and tap version and i would 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.629
 and actually always takes because you 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.650
 have 900 now to measure and that only the 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.090
 rear wheel in the you completely 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.819
 disturbed especially with weather like this it 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.340
 it rained a lot it's cold and let's 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.379
 Well essentially this is not a car targeted 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.599
 not for brand version has air suspension 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.859
 and keep that whole Putin dream tight and 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.260
 it's weird you figure out how low 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:36.750
 this variant and get your curve yourself 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.159
 tilting oedipus fifth against the bend 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.450
 nice as a motorcyclist 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.739
 and remains weaker here with this 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.000
 I suppose I don't have to 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.790
 combine falls with four-wheel drive 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.189
 which is a shame but even without it 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.659
 system it is striking how simple and 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:50.700
 can drive this carriage through curves 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:53.220
 as if it were a true one or even two 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.950
 classes is smaller it is such an impressive 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.569
 great thing and it used to notice and too 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.700
 can drive if you really enter the temple 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.230
 he no longer notices that and that is mainly 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.480
 also nice to blow with and autobahn 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.220
 from 220 to 230 it is cruising speed 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.319
 super tight you have a lot of feeling your steering 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.329
 you notice if that changes course 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.849
 car responding immediately is no doubt 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.169
 no move and then you see nothing 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.459
 his car is about to have this is not 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:16.500
 Only excess when you do an act 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.150
 germany continuously from merlin to 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.250
 place munich back to stoeckart 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.570
 then this is the car with which you also 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.780
 actually all that capacity 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.780
 utilize 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.700
 and 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.990
 then just on the luxury on board I have me 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:41.210
 recently that s class 24 hours ago 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.919
 i know all systems security system 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.110
 with car drives itself implies the backup 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.460
 within the lines at high speed it 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.870
 overview and digital screens 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.160
 fantastic 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.020
 funny, by the way, that struck me 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.030
 have reversing camera of course 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.590
 have 63 camera that you kind of top down 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.449
 duke also gets that you see more often 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.160
 again even one forward 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.449
 driving camera with traffic because that nose so 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.979
 long is that you can see if you pass one 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.020
 pole stepje free just in room 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:06.050
 in the nose and when you go see which 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.539
 class actually falls this s coupe 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.070
 then look at competitors m6 no that's right 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:13.729
 still under 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.710
 also in audi rs7 no rolls-royce wraith 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.000
 so say the go to page and the 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.169
 that is bentley continental gt 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.720
 actually competitors for this car 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.699
 same price range and for me the 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.169
 choice actually be easy because so 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:25.669
 a ghost and such a manly 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.550
 then you go to exaggeration what you buy 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.410
 for the got the leather is even more edited 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.090
 and wood has been varnished even more often 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:36.039
 it will all be pure together 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.039
 technology this is the better car
