just drawing with black texture after
you've<00:01:46.000> gone<00:01:46.090> over<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.480> whole<00:01:46.750> egg<00:01:46.930> in<00:01:47.140> an

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
you've gone over the whole egg in an

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.740 
you've gone over the whole egg in an
orange<00:01:47.560> paint<00:01:47.890> and<00:01:48.820> then<00:01:48.970> just<00:01:49.180> flip<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.570> fill

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
orange paint and then just flip the fill

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.330 
orange paint and then just flip the fill
in<00:01:49.870> the<00:01:50.050> holes<00:01:50.350> you've<00:01:50.560> got<00:01:50.770> here<00:01:50.980> so<00:01:51.130> you<00:01:51.190> got

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
in the holes you've got here so you got

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.680 
in the holes you've got here so you got
like<00:01:51.460> a<00:01:51.490> green<00:01:51.850> for<00:01:52.060> his<00:01:52.180> eyes<00:01:52.270> and<00:01:52.540> then<00:01:52.660> a

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
like a green for his eyes and then a

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.330 
like a green for his eyes and then a
burgundy<00:01:53.200> for<00:01:53.440> his<00:01:53.530> stomach<00:01:53.800> and<00:01:54.070> all<00:01:54.130> that

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
burgundy for his stomach and all that

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.100 
burgundy for his stomach and all that
it's<00:01:54.730> pretty<00:01:54.940> self-explanatory<00:01:55.270> I<00:01:55.660> did<00:01:55.870> a<00:01:55.900> red

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
it's pretty self-explanatory I did a red

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.270 
it's pretty self-explanatory I did a red
in<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.290> mouth<00:01:56.470> but<00:01:56.710> it<00:01:56.800> didn't<00:01:56.980> really<00:01:57.160> turn

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
in the mouth but it didn't really turn

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.950 
in the mouth but it didn't really turn
out<00:01:57.520> so<00:01:57.670> I<00:01:57.700> guess<00:01:57.910> leave<00:01:58.150> the<00:01:58.300> mouth<00:01:58.450> as<00:01:58.660> it<00:01:58.810> is

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
out so I guess leave the mouth as it is

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.050 
out so I guess leave the mouth as it is
bulbasaur<00:01:59.560> the<00:02:00.160> whole<00:02:00.340> thing<00:02:00.580> in<00:02:00.700> a<00:02:00.790> lime

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
bulbasaur the whole thing in a lime

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.970 
bulbasaur the whole thing in a lime
light<00:02:01.540> green<00:02:01.960> because<00:02:02.320> what<00:02:02.530> you<00:02:02.620> want<00:02:02.740> is<00:02:02.920> a

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
light green because what you want is a

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.280 
light green because what you want is a
dark<00:02:03.400> green<00:02:03.700> when<00:02:04.570> you're<00:02:04.720> drawing<00:02:04.900> on<00:02:05.080> these

holes here you want to fill the holes in

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.490 
holes here you want to fill the holes in
with<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.360> darker<00:02:07.690> green<00:02:07.840> so<00:02:07.990> it<00:02:08.080> stands<00:02:08.350> out

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500
