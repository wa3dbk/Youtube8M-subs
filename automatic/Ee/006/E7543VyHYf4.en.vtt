00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.030 
you maybe not know is that the screen
I'm<00:00:33.390> standing<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.840> front<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.320> green<00:00:34.739> and

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
I'm standing in front of is green and

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.670 
I'm standing in front of is green and
anything<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.239> color<00:00:36.510> green<00:00:36.870> will

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
anything that is the color green will

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.160 
anything that is the color green will
change<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.760> weather<00:00:39.090> map<00:00:39.450> or<00:00:39.780> whatever

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
video we're putting behind me we could

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.209 
video we're putting behind me we could
put<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> weather<00:00:42.480> map<00:00:42.750> back<00:00:42.989> here<00:00:43.469> we<00:00:43.950> could<00:00:44.070> put

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
put a weather map back here we could put

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.279 
put a weather map back here we could put
a<00:00:44.280> picture<00:00:44.670> we<00:00:44.850> could<00:00:45.000> put<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> video<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.930> so

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
a picture we could put a video and so

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.900 
a picture we could put a video and so
the<00:00:46.440> camera<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:46.950> smart<00:00:47.309> enough<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.789> it's

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
the camera is smart enough and it's

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.000 
the camera is smart enough and it's
connected<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> computer<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.230> says<00:00:49.440> hey<00:00:49.710> if

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
connected to a computer that says hey if

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.700 
connected to a computer that says hey if
you<00:00:50.520> look<00:00:50.730> out<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.270> see<00:00:51.539> green<00:00:51.899> put<00:00:52.469> some

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
you look out you see green put some

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.040 
you look out you see green put some
graphics<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.270> could<00:00:54.600> cover<00:00:54.809> my

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
graphics on that so I could cover my

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.979 
graphics on that so I could cover my
face<00:00:55.670> that's<00:00:56.670> why<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.850> cannot<00:00:57.239> wear<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.570> green

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
face that's why I cannot wear a green

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.569 
face that's why I cannot wear a green
jacket<00:00:58.350> or<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> green<00:00:59.039> skirt<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.550> would

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
jacket or a green skirt it would

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.450 
jacket or a green skirt it would
completely<00:01:00.210> go<00:01:00.420> away<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:01.199> it's<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.980> pretty<00:01:02.160> cool

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
completely go away so it's a pretty cool

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.340 
completely go away so it's a pretty cool
technology<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.270> actually<00:01:03.660> want<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.930> zoom<00:01:04.170> out

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
technology and actually want to zoom out

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.530 
technology and actually want to zoom out
here<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.830> can<00:01:04.949> see<00:01:05.129> what<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.489> look<00:01:05.880> at<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.210> be

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
there is a monitor that is the TV

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.390 
there is a monitor that is the TV

monitor with those weather graphics on

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.460 
monitor with those weather graphics on
it<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:18.150> when<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.360> look<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.900> side
