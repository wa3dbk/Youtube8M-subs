you

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.350 

this<00:05:40.780> is<00:05:40.960> getting<00:05:41.319> worse<00:05:41.560> I<00:05:41.979> think<00:05:42.729> I'm<00:05:43.150> gonna

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
this is getting worse I think I'm gonna

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.240 
this is getting worse I think I'm gonna
throw<00:05:43.690> in<00:05:44.110> the<00:05:44.229> towel<00:05:44.470> and<00:05:44.800> quit<00:05:45.669> I<00:05:47.069> don't<00:05:48.069> know

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
throw in the towel and quit I don't know

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.439 
throw in the towel and quit I don't know
how<00:05:48.340> to<00:05:48.460> run<00:05:48.580> these<00:05:48.789> damn<00:05:49.000> things

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:49.449 
how to run these damn things

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.140 
how to run these damn things
I<00:05:49.710> guess<00:05:50.710> the<00:05:50.889> reptile<00:05:51.250> kind<00:05:51.580> of<00:05:51.699> sounds<00:05:52.000> like

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
I guess the reptile kind of sounds like

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.540 
I guess the reptile kind of sounds like
it<00:05:52.360> because<00:05:52.690> I<00:05:53.259> can't<00:05:53.830> make<00:05:53.979> either<00:05:54.220> of<00:05:54.430> them

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
it because I can't make either of them

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.860 
it because I can't make either of them
work<00:05:54.789> there<00:05:55.389> you<00:05:55.419> go

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
work there you go

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
all right well you can't win them all

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.860
