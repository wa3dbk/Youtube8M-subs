the San freak all which is pretty deep

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.900 
the San freak all which is pretty deep
you<00:00:25.439> know<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.680> almost<00:00:25.830> goes<00:00:26.220> up<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.699> half

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
you know it almost goes up to the half

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.980 
you know it almost goes up to the half
or<00:00:27.119> eight<00:00:27.240> point<00:00:28.670> it<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.820> normal<00:00:30.359> for<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
or eight point it is normal for the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
touch screen to register touches and

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.049 
touch screen to register touches and
when<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.410> device<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.739> only<00:00:35.190> partially<00:00:35.850> in

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
when the device is only partially in

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.020 
when the device is only partially in
water<00:00:36.329> or<00:00:36.540> being<00:00:36.899> run<00:00:37.170> under<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.500> trap<00:00:38.030> because

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
water or being run under a trap because

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.209 
water or being run under a trap because
it<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.300> basically<00:00:39.780> registering<00:00:40.530> touches<00:00:41.040> this

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
it is basically registering touches this

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.880 
it is basically registering touches this
is<00:00:41.430> completely<00:00:41.850> normal<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.540> once<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.590> device

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
is completely normal and once the device

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.369 
is completely normal and once the device
is<00:00:43.950> however<00:00:44.460> one<00:00:44.879> fully<00:00:45.270> submerged<00:00:45.750> won't<00:00:46.230> be

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
is however one fully submerged won't be

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.770 
is however one fully submerged won't be
able<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.829> register<00:00:46.980> touches<00:00:47.789> because<00:00:48.570> it's

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
able to register touches because it's

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.270 
able to register touches because it's
going<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.050> think<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.649> whole<00:00:49.680> screen<00:00:50.039> is

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
going to think that the whole screen is

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.670 
going to think that the whole screen is
being<00:00:50.550> touched<00:00:50.789> by<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.600> young<00:00:51.930> body<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.440> water

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
being touched by the young body of water

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.490 
being touched by the young body of water
so<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.760> not<00:00:53.940> possible<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.570> really<00:00:55.050> use<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
so it is not possible to really use the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.069 
so it is not possible to really use the
an<00:00:55.649> touch<00:00:55.920> screen<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.820> water<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.539> I

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
an touch screen and the water and I

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.410 
an touch screen and the water and I
won't<00:00:58.289> be<00:00:58.440> able<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.890> won't<00:00:59.609> be<00:00:59.820> possible<00:01:00.000> to

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
won't be able to won't be possible to

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.799 
won't be able to won't be possible to
use<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.780> touch<00:01:00.989> screen<00:01:01.410> above<00:01:02.010> water<00:01:02.370> again

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
use the touch screen above water again

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.109 
use the touch screen above water again
until<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> screen<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.559> fully<00:01:04.860> dried<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.970> let

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
until the screen is fully dried so let

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.179 
until the screen is fully dried so let
me<00:01:06.240> quickly<00:01:06.390> try<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.080> front<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.979> screen

and lock it and as you can see here the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.320 
and lock it and as you can see here the
phone<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.040> fully<00:01:14.280> functional<00:01:14.909> which<00:01:15.119> is

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
phone is to fully functional which is

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.090 
phone is to fully functional which is
good<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:18.750> one<00:01:18.930> downside<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.920> phone

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
good and the one downside of the phone

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.100 
good and the one downside of the phone
not<00:01:20.310> being<00:01:20.580> functional<00:01:21.090> underwater<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.869> that

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
not being functional underwater is that

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.350 
not being functional underwater is that
you<00:01:22.290> are<00:01:22.470> unable<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.860> an<00:01:23.369> take<00:01:23.640> pictures<00:01:24.150> by

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
you are unable to an take pictures by

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.149 
you are unable to an take pictures by
clicking<00:01:24.750> on<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.930> shutter<00:01:25.439> button<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:26.009> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
clicking on the shutter button in the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.880 
clicking on the shutter button in the
camera<00:01:26.520> app<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:28.020> phone<00:01:28.200> obviously

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
camera app and the phone obviously

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.560 
camera app and the phone obviously
doesn't<00:01:29.250> have<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> physical<00:01:29.640> camera<00:01:30.210> button

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
doesn't have a physical camera button

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.200 
doesn't have a physical camera button
which<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.079> bit<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.530> pain<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.100> there's<00:01:32.970> one

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
which is a bit of a pain and there's one

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.130 
which is a bit of a pain and there's one
easy<00:01:33.540> workaround<00:01:34.259> for<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.829> if<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.369> go<00:01:35.549> into

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
easy workaround for this if you go into

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.200 
easy workaround for this if you go into
the<00:01:37.140> camera<00:01:37.409> settings<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.310> go<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.460> self<00:01:38.880> timer

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
the camera settings and go to self timer

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.899 
the camera settings and go to self timer
you<00:01:39.990> can<00:01:40.049> set<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.560> two<00:01:41.189> seconds<00:01:41.700> or<00:01:41.880> 10

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
you can set it to two seconds or 10

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.990 
you can set it to two seconds or 10
seconds<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.930> then<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:44.070> can<00:01:44.220> obviously<00:01:44.340> flip

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
seconds and then you can obviously flip

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.179 
seconds and then you can obviously flip
the<00:01:45.210> am<00:01:45.390> shutter<00:01:45.720> button<00:01:46.110> above<00:01:46.259> water<00:01:46.680> and

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
the am shutter button above water and

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.830 
the am shutter button above water and
then<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.579> won't<00:01:47.850> take<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.329> phone<00:01:48.509> below

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
then you won't take the phone below

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.440 
then you won't take the phone below
water<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.500> will<00:01:49.680> take<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.159> picture<00:01:50.579> there<00:01:51.270> is

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
water it will take the picture there is

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.200 
water it will take the picture there is
also<00:01:51.689> an<00:01:52.110> smile<00:01:52.860> feature<00:01:53.280> where<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.850> will<00:01:54.000> take

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
also an smile feature where it will take

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.120
