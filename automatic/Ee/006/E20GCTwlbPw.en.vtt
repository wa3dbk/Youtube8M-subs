00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.179
 Hello, the next parcel arrived in 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.800
 this time two small packages arrived 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.200
 rode without track numbers 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.089
 how long before or I won't say for sure 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.340
 because the little things of every different ordered 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.680
 the only thing I know is that here 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:24.240
 there are films for meizu mx4 pro and 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.380
 meizu m1 melange it and here on the idea and 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.869
 usb cable 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.279
 laced well and one of the cheapest in mind 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.920
 a half dollar but the seller wrote 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.690
 here cable cable or whatever it is 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.210
 correctly read 1 dollar rated and 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.870
 here is the same screen 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.559
 protector 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:45.180
 1 dollar here on the idea of ​​the pieces let's 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:49.620
 open we'll see the video right away 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.239
 which is not particularly meaningful I am pure 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:57.510
 unpacking small packages 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:01:03.000
 This is what ordered more from the little things here 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:08.970
 so here we have so package course this 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.610
 I understand so gift some emblem or 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:17.189
 what is it gold sticker want sticker what 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:20.340
 then type of gold 24 carats ha ha funny yes 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.750
 know look if anyone is interested well 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.509
 that is, I don’t see the camera, I don’t see 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.869
 what's going on in the camera like an hour 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.490
 it says 24 carats like pen this 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.650
 it is surely not clear what it is 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.229
 such a souvenir 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.750
 nice so here we are in 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.640
 each of which is three films tanks 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.799
 also usually decided not to buy glass well 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:46.229
 Why are these types and so crown and glass + in 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.009
 meizu this is to glass that one 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:53.700
 titles so we have everything right 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:57.560
 It is our film for so 3 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.479
 napkins and films in theory so this is m1 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.850
 up for m1 but in my opinion not very 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.470
 poor quality and they are all about everything about 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:10.110
 Vinga camera and for speaker 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:13.800
 so here it is clear everything is fine so well 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:18.090
 the second we have for my meizu mx4 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.850
 about diana here opens well in 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:25.170
 principle not bent normally too 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:29.610
 here that he is not here completely that yes 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:32.820
 hand here rag squeezed okay rags 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:36.240
 especially that two three are not needed 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:44.100
 well everything is correct yes so here it is 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:46.560
 cant so seller nakosyachil okay no 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.120
 slits under the num button under the sensors this 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:54.990
 fingerprint also counts as for 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.360
 m10 seller well so kosyachny well in 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.320
 Basically kicks were worth a dollar on the floor 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.810
 my one thing 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.810
 I could not find a volume without a track either. 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.030
 cheap one that doesn't have to be paid 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.420
 for the track number is still only a nick and a half two 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:13.100
 the dollar and therefore the seller's expense do not know 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.330
 let's see how my mood will be if 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.989
 nothing will stick in that 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:23.430
 here still as he tried but should be 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:25.440
 so it will not be visible now spread now 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.750
 your evening, well, all the same glass 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.250
 scratched me already scratched so 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.580
 microscratches are therefore not particularly 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:38.430
 good there is a glass of this meizu mx4 front 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:41.430
 so here we have to idea or cable 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:45.090
 I just don’t know how long I ordered 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:49.080
 2 meters and 3 meters no-no-no-no-no 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:52.920
 Yusb cable arrived for samsung galaxy s 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.580
 5 yes if I remember there was a video 2 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.430
 galaxy cattle 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.690
 asked to buy a cable from u1 already dead 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.910
 on the same phone 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.590
 Well, in principle, on a fake these cable, they 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.900
 and they are also cheap in principle 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.600
 somewhere around I don’t know the link 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.299
 about 30 or 50 cents may slightly 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.390
 Has risen in price here this under samsungovsky 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:18.350
 this yusbi connector 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:21.049
 clumsy here put why here 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.010
 I screwed up there, it bent the contacts 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:27.260
 here here here inside if it will be seen 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.780
 here it is standard and ate contacts they 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.510
 bent inwards so its no longer like in 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.600
 previous frame and so you will not do 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:39.230
 immediately ordered two to one already in 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:43.040
 the stock was lying that person how would 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.900
 worth a penny here are the things guys 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.430
 so I do not know, I saw it turned out to 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.150
 this is clumsy something from one to another 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.800
 I jump over, in principle, I need to stay 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.410
 deal with these films because 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:59.810
 it’s not like the film 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:07.310
 principle, probably yes it is too narrow, I 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:11.210
 it can be seen here too narrow here 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:14.419
 Were on M1 already across hiding all right 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.710
 here they are m1 they are all means these were 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.190
 mx-4 pro 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.890
 he falls apparently mixed up okay 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:23.750
 something decide okay, let 's figure it out 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.700
 In principle, this money is big let's see 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.620
 I still have glue, then maybe 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.770
 I will forgive the seller 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.060
 video I think if it was interesting when 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.800
 there was nothing interesting but in 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.780
 Like this video and write 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.000
 comments subscribe to our group 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.340
 Well, I think probably all it ends 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.310
 unpacking two small package yet 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.720
 unpacked while waiting for the rest 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.530
