00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
we did start with CAD software which

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.710 
we did start with CAD software which
gives<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:25.920> leg<00:02:26.070> up<00:02:26.130> but<00:02:26.760> then<00:02:26.940> we<00:02:26.970> did<00:02:27.240> scan

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
gives you a leg up but then we did scan

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.300 
gives you a leg up but then we did scan
it<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:27.900> take<00:02:28.110> photos<00:02:28.320> as<00:02:28.590> well<00:02:28.740> and<00:02:29.010> in<00:02:29.100> fact

to get the lights right in the front the
back<00:02:31.470> which<00:02:31.740> are<00:02:31.860> extremely<00:02:31.980> complicated

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
back which are extremely complicated

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.110 
back which are extremely complicated
audi<00:02:33.780> actually<00:02:34.260> sent<00:02:34.530> us<00:02:34.710> lights<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.700> know<00:02:35.730> to

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120

like just lights so we now use them in

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.760 
like just lights so we now use them in
the<00:02:42.210> studio<00:02:42.570> to<00:02:42.660> show<00:02:43.020> when<00:02:43.260> our<00:02:43.380> build<00:02:43.590> is

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.530 
I don't know how that works so actually
there's<00:03:01.830> a<00:03:01.860> company<00:03:02.100> down<00:03:02.310> here<00:03:02.490> in<00:03:02.550> LA<00:03:02.820> that

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
there's a company down here in LA that

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.380 
there's a company down here in LA that
will<00:03:03.990> run<00:03:04.950> basically<00:03:05.310> little<00:03:05.640> lines<00:03:05.910> it's<00:03:06.240> a

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
will run basically little lines it's a

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.120 
will run basically little lines it's a
it's<00:03:06.600> an<00:03:06.720> adhesive<00:03:07.230> but<00:03:07.410> it's<00:03:07.560> not<00:03:07.710> very

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
it's an adhesive but it's not very

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.160 
it's an adhesive but it's not very
sticky<00:03:08.490> they<00:03:08.940> run<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:09.270> down<00:03:09.420> all<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.930> lines

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
sticky they run that down all the lines

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.360 
sticky they run that down all the lines
of<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.440> car<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:10.830> kind<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.100> a<00:03:11.160> grid<00:03:11.340> pattern

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
of the car and kind of a grid pattern

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.430 
of the car and kind of a grid pattern
and<00:03:11.910> then<00:03:12.390> they<00:03:12.480> have<00:03:12.570> a<00:03:12.600> laser<00:03:12.840> scanner<00:03:13.110> that

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
and then they have a laser scanner that

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.140 
and then they have a laser scanner that
picks<00:03:13.710> up<00:03:13.860> those<00:03:14.040> lines<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:14.670> turns<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:15.030> into

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
picks up those lines and turns it into

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.600 
picks up those lines and turns it into
tessellation<00:03:15.930> as<00:03:16.250> tessellations<00:03:17.250> basically

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
tessellation as tessellations basically

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.670 
tessellation as tessellations basically
little<00:03:17.790> triangles<00:03:18.300> that<00:03:18.360> we<00:03:18.510> use<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.900> recreate

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
little triangles that we use to recreate

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.620 
little triangles that we use to recreate
thanks<00:03:20.100> so<00:03:20.550> it<00:03:20.610> probably<00:03:20.790> takes<00:03:21.000> like<00:03:21.180> 15

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
thanks so it probably takes like 15

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.150 
thanks so it probably takes like 15
hours<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:21.989> put<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.230> stickers<00:03:22.530> on<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.709> like<00:03:22.950> 10

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
hours to put the stickers on it like 10

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.740 
hours to put the stickers on it like 10
minutes<00:03:23.340> is<00:03:23.550> just<00:03:23.580> skate<00:03:23.910> yeah<00:03:24.060> it's<00:03:24.420> exactly

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
minutes is just skate yeah it's exactly

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:33.270 
minutes is just skate yeah it's exactly
right<00:03:24.870> yeah<00:03:25.470> okay

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.130 

so<00:03:33.850> this<00:03:34.030> one<00:03:34.180> is<00:03:34.270> essentially<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.780> paddle

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
so this one is essentially the paddle

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.660 
so this one is essentially the paddle
shifter<00:03:35.470> car<00:03:35.680> although<00:03:35.860> I<00:03:36.010> still<00:03:36.160> think<00:03:36.610> you

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
shifter car although I still think you

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.840 
shifter car although I still think you
can<00:03:36.819> get<00:03:36.940> it<00:03:37.030> with<00:03:37.060> a<00:03:37.150> six-speed<00:03:37.660> man<00:03:38.610> so<00:03:39.610> you

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
can get it with a six-speed man so you

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.430 
can get it with a six-speed man so you
know<00:03:39.940> I'm<00:03:40.090> really<00:03:40.300> like<00:03:40.630> it's<00:03:41.020> a<00:03:41.050> very<00:03:41.260> meaty

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
know I'm really like it's a very meaty

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.199 
know I'm really like it's a very meaty
ship<00:03:41.770> feels<00:03:42.100> really<00:03:42.250> good<00:03:42.400> in<00:03:42.459> this<00:03:42.610> car<00:03:42.819> I'm

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
ship feels really good in this car I'm

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:44.520 
ship feels really good in this car I'm
gonna<00:03:43.360> jump<00:03:43.569> back<00:03:43.720> here<00:03:43.900> so<00:03:44.050> I<00:03:44.080> can<00:03:44.200> hear<00:03:44.350> you

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
gonna jump back here so I can hear you

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:59.190 
gonna jump back here so I can hear you
can<00:03:44.650> throw<00:03:44.770> a<00:03:44.830> few<00:03:44.980> ribs<00:03:45.250> at<00:03:45.430> it<00:03:57.900> yeah<00:03:58.900> they

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
can throw a few ribs at it yeah they

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.600 
can throw a few ribs at it yeah they
sound<00:03:59.350> good<00:03:59.560> I<00:03:59.770> kind<00:03:59.980> of<00:04:00.010> dig<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.459> white

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
sound good I kind of dig the white

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.860 
sound good I kind of dig the white
gauges<00:04:01.150> it's<00:04:01.360> kind<00:04:01.540> of<00:04:01.569> weird<00:04:01.750> because

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
gauges it's kind of weird because

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.720 
gauges it's kind of weird because
sometimes<00:04:02.230> white<00:04:02.440> gauges<00:04:02.890> you're<00:04:03.069> like<00:04:03.220> the

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
sometimes white gauges you're like the

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.370 
sometimes white gauges you're like the
reflection<00:04:04.270> of<00:04:04.330> the<00:04:04.390> white<00:04:04.630> you<00:04:05.260> know

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
reflection of the white you know

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.170 
reflection of the white you know
sometimes<00:04:05.980> it<00:04:06.130> gets<00:04:06.550> a<00:04:06.670> little<00:04:06.760> Sun

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
sometimes it gets a little Sun

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.360 
sometimes it gets a little Sun
reflection<00:04:08.050> or<00:04:08.200> you<00:04:08.260> can't<00:04:08.440> read<00:04:08.620> them<00:04:08.800> but<00:04:09.040> in

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
reflection or you can't read them but in

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.340 
reflection or you can't read them but in
this<00:04:09.489> car<00:04:09.700> looks<00:04:09.910> pretty<00:04:10.120> good<00:04:10.300> so<00:04:10.959> Dan<00:04:11.170> the
