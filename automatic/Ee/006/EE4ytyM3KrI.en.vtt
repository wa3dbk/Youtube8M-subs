sold on the Western BB Creams before
until<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.300> tried<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.629> SN<00:01:03.870> all<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.080> ones<00:01:04.260> I

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
until I tried to SN all the ones I

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.770 
until I tried to SN all the ones I
really<00:01:04.710> really<00:01:05.070> rate<00:01:05.250> them<00:01:05.489> I've<00:01:06.090> also<00:01:06.390> tried

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
really really rate them I've also tried

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.600 
really really rate them I've also tried
the<00:01:06.960> double<00:01:07.260> wet<00:01:07.380> one<00:01:07.530> which<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.830> really<00:01:08.430> like

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
to but I think that that's probably

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.980 
to but I think that that's probably
better<00:01:11.280> if<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.820> have<00:01:11.970> oily<00:01:12.330> skin<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.750> one's

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
better if you have oily skin this one's

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.899 
better if you have oily skin this one's
better<00:01:13.170> if<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.409> have<00:01:13.560> drier<00:01:13.799> skin<00:01:13.920> either<00:01:14.670> way

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
better if you have drier skin either way

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.640 
better if you have drier skin either way

the L'Oreal Lumi magique highlighter is
very<00:01:31.680> very<00:01:31.860> similar<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.220> wire<00:01:32.490> cells<00:01:32.759> to

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
very very similar to wire cells to

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.319 
very very similar to wire cells to
chakra<00:01:33.979> but<00:01:34.979> much<00:01:35.159> much<00:01:35.340> cheaper<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.090> just

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
chakra but much much cheaper and I just

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.120 
chakra but much much cheaper and I just
apply<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.659> under<00:01:37.110> my<00:01:37.200> eyes<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.860> kind<00:01:38.070> of

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
apply this under my eyes in a kind of

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.859 
apply this under my eyes in a kind of
triangle<00:01:38.700> shape<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.479> just<00:01:39.720> really

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
triangle shape and this just really

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.929 
triangle shape and this just really
helps<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.500> brighten<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.189> under<00:01:41.460> eye<00:01:41.520> area

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
mid-tone shimmery Brown I think it looks

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.090 
mid-tone shimmery Brown I think it looks
really<00:04:36.870> pretty<00:04:37.020> for<00:04:37.260> summer<00:04:37.500> it's<00:04:37.980> like<00:04:38.010> a

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
simple and quick and you don't need to

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.430 
simple and quick and you don't need to
faff<00:04:42.090> around<00:04:42.120> and<00:04:42.690> lots<00:04:42.840> of<00:04:42.930> blending<00:04:43.320> or

is called expresso that's the one thing

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.790 
is called expresso that's the one thing
I'm<00:04:51.420> not<00:04:51.570> sure<00:04:51.630> about<00:04:51.930> what<00:04:52.080> this<00:04:52.350> palette<00:04:52.680> is

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
I'm not sure about what this palette is

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.130 
I'm not sure about what this palette is
the<00:04:53.040> sexy<00:04:53.640> names<00:04:53.850> not<00:04:54.540> a<00:04:54.570> big<00:04:54.750> fan<00:04:54.930> of<00:04:54.960> those

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
the sexy names not a big fan of those

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.500 
the sexy names not a big fan of those
but<00:04:55.380> anyway<00:04:55.590> I<00:04:55.620> just<00:04:55.770> use<00:04:56.100> this<00:04:56.280> to<00:04:56.940> kind<00:04:57.420> of

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
but anyway I just use this to kind of

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.510 
but anyway I just use this to kind of
blend<00:04:57.720> it<00:04:57.930> just<00:04:58.110> right<00:04:58.410> up<00:04:58.650> above<00:04:59.040> my

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
blend it just right up above my

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.700 
blend it just right up above my
eyelashes<00:05:00.150> just<00:05:00.390> to<00:05:00.870> add<00:05:01.020> a<00:05:01.050> bit<00:05:01.260> of<00:05:01.350> depth<00:05:01.560> and

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
eyelashes just to add a bit of depth and

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.200 
eyelashes just to add a bit of depth and
then<00:05:01.860> I<00:05:01.890> take<00:05:02.100> a<00:05:02.220> little<00:05:02.250> bit<00:05:02.550> underneath<00:05:02.910> as

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
then I take a little bit underneath as

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.450 
then I take a little bit underneath as
well<00:05:03.410> instead<00:05:04.410> of<00:05:04.530> using<00:05:04.740> kind<00:05:05.070> of<00:05:05.160> a<00:05:05.220> full-on

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
well instead of using kind of a full-on

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.300 
well instead of using kind of a full-on
eyeliner<00:05:06.030> I<00:05:06.210> just<00:05:06.420> think<00:05:06.630> this<00:05:06.840> really<00:05:07.560> gives

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
eyeliner I just think this really gives

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.700 
eyeliner I just think this really gives
your<00:05:08.550> eyes<00:05:08.610> a<00:05:08.760> bit<00:05:09.030> of<00:05:09.090> definition<00:05:09.240> and<00:05:09.930> makes

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
your eyes a bit of definition and makes

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.170 
your eyes a bit of definition and makes
them<00:05:10.860> look<00:05:10.890> a<00:05:11.010> bit<00:05:11.130> bigger<00:05:11.340> as<00:05:11.550> well<00:05:11.700> after

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
them look a bit bigger as well after

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.760 
them look a bit bigger as well after
