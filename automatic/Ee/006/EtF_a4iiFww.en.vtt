and so he had a new ingenious way of

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.380 
and so he had a new ingenious way of
installing<00:00:17.670> his<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:19.109> machine<00:00:20.029> so<00:00:21.029> let's

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
installing his is a machine so let's

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.920 
installing his is a machine so let's
let's<00:00:21.689> take<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.900> look<00:00:22.109> at<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:23.660> what<00:00:24.660> he<00:00:24.750> does

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
let's take a look at the what he does

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.740 
let's take a look at the what he does
here<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.650> then<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:25.980> comes<00:00:26.250> up<00:00:26.430> from<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
here it is and then it comes up from the

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.919 
here it is and then it comes up from the
middle<00:00:27.960> well<00:00:28.890> if<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> four-hole<00:00:30.420> sink

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
middle well if this is a four-hole sink

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.150 
middle well if this is a four-hole sink
and<00:00:31.700> originally<00:00:32.700> we<00:00:32.880> had<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.980> soap<00:00:34.980> dispenser

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
and originally we had a soap dispenser

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.970 
and originally we had a soap dispenser
here<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.149> did<00:00:36.450> not<00:00:36.630> want<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.050> soap<00:00:37.290> well<00:00:37.680> we

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
here I did not want the soap well we

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.670 
here I did not want the soap well we
both<00:00:38.190> did<00:00:38.250> not<00:00:38.640> want<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.180> for<00:00:39.390> Spencer<00:00:39.899> and

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
both did not want it so for Spencer and

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.970 
both did not want it so for Spencer and
I<00:00:41.160> did<00:00:41.579> not<00:00:41.790> want<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.239> commit<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.050> nozzle<00:00:43.680> of

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
I did not want to commit the nozzle of

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.750 
I did not want to commit the nozzle of
our<00:00:45.379> sink<00:00:46.640> and<00:00:47.640> ah<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:49.500> very<00:00:49.710> nice<00:00:49.890> one<00:00:50.129> okay

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
our sink and ah the very nice one okay

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.490 
our sink and ah the very nice one okay
and<00:00:51.030> then<00:00:51.600> also<00:00:52.129> you<00:00:53.129> got<00:00:53.370> your<00:00:53.579> double<00:00:53.789> spray

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
and then also you got your double spray

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.680 
and then also you got your double spray
right<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.250> did<00:00:56.489> not<00:00:56.699> want<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.149> put<00:00:57.420> that

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
right and I did not want to put that

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.270 
right and I did not want to put that
diverter<00:00:58.309> on<00:00:59.309> the<00:01:00.120> sink<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.980> lose<00:01:01.980> that

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
diverter on the sink and lose that

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.080 
diverter on the sink and lose that
capability<00:01:03.199> here<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:05.100> came<00:01:05.580> up<00:01:05.760> with<00:01:05.790> an

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
capability here so I came up with an

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.920 
capability here so I came up with an
idea<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.930> putting<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.470> valve<00:01:07.770> right<00:01:08.310> here<00:01:08.930> just

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
idea of putting a valve right here just

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.399 
idea of putting a valve right here just
like<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:11.510> this<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.720> where<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.990> focus

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
like this this is where the focus

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.730 
like this this is where the focus
Spencer<00:01:13.890> was<00:01:14.100> at<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.960> allows<00:01:16.350> me<00:01:16.380> to

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
Spencer was at and this allows me to

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.780 
Spencer was at and this allows me to
turn<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.310> water<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.630> SD<00:01:19.259> 501<00:01:20.150> right

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
turn the water on to the SD 501 right

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.109 
turn the water on to the SD 501 right
okay<00:01:23.790> it's<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.180> quarter<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.659> our<00:01:25.259> turn<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:26.119> so

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
okay it's a quarter of our turn and so

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.819 
okay it's a quarter of our turn and so
whether<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.509> power<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.080> or<00:01:28.320> off<00:01:28.350> it's

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
whether the power is on or off it's

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.719 
whether the power is on or off it's
going<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.159> automatically<00:01:29.759> flow<00:01:30.329> through<00:01:30.659> yes

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
going to automatically flow through yes

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.350 
going to automatically flow through yes
and<00:01:32.729> run<00:01:33.060> through<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.270> Machine<00:01:34.579> and<00:01:35.579> then<00:01:36.240> I

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
and run through the Machine and then I

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.969 
and run through the Machine and then I
can<00:01:36.570> turn<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.470> turn<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:40.500> it's

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
can turn it on and turn it on and it's

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.969 
can turn it on and turn it on and it's
on<00:01:41.220> clean<00:01:41.520> water<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:42.710> then<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.860> can

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
on clean water and then you can

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.440 
on clean water and then you can
obviously<00:01:44.100> go<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.640> whatever<00:01:44.970> setting<00:01:45.420> you

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
obviously go to whatever setting you

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.819 
obviously go to whatever setting you
want<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.810> from<00:01:45.990> there<00:01:46.170> yeah<00:01:47.600> now<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:49.259> here

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
want to from there yeah now this here
