we're<00:01:33.860> out<00:01:34.040> full<00:01:34.540> this<00:01:35.540> would<00:01:35.780> really<00:01:35.990> show

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
we're out full this would really show

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.970 
we're out full this would really show
all<00:01:37.880> of<00:01:38.240> it<00:01:38.390> still<00:01:39.520> metal<00:01:40.520> flake<00:01:41.740> he's<00:01:42.740> got

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
all of it still metal flake he's got

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:54.490 
all of it still metal flake he's got
pearl<00:01:43.370> in<00:01:43.610> it<00:01:43.729> also

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.890 

this<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.920> interior<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.790> van<00:01:57.000> I'm

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
this is the interior of the van I'm

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.630 
this is the interior of the van I'm
taking<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.440> now<00:01:58.470> in<00:01:58.770> there<00:01:58.920> better<00:01:59.220> light

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
taking it now in there better light

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:36.759 
taking it now in there better light
condition<00:01:59.670> so<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.690> get<00:02:00.810> an<00:02:00.900> idea

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.199 

gives<00:02:37.769> you<00:02:37.890> an<00:02:37.950> idea<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.370> red<00:02:38.579> paint<00:02:38.879> here<00:02:39.180> and

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
gives you an idea the red paint here and

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.030 
gives you an idea the red paint here and
get<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:41.040> hood<00:02:41.310> here<00:02:41.640> so<00:02:41.909> that<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:43.560> then<00:02:43.739> it<00:02:43.860> so

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
get the hood here so that and then it so

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.420 
get the hood here so that and then it so
you<00:02:44.220> can<00:02:44.459> see<00:02:45.530> what<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.650> looks<00:02:46.829> like<00:02:47.069> with<00:02:47.310> the

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
you can see what it looks like with the

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.530 
you can see what it looks like with the
Sun<00:02:47.640> on<00:02:47.879> it<00:02:50.450> there<00:02:51.450> we<00:02:51.599> go

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
Sun on it there we go

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.890 
Sun on it there we go
see<00:02:54.540> there's<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.810> lot<00:02:55.109> of<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:56.510> lot<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.599> metallic

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
see there's a lot of a lot of metallic

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:40.700 
see there's a lot of a lot of metallic
in<00:02:58.230> there

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.670 

these<00:03:42.450> second<00:03:43.450> row<00:03:43.630> of<00:03:43.660> captains<00:03:44.110> chairs<00:03:44.200> come

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
these second row of captains chairs come

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.150 
these second row of captains chairs come
out<00:03:44.830> you<00:03:44.980> can<00:03:45.130> see<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.460> leader<00:03:45.700> right<00:03:45.940> there

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
out you can see the leader right there

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.840 
out you can see the leader right there
so<00:03:48.160> you<00:03:48.220> can<00:03:48.490> take<00:03:48.730> them<00:03:48.880> out<00:03:50.430> same<00:03:51.430> thing<00:03:51.460> with

so you can take them out same thing with
this<00:03:52.320> bench<00:03:53.320> seat<00:03:53.710> here

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
this bench seat here

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:06.020 
this bench seat here
becomes<00:03:54.640> a<00:03:54.940> bed<00:03:55.480> and<00:03:56.110> put<00:03:56.470> down<00:03:56.650> back<00:03:56.980> there

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.390 

it's<00:04:06.480> amazing<00:04:06.930> a<00:04:06.960> lot<00:04:07.020> a<00:04:07.140> little<00:04:07.320> light<00:04:07.560> can<00:04:08.250> do

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
it's amazing a lot a little light can do

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.450 
it's amazing a lot a little light can do
for<00:04:08.790> photography<00:04:12.380> there's<00:04:13.380> a<00:04:13.470> CB<00:04:14.130> there<00:04:14.430> I

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
for photography there's a CB there I

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
for photography there's a CB there I
just<00:04:14.580> put<00:04:14.940> that<00:04:15.120> in<00:04:15.300> a<00:04:16.250> ball<00:04:19.760> that<00:04:20.760> contain<00:04:21.209> was

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
just put that in a ball that contain was

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.670 
just put that in a ball that contain was
meant<00:04:21.780> for<00:04:21.870> I<00:04:22.079> think<00:04:22.710> a<00:04:23.220> cat<00:04:24.320> but<00:04:25.320> it<00:04:25.470> works

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
meant for I think a cat but it works

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:36.120 
meant for I think a cat but it works
well<00:04:25.950> there<00:04:26.400> in<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.730> center

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.800 

and<00:04:37.200> here's<00:04:38.200> the<00:04:39.060> fuses<00:04:40.060> and<00:04:40.180> everything<00:04:40.570> for

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
and here's the fuses and everything for

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:47.960 
and here's the fuses and everything for
the<00:04:41.670> wiring<00:04:42.670> that<00:04:43.060> they<00:04:43.210> put<00:04:43.480> in<00:04:43.630> this<00:04:44.850> vehicle

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.520 

since<00:04:48.970> this<00:04:49.120> is<00:04:49.300> all<00:04:50.430> customized<00:04:52.320> there<00:04:53.320> the

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
since this is all customized there the

00:04:53.530 --> 00:05:01.150 
since this is all customized there the
fuse<00:04:53.740> is<00:04:53.950> there<00:04:54.190> for<00:04:54.400> that<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:55.120> circuits

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:19.560 

this<00:05:02.160> is<00:05:02.340> pretty<00:05:02.610> expensive<00:05:02.940> when<00:05:03.300> new

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.830 

that's<00:05:20.570> how<00:05:20.750> you<00:05:20.810> can<00:05:22.060> put<00:05:23.060> a<00:05:23.090> lot<00:05:23.300> of<00:05:23.420> stuff<00:05:23.630> in

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
that's how you can put a lot of stuff in

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.200 
that's how you can put a lot of stuff in
here<00:05:26.800> especially<00:05:27.800> sure<00:05:28.250> take<00:05:28.520> that<00:05:28.730> backseat
