 the athletes is playing alone he said 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.150
 even official so to make a small 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.570
 so formula how to put his radio 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.360
 with of course the html html parma code 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.650
 so on your blog on your retro on 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.840
 your radio on your forum reach there 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.270
 in fact just about everywhere as long as you 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.080
 can help me TV coding so poor 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.840
 so you go to the site 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.289
 radionomy you connect and you 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:39.239
 are you going to click on retro radio paul 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:39.660
 no less than it happened on the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.700
 site 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.530
 here the grid radio where you will see 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.809
 your radio your clicks and again that's it 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.469
 has arrived without the site here so there you 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.270
 go see the orange red rectangle 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:58.100
 but his parents the good ones what you 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.390
 clicked on customize the fun 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.430
 so you'll see that here there will be 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.480
 your player so me it is huge 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.890
 it's ugly 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:11.090
 so here you have selected small 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.580
 this is a beautiful little full rate 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:19.020
 on the other hand we will have to pause 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.650
 lazio of course not have the video and 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.409
 then 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.380
 finally you can put means we're going 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.479
 choose the background color so if you 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.520
 it's going to depend on your site 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.720
 you put there though in Ghana on me 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:41.700
 I put a little black finally a little noah 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:44.820
 noa you loppsi 5 except at the break 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.840
 and a text me for example I'm going 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.329
 choose a color a little flashy pink 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.119
 which will give a very good shot so 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:58.950
 that's what gives it so it's rather 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:01.680
 flash for a site for a site and 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.729
 then here of course select them the 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.700
 while doing something right click click 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.580
 to copy 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.440
 then you go to a forum 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.160
 so I'm going to pause the video alice 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.500
 it was therefore worthwhile leaving the site 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.290
 this the forum so it's forumactive will make 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.560
 that all value is 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.650
 really a nice forum that's what 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.060
 so we're going to connect so that's it 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.550
 connected so there when you can see 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.769
 the dregs to the radio so we will go on 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.140
 the admin panel so who gets 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:40.560
 find here 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:44.170
 So here we landed if it ensures 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.280
 excuse me yes I think it was turning 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.730
 not to say that I had a few small 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.010
 second thoughts 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.340
 so we go to the teeth crest see 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.780
 category under forums for me of course 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.549
 does me that depends one you can 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.500
 put everywhere as your site 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.709
 accept htm codes so you go 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.560
 click on where is what you put 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.829
 all in all there so there you me 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.200
 I have all the codes splm so is a 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.489
 as you can see here their voice the 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.940
 cob from my radio 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:16.000
 so I lift them up so we'll try 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.959
 to just go for a promise that otherwise 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.120
 it's really stupid 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:26.290
 so here it is here so you narrate in 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:29.920
 was therefore right to paste here 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:33.819
 recorded now we will see them again 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.889
 the forum here arrived on the forum on 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.489
 will go down and we'll see them on 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:40.930
 new pleasure of gliding that before 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.959
 they were good will see as you there 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.049
 was more that there was little noticed it 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.370
 will wait a bit and so here we are 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.349
 back with some small problems 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.700
 techniques that unfortunately even though 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.739
 there has not been a lot of time at 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.280
 laying bed so as you can see 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.810
 a beautiful color you so it goes 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.019
 automatically and I remove them and 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.180
 that we affix and it's good flash so 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:07.090

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.650
