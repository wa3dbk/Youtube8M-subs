00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.809

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.219
 with some tiny accessories that 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.930

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.930

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.199

 this sad father because the truth is 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.680
 which are very different from looking 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:57.170

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:33.140

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:14.370
 that there are these unemployed 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.620

 let's see here like this 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.590
 already 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.590
 and the other bracelet on the other hand 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.520
 It is total 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.660
 now 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.780
 well and then we have here these 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.320
 utensils that are the ones that carry 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.320

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.500
 so let's put it on hand 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.500

 here then seeing to see if any 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.630
 accessory of these little lazy 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.270
 I guessed when I could do it and I think 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.600
 is going to be this one of the yellow helmet 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.600
 we'll see 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.320
 i 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.409
 and if in the yellow helmet 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:07.100
 let's go deep, well let's go 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.990
 seeing what he brings as always equal 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:14.490
 that in the other 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:18.120
 the models that come in this series 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:23.330
 the series 5 and the one that we are going to assemble is going to 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.330
 If this is so you go 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.760
 first we start here for this 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:34.850
 part 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.850
 and we put it to the legs 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:42.660
 here we cojemos 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:45.270
 this part of top and I always lame 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.710
 first after the arm 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.710
 let's put them on 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.290
 here 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.960
 here 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.960
 and now we fit her head 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.389
 today 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:09.819
 then he has stayed 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:13.230
 good and now let's put the 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:16.470
 Mask that goes before the wig 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:20.010
 which I think would be like that if we have to 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.960
 make it look like it fits here we have it 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:26.190
 We are going to do that afternoon here in both 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.990
 sides and now we put you carefully 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:32.070
 so that we do not miss the part of the 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:36.450
 mask for the wig 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:41.030
 now we put your money hat and 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.030
 it would be on and we would miss 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:47.240
 the handkerchief that is this 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.270
 Now we put on the gloves, which is what 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.760
 what would we have left 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.180
 we fit them first for the part of 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.180
 hand 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:59.740
 you see first this part and we do 

00:05:57.749 --> 00:06:02.800
 click 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:05.310
 and I would have them already and now what 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.720
 what we would lack would be this utensil 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:14.030

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:18.070

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.070

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:23.349
