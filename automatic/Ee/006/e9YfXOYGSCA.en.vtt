00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.930
 get ready 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.930
 it is now 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.080
 we have a 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.080
 we want to know 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.310
 with doc and prepare everyone is time 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.780
 prepare to buy with the station 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.780
 space in 32 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.960
 one 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.570
 we fit well but one of the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.030
 rockets hit the edge of the 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.490
 station I think I'll have to go out to 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.770
 walk through space to fix it 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.820
 everything comes and we will leave 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.820
 explore the station 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:21.840
 5 care 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.399
 camila I feel I can not help it with 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.399
 then 1 here 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.770
 it is difficult 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.560
 valentina or la gavi what a pleasure to meet you 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.259
 at last they should be your friends 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.840
 docking boy and anabel with the valentina 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.760
 that I would wave up head but not 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.210
 I understand how it floats 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:54.210
 I will tell you the secret use the walls 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.720
 roof or the floor to push yourself with 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.720
 watch out 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.250
 and to mobilize the hands very windy 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.899
 here you learn fast and if one gets stuck 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.289
 half of a room and can not 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.659
 push against anything what good question 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.730
 you know about gravity is a force 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:15.069
 invisible that attracts between larger 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.780
 something more serious has so in a 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.150
 planet as the earth has a lot 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.700
 gravity to attract us to it but here 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.750
 the gravity is very weak so 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.760
 they need something more to push them and 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.769
 when he pushed the pen she pushes me 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.319
 Clear turn that a pen is very 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.870
 small so it pushes me very little already 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:38.950
 I understood that if you throw something else 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.139
 big would go faster you guessed it then 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.709
 you wait to get to a wall and start 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.709
 again 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.980
 and this is fun when practiced 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.980
 more modern
