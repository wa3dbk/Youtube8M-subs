this<00:01:02.070> device<00:01:02.340> for<00:01:02.969> 24<00:01:03.420> days<00:01:03.449> much<00:01:04.199> like<00:01:04.379> a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
this device for 24 days much like a

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.679 
this device for 24 days much like a
device<00:01:04.739> that's<00:01:04.769> too<00:01:05.159> laggy<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.790> too<00:01:06.000> slow<00:01:06.299> all

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
device that's too laggy and too slow all

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.179 
device that's too laggy and too slow all
around<00:01:06.960> there's<00:01:07.170> devices<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.799> are<00:01:07.920> almost

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
around there's devices that are almost

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.190 
around there's devices that are almost
too<00:01:08.520> quick<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.000> be<00:01:09.119> functional<00:01:09.689> i<00:01:09.780> find<00:01:10.049> this

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
too quick to be functional i find this

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.810 
too quick to be functional i find this
one<00:01:10.409> i<00:01:10.439> knows<00:01:10.650> where<00:01:11.130> does<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.400> probably

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
one i knows where does that probably

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.640 
one i knows where does that probably
sounds<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.659> find<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.229> overall<00:01:13.500> this

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
sounds to you I find that overall this

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.260 
sounds to you I find that overall this
device<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.010> exceptionally<00:01:14.610> fast<00:01:14.790> all<00:01:15.030> around

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
device is exceptionally fast all around

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.910 
device is exceptionally fast all around
almost<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.780> point<00:01:15.990> where<00:01:16.259> when<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.830> do

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
almost to the point where when I do

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.499 
almost to the point where when I do
something<00:01:17.280> or<00:01:17.520> press<00:01:17.729> something<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.180> use<00:01:18.330> any

something or press something I use any

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.510 
something or press something I use any
sort<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.750> gesture<00:01:19.080> like<00:01:19.229> let's<00:01:19.710> say<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.490> know

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.070 
it's almost too fast I guess for lack of
a<00:01:26.970> better<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.180> can't<00:01:27.420> think<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.750> better<00:01:27.780> way

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
a better I can't think of a better way

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.630 
a better I can't think of a better way
to<00:01:28.110> explain<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.680> see<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.070> from<00:01:29.250> time<00:01:29.460> to

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
to explain and I see that from time to

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.130 
to explain and I see that from time to
time<00:01:29.670> when<00:01:30.000> I'm<00:01:30.090> loading<00:01:30.390> up<00:01:30.479> stuff<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.750> kind

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
time when I'm loading up stuff and kind

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.929 
time when I'm loading up stuff and kind
of<00:01:31.259> stutter<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.799> jump<00:01:32.100> back<00:01:32.250> into<00:01:32.460> action

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
of stutter and jump back into action

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.789 
of stutter and jump back into action
quicker<00:01:33.540> than<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.780> would<00:01:33.930> expect<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.530> and

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
quicker than I would expect it to and

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:35.870 
quicker than I would expect it to and
let<00:01:34.860> me<00:01:34.950> see<00:01:35.070> if<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.159> can<00:01:35.310> kind<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.520> get<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.729> to

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
let me see if I can kind of get it to

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.969 
let me see if I can kind of get it to
manipulate<00:01:36.360> itself<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.530> little<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.829> issue

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
manipulate itself a little the issue

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.530 
manipulate itself a little the issue
that<00:01:38.189> I've<00:01:38.280> been<00:01:38.400> having<00:01:38.759> seems<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.329> be<00:01:39.420> pretty

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
that I've been having seems to be pretty

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.670 
that I've been having seems to be pretty
quick<00:01:39.720> today<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.170> I'm<00:01:40.229> not<00:01:40.320> really<00:01:40.470> having

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
quick today and I'm not really having

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.920 
quick today and I'm not really having
any<00:01:40.829> huge<00:01:41.159> issues<00:01:41.520> but<00:01:41.729> it's<00:01:42.180> almost<00:01:42.360> too<00:01:42.630> fast

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
any huge issues but it's almost too fast

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.600 
any huge issues but it's almost too fast
so<00:01:43.110> much<00:01:43.290> like<00:01:43.470> from<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.710> UI<00:01:43.920> experience<00:01:44.520> is

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
so much like from a UI experience is

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.340 
so much like from a UI experience is
really<00:01:44.759> unpleasant<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.720> have<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:45.990> slow

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
really unpleasant to have it slow

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.170 
really unpleasant to have it slow
sometimes<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:47.040> find<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.520> speed<00:01:47.939> is

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
sometimes I find that the speed is

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.389 
sometimes I find that the speed is
causing<00:01:49.110> issues<00:01:49.259> as<00:01:49.680> well<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.340> that's

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
causing issues as well so that's

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.280 
causing issues as well so that's
something<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.970> keep<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.570> mind<00:01:51.630> overall<00:01:52.110> but

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
something to keep in mind overall but

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.660 
something to keep in mind overall but
employment<00:01:52.680> really<00:01:52.979> impressive<00:01:53.399> battery
