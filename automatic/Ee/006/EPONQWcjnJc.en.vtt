00:00:01.237 --> 00:00:08.377
 The Battle at Imperia Online 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:12.549
 Part I: The Composition of the Army 

00:00:14.432 --> 00:00:19.912
 Arriving at the mission site, the attacker's army is placed against that of the defender. 

00:00:20.072 --> 00:00:27.002
 Both armies are divided into three combat lines: First Line, Sagittarius and Artillery. 

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:34.639
 First Line and Sagittarius are divided into Center and Two Wings. 

00:00:35.428 --> 00:00:44.458
 Much of the soldiers form the First Line. All Range units are grouped there - Crawlers, Silesians and Pedestrians. 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:52.620
 In each battle 10% of these range units, taken proportionally from all units, are always placed in the Reserve. 

00:00:53.313 --> 00:00:57.773
 They will take part in the battle when some of the first line groups will be destroyed by the enemy. 

00:00:58.734 --> 00:01:07.144
 As it is understood the formation of armies divides the first line units as follows: 15% in each of the Wings and 60% in the Center. 

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:12.603
 To change these values, the player has to choose different formations before the battle. 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.109
 Formations are opened in the capital through research. 

00:01:17.273 --> 00:01:24.533
 They give the opportunity to change the ratio of soldiers between the Wing / Center and can be very useful, depending on the composition of the players' armies. 

00:01:25.199 --> 00:01:31.199
 To choose the best possible formation against a certain opponent, the player must spy on his enemy before the battle, 

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:34.129
 to put the composition of his army. 

00:01:35.054 --> 00:01:40.584
 Each type of military unit has priority on placement on the First Line according to its best performance. 

00:01:41.598 --> 00:01:49.708
 From the wing to the Center, the priority ranking of the units is: initially Cavalry, followed by the Silversmiths and finally - the Skadars. 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.680
 If the amount of soldiers is greater than the size of the devision, the positions will be changed. 

00:01:55.656 --> 00:01:58.176
 After the First Line is the Sagittarius. 

00:01:58.297 --> 00:02:00.437
 It is divided into Wing and Center. 

00:02:00.582 --> 00:02:05.422
 Sagittarius are equally divided between the three positions, without reserve. 

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:09.909
 Sagittarius positions also depend on the choice for Formation. 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:17.100
 For example, the Sagittarians on Wings will be suitable if the enemy does not have Knights on His Wings, but there are more Silent ones. 

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:22.208
 The spearheads are powerful on the wings but are affected by the Sagittarius. 

00:02:22.565 --> 00:02:27.625
 If they are scattered enough through the Wings, Sagittarius can easily destroy all the hostile Hedges. 

00:02:28.983 --> 00:02:36.643
 On the back of the army are placed surrounding machines - very effective against the soldiers, but the devastating perfect of the Horse. 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:44.590
 Land, General's abilities, colonial bonuses, and military research can affect the army's efficiency. 

00:02:45.523 --> 00:02:52.513
 In the chaos of war, however, one thing is even more important for the end of the battle than the power of the army - 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.720
 Morals of soldiers. 

00:02:54.795 --> 00:02:58.555
 The more damage the soldiers are suffering, the more Moral they lose. 

00:02:58.804 --> 00:03:05.324
 When its value falls below 50, then there is an upward chance for each next round of devaluation to be destroyed. 

00:03:05.674 --> 00:03:11.574
 Some of the soldiers may return after the battle, but many of them will eventually be defeated by the army. 

00:03:12.237 --> 00:03:19.327
 The attacker's morale may be fatal to his army, but he is irrelevant to the Garrison of the Defender. 

00:03:20.192 --> 00:03:26.202
 The soldiers in it are surrounded and can not leave, so they will fight gloriously until death. 

00:03:26.508 --> 00:03:30.888
 Continues to Part II
