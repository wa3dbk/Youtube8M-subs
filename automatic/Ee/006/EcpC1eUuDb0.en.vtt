00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.590
 Welcome to the most wanted 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.590
 challenge 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.169
 We're just going to go with their rows 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:33.309
 we tell you the parcours has 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:34.600
 borrowed challandes it is as fast as 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.090
 possible to get through the parcours 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.309
 but to touch the whole without a cap 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.050
 if a cap touches you that costs 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.730
 street customers then there is one 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.750
 brake point because you have to meet if 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.040
 We do not meet with again 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.040
 penalty seconds and so on 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.220
 rowling of perfect electronic arts 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.530
 the customers of electronic arts 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.940
 invited to a drift challenge 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.560
 locked safety railing where we 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.220
 definitely use tracks and also 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.220
 be further 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.980
 Dominik now has the chance here 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.090
 very big as passenger meets 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.750
 say you already have a bit of 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.060
 pants full 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.290
 I want to play but it is pigs 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.850
 Of course this is also about cool 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.230
 points and there are too water balance 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.600
 hung and the passenger must always 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.730
 try with his plate in this 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.290
 curve of that is the balloons too 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.290
 Get out of the way 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.660
 is it too much now that is too many days 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.370
 video games or even hornier or how 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.940
 he says the truth or sabine it 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.690
 screamed 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.500
 even the most relatively well everything 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.500
 just a good one still live 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:48.150
 This is a very good beat 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.150
 delicious as meat 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.000
 that was fun in any case 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.969
 but it gets pretty 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.390
 So shake my stomach point 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:22.090
 he would have swallows that on 100 of us 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:26.129
 are likely at least 40 liters of brunner 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.129
 I believe he is 50 60 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.410
 that's so fucking hot here 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.120
 even the tires are extra stressed 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.500
 they will not start while 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.270
 the ride to place and that's him 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.830
 happened several times would be very nice 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.220
 tire wear today why that's her 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.220
 because of it 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.780
 What should I say I am just me 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.220
 I've never done it, never 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.330
 pretend tried and there 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.310
 I'm damn bad I'm glad 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.450
 that someone else is driving yes I think so 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.099
 should I buckle up 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.099
 That's why I read 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.530
 for that can 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.430
 Why 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.320
 already painless on the stairs 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.470
 also in the off 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.200
 Europe 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.419
 honor the winners right here 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.469
 proclaim 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:09.080
 in second place with 37 6 points 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:13.199
 very close 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.849
 It is in English after the second 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.520
 the first place and that was one 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:19.919
 really tight affair with 37.3 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.080
 score is only 0-3 away 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:29.069
 second place on place number 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:31.080
 One is Hubertus as it may have 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:33.150
 also a little something that did you 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.370
 just a little bit need for speed most 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.750
 wanted goods in any case you have 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.310
 helped in any case, I guess 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.849
 the cars have taken less damage 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.849
 as a game
