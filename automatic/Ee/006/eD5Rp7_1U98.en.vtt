just<00:01:26.180> because<00:01:26.480> that<00:01:26.810> is<00:01:26.990> exactly<00:01:27.740> thirty<00:01:28.220> days

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
just because that is exactly thirty days

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.180 
just because that is exactly thirty days
after<00:01:29.120> it<00:01:29.330> comes<00:01:29.600> out<00:01:29.780> for<00:01:29.960> xbox<00:01:30.440> so<00:01:30.920> I<00:01:30.950> also
