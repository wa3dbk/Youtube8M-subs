 will impose your hands on our heads and we in the name of Christ 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.510

 in sherry with a little peace 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.919
 if you have to suffer 

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.919
 but Jesus is always with you 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.849
 estebanÃ© the others helped everyone in need 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:17.760
 so that 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.760
 the word of Christ was announced that also with works 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:25.109
 They were sometimes discussed with members of the synagogue 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:27.849
 and ends up wearing his enemies 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.149
 he was arrested 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:33.599
 and one of his judges was precisely to know him who later by grace 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.009
 of the Lord would be Paul the Apostle with Belgium 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:43.720
 the province to see the controversial issues 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.350
 I've heard him say that Jesus the crucified is the son of God 

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:51.909
 the jungle is true and with their words they offend our religion 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:55.069

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.050
 rosebush who has joined 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.239

 Maybe one day you will understand what is the love of God 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.680
 take it to court 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.680
 For me, death is the condemnation it deserves 

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:24.209
 as christ 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.209
 esteban is a poor and helpless lamb 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:30.119
 who offered himself to god 

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:32.719
 suffering martyrdom 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:35.719
 is the first of the others who offered their lives 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.299
 without hesitation a moment 

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:45.989
