to you about how to use light meters now

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.310 
to you about how to use light meters now
there<00:00:09.330> are<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.450> lot<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.630> different<00:00:09.960> kinds<00:00:10.230> of

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
there are a lot of different kinds of

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.959 
there are a lot of different kinds of
light<00:00:10.440> meters<00:00:10.740> out<00:00:10.920> there<00:00:11.190> it's<00:00:11.610> gonna<00:00:11.849> be

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
light meters out there it's gonna be

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.189 
light meters out there it's gonna be
basically<00:00:13.580> trying<00:00:14.580> each<00:00:15.179> one<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.630> them<00:00:15.780> out<00:00:15.960> at

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
basically trying each one of them out at

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.750 
basically trying each one of them out at
the<00:00:16.289> store<00:00:16.590> maybe<00:00:16.980> borrowing<00:00:17.430> them<00:00:17.520> from<00:00:17.670> your

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
the store maybe borrowing them from your

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.279 
the store maybe borrowing them from your
friends<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.210> find<00:00:18.420> out<00:00:18.570> which<00:00:18.750> one<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.109> like

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
friends to find out which one you like

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.230 
friends to find out which one you like
best<00:00:19.560> although<00:00:19.949> they<00:00:20.130> all<00:00:20.250> have<00:00:20.490> basically

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
best although they all have basically

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.310 
best although they all have basically
the<00:00:21.990> same<00:00:22.199> idea<00:00:22.560> behind<00:00:23.100> them<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:24.230> when<00:00:25.230> you

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
the same idea behind them you when you

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.990 
the same idea behind them you when you
get<00:00:25.439> your<00:00:25.619> light<00:00:25.769> meter<00:00:25.980> you're<00:00:26.519> gonna<00:00:26.670> turn

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
get your light meter you're gonna turn

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.670 
get your light meter you're gonna turn
it<00:00:27.119> on<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.750> you're<00:00:27.900> going<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.050> be<00:00:28.170> able<00:00:28.500> to

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
it on and you're going to be able to

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.179 
it on and you're going to be able to
change<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.910> ISO<00:00:30.539> that's<00:00:31.230> your<00:00:31.439> film<00:00:31.650> speed<00:00:31.949> or

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
change the ISO that's your film speed or

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.150 
change the ISO that's your film speed or
even<00:00:32.790> now<00:00:33.360> that's<00:00:33.570> digital<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.230> still<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.860> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
even now that's digital it still is the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.130 
even now that's digital it still is the
equivalent<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.850> your<00:00:36.000> film<00:00:36.180> speed<00:00:36.510> usually

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
equivalent of your film speed usually

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.869 
equivalent of your film speed usually
there's<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.590> button<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.250> will<00:00:38.489> do<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.820> and

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
like this and or a spot meter as it

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.380 
like this and or a spot meter as it
sometimes<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.579> can<00:01:53.729> hold<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.060> up<00:01:54.149> and

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
sometimes is you can hold it up and

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.910 
sometimes is you can hold it up and
instead<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.930> detecting<00:01:55.470> what<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.710> light<00:01:55.890> is

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
instead of detecting what the light is

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.310 
instead of detecting what the light is
here<00:01:56.579> it's<00:01:57.180> detecting<00:01:57.869> what<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.110> light<00:01:58.290> is

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
here it's detecting what the light is

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.010 
here it's detecting what the light is
where<00:01:58.890> you're<00:01:59.040> looking<00:01:59.219> some<00:02:00.149> light<00:02:00.689> meters

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
where you're looking some light meters

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.109 
where you're looking some light meters
have<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.860> scope<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.340> can<00:02:02.520> look<00:02:02.670> through<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.060> you

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
have a scope you can look through so you

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.240 
have a scope you can look through so you
can<00:02:03.270> aim<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.479> more<00:02:03.780> directly<00:02:04.320> this<00:02:04.530> one<00:02:04.770> does

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
can aim it more directly this one does

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.080 
can aim it more directly this one does
not<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.790> course

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
not of course

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.529 
not of course
then<00:02:07.509> through<00:02:08.440> using<00:02:08.759> your<00:02:09.759> light<00:02:10.000> meter<00:02:10.179> you

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
then through using your light meter you

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.140 
then through using your light meter you
will<00:02:10.660> know<00:02:10.840> exactly<00:02:11.140> what<00:02:11.709> exposure<00:02:12.489> you<00:02:13.000> need

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
will know exactly what exposure you need

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.479 
will know exactly what exposure you need
to<00:02:13.239> set<00:02:13.450> your<00:02:13.629> camera<00:02:14.050> to<00:02:14.080> all<00:02:14.769> the<00:02:15.129> settings

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
to set your camera to all the settings

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.000 
to set your camera to all the settings
it<00:02:15.849> makes<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.450> job<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.660> lot<00:02:16.959> easier<00:02:17.019> you<00:02:17.830> now

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
it makes the job a lot easier you now

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.619 
it makes the job a lot easier you now
know<00:02:18.220> what<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.670> need<00:02:18.819> your<00:02:18.940> f-stop<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.510> be

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
know what you need your f-stop to be

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.030 
know what you need your f-stop to be
what<00:02:19.810> you<00:02:19.900> need<00:02:20.019> your<00:02:20.140> shutter<00:02:20.349> speed<00:02:20.709> to<00:02:20.739> be

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
what you need your shutter speed to be

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.680 
what you need your shutter speed to be
and<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.760> make<00:02:21.940> sure<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.150> everything<00:02:22.569> is

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
and to make sure that everything is

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.330 
and to make sure that everything is
evenly<00:02:22.989> lit<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.560> that's<00:02:23.980> how<00:02:24.129> you<00:02:24.190> use<00:02:24.310> a

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
evenly lit and that's how you use a

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.549 
evenly lit and that's how you use a
light<00:02:24.519> meter
