00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
and all that kind of stuff so you you

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:13.879 
and all that kind of stuff so you you
would<00:05:12.060> use<00:05:12.210> everything<00:05:12.599> in<00:05:12.900> your<00:05:13.020> arsenal<00:05:13.620> to

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
would use everything in your arsenal to

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.439 
would use everything in your arsenal to
keep<00:05:14.729> them<00:05:15.000> dumb<00:05:15.870> and<00:05:16.470> supered<00:05:17.250> so<00:05:17.729> I<00:05:17.760> would

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
keep them dumb and supered so I would

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:20.300 
keep them dumb and supered so I would
the<00:05:18.599> jet<00:05:18.810> planes<00:05:19.139> and<00:05:19.500> be<00:05:19.650> carrying<00:05:20.070> it<00:05:20.220> and

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
the jet planes and be carrying it and

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.240 
the jet planes and be carrying it and
their<00:05:20.460> fuel<00:05:21.229> it<00:05:22.229> could<00:05:22.440> be<00:05:22.560> in<00:05:22.680> the<00:05:22.800> fuel<00:05:23.099> and

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
their fuel it could be in the fuel and

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.920 
their fuel it could be in the fuel and
it<00:05:23.340> could<00:05:23.520> be<00:05:23.639> an<00:05:23.760> extra<00:05:24.120> tank<00:05:24.389> we<00:05:24.659> can<00:05:24.780> do

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
it could be an extra tank we can do

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:25.700 
it could be an extra tank we can do
divert<00:05:25.139> Road

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
divert Road

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.320 
divert Road
yeah<00:05:26.780> but<00:05:27.780> then<00:05:27.960> the<00:05:28.080> pilots<00:05:28.699> the<00:05:29.699> pilots<00:05:30.120> that

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
yeah but then the pilots the pilots that

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.020 
yeah but then the pilots the pilots that
are<00:05:30.479> flying<00:05:30.720> these<00:05:31.050> planes<00:05:31.669> they<00:05:32.669> have<00:05:32.849> to

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
are flying these planes they have to

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.210 
are flying these planes they have to
know<00:05:33.180> that<00:05:33.419> there's<00:05:33.599> an<00:05:33.780> extra<00:05:34.139> tank<00:05:34.380> on<00:05:34.650> it<00:05:34.919> oh

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
know that there's an extra tank on it oh

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.219 
know that there's an extra tank on it oh
they<00:05:36.030> did<00:05:36.270> you<00:05:36.419> know<00:05:36.599> what<00:05:36.750> they're<00:05:36.870> doing

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
they did you know what they're doing

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:39.649 
they did you know what they're doing
because<00:05:37.440> the<00:05:38.190> G<00:05:38.699> at<00:05:38.880> the<00:05:39.030> recommendation

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:39.659 
because the G at the recommendation

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:41.420 
because the G at the recommendation
aircraft<00:05:40.139> they<00:05:40.349> wouldn't<00:05:40.590> be<00:05:40.710> doing<00:05:40.949> zigzag

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
aircraft they wouldn't be doing zigzag

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.500 
aircraft they wouldn't be doing zigzag

miss<00:05:48.270> no<00:05:48.419> but<00:05:48.570> I<00:05:48.659> was<00:05:48.840> thinking<00:05:49.229> of<00:05:49.349> the

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
miss no but I was thinking of the

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.879 
miss no but I was thinking of the
military<00:05:50.220> plane<00:05:50.580> oh<00:05:51.030> yeah<00:05:51.630> they<00:05:52.470> know<00:05:52.770> what

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
military plane oh yeah they know what

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:55.520 
military plane oh yeah they know what
they're<00:05:53.039> doing<00:05:53.539> and<00:05:54.539> I<00:05:54.870> think<00:05:55.110> it's<00:05:55.259> foreign

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
they're doing and I think it's foreign

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.129 
they're doing and I think it's foreign
pilots<00:05:55.889> that<00:05:56.340> will<00:05:56.520> spray<00:05:56.820> and<00:05:57.120> over<00:05:57.630> Canada

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 
pilots that will spray and over Canada

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.100 
pilots that will spray and over Canada
in<00:05:58.259> the<00:05:58.289> US<00:05:58.680> and<00:05:59.039> the<00:05:59.729> deal<00:05:59.940> is<00:05:59.969> that<00:06:00.479> our

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
in the US and the deal is that our

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.010 
in the US and the deal is that our
pilots<00:06:01.650> will<00:06:01.830> be

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
pilots will be

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.830 
pilots will be
their<00:06:02.380> spring<00:06:02.770> their<00:06:03.040> countries<00:06:03.580> I<00:06:03.820> came<00:06:04.720> to

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
their spring their countries I came to

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.360 
their spring their countries I came to
like<00:06:04.990> a<00:06:05.020> doctor<00:06:05.740> strangelove<00:06:06.400> policies<00:06:08.370> you

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
like a doctor strangelove policies you

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.910 
like a doctor strangelove policies you
see<00:06:09.400> yeah<00:06:09.970> and<00:06:10.330> that<00:06:11.170> makes<00:06:11.320> perfect<00:06:11.590> sense

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:11.920 
see yeah and that makes perfect sense

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.770 
see yeah and that makes perfect sense
but<00:06:12.370> no<00:06:12.520> it's<00:06:12.700> not<00:06:12.820> commercial<00:06:13.120> aircraft

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780 
but no it's not commercial aircraft

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.690 
but no it's not commercial aircraft
because<00:06:14.200> you<00:06:14.950> can<00:06:15.100> actually<00:06:15.400> see<00:06:15.580> the

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:15.700 
because you can actually see the

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.340 
because you can actually see the
commercial<00:06:16.180> aircraft<00:06:16.600> with<00:06:16.900> the<00:06:16.990> usual

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.350 
commercial aircraft with the usual

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.580 
commercial aircraft with the usual
contrail<00:06:17.920> yeah<00:06:18.420> disappearing<00:06:19.420> about<00:06:20.200> a<00:06:20.230> fruit

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 
contrail yeah disappearing about a fruit

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.920 
contrail yeah disappearing about a fruit
after<00:06:21.070> and<00:06:21.340> they're<00:06:21.520> flying<00:06:21.850> very<00:06:22.360> very<00:06:22.690> off

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
after and they're flying very very off

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.080 
after and they're flying very very off
yeah<00:06:23.470> and<00:06:23.710> they're<00:06:23.830> flying<00:06:24.070> very<00:06:24.460> very<00:06:24.790> high

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
yeah and they're flying very very high

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.320 
yeah and they're flying very very high
yes<00:06:25.750> and<00:06:25.990> in<00:06:26.080> a<00:06:26.380> straight<00:06:26.650> line<00:06:26.790> for<00:06:27.790> these

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
yes and in a straight line for these

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.680 
yes and in a straight line for these
guys<00:06:28.560> do<00:06:29.560> you<00:06:30.220> see<00:06:30.430> checkerboard<00:06:31.120> patterns

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.690 
guys do you see checkerboard patterns

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:36.030 
guys do you see checkerboard patterns
I've<00:06:32.680> seen<00:06:32.950> them<00:06:33.100> do<00:06:33.310> u-turns<00:06:34.320> as<00:06:35.320> well<00:06:35.620> and

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.040 
I've seen them do u-turns as well and

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.790 
I've seen them do u-turns as well and
the<00:06:36.880> stuff<00:06:37.120> that<00:06:37.300> they<00:06:37.420> lay<00:06:37.600> down<00:06:37.870> forms<00:06:38.650> these

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
the stuff that they lay down forms these

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.180 
the stuff that they lay down forms these
odd-looking<00:06:39.210> polymer<00:06:40.210> clouds<00:06:40.710> now<00:06:41.710> we<00:06:41.770> know

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:42.190 
odd-looking polymer clouds now we know

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:43.800 
odd-looking polymer clouds now we know
that<00:06:42.220> the<00:06:42.490> polymer<00:06:43.030> and<00:06:43.240> that's<00:06:43.390> what<00:06:43.570> gives

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:43.810 
that the polymer and that's what gives

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.720 
that the polymer and that's what gives

health system of course because it had
all<00:07:34.000> the<00:07:34.150> data<00:07:34.330> of<00:07:34.690> how<00:07:34.720> many<00:07:35.050> people<00:07:35.410> had

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:35.560 
all the data of how many people had

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.690 
all the data of how many people had
asked<00:07:35.890> marled<00:07:36.280> effects<00:07:37.000> etc<00:07:37.210> sure<00:07:38.190> so<00:07:39.190> all<00:07:39.370> the

asked marled effects etc sure so all the
testing<00:07:40.180> has<00:07:40.330> been<00:07:40.540> done<00:07:40.600> and<00:07:44.070> they're

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:45.070 
testing has been done and they're

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:48.860 
testing has been done and they're
they're<00:07:45.940> doing<00:07:46.090> it<00:07:46.240> for<00:07:46.390> real<00:07:46.540> now<00:07:46.810> you<00:07:47.110> know

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:48.870 
they're doing it for real now you know

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:52.710 
they're doing it for real now you know
I'm<00:07:49.870> sure<00:07:49.900> it<00:07:50.170> also<00:07:50.860> weakened<00:07:51.430> immune<00:07:52.180> system

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:52.720 
I'm sure it also weakened immune system

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.050 
I'm sure it also weakened immune system
we<00:07:53.410> know<00:07:53.680> for<00:07:54.070> sure<00:07:54.100> that<00:07:54.280> there<00:07:54.700> is<00:07:54.790> there's

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:55.060 
we know for sure that there is there's

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:59.040 
we know for sure that there is there's
some<00:07:55.330> aluminum<00:07:55.870> oxide<00:07:56.350> in<00:07:56.590> it<00:07:56.740> and<00:07:57.420> very<00:07:58.420> um

00:07:59.040 --> 00:07:59.050 
some aluminum oxide in it and very um

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:02.400 
some aluminum oxide in it and very um
barium<00:07:59.680> and<00:08:00.300> now<00:08:01.300> what<00:08:01.540> is<00:08:01.660> the<00:08:01.900> aluminum

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:02.410 
barium and now what is the aluminum

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:05.250 
barium and now what is the aluminum
oxide<00:08:02.850> aluminum<00:08:03.850> Knox<00:08:04.060> oxide<00:08:04.630> there's<00:08:04.930> a<00:08:05.020> few
