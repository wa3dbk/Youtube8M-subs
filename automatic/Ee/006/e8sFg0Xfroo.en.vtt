00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
game and it's an ascent 240sx as you can

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.349 
game and it's an ascent 240sx as you can
see<00:01:11.720> i<00:01:12.200> have<00:01:12.530> tuned<00:01:13.009> it<00:01:13.159> I've<00:01:13.340> tuned<00:01:13.670> it<00:01:13.820> in<00:01:14.210> a

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:14.359 
see i have tuned it I've tuned it in a

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:16.620 
see i have tuned it I've tuned it in a
way<00:01:14.539> that<00:01:14.570> I<00:01:14.780> think<00:01:14.869> is<00:01:15.439> good<00:01:15.859> for<00:01:16.189> drifting

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
way that I think is good for drifting

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.630 
way that I think is good for drifting
again<00:01:17.630> this<00:01:18.020> is<00:01:18.200> just<00:01:18.320> say<00:01:18.530> a<00:01:18.770> normal<00:01:19.219> setup<00:01:19.429> or

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
again this is just say a normal setup or

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.270 
again this is just say a normal setup or
whatever<00:01:19.880> or<00:01:20.090> a<00:01:20.119> noob<00:01:20.479> setup<00:01:20.950> but<00:01:21.950> from

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
whatever or a noob setup but from

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.410 
whatever or a noob setup but from
whatever<00:01:22.490> experience<00:01:23.060> I've<00:01:23.149> had<00:01:23.179> with

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
whatever experience I've had with

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.789 
whatever experience I've had with
drifting<00:01:23.719> in<00:01:23.840> from<00:01:23.869> whatever<00:01:24.170> experience<00:01:24.740> I

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
drifting in from whatever experience I

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.789 
drifting in from whatever experience I
know<00:01:24.909> you<00:01:25.909> know<00:01:26.030> pretty<00:01:26.240> much<00:01:26.710> you<00:01:27.710> know

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
know you know pretty much you know

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.880 
know you know pretty much you know
tuning<00:01:28.369> cars<00:01:28.789> for<00:01:29.210> drifting<00:01:29.569> you<00:01:30.409> know<00:01:30.530> I<00:01:30.560> used

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
tuning cars for drifting you know I used

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.630 
tuning cars for drifting you know I used
that<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:31.640> sort<00:01:31.880> of<00:01:32.590> tune<00:01:33.590> this<00:01:33.770> so<00:01:34.219> it's<00:01:34.520> not

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
that to sort of tune this so it's not

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.760 
that to sort of tune this so it's not
that<00:01:34.700> bad<00:01:34.969> I'm<00:01:35.450> still<00:01:36.079> learning<00:01:36.200> how<00:01:36.439> to<00:01:36.499> drift

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
that bad I'm still learning how to drift

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.559 
that bad I'm still learning how to drift
so<00:01:37.249> i'm<00:01:37.490> guessing<00:01:37.639> the<00:01:37.819> carrot<00:01:38.119> setup<00:01:38.389> is

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
so i'm guessing the carrot setup is

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:39.700 
so i'm guessing the carrot setup is
probably<00:01:38.960> a<00:01:39.049> little<00:01:39.139> bit<00:01:39.289> wrong<00:01:39.499> whatever

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
probably a little bit wrong whatever

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.319 
probably a little bit wrong whatever
whatever<00:01:39.979> but<00:01:40.789> i'm<00:01:40.850> not<00:01:40.909> going<00:01:40.969> to<00:01:41.090> show<00:01:41.149> you

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
whatever but i'm not going to show you

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.029 
whatever but i'm not going to show you
to<00:01:41.509> you<00:01:41.600> guys<00:01:41.749> now<00:01:41.899> because<00:01:42.229> i<00:01:42.469> don't<00:01:42.859> want<00:01:42.889> you

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039

guys to copy this settle because it's

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.220

hey<00:02:05.100> I'm<00:02:05.220> learning<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.550> drift<00:02:05.790> as<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.150> can<00:02:06.300> see

the<00:02:20.600> hard<00:02:20.750> way<00:02:20.870> it<00:02:20.930> is<00:02:22.270> it's<00:02:23.270> like<00:02:23.390> even

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
the hard way it is it's like even

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.820 
the hard way it is it's like even
controlling<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.110> slide<00:02:24.350> it's<00:02:24.530> sort<00:02:24.740> of

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
controlling the slide it's sort of

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.030 
controlling the slide it's sort of
getting<00:02:25.490> to<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:26.870> catch<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.320> slide<00:02:27.560> before<00:02:27.770> it

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
getting to to catch the slide before it

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.900 
getting to to catch the slide before it
goes<00:02:28.160> out<00:02:28.310> of<00:02:28.370> control<00:02:28.490> you<00:02:29.060> know<00:02:30.790> that's<00:02:31.790> what

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
goes out of control you know that's what

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.320 
goes out of control you know that's what
I<00:02:31.970> have<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:32.150> mess<00:02:32.300> around<00:02:32.420> with<00:02:32.660> a<00:02:32.690> little<00:02:32.960> bit

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
I have to mess around with a little bit

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.140 
I have to mess around with a little bit
hit<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.420> right<00:02:35.480> over<00:02:35.690> tomorrow<00:02:35.900> there<00:02:36.320> you<00:02:36.470> go

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
hit the right over tomorrow there you go

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.000 
hit the right over tomorrow there you go
so<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.540> have<00:02:38.840> a<00:02:38.870> mess<00:02:39.170> around<00:02:39.290> yesterday<00:02:39.590> I've

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
so I have a mess around yesterday I've

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.010 
so I have a mess around yesterday I've
been<00:02:40.160> drifting<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:40.970> little<00:02:41.000> bit<00:02:41.300> and<00:02:43.390> I've<00:02:44.390> sort

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
been drifting a little bit and I've sort

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.750 
been drifting a little bit and I've sort
of<00:02:45.140> gotten<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.710> hang<00:02:45.950> of<00:02:46.070> this<00:02:46.190> now<00:02:46.250> this<00:02:46.580> is

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
of gotten the hang of this now this is

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.290 
of gotten the hang of this now this is
actually<00:02:47.300> a<00:02:47.600> lot<00:02:48.050> faster<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.550> care<00:02:49.790> now<00:02:50.030> that

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
actually a lot faster the care now that

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.760 
actually a lot faster the care now that
I<00:02:50.330> dunno<00:02:50.900> that<00:02:51.080> I've<00:02:51.170> to<00:02:51.290> knit<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:51.500> little<00:02:51.680> bit

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
I dunno that I've to knit a little bit

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.920 
I dunno that I've to knit a little bit
more<00:02:53.410> but<00:02:54.910> I'll<00:02:55.910> sort<00:02:56.180> of<00:02:56.270> get<00:02:56.390> used<00:02:56.420> to<00:02:56.690> it<00:02:56.810> and

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
more but I'll sort of get used to it and

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.100 
more but I'll sort of get used to it and
I'll<00:02:57.230> see<00:02:57.260> what<00:02:57.560> what<00:02:57.980> I<00:02:58.010> can<00:02:58.190> do<00:02:58.280> with<00:02:58.310> it

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
I'll see what what I can do with it

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:09.920 
I'll see what what I can do with it
let's<00:03:00.110> go<00:03:00.230> in<00:03:00.380> and<00:03:00.530> out<00:03:00.560> of<00:03:00.710> this<00:03:00.830> hunger<00:03:01.700> thing

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.229 

there<00:03:10.560> you<00:03:10.620> go<00:03:10.739> see<00:03:11.129> I'm<00:03:11.640> getting<00:03:11.849> the<00:03:12.000> hang<00:03:12.120> of

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
there you go see I'm getting the hang of

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.050 
there you go see I'm getting the hang of
drifting<00:03:12.629> it's<00:03:12.840> not<00:03:12.989> that<00:03:13.049> hard<00:03:13.319> I<00:03:14.310> just<00:03:14.939> need

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
drifting it's not that hard I just need

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.369 
drifting it's not that hard I just need
to<00:03:15.090> learn<00:03:15.299> how<00:03:15.359> to<00:03:15.629> control<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.170> care<00:03:16.349> a

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
to learn how to control the care a

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.959 
to learn how to control the care a
little<00:03:16.500> bit<00:03:16.590> better<00:03:17.629> and<00:03:19.250> when<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.370> catch<00:03:20.579> the

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:20.969 
little bit better and when to catch the

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:23.420 
little bit better and when to catch the
drift<00:03:21.840> so<00:03:22.109> I<00:03:22.140> can<00:03:22.379> sort<00:03:22.620> of<00:03:22.709> keep<00:03:22.769> it<00:03:23.099> going<00:03:23.370> for

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
drift so I can sort of keep it going for

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.160 
drift so I can sort of keep it going for
much<00:03:23.879> much<00:03:24.090> longer<00:03:24.120> I've<00:03:24.840> also<00:03:25.019> been

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
much much longer I've also been

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.750 
much much longer I've also been
practicing<00:03:25.590> on<00:03:25.680> actual<00:03:25.980> tracks<00:03:26.340> not<00:03:26.549> just

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
practicing on actual tracks not just

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.459 
practicing on actual tracks not just
this<00:03:26.909> airfield<00:03:27.480> thing<00:03:27.750> because<00:03:28.079> of<00:03:28.290> course

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:28.469 
this airfield thing because of course

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:33.470 
this airfield thing because of course
this<00:03:28.620> is<00:03:28.769> just<00:03:28.799> a<00:03:29.099> little<00:03:29.250> bit<00:03:29.400> easier<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:32.480> to

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
this is just a little bit easier to to

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:40.580 
this is just a little bit easier to to
mess<00:03:33.629> around<00:03:33.750> on<00:03:34.019> but<00:03:38.780> it's<00:03:39.780> really<00:03:40.079> fun<00:03:40.260> I<00:03:40.439> am

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
mess around on but it's really fun I am

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.440 
mess around on but it's really fun I am
enjoying<00:03:40.889> this<00:03:41.040> game<00:03:41.219> a<00:03:41.280> lot<00:03:41.579> it's<00:03:41.849> so<00:03:42.239> much

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
enjoying this game a lot it's so much

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.270 
enjoying this game a lot it's so much
fun<00:03:42.659> I<00:03:42.720> didn't<00:03:43.049> think<00:03:43.109> I<00:03:43.260> was<00:03:43.349> gonna<00:03:43.530> well<00:03:44.250> I

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
fun I didn't think I was gonna well I

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.860 
fun I didn't think I was gonna well I
didn't<00:03:44.760> think<00:03:44.939> like<00:03:45.269> it<00:03:45.450> was<00:03:45.540> gonna<00:03:45.689> be<00:03:45.840> a

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
didn't think like it was gonna be a

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.690 
didn't think like it was gonna be a
really<00:03:46.560> good<00:03:46.739> game<00:03:46.919> to<00:03:47.099> learn<00:03:47.250> how<00:03:47.310> to<00:03:47.430> if<00:03:47.609> we

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
really good game to learn how to if we

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.309 
really good game to learn how to if we
can<00:03:47.849> play<00:03:48.239> but<00:03:48.780> I<00:03:50.599> never<00:03:51.599> thought<00:03:51.870> that<00:03:51.989> I<00:03:52.079> have

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
can play but I never thought that I have

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:58.330 
can play but I never thought that I have
so<00:03:52.530> much<00:03:52.620> fun<00:03:52.829> playing<00:03:52.889> this<00:03:53.129> game

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
driving around a little bit in this game

so<00:04:23.310> um<00:04:23.669> I<00:04:24.120> played<00:04:24.720> this<00:04:24.780> game<00:04:24.960> for<00:04:24.990> about<00:04:25.350> I

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
so um I played this game for about I

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.340 
so um I played this game for about I
would<00:04:25.680> say<00:04:25.770> about<00:04:26.400> five<00:04:26.669> hours<00:04:26.960> overall<00:04:27.960> like

would say about five hours overall like
I<00:04:28.470> got<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.740> game<00:04:28.919> and<00:04:29.160> then<00:04:30.030> well<00:04:30.600> I<00:04:30.810> wouldn't

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
say play the game for five hours I've

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.800 
say play the game for five hours I've
drifted<00:04:32.610> for<00:04:32.910> about<00:04:33.090> five<00:04:33.300> hours<00:04:33.330> in<00:04:33.690> this

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
drifted for about five hours in this

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.850
