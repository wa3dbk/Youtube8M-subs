different special powers now let's go

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.230 
different special powers now let's go
try<00:00:25.619> out<00:00:25.650> some<00:00:25.920> special<00:00:26.609> powers<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:26.970> probably

the best special power is the first one
you<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.369> can<00:00:29.580> craft<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.480> called

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
you you can craft and is called

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.110 
you you can craft and is called
invincibility<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:32.160> what<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:32.610> does<00:00:32.669> if<00:00:33.000> we

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
invincibility so what this does if we

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.049 
invincibility so what this does if we
just<00:00:33.300> change<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:34.050> our<00:00:34.079> creative<00:00:35.040> mode<00:00:35.280> off<00:00:35.550> you

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
but so you can jump into fire can change

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.410 
but so you can jump into fire can change
this<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.860> classic<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.490> if<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.820> really<00:02:00.149> does

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
this to classic and if I really does

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.359 
this to classic and if I really does
nothing<00:02:00.930> but<00:02:01.079> what<00:02:01.500> what<00:02:01.740> happens<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.340> that

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
nothing but what what happens is that

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.060 
nothing but what what happens is that
water<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.390> enemy<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:03.990> if<00:02:04.560> we<00:02:04.680> go<00:02:04.920> over

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
water is the enemy and if we go over

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.800 
water is the enemy and if we go over
here<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.640> get<00:02:05.850> give<00:02:06.119> ourselves<00:02:06.240> some<00:02:06.659> a

it hurts us if we submerge ourselves

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.320 
it hurts us if we submerge ourselves
with<00:02:14.750> water<00:02:15.040> actually<00:02:16.040> we<00:02:16.670> need<00:02:16.819> to<00:02:16.910> submerge

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
with water actually we need to submerge

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.979 
with water actually we need to submerge
ourselves<00:02:18.040> there<00:02:19.040> we<00:02:19.160> go<00:02:19.400> we're<00:02:20.270> in<00:02:20.390> creative

underwater and actually you get the
bubbles<00:02:39.440> outside<00:02:40.099> of<00:02:40.250> water<00:02:40.459> so<00:02:40.700> are<00:02:40.940> you<00:02:41.120> sort

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
bubbles outside of water so are you sort

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.120 
bubbles outside of water so are you sort
of<00:02:41.390> like<00:02:41.540> a<00:02:41.660> fish<00:02:41.959> you<00:02:42.110> need<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.380> be<00:02:42.500> inside<00:02:42.920> the
