00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
after it was cut and got knocked into

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.539 
after it was cut and got knocked into
the<00:01:24.180> river<00:01:24.420> went<00:01:25.409> downstream<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.130> then<00:01:26.250> you

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
the river went downstream and then you

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.039 
the river went downstream and then you
know<00:01:26.670> if<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.090> can<00:01:27.210> just<00:01:27.450> see<00:01:27.570> how<00:01:27.689> it's<00:01:27.840> how

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
know if you can just see how it's how

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.200 
know if you can just see how it's how
it's<00:01:28.229> been<00:01:28.380> beaten<00:01:28.680> beaten<00:01:29.159> around<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.820> all

smoothed<00:01:30.630> off<00:01:32.240> but<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.450> could<00:01:33.659> just<00:01:34.049> get<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> lot

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
smoothed off but I could just get a lot

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
using like some of the quick-set glues

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.490 
using like some of the quick-set glues
it<00:02:52.850> takes<00:02:53.269> a<00:02:53.360> little<00:02:53.480> bit<00:02:53.600> more<00:02:53.690> time<00:02:54.049> it<00:02:54.319> takes

tell<00:03:25.400> you<00:03:25.489> though<00:03:25.670> that<00:03:26.239> since<00:03:26.660> I<00:03:26.930> I've<00:03:27.290> used

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
tell you though that since I I've used

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.550 
tell you though that since I I've used
this<00:03:27.769> for<00:03:27.829> years<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:28.640> hot<00:03:28.790> glue<00:03:29.079> I've<00:03:30.079> never

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
this for years the hot glue I've never

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.740 
this for years the hot glue I've never
had<00:03:30.799> a<00:03:30.829> piece<00:03:31.190> of<00:03:31.370> wood<00:03:31.700> separate<00:03:32.329> from<00:03:32.600> the

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
had a piece of wood separate from the

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.259 
had a piece of wood separate from the
glue<00:03:33.049> when<00:03:33.500> it's<00:03:33.620> on<00:03:33.799> there<00:03:34.010> I've<00:03:34.400> had<00:03:34.700> a<00:03:34.730> catch

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
glue when it's on there I've had a catch

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.520 
glue when it's on there I've had a catch
and<00:03:35.630> break<00:03:36.200> this<00:03:36.950> waste<00:03:37.310> block<00:03:37.670> in<00:03:37.940> half

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
and break this waste block in half

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.560 
and break this waste block in half
before<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.920> glue<00:03:40.180> separated<00:03:41.180> from<00:03:41.299> the<00:03:41.450> two

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
before the glue separated from the two

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.750 
before the glue separated from the two
pieces<00:03:41.750> of<00:03:41.870> wood<00:03:42.049> so<00:03:42.320> I'm<00:03:43.040> completely

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
pieces of wood so I'm completely

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.479 
pieces of wood so I'm completely
confident<00:03:44.390> that<00:03:44.630> it<00:03:45.049> holds<00:03:45.290> and<00:03:45.829> I've<00:03:46.250> turned

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
confident that it holds and I've turned

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.789 
confident that it holds and I've turned
you<00:03:46.790> know<00:03:46.820> some<00:03:47.420> bigger<00:03:47.660> bigger<00:03:48.200> bowls<00:03:48.530> on

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
you know some bigger bigger bowls on

you know some bigger bigger bowls on
this<00:03:48.950> thing<00:03:49.160> a<00:03:50.380> liberal<00:03:51.380> amount<00:03:51.650> on

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.869 

and<00:04:03.200> what<00:04:04.200> I<00:04:04.230> do<00:04:04.349> I<00:04:04.470> just<00:04:05.069> hold<00:04:05.489> it<00:04:05.640> on<00:04:05.730> there

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
and what I do I just hold it on there

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
it right along the edge and just roll a

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:26.020 
it right along the edge and just roll a
piece<00:04:18.840> around<00:04:19.199> and<00:04:19.709> fill<00:04:20.010> that<00:04:20.190> in<00:04:20.459> so<00:04:21.710> that<00:04:23.419> it

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
piece around and fill that in so that it

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.850 
piece around and fill that in so that it
bond<00:04:27.030> you<00:04:27.570> know<00:04:27.600> just<00:04:27.960> run<00:04:28.139> around<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:28.650> lip

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
bond you know just run around the lip

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.920 
bond you know just run around the lip
and<00:04:29.010> everything<00:04:29.370> to<00:04:29.580> then<00:04:30.300> that's<00:04:30.479> it<00:04:30.720> that's

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
set up for a few minutes just two to

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.580 
set up for a few minutes just two to
three<00:04:35.850> minutes<00:04:36.180> and<00:04:36.450> then<00:04:36.810> once<00:04:36.960> it<00:04:37.110> you<00:04:37.410> can

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
three minutes and then once it you can

see when it end starts to turn white and
that's<00:04:40.080> move<00:04:40.290> ahead<00:04:40.440> and<00:04:40.590> clean<00:04:40.740> up<00:04:40.889> the<00:04:41.070> face

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.910 

I'm<00:05:26.360> just<00:05:26.510> gonna<00:05:26.630> get<00:05:26.810> it<00:05:26.960> get<00:05:27.290> it<00:05:27.440> all<00:05:27.590> cleaned

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:27.920 
I'm just gonna get it get it all cleaned

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.830 
I'm just gonna get it get it all cleaned
up<00:05:28.100> all<00:05:28.520> the<00:05:28.670> way<00:05:28.760> across<00:05:29.000> and<00:05:29.450> then<00:05:29.540> I'm<00:05:29.720> gonna

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
up all the way across and then I'm gonna

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.220 
up all the way across and then I'm gonna
go<00:05:30.050> ahead<00:05:30.080> and<00:05:30.410> and<00:05:31.180> set<00:05:32.180> a<00:05:32.210> mark<00:05:32.720> on<00:05:32.870> the<00:05:32.990> face

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
go ahead and and set a mark on the face

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.630 
go ahead and and set a mark on the face
of<00:05:33.260> it<00:05:33.500> here<00:05:33.830> because<00:05:34.280> it's<00:05:35.060> not<00:05:35.300> not<00:05:36.290> true<00:05:36.710> so

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
of it here because it's not not true so

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.820 
of it here because it's not not true so
that's<00:05:38.360> gonna<00:05:38.540> be<00:05:38.630> a<00:05:38.780> shallow<00:05:39.080> point<00:05:39.470> and<00:05:39.710> this

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
that's gonna be a shallow point and this

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.320 
that's gonna be a shallow point and this
over<00:05:40.100> here<00:05:40.130> is<00:05:40.310> gonna<00:05:40.550> be<00:05:40.670> a<00:05:40.700> shallow<00:05:40.940> point<00:05:41.240> so

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
over here is gonna be a shallow point so

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:42.670 
over here is gonna be a shallow point so
we're<00:05:41.420> gonna<00:05:41.510> go<00:05:41.900> ahead<00:05:41.990> and<00:05:42.110> set<00:05:42.320> and<00:05:42.530> then

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
we're gonna go ahead and set and then

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.800 
we're gonna go ahead and set and then
not<00:05:42.830> not<00:05:43.190> touch<00:05:43.460> this<00:05:43.700> area<00:05:44.030> up<00:05:44.150> here<00:05:44.360> and<00:05:44.510> that

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
not not touch this area up here and that

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.150 
not not touch this area up here and that
part's<00:05:45.080> going<00:05:45.290> to<00:05:45.350> stick<00:05:45.560> out<00:05:45.710> so<00:05:45.980> we're<00:05:46.100> not

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
part's going to stick out so we're not

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.130 
part's going to stick out so we're not
going<00:05:46.310> to<00:05:46.370> come<00:05:46.940> in<00:05:46.970> and<00:05:47.210> cut<00:05:47.420> that<00:05:47.600> out<00:05:47.840> at<00:05:47.990> all

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
going to come in and cut that out at all

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.470 
going to come in and cut that out at all
let<00:05:48.980> me<00:05:49.040> just<00:05:49.220> clean<00:05:49.820> it<00:05:49.850> up<00:05:50.030> a<00:05:50.120> little<00:05:50.180> bit

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:50.480 
let me just clean it up a little bit

00:05:50.480 --> 00:06:10.550 
let me just clean it up a little bit
more<00:05:53.980> closer

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560
