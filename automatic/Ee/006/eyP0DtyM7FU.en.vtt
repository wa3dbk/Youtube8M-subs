build that the upgradable wall though is
actually<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.549> new<00:01:12.180> project<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.869> can

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
actually a new project that you can

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.660 
actually a new project that you can
build<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.590> can<00:01:13.740> upgrade<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.070> every<00:01:14.490> day

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
build and you can upgrade that every day

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.940 
build and you can upgrade that every day
like<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.060> would<00:01:15.240> your<00:01:15.530> defensive<00:01:16.530> focus

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950

we can switch over to the upgradable

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.030 
we can switch over to the upgradable
wall<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.000> get<00:01:36.630> defense<00:01:37.530> there<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.009> see

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
wall and get defense there you can see

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.120 
wall and get defense there you can see
provides<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.850> bit<00:01:39.630> more<00:01:39.840> than<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.530> great<00:01:40.860> pit

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
make sure to I guess what I learned from

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.979 
make sure to I guess what I learned from
this<00:02:38.459> is<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.939> check<00:02:39.299> with<00:02:39.450> everyone<00:02:39.840> before

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
this is to check with everyone before

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.890 
this is to check with everyone before
doing<00:02:40.379> anything<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:41.069> thought<00:02:41.540> we<00:02:42.540> don't<00:02:42.689> get

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
doing anything I thought we don't get

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.500 
doing anything I thought we don't get
easier<00:02:43.140> for<00:02:43.319> plumbing<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:44.189> Jen<00:02:45.090> thought<00:02:45.329> was

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
easier for plumbing so Jen thought was

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.649 
easier for plumbing so Jen thought was
the<00:02:45.629> best<00:02:45.659> use<00:02:46.109> for<00:02:46.139> it<00:02:46.500> in<00:02:46.620> my<00:02:46.739> opinion<00:02:47.040> we<00:02:48.000> did

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659 
the best use for it in my opinion we did

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.569 
the best use for it in my opinion we did
need<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.900> use<00:02:49.409> two<00:02:49.680> nuts<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.069> bolts<00:02:50.129> to<00:02:50.400> make

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
need to use two nuts and bolts to make

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.520 
need to use two nuts and bolts to make
that<00:02:50.879> we<00:02:51.540> don't<00:02:51.629> have<00:02:51.780> enough<00:02:52.049> to<00:02:52.200> make<00:02:52.349> all

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
that we don't have enough to make all

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.119 
that we don't have enough to make all
the<00:02:52.799> items<00:02:53.069> in<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.280> game<00:02:53.659> but<00:02:54.769> yeah<00:02:55.769> so
