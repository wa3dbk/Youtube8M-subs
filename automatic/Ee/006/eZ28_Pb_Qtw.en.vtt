some enemies with exploding tanks on
their<00:01:25.170> back<00:01:25.380> why<00:01:25.860> would<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.250> walk<00:01:26.460> around

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
their back why would you walk around

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.310 
their back why would you walk around
with<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.090> if<00:01:27.330> it's<00:01:27.479> just<00:01:27.659> gonna<00:01:27.780> explore<00:01:28.170> if

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
with that if it's just gonna explore if

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.020

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
you shoot it and they don't even have

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.149 
you shoot it and they don't even have
flamethrowers<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.140> guess<00:01:31.439> there<00:01:31.650> are<00:01:31.680> oxygen

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
flamethrowers I guess there are oxygen

flamethrowers I guess there are oxygen
tanks<00:01:32.759> maybe<00:01:33.090> but<00:01:33.750> then<00:01:33.900> why<00:01:34.049> do<00:01:34.110> some<00:01:34.470> troops

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
tanks maybe but then why do some troops

tanks maybe but then why do some troops
have<00:01:34.920> oxygen<00:01:35.430> tanks<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.820> others<00:01:36.090> don't
