have that in a second and there are two
types<00:02:45.710> of<00:02:46.040> freezers<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:47.210> one<00:02:47.390> is<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.990> frita

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
types of freezers the one is the frita

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.340 
types of freezers the one is the frita
that<00:02:48.500> opens<00:02:48.920> like<00:02:49.280> that<00:02:49.480> maybe<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.660> keep<00:02:51.080> ice

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
that opens like that maybe to keep ice

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.830 
that opens like that maybe to keep ice
or<00:02:51.770> whatever<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.640> other<00:02:52.790> one<00:02:53.000> is<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.450> sliding

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
or whatever the other one is the sliding

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.640

freezer<00:02:54.260> for<00:02:54.620> ice<00:02:55.040> cream<00:02:55.370> itself<00:02:55.790> and<00:02:56.650> the

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
freezer for ice cream itself and the

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.199 
freezer for ice cream itself and the
reason<00:02:57.890> why<00:02:57.980> I<00:02:58.010> have<00:02:58.160> that<00:02:58.340> mat<00:02:58.580> in<00:02:58.790> there<00:02:59.000> is

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
reason why I have that mat in there is

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.090 
reason why I have that mat in there is
because<00:02:59.660> I<00:03:01.270> much<00:03:02.270> like<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:03.100> prisoner

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
because I much like the prisoner

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.510 
because I much like the prisoner
transport<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:05.360> used<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.350> same<00:03:06.560> piece<00:03:07.130> on<00:03:07.430> the

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
transport I used the same piece on the

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.730 
transport I used the same piece on the
bottom<00:03:07.670> which<00:03:08.060> was<00:03:08.209> bright<00:03:08.570> red<00:03:08.600> if<00:03:09.350> you<00:03:09.410> don't

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
bottom which was bright red if you don't

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.490 
bottom which was bright red if you don't
know<00:03:09.860> that<00:03:09.940> kind<00:03:10.940> of<00:03:11.030> see<00:03:11.209> hard<00:03:11.660> to<00:03:11.750> see<00:03:11.930> if<00:03:12.410> you

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
know that kind of see hard to see if you

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.680 
know that kind of see hard to see if you
look<00:03:12.620> inside<00:03:12.890> these<00:03:13.070> holes<00:03:13.390> see<00:03:14.390> you<00:03:14.540> can

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
look inside these holes see you can

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.990 
look inside these holes see you can
start<00:03:14.840> red<00:03:15.110> so<00:03:15.980> I<00:03:16.010> covered<00:03:16.370> that<00:03:16.400> up<00:03:16.670> because

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000
