 hello welcome from your channel 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.790
 decoration artist dotcom in this 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.460
 Friends, we are going to talk about how 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.860
 decorate a small apartment with a 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.320
 little money because sometimes we have a 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.170
 reduced budget and a big challenge 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.539
 which is re decorating our place where 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.490
 we live in this case an apartment 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.380
 you have an advantage because when you live 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.320
 in a small space you can do 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.929
 big changes that can facilitate the 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.609
 relaxation , comfort and pleasure 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.530
 be in that apartment and not 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:36.520
 you will necessarily use a lot 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.440
 money you want to know how we started 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.810
 first step you have to check the state 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.000
 current of your department including 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.010
 all the furniture the combination that 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.920
 you have the colors of the illustrations 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.600
 the pictures and so on you should make a 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.790
 list of foods that you should 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.860
 keep and one of the things that you're going to 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.200
 discard decides what will be the 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.790
 general theme of decoration you should 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.030
 to choose a color combination 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.910
 like cold blues and greens or 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.820
 reds to warm yellows choose a 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.800
 style of d 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.909
 even if you like it that way it's going to be 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.729
 much easier 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.650
 redecorate in your apartment number 3 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.080
 remember that you have a budget 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.869
 limited so if you already have furniture 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.090
 relatively new models choose a 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.820
 modern theme this so you do not have to 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.180
 change things that still serve number 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.490
 4 choose a large piece of furniture that you love and go 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.250
 to your decoration scheme around 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.990
 this is going to be a point for 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.869
 the organization the first thing you have 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.180
 what to do is accommodate most of the 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.280
 furniture and belongings that you have 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.110
 against the wall because when you're 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.200
 working in such a small space 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.970
 the items placed in the center of 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.979
 the room makes this one look 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.619
 much smaller after you 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.630
 We recommend that you clean the windows and 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.390
 that with this will go much more light to 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.369
 your room then you must remove 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.979
 all the mess consider selling 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.650
 those objects that no longer serve you 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.110
 finally remember that less is more 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.119
 when using only a few 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.910
 furniture your apartment is going to see a lot 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.650
 Cleaner and larger choose this 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.960
 advice when around is your 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.360
 apartment now if we go to the section 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.490
 of decorating the first thing that you have to 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.290
 do is a list of articles under 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.120
 price that the great 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.310
 difference think about the things that you 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.190
 adjust more to your decoration theme and 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.070
 that will add comfort and luxury to your 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.210
 apartment including colorful candles 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.770
 cushions and some curtains number 2 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.890
 find places that have good 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.470
 prices go shopping but do not pay more 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.620
 for things that you can find much more 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.110
 cheap 3 keep in mind that the 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.170
 objects with dual function as 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.270
 shelves or trunks are usually very 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.120
 convenient when living in a 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.640
 apartment and number 4 remember that the 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.920
 mirrors create the illusion of having a 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.590
 more space so we recommend you 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.230
 that you put them in your living room or 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.239
 rooms that have appeared to you 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.450
