00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.340
 your show received five out of five the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.139
 missions of the quinté plus and 5-5 for 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.700
 to accompany me today alexander from 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.170
 kaufman hello alexander mauves have 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.060
 made good morning alexander 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.760
 direction the crusader laroche with the 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.580
 fifth step of gnt paris turf a 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.660
 test for 5 to 10 in 2008 150 m we are going 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.400
 perhaps speaks a little bit of the route of the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.849
 crossed-laroche oran the distance one can 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.650
 not make it 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.119
 we can make the distance is like 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.590
 a track with a huge straight line 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.390
 by the way when you arrive early 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.020
 of the straight line and that if you have 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.360
 more resources 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.980
 it's jordan at the pole now in 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.329
 this race there we will see I think 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.320
 that there will not be many horses from 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.520
 second rung that will come 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.440
 and we are going to see with your 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.680
 selection right away alexandre then 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.890
 the 5 at west wind on the 3rd had notice the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.649
 set very well throw the dirt of mirel the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.719
 12 vinci delaby the eighth high of 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.910
 carli the two tropics had to be and finally 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.260
 the number 9 tick of the world regarding 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.579
 your favorite number 5 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.590
 a west wind a choice that has a 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.910
 beautiful business card it comes from 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.949
 reconnect with success 6 2 in taken 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.750
 exactly paris turf it was oman on 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.350
 this same distance to the base paper 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.549
 unavoidable 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.290
 well, let's say it's always been a 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.729
 class horse it be it at 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.299
 laurent koubiche or from now on 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.710
 matthieu abrivard 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.869
 now he is a son of korea years 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.400
 like all the bodies in big motor but 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.810
 little mind is that they think that 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.549
 Matthieu Abrivard found immediately 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.170
 good buttons and at the mans he did 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.360
 really terrible impression he was walking 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.439
 14 and a half and last few kilometers I 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.880
 pray like it's a little 11 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.020
 I think it's a horse that goes 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.210
 take two hundred thousand euros this 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.530
 year for me it's really a sun 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.670
 this choice did not sound we will see what 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.710
 that we think matthieu abrivard since 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.540
 david fricaud was to meet him it's 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.070
 our first field info he us 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.270
 speaks in particular of the state of form of 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.540
 his horse a west wind have 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.610
 listen 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.369
 the horse is very much more info here 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.960
 there but win at the mans he stayed in 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.420
 good form of commitment is good a 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.530
 other quality 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.659
 be careful the first meters of 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.460
 crazy race able to go ahead or 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.530
 to wait was to defer I think 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.119
 that it has improved too but that's good 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.619
 arrives on his best value he 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.880
 really holds a first chance he 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.380
 will again deferré losses it's 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.149
 something that is important we are 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.780
 is reported at his last 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.060
 race 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.590
 there we go where cross laroche was a little 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.870
 drive or let in the same 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.069
 compet mode than the last time that 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.630
 you have to offer the regulate it is going 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.700
 still pretty confident before this 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.890
 first so here is hate a 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.140
 good and we're part of the horses of the 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.390
 race to the aura understood this is the 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.970
 trust of a clan abrivard is enough 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.560
 logical wanted to contrast the number 3 had 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.190
 review who made a beautiful meeting 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.019
 winter 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.790
 he remains on a first a probante 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.660
 third place in the albert price 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.040
 Demarcq 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.459
 this is our race reference we will 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.069
 see there just the video is taken at the 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.180
 death of a year turning that day 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.530
 she was not very lucky there 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.330
 find attila of the gabbro which 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.950
 no longer advanced and suddenly he loses 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.500
 time at the time of the blow it will come back to finish 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.170
 third I think without this incident 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.940
 he could have finished in second place 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.769
 because arlington rim was for me 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.609
 a little above in this lot and we 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.260
 sees the horse regain ground 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.269
 it was a bit like the great clock 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.920
 markets 13 and we also see a test 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.320
 of the miracle that was 4th this diary all 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.700
 in fact said he had a m but a 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.200
 nice race we will come back to the thesis 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.820
 mirel with stone vercruysse while 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.799
 the hour so on this performance 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.359
 we can not dismiss it we can not 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.310
 to dismiss it is for me one of the values 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.630
 rising among the five years a 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.850
 generation that is quite extraordinary 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.239
 it's true since a few months 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.190
 already 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.150
 now the only downside is 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.280
 it is not déferré later 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.140
 and I find that he is definitely more 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.269
 bleeding so deferred from the posts I 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.579
 would have put it in mind 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.140
 the busy I put it 2nd 2nd will not be 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.060
 match is between a number position 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.739
 7 very well throw beautiful performances 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.870
 since its beginnings including province and 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.130
 well we crossed laroche 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.140
 recently the autumn we forgot 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.329
 fault at the beginning a race to forget on 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.590
 buy with confidence we buy some for 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.060
 me it's my little find I think 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.950
 we're going on a favorite edition 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.269
 but that's my little underdog 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.889
 can finish among the top three at 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.450
 around 10 against 1 back to school 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:55.250
 was good at galloping behind good 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.660
 course this time déferré of the four 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.290
 feet it's only the second time 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.450
 of her career 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.650
 I think it will really serve him and 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.390
 as you said especially it is 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.250
 very well on the flat profiles 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.720
 it's clearly the race aimed at me 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.580
 am very confident for this horse a 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.800
 opponent shoah yeah I think we're leaving 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.670
 on an arrival a little crate and the one 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.200
 this is a good tool 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.430
 we'll see if he can spice 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.300
 reports in fourth position their 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.110
 spoke earlier about the test of 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.540
 mirel the number one 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.579
 already not less than nine wins and five 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.680
 accessits in 17 attempts placed at 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.750
 semi classic level we saw the weight 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.060
 it was his comeback on that race 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.290
 and paragliding in value to draw as we go 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.450
 say there again first chance 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.620
 first chance even you will be able to 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.120
 say alexandre maybe want to put a 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.440
 little low it's true she's 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.970
 maybe inseparable from your opinion 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.550
 by the way she has already beaten with respect 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.110
 when this one was ironed now 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.610
 it's the famous second race of 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.410
 back home and I find that she has some 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.419
 best commitments in June 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.070
 commitments a little easier in 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.870
 pure class first chance now 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.220
 pirlet times already he was not thinking 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.360
 really run yes yes because its 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.160
 limits with respect to qualification 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.110
 limits so he did not prepare his 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.460
 mare elbow the knife between 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.800
 teeth for this race so she has to 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.660
 to be at 90% and that's going to be enough for 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.490
 take place but that's it I think 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.510
 that she is not going to win we will see this 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.860
 what exactly does father think about the crisis 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.460
 since jean françois meyer went to 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.169
 his meeting 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.070
 he talks to us about the race of 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:11.810
 return the cash register mirel we listen 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.460
 baby site is super good as would a 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.020
 friend of mine was going to coach a little 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.520
 eyes surrounded for a few days because 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.350
 it was returned but were 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.220
 quite convincing who really has a 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.250
 race in this event 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.440
 he recovers and still enough it's this 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.320
 that we apply to the recovery 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.870
 the mare did not work really 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.850
 very hard since she 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.310
 lost a little bit of what we know 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.720
 applied to cool it cross you 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.190
 returns very soon naghouche is not 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.250
 a worry in the name is always a 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:43.460
 plate so in the first three if 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.420
 we can not understand it 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.460
 still not the big fat 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.540
 confidence compared to altesse du mirel 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.340
 but a good place why not that 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.960
 worth three framers with had abyss 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.160
 is true that it's five years old they are 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.660
 a little above in pure class per se 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.550
 it's safe now I have this little 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.450
 flat that the mare is only his 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.440
 second when you have mostly 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.910
 that apparently she took rap and 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.130
 yet he agreed 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.960
 here she was tired in sack and 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.550
 position compared to the 25 meters with the 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.750
 12 vinci labit we know him 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.080
 perfectly one can not either at this 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.670
 level 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.110
 now we have the 25 meters 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.730
 worry me a little bit like ben 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.890
 it is true that it is not obvious I 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.860
 hesitated either the fifth master or six 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.210
 seven or even 8 now jean michel 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.280
 bazire looks very confident I think 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.080
 that he made this gnt a goal with 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.890
 I saw that he had already engaged in 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.660
 the next step 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.430
 and then still he has made a 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.500
 week riding like an iax to 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.910
 vincennes here is stack he entrusted to jos 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.440
 verbeeck and jason beck the track of the 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.030
 cross laroche he knows it's clear 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.080
 it removes the ornament that I think he's going 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.580
 try swamps waiting at mid 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.020
 platoon and in the nuts that can finish 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.250
 and take a fifth place he has 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.530
 it took 25 games to get there 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.970
 surely there I agree alexander 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.470
 thank you for all this information we will 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.820
 conclude with wam a little chocolate I 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.020
 know very very hot with a horse 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.180
 to representatives of joël van eeckhaute 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.560
 yeah that's right 508 cool goal sounds 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.220
 and I last spotted it is 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.320
 galloping 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.820
 behind he makes a superb return I 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.240
 think he's really a colt 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.950
 of class 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.020
 he shot eight to self I do not think that 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.700
 it's going to bother him rather a benefit if 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.720
 the wise I think he has largely the 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.100
 size of such a race 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.690
 bah listen it is noted there is more 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.190
 than to go to the cashier's office thank you 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.690

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.430

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.820
