00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.940
 in the flooded plains of the mountains if the coast to the hinterland Brazil is known 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.620
 worldwide for the admirable biodiversity of its forests 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.580
 but as one territory can house such a variety of life 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.400
 the time of formation of the amazon can give us some clues 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.090
 stay tuned that the episode to forrester time is back 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.470
 the Brazilian territory basso many changes to reach the annual forum 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.680
 before the total separation of the continents to about 200 million 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.000
 a large part of what today is the northern region of Brazil 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.480
 but this area would still undergo major transformations 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.230
 the tectonic plates moved up the Andes mountain range. 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.230
 world is very dynamic than we know it today. 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.070
 to the Pacific began to flow into the Atlantic Ocean 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.719
 as the tendency of life is to occupy new areas 

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:15.840
 this immense region that was submerged gave place to a forest the conditions 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.299
 environmental conditions that would form the Amazon as it is today with 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.459
 humid and even savannas appeared 6 million years ago 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.600
 Masonic entity already surprised since the earliest times 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.180
 posses revealed the existence of this average paulo 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.120
 who remained alive in the forest of 15 12 thousand years ago 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.860
 these militant groups with the prime minister 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.290
 the brand asked 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.300
 the rulers of the region 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.450
 today in the world's largest rainforest 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.450
 And you're younger than Brazil, as we know it. 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.240
 changes 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.530
 when the climate changes for any reason they change the physiognomies of the forest 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.880
 the opposite is also true of the changes that man promotes in the soil 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.480
 how to replace forests by urban areas with opera a climate 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.369
 water availability 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:15.819
 the planet is always subject to change and forests 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:19.939
 these changes can have and with this team and for most people 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:24.569
 how growth said a population of a given plant in a 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:25.539
 forest 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:26.669
 the extreme 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:29.899
 with tragic consequences for us humans 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.899
 after all the forest weather 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:38.489
 dense forests with many trees in the 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.219
 besides contributing to the determination of votes 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.589
 are more effective to solve the match slb force 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:53.199
 my close granddaughter explained that the forest cover 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:54.159
 the event 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.789
 two companies can register 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:59.889
 especially on the banks of rivers and hillsides 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:03.899
 as happened in the mountain region of Rio de Janeiro 

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:06.909
 to better understand what happened in this region 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.909
 already started the teacher ana coimbra 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:13.540
 extreme rainfall events 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.099
 the slips we saw here 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.379
 they are like other areas similar to them 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:21.249
 not slip 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:27.329
 movement from soil materials and fragments of amphora if another comes 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.999
 vegetation driven by rain 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:36.259
 gravitational force that with two of the movement from above to 

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:39.259
 low phenomenon is common in mountainous regions 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.099
 I think we 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:44.729
 I know what to learn 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:47.729
 in which nature she has a remix 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.700
 of resistance to the forces acting on it physical limits 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.329
 physical limits thug speaking for example of rain force 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:04.589
 that it enters the store shelves and accumulates and 

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:07.589
 in the midst of these materials to renew to exert a force 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:10.389
 then when this force 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.389
 is greater than the strength of these materials 

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:19.609
 ps once they will move around the square action of the truth society 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:25.439
 we even have dividend events within our reach 

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:32.090
 This is Argentina, what we call scars and slides. 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.090
 effects 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.060
 and I say recent because the coloring of the red sole of e indicates that this 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.270
 happened a very short time ago 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.639
 here on the other side we have a rocky escarpment with 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.820
 scars from landslides plus cases 

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:54.360
 dm a smaller amount of movement materials but also 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:57.080
 will converge all 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:03.659
 with the earth's sediments of d-blocks of remnants of deep trees 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:04.559
 of many 

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:07.979
 that are reminded no more cars 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.120
 fluvial 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.939
 what we call rivers now acting very much material of the slopes 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:17.580
 as a result of very heavy rains 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.689
 sometimes I actually heard it will get on top of it will form a bit of much 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:24.620
 really loud 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.319
 the strength in very high transport capacity 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.999
 and with a potential for destruction of everything in the way this 

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:36.550
 because it will increase 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.419
 or with the size of that fruit to replace a destroying power of the island 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.419
 the conditions met in the time period due to the great imagina 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:50.449
 allowed the formation of Brazilian patrimony 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:52.610
 arouses curiosity 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.180
 today with science we are looking for creative ways to respond briefly 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:00.110
 and some of the same iraq 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.009
 in the forest
