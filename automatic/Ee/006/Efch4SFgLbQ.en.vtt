coordinating<00:00:23.189> colors<00:00:24.500> the<00:00:25.500> reason<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:25.920> I

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
coordinating colors the reason that I

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.670 
coordinating colors the reason that I
designed<00:00:26.580> this<00:00:26.820> kit<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.359> because<00:00:27.840> i<00:00:28.080> really

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
designed this kit is because i really

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.560 
designed this kit is because i really
think<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.960> we<00:00:30.960> can<00:00:31.140> always<00:00:31.470> use<00:00:31.679> more

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
think that we can always use more

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.790 
think that we can always use more
comprehensive<00:00:33.570> instructional<00:00:33.809> materials

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
comprehensive instructional materials

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.650 
comprehensive instructional materials
for<00:00:35.399> new<00:00:35.760> knitters<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.920> I<00:00:38.149> actually<00:00:39.149> came

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
for new knitters and I actually came

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.389 
for new knitters and I actually came
into<00:00:39.930> designing<00:00:40.260> out<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.860> education

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
into designing out of the education

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.030 
into designing out of the education
field<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.540> was<00:00:42.780> sort<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.260> natural<00:00:43.739> for<00:00:43.950> me

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
field so it was sort of natural for me

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.279 
field so it was sort of natural for me
to<00:00:44.070> feel<00:00:44.370> like<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.610> needed<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.660> make<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.840> lesson

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
to feel like I needed to make a lesson

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.970 
to feel like I needed to make a lesson
out<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.950> my<00:00:47.100> patterns<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:48.450> here's<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.680> sketch

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
out of my patterns so here's the sketch

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.799 
out of my patterns so here's the sketch
that<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.309> first<00:00:50.940> presented<00:00:51.510> for<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:51.960> idea<00:00:52.579> and

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
that I first presented for this idea and

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.060 
that I first presented for this idea and
it's<00:00:56.000> actually<00:00:57.000> pretty<00:00:57.690> accurate<00:00:58.070> compared

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
it's actually pretty accurate compared

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.180 
it's actually pretty accurate compared
to<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.430> final<00:00:59.789> project<00:01:00.500> but<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.770> doesn't

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
to the final project but it doesn't

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.369 
to the final project but it doesn't
really<00:01:02.609> show<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.090> features<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:03.930> pattern

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
really show the features of this pattern

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.640 
really show the features of this pattern
as<00:01:04.619> well<00:01:04.979> as<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.400> project<00:01:05.909> itself<00:01:06.090> does<00:01:06.659> this

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
as well as the project itself does this

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.630 
as well as the project itself does this
pattern<00:01:07.860> starts<00:01:08.549> with<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.030> scarf<00:01:09.799> and<00:01:10.799> what

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
pattern starts with the scarf and what

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.289 
pattern starts with the scarf and what
it<00:01:11.760> does<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.360> teaches<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.930> new<00:01:13.229> knitter<00:01:13.530> how

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
it does is it teaches a new knitter how

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.410 
it does is it teaches a new knitter how
to<00:01:15.299> execute<00:01:15.920> the<00:01:16.920> various<00:01:17.340> stitches<00:01:17.790> garter

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
to execute the various stitches garter

knit a swatch this project begins with
the<00:01:27.420> cast<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.250> takes<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.430> new<00:01:29.579> knitter

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
the cast on and takes the new knitter

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.149 
the cast on and takes the new knitter
through<00:01:30.180> each<00:01:30.450> lesson<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.229> as<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.799> lessons

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
through each lesson and as the lessons

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.429 
through each lesson and as the lessons
build<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.610> each<00:01:32.640> other<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.509> scarf<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.020> formed

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
build on each other the scarf is formed

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.640 
build on each other the scarf is formed
and<00:01:34.740> when<00:01:35.490> they<00:01:35.670> reached<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.180> halfway<00:01:36.299> point

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
and when they reached the halfway point

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.969 
and when they reached the halfway point
they<00:01:37.650> get<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.070> go<00:01:38.250> backwards<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.979> practice

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
they get to go backwards and practice

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.440 
they get to go backwards and practice
everything<00:01:41.460> they<00:01:41.579> learned<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.119> at<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.420> end

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
everything they learned and at the end

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.880 
everything they learned and at the end
you<00:01:42.720> get<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.920> rather<00:01:44.220> attractive<00:01:44.579> scarf<00:01:45.299> I

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
you get this rather attractive scarf I

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.580 
you get this rather attractive scarf I
like<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.100> lot<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:48.810> second<00:01:49.170> part<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
like it a lot the second part of the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.499 
like it a lot the second part of the
pattern<00:01:49.799> allows<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.759> knitter<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.119> make<00:01:51.299> a

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
pattern allows the knitter to make a

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.910 
pattern allows the knitter to make a
coordinating<00:01:52.350> hat<00:01:52.649> which<00:01:53.640> isn't<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.149> flat<00:01:54.920> so

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
coordinating hat which isn't it flat so

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.249 
coordinating hat which isn't it flat so
the<00:01:56.610> new<00:01:57.149> knitter<00:01:57.390> uses<00:01:57.810> all<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.140> the

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
the new knitter uses all of the

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.600 
the new knitter uses all of the
techniques<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.860> were<00:01:58.979> presented<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.520> the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
techniques that were presented in the

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.760 
techniques that were presented in the
first<00:01:59.820> part<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.270> pattern<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.840> then

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
first part of the pattern and then

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.100 
first part of the pattern and then
learns<00:02:02.130> one<00:02:02.490> new<00:02:02.670> one<00:02:02.850> which<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.299> decreasing

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
learns one new one which is decreasing

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.310 
learns one new one which is decreasing
for<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.829> crown<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.729> then<00:02:06.270> at<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.450> end<00:02:06.600> after

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
for the crown and then at the end after

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.089 
for the crown and then at the end after
the<00:02:07.710> cast-off<00:02:08.280> bind<00:02:09.000> off<00:02:09.209> sorry<00:02:09.739> they<00:02:10.739> learn

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
the cast-off bind off sorry they learn

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:11.620 
the cast-off bind off sorry they learn

much
stitch<00:02:11.930> in<00:02:12.230> order<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:12.920> seem<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.730> hat<00:02:13.880> at<00:02:14.090> the

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.340 
stitch in order to seem the hat at the
back<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:15.190> we<00:02:16.190> end<00:02:16.310> up<00:02:16.490> with<00:02:16.520> this<00:02:16.910> on<00:02:17.300> a<00:02:17.360> hand
