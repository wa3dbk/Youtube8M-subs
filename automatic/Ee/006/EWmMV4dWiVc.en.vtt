00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.080
 if not the greatest laugh Irecê event 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.580
 world soccer 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.170
 we all know that the country still needs 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.460
 very rich and great improve 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.380
 needs 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.660
 they are still in love with this 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.369
 world cup motivated sport 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.710
 although we kept the title billed 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.770
 we were in search of some innovations that 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:40.280
 hit the cups do not lose your daughter today 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:40.910
 the diary of the curious the world cup in the 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.650
 Brazil 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.540
 fifa decided to increase the use of 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.820
 spray for the marking of barriers and 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.560
 position of the ball in the free kicks 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.170
 the spray was invented by a miner from 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.760
 ituiutaba either 14 years tried to approve 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.290
 fifa for the intention to be 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.750
 adopted in world cups 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.579
 the creation of Germany had already been 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.640
 used in brazilian games for a long time 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.620
 time passing in front of the TV a game 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.140
 if I'm not mistaken Brazil and Argentina 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.060
 The narrator is told I want to see the 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.520
 citizen will keep the barrier in place 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.860
 hence see and that thing is not perception 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.290
 mine was looking for something I said poxa 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.880
 I'll solve the problem there, I thought. 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.280
 on provisional marking 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.510
 inspired by shaving cream the shape of 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.270
 drive this right 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.940
 on the waist of the habit is responsible for 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.590
 canopy habits called 9.15 fair play is 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.659
 a reference to the distance that wood 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.540
 should stay with the ball than nine meters 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.880
 and 15 the mark on the lawn disappears after 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.490
 a few minutes but not everything is flowers 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.869
 a controversy has been established on the 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.479
 invention of the product 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.430
 although it created the concept is not the 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.950
 Brazilian and who does not appear as owner 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.810
 of the idea next to the fifa in 2009 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.790
 the Argentine journalist pablo silva 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.310
 claimed for the science of the product 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.110
 according to him the idea arose in 2001 and 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.780
 end of 2007 the project was presented 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.310
 by the Argentine football association that 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.170
 liked the idea and started using the 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.720
 equipment in championship matches at 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.720
 people use 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.100
 a creation that came to stay was the 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.810
 use of yellow and red cards 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.080
 few people know but it all started in 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.240
 1962 World Cup A Punishment Game 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.920
 considered one of the most aggressive 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.440
 in the history of the canopies 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.030
 the English judge who is responsible for 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.340
 arbitration of that match 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.050
 four years later she was is 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.010
 again involved in a confusion and 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.960
 world cup 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.000
 in the countryside the argentina england was searching 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.670
 a place for one of the semi-finals with 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.680
 some football and a lot of violence in that 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.300
 occasion antonio rattin captain argentino 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.450
 was kicked out of the field 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.620
 but he avoided withdraw one day directed by 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.120
 one of the streets of london 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.490
 the referee had the idea of ​​using two 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.040
 cards when stopped at a traffic light on 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.300
 color symbolized warning and 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.950
 would show that the player had 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.950
 past the limits 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.500
 it was not until 1970 that the cards were 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.200
 introduced into cups and adopted throughout 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.380
 the world that year was no red 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.840
 applied on June 14, 1934 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.370
 chilean carlos caszely was presented with 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.850
 with the red card the first in 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.850
 world Cups 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.260
 another necessary creation and gave 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.220
 the possibility of replacing 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.520
 players 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.130
 this happened only in 1970 the game of 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.200
 opening between a Soviet and Mexico 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.850
 in fact the possibility of 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.400
 change of players that was only used 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.290
 five years earlier in the English championship 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.580
 the idea was so certain that it began to be 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.730
 perfected 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.280
 in 1990, fifa only allowed the permanence 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.900
 of five reserve seats 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.710
 limiting to two the number of 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.930
 replacements in 1994 the first change 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.180
 all team members with the exception of 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.370
 of suspended players were released 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.080
 to sit on the bench but the 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.830
 number of substitutions remains the 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.570
 same 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:00.160
 2 but the goalkeeper was in 1998 that 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.770
 be the rule that the years to the 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.780
 present, besides being able to place all 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.640
 players of the bank was adopted the number 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.060
 three amendments without distinction of 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.060
 position 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.630
 this time pilots also enter this 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.870
 list 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.760
 it was created in 1970 in competitions of 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.120
 but was only accepted by fifa in 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.010
 world in 1978 by the matches 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.150
 were settled by lottery or 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.770
 new games 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.810
 curiously the decision by penalties the 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.430
 was necessary in the cup of 82 when the 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.660
 West Germany and France in the 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.200
 semifinal 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.300
 only on two occasions in 2006 in 1994 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.169
 When Brazil guarantees the Tetra a Copa 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.169
 was decided on penalties 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.479
 but not all the creation worked out without 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.129
 I noticed that in this cup I did not use the 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.629
 trolleys to remove athletes 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:56.669
 selected from field 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:57.750
 the idea came in the canopy of 94 in the states 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.699
 United 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.039
 the idea of ​​using an electric cart 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.680
 to make safety a game fast 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.719
 seemed perfect but did not advance and are 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.819
 very common here from Brazil but fifa 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:11.430
 have not used in world cups 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:12.210
 The very curious episode marked one of the 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.009
 carts 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.199
 during the match between Argentina and Ecuador 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:18.300
 valid for the cup qualifiers. 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.979
 Argentina's half-man Mascherano was 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.669
 expelled after kicking the driver of a 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.669
 of these carts 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:46.059
 that's all I failed the revolutionary 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.889
 golden goal also did not last long 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:49.509
 for those who do not remember the golden goal was 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.309
 the rule applied by fifa that gives a 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:52.419
 game closed and victory for who 

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:53.949
 score first goal 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.559
 during the extension that has two 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:58.839
 15 minutes from time was made was in 

00:05:56.559 --> 00:06:01.150
 several championships from 93 and 

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:02.740
 arrived at the 98 world cup 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.569
 The objective is to promote the 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.339
 attack but ended up having inverse effect 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:07.870
 with teams playing so 

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:08.889
 conservative for fear of taking a goal 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.650
 decisive 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:14.169
 after that to create something of silver that was 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.759
 used in the Eurocopa 2004 in which the game 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:17.740
 ended after the first half of the 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:18.400
 extension if any team were in the 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.889
 front 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.629
 fact the use of this rule was 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:24.969
 part of the Italian club for a day that 

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:26.740
 threatened to dismiss Korean player 1 man 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:29.169
 after he qualified for Italy 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.909
 in the cup of 2002 with a golden goal 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:33.659
 the player ended up not attending the 

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:33.659
 pre-season workouts 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:37.399
