that<00:00:22.850> earphones<00:00:23.850> are<00:00:24.210> very<00:00:24.600> fragile<00:00:25.289> because

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
that earphones are very fragile because

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:33.830 
that earphones are very fragile because
of<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:27.560> thin<00:00:28.560> wires<00:00:29.750> they<00:00:30.750> are<00:00:32.360> they<00:00:33.360> easily

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
of the thin wires they are they easily

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.090 
of the thin wires they are they easily
break<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:35.450> you<00:00:36.450> end<00:00:36.719> up<00:00:37.020> buying<00:00:37.610> earphones

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
break and you end up buying earphones

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.860 
break and you end up buying earphones
several<00:00:41.100> times<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.910> year<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:43.579> this<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.870> not

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
several times a year and this is not

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.119 
several times a year and this is not
very<00:00:46.260> nice<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:48.620> expensive<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:52.129> end

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
very nice this is expensive so you end

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.560 
very nice this is expensive so you end
up<00:00:53.340> buying<00:00:53.640> cheaper<00:00:54.300> pairs<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.930> ear<00:00:55.350> phones

up buying cheaper pairs of ear phones
and<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:58.109> bad<00:00:58.320> thing<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.920> only<00:00:59.699> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
and the bad thing is that only the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.719 
and the bad thing is that only the
really<00:01:01.020> expensive<00:01:02.480> earphones<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.729> option

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
really expensive earphones of the option

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.060 
really expensive earphones of the option
to<00:01:05.900> change<00:01:06.900> their<00:01:07.560> wires<00:01:08.000> they<00:01:09.000> come<00:01:09.510> with

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
to change their wires they come with

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.440 
to change their wires they come with
replaceable<00:01:12.560> wires<00:01:13.560> but<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.549> cheaper<00:01:15.150> ones

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
replaceable wires but the cheaper ones

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.580 
replaceable wires but the cheaper ones
do<00:01:16.049> not<00:01:16.130> so<00:01:17.130> they<00:01:17.549> thought<00:01:17.880> they<00:01:19.070> break<00:01:20.070> in

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
do not so they thought they break in

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.460 
do not so they thought they break in
three<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:23.430> six<00:01:23.460> months<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.990> have<00:01:25.200> to

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
three to six months and you have to

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.569 
three to six months and you have to
spend<00:01:26.479> up<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.920> 50<00:01:28.920> or<00:01:29.159> 60<00:01:29.790> heroes<00:01:30.950> for<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.189> next

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
spend up to 50 or 60 heroes for the next

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.840 
spend up to 50 or 60 heroes for the next
pair<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.880> earphones<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:35.509> the<00:01:36.509> solution<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.850> to

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
pair of earphones so the solution is to

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.179 
pair of earphones so the solution is to
add<00:01:39.799> some<00:01:40.799> tape<00:01:41.610> over<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.540> beginning<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.710> the

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
add some tape over the beginning of the

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.719 
add some tape over the beginning of the
wire<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.770> really<00:01:47.450> protect<00:01:48.450> them<00:01:49.110> and

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
wire so you really protect them and

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:57.859 
wire so you really protect them and
protect<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:51.060> wire<00:01:52.610> of<00:01:54.710> bending<00:01:55.710> too<00:01:56.119> badly<00:01:57.119> so

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
protect the wire of bending too badly so

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.899 
protect the wire of bending too badly so
it<00:01:58.229> does<00:01:59.219> not<00:01:59.250> Bend<00:02:00.030> too<00:02:00.509> badly<00:02:01.290> anymore<00:02:02.130> which

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
it does not Bend too badly anymore which

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.749 
it does not Bend too badly anymore which
is<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.600> reason<00:02:03.899> why<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:05.270> Greeks<00:02:06.270> anyway<00:02:07.079> em<00:02:08.069> it

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
is the reason why it Greeks anyway em it

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:16.130 
is the reason why it Greeks anyway em it
bends<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:12.770> 11<00:02:13.770> wire<00:02:14.129> or<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:15.000> wires<00:02:15.360> inside

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
bends and 11 wire or the wires inside

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.290 
bends and 11 wire or the wires inside
just<00:02:17.690> loses<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:19.110> connection<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.670> other

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
just loses the connection to the other

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.119 
just loses the connection to the other
part<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.650> wire<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:24.030> let's<00:02:24.420> see<00:02:24.780> how<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.650> have

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
part of the wire so let's see how I have

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:32.300 
part of the wire so let's see how I have
done<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.640> on<00:02:27.200> my<00:02:28.200> earphones<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:30.830> have<00:02:31.830> some

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
done it on my earphones I have some

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:40.460 
done it on my earphones I have some

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
look very nice but there are also

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.890 
look very nice but there are also
different<00:02:52.190> types<00:02:53.190> of<00:02:53.550> tape<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:54.239> we<00:02:54.360> can<00:02:54.390> look

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
different types of tape so we can look

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.380 
different types of tape so we can look
better<00:02:55.319> but<00:02:56.360> this<00:02:57.360> way<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:58.590> wire<00:02:59.069> is

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
better but this way the wire is

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.850 
better but this way the wire is
protected<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.739> cannot<00:03:01.739> bend<00:03:02.360> you<00:03:03.360> see<00:03:03.860> the

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
protected and cannot bend you see the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.290 
protected and cannot bend you see the
tape<00:03:05.330> holds<00:03:06.330> it<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.959> it<00:03:07.709> does<00:03:07.950> not<00:03:08.250> bend<00:03:09.030> at

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
tape holds it and it does not bend at

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.660 
tape holds it and it does not bend at
the<00:03:09.830> most<00:03:10.830> fragile<00:03:12.500> place<00:03:13.500> of<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.430> wire

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
the most fragile place of the wire

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:22.089 
the most fragile place of the wire
anyway<00:03:15.330> so<00:03:16.640> with<00:03:17.750> this<00:03:19.129> tape<00:03:20.129> if<00:03:20.489> you<00:03:20.700> add<00:03:21.080> 2

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
anyway so with this tape if you add 2

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.990 
anyway so with this tape if you add 2
centimeters<00:03:23.099> of<00:03:23.129> tape<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:25.700> protect<00:03:26.700> your

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
centimeters of tape you protect your

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.130 
centimeters of tape you protect your
earphones<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:28.140> they<00:03:28.440> will<00:03:29.159> last<00:03:29.610> a<00:03:30.000> very<00:03:30.659> long

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
earphones and they will last a very long

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.649 
earphones and they will last a very long
time<00:03:31.799> they<00:03:32.760> will<00:03:33.090> last<00:03:33.540> probably<00:03:34.110> a<00:03:35.269> so<00:03:36.269> long

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
time they will last probably a so long

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:41.149 
time they will last probably a so long
till<00:03:37.110> the<00:03:37.400> speaker<00:03:38.959> till<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.170> speakers<00:03:40.830> am

every<00:04:00.659> year<00:04:01.040> and<00:04:02.040> it<00:04:02.819> is<00:04:03.030> really<00:04:03.420> worth<00:04:03.959> doing

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
every year and it is really worth doing

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.210 
every year and it is really worth doing
it<00:04:04.950> although<00:04:05.580> it<00:04:05.760> does<00:04:05.970> not<00:04:06.239> look<00:04:06.629> that<00:04:07.220> great

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
it although it does not look that great

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:15.259 
it although it does not look that great
but<00:04:09.409> the<00:04:11.090> books<00:04:12.090> are<00:04:12.269> not<00:04:12.900> very<00:04:13.379> important<00:04:14.269> in

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
but the books are not very important in

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.069 
but the books are not very important in
my<00:04:15.569> opinion<00:04:15.739> but<00:04:17.030> how<00:04:18.030> long

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
my opinion but how long

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:26.270 
my opinion but how long
the<00:04:19.379> earphones<00:04:19.979> will<00:04:21.289> last<00:04:23.210> so<00:04:24.710> you<00:04:25.710> can<00:04:25.919> do<00:04:26.129> it

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
the earphones will last so you can do it

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.119 
the earphones will last so you can do it
even<00:04:26.759> with<00:04:27.379> these<00:04:29.300> wires<00:04:30.300> they<00:04:31.139> are<00:04:31.439> for<00:04:31.889> the

00:04:32.119 --> 00:04:32.129 
even with these wires they are for the

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:36.559 
even with these wires they are for the
volume<00:04:32.669> control<00:04:33.300> but<00:04:34.020> it<00:04:35.009> seems<00:04:35.460> for<00:04:35.939> now<00:04:36.180> that

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:36.569 
volume control but it seems for now that

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:43.369 
volume control but it seems for now that
the<00:04:37.550> Iran's<00:04:38.550> have<00:04:39.449> better<00:04:40.639> wires<00:04:41.639> here<00:04:42.379> that

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:43.379 
the Iran's have better wires here that

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:52.809 
the Iran's have better wires here that
do<00:04:43.979> not<00:04:44.159> bring<00:04:44.669> em<00:04:45.090> that<00:04:46.129> easily<00:04:47.129> but<00:04:47.819> add<00:04:51.800> at

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:52.819 
do not bring em that easily but add at

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:57.860 
do not bring em that easily but add at
this<00:04:53.819> point<00:04:54.319> here<00:04:55.319> the<00:04:56.069> wire<00:04:56.400> is<00:04:56.430> very<00:04:57.300> fragile

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
this point here the wire is very fragile

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.680 
this point here the wire is very fragile
since<00:04:58.469> I<00:04:58.650> had<00:04:58.919> one<00:04:59.310> pair<00:04:59.340> of<00:04:59.789> those<00:05:00.210> earphones
