00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
still sent me call the star technique I

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
still sent me call the star technique I
think<00:00:22.170> you're<00:00:22.260> going<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.410> find<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.769> pretty

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
think you're going to find it pretty

think you're going to find it pretty
useful<00:00:23.720> star<00:00:24.720> technique<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.560> notice<00:00:25.890> a

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
useful star technique you notice a

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.580 
useful star technique you notice a
2-over<00:00:26.609> call<00:00:26.849> sort<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.240> difficult<00:00:27.779> questions

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
2-over call sort of difficult questions

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.890 
2-over call sort of difficult questions
and<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.609> just<00:00:29.789> gives<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.000> strategy<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.810> you

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
and it just gives you strategy that you

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.549 
and it just gives you strategy that you
can<00:00:31.199> rely<00:00:32.070> on<00:00:32.099> or<00:00:32.460> even<00:00:32.489> practice<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.330> the

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
can rely on or even practice in the

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.410 
can rely on or even practice in the
timely<00:00:34.559> not<00:00:34.799> to<00:00:34.949> interview<00:00:35.430> which<00:00:35.940> as<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.150> say<00:00:36.390> I

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
timely not to interview which as I say I

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.469 
timely not to interview which as I say I
think<00:00:36.680> could<00:00:37.680> really<00:00:38.100> offer<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.580> good

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:39.479

it led to so looking for specific

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:00.380 
it led to so looking for specific
examples<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.220> when<00:00:59.580> it's<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.850> question<00:01:00.239> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
examples so when it's the question the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.799 
examples so when it's the question the
first<00:01:00.629> thing<00:01:00.900> that<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.199> would<00:01:01.409> talk<00:01:01.650> about<00:01:01.680> is

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
first thing that you would talk about is

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.230 
first thing that you would talk about is
the<00:01:03.809> situation<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.309> situation<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:06.060> you

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
the situation so the situation that you

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.510 
the situation so the situation that you
found<00:01:06.660> yourself<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.740> might<00:01:08.160> describe

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
found yourself in you might describe

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.060 
found yourself in you might describe
where<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.000> were<00:01:09.090> working<00:01:09.510> at<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.810> time<00:01:10.140> and

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
where you were working at that time and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.140 
where you were working at that time and
this<00:01:11.190> should<00:01:11.340> account<00:01:11.610> for<00:01:11.730> about<00:01:11.850> ten

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
this should account for about ten

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.630 
this should account for about ten
percent<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.570> your<00:01:12.660> answer<00:01:12.960> as<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> rule<00:01:13.640> so

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
percent of your answer as the rule so

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.160 
percent of your answer as the rule so
the<00:01:14.790> next<00:01:14.940> thing<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.420> might<00:01:15.870> want<00:01:16.110> to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
the next thing that you might want to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.590 
the next thing that you might want to
talk<00:01:16.290> about<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.400> task<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.390> very

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
talk about is a task so the very

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.450 
talk about is a task so the very
specific<00:01:19.110> task<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.650> undertook<00:01:20.100> at<00:01:20.280> that

specific task that you undertook at that

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.820 
specific task that you undertook at that
time<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.030> again<00:01:21.930> probably<00:01:22.380> about<00:01:22.560> ten

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
time and again probably about ten

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.670 
time and again probably about ten
