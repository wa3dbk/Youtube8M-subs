00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.440 
something good to weld the floor too
like<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:29.340> we<00:02:29.880> might<00:02:30.060> go<00:02:30.180> all<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.420> way

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
like that and we might go all the way

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.290 
like that and we might go all the way
back<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.900> don't<00:02:31.140> know<00:02:31.200> this<00:02:31.470> is<00:02:31.970> it's<00:02:32.970> getting<00:02:33.239> a

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
back I don't know this is it's getting a

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.770 
back I don't know this is it's getting a
little<00:02:33.450> thin<00:02:33.780> right<00:02:33.989> there<00:02:35.120> so<00:02:36.120> i<00:02:36.390> might<00:02:36.660> go

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
little thin right there so i might go

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.490 
little thin right there so i might go
all<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.050> way<00:02:37.110> back<00:02:37.349> to<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.870> bracket<00:02:40.260> but

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
all the way back to to the bracket but

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.309 
all the way back to to the bracket but
that<00:02:41.190> is<00:02:41.459> where<00:02:42.030> we<00:02:42.090> are<00:02:42.330> right<00:02:42.390> now<00:02:42.599> then

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
that is where we are right now then

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.690 
that is where we are right now then
after<00:02:43.590> i<00:02:43.620> get<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:43.890> floor<00:02:44.130> in<00:02:44.370> all<00:02:44.580> due<00:02:45.480> up<00:02:45.660> the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
after i get the floor in all due up the

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.400 
after i get the floor in all due up the
front<00:02:47.700> seat<00:02:48.000> bracket<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:48.660> that<00:02:48.840> goes<00:02:49.020> in<00:02:49.170> over

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
front seat bracket so that goes in over

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.940 
front seat bracket so that goes in over
the<00:02:49.530> floor<00:02:49.739> so<00:02:50.280> that<00:02:50.640> are<00:02:51.569> we<00:02:51.660> go<00:02:51.840> i'll<00:02:52.800> get

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
the floor so that are we go i'll get

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.460 
the floor so that are we go i'll get
back<00:02:53.069> to<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.310> alright<00:02:53.790> so<00:02:54.180> here<00:02:55.080> we<00:02:55.170> go<00:02:55.940> forgot

there so I'm gonna have to and do some

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.860 
there so I'm gonna have to and do some
piecing<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.420> other<00:03:19.200> things<00:03:19.590> here<00:03:19.950> not<00:03:20.280> my

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
piecing and other things here not my

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.800 
piecing and other things here not my
ideal<00:03:21.870> choice<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:22.410> do<00:03:22.530> but<00:03:23.450> when<00:03:24.450> it's<00:03:24.600> all<00:03:24.720> you

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
ideal choice to do but when it's all you

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.920 
ideal choice to do but when it's all you
got<00:03:24.989> it's<00:03:25.290> all<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:25.500> got<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:26.100> um<00:03:26.850> we'll<00:03:27.600> start

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
got it's all you got so um we'll start

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.470 
got it's all you got so um we'll start
getting<00:03:27.959> this<00:03:28.230> tacked<00:03:28.950> in<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.700> keep<00:03:30.239> going

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
getting this tacked in and keep going

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.370 
getting this tacked in and keep going
already<00:03:30.900> here<00:03:31.680> we<00:03:31.799> go<00:03:32.000> that<00:03:33.000> panels<00:03:33.390> in<00:03:33.600> and

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
already here we go that panels in and

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.810 
already here we go that panels in and
then<00:03:35.130> I'm<00:03:35.459> piecing<00:03:35.760> together<00:03:37.310> other<00:03:38.310> panels

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
then I'm piecing together other panels

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.520 
then I'm piecing together other panels
to<00:03:39.000> get<00:03:39.150> around<00:03:39.299> this<00:03:39.540> curve<00:03:39.840> because<00:03:40.290> my

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
to get around this curve because my

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.210 
to get around this curve because my
fabrication<00:03:41.070> skills<00:03:42.260> are<00:03:43.260> nonexistent<00:03:43.620> so

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
fabrication skills are nonexistent so

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.759 
fabrication skills are nonexistent so
I'm<00:03:44.310> not<00:03:44.489> quite<00:03:44.730> sure<00:03:44.760> how<00:03:45.299> to<00:03:45.590> bend<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.739> metal

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
I'm not quite sure how to bend the metal

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.099 
I'm not quite sure how to bend the metal
so<00:03:47.190> I'm<00:03:47.280> just<00:03:47.459> taking<00:03:47.989> big<00:03:48.989> old<00:03:49.140> hammer<00:03:49.350> then

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
so I'm just taking big old hammer then

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.979 
so I'm just taking big old hammer then
tacking<00:03:52.109> it<00:03:52.200> in<00:03:52.670> and<00:03:53.670> then<00:03:53.790> an<00:03:54.209> attack<00:03:54.570> welding

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
tacking it in and then an attack welding

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.880 
tacking it in and then an attack welding
as<00:03:55.109> I<00:03:55.260> go<00:03:55.470> when<00:03:56.400> I<00:03:56.430> go<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.510> just<00:03:58.140> pounding<00:03:58.799> it

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
as I go when I go and just pounding it

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.039 
as I go when I go and just pounding it
around<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.280> curve<00:03:59.519> and<00:03:59.970> seems<00:04:00.630> to<00:04:00.810> be<00:04:00.900> working

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
around the curve and seems to be working

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.979 
around the curve and seems to be working
so<00:04:01.820> we'll<00:04:02.820> keep<00:04:03.000> going<00:04:03.209> I'll<00:04:03.450> get<00:04:03.570> that<00:04:03.750> piece

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
so we'll keep going I'll get that piece

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.289 
so we'll keep going I'll get that piece
in<00:04:04.200> there<00:04:04.430> and<00:04:05.430> then<00:04:05.579> I'll<00:04:05.700> get<00:04:05.850> a<00:04:05.880> couple<00:04:06.060> of

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
in there and then I'll get a couple of

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.560 
in there and then I'll get a couple of
pieces<00:04:07.040> in<00:04:08.040> here<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:08.700> that<00:04:08.940> will<00:04:09.209> just<00:04:09.239> about

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
pieces in here and that will just about

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.390 
pieces in here and that will just about
use<00:04:09.870> up<00:04:10.049> on<00:04:10.170> my<00:04:10.319> scrap<00:04:10.620> metal<00:04:10.950> so<00:04:11.100> then<00:04:11.280> I'll

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
use up on my scrap metal so then I'll

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.789 
use up on my scrap metal so then I'll
have<00:04:11.519> to<00:04:11.750> I've<00:04:12.750> got<00:04:12.930> enough<00:04:13.200> to<00:04:13.319> do<00:04:13.410> the<00:04:13.560> seat
