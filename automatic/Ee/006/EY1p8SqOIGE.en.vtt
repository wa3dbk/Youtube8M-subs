modding for cable management and this is

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.099 
modding for cable management and this is
I'm<00:00:24.090> not<00:00:24.210> sure<00:00:24.420> if<00:00:24.510> I'm<00:00:24.600> going<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.810> be<00:00:24.869> using

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
I'm not sure if I'm going to be using

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.500 
I'm not sure if I'm going to be using
this<00:00:25.470> motherboard<00:00:26.240> which<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.449> an<00:00:27.750> Intel<00:00:29.330> or<00:00:30.330> if

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
this motherboard which is an Intel or if

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.030 
this motherboard which is an Intel or if
I'm<00:00:30.630> going<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.840> use<00:00:30.990> my<00:00:31.019> other<00:00:31.289> mother<00:00:31.710> board

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
I'm going to use my other mother board

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.350 
I'm going to use my other mother board
but<00:00:32.969> anyway<00:00:33.420> here<00:00:34.350> are<00:00:34.850> this<00:00:35.850> motherboard<00:00:36.180> has

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
but anyway here are this motherboard has

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.310 
but anyway here are this motherboard has
four<00:00:36.899> SATA<00:00:37.200> ports<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:39.110> here<00:00:40.110> are<00:00:40.260> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
four SATA ports on it and here are the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.160 
four SATA ports on it and here are the
front<00:00:40.829> uh<00:00:41.160> front<00:00:42.379> port<00:00:43.640> inputs<00:00:44.899> so<00:00:45.899> I'm<00:00:45.989> not

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
front uh front port inputs so I'm not

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.229 
front uh front port inputs so I'm not
sure<00:00:46.230> if<00:00:47.090> I'm<00:00:48.090> probably<00:00:48.360> going<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.660> be<00:00:48.750> cutting

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
sure if I'm probably going to be cutting

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.799 
sure if I'm probably going to be cutting
here<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:52.100> here<00:00:53.100> because<00:00:53.940> behind<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.480> little

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
here and here because behind this little

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.830 
here and here because behind this little
plate<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.440> open<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.730> can<00:00:56.760> run<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.329> SATA

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
plate it's open so I can run the SATA

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.319 
plate it's open so I can run the SATA
cables<00:00:58.289> from<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:59.270> hard<00:01:00.270> drive<00:01:00.559> up<00:01:02.090> behind<00:01:03.090> the

motherboard here and then for the time
being<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.570> run<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.990> front<00:01:13.409> port<00:01:13.740> Jack's

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
being I can run the front port Jack's

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.990 
being I can run the front port Jack's
into<00:01:14.700> here<00:01:16.400> here<00:01:17.400> are<00:01:19.009> front<00:01:20.009> port<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.610> front

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
into here here are front port to front

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.249 
into here here are front port to front
port<00:01:21.299> USB<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:22.020> which<00:01:22.290> only<00:01:22.500> have<00:01:22.710> one<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:25.250> and

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.249 

here<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:32.310> 24-pin<00:01:33.240> power<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:34.020> I'm<00:01:34.110> going<00:01:34.140> to

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
here is the 24-pin power so I'm going to

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:41.020 
here is the 24-pin power so I'm going to
be<00:01:34.350> Clinton<00:01:35.090> look<00:01:36.090> I'm<00:01:36.990> recutting<00:01:37.560> right<00:01:38.390> here

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
be Clinton look I'm recutting right here

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:49.819 
be Clinton look I'm recutting right here
and<00:01:42.030> I'm<00:01:42.659> up<00:01:43.369> here<00:01:44.930> here's<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:47.570> is<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.780> be<00:01:49.500> four

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
and I'm up here here's the is it be four

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.859 
and I'm up here here's the is it be four
pin<00:01:50.100> power<00:01:50.420> so<00:01:51.420> i'll<00:01:51.540> be<00:01:51.659> cutting<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:54.570> hole

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
pin power so i'll be cutting the hole

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:06.400 
pin power so i'll be cutting the hole
here<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.759> we<00:01:56.969> just<00:01:57.210> turn<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.630> around

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:18.460 

so<00:02:07.410> if<00:02:07.530> we<00:02:07.680> can<00:02:07.890> get<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:14.000> just<00:02:15.200> in<00:02:16.250> there

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
so if we can get in just in there

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.770 
so if we can get in just in there
actually<00:02:19.470> right<00:02:19.800> right<00:02:20.640> behind<00:02:21.030> right<00:02:21.390> about

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
actually right right behind right about

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.560 
actually right right behind right about
in<00:02:22.490> there<00:02:23.490> that's<00:02:23.820> where<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:25.820> holes<00:02:26.820> are<00:02:27.060> for

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
in there that's where the holes are for

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.050 
in there that's where the holes are for
the<00:02:28.460> cpu<00:02:29.460> cooler<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:31.610> so<00:02:32.610> what<00:02:32.760> I'm<00:02:32.850> going<00:02:32.970> to

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
the cpu cooler and so what I'm going to

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:40.300 
the cpu cooler and so what I'm going to
do<00:02:33.240> is<00:02:33.360> I'm<00:02:33.480> going<00:02:33.600> to<00:02:33.660> cut<00:02:37.010> cut<00:02:38.010> along<00:02:38.370> here

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
do is I'm going to cut cut along here

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:48.620 
do is I'm going to cut cut along here
here<00:02:45.260> like<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:46.530> somewhere<00:02:47.190> I'll<00:02:48.060> be<00:02:48.330> square

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
here like that somewhere I'll be square

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.750 
here like that somewhere I'll be square
though<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.590> then<00:02:49.740> that<00:02:49.980> way<00:02:50.160> if<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.370> need<00:02:50.550> to

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
though and then that way if I need to

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.620 
though and then that way if I need to
change<00:02:51.450> out<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.960> cpu<00:02:52.590> cooler<00:02:52.950> i<00:02:52.980> can<00:02:53.400> i<00:02:53.730> can

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
change out the cpu cooler i can i can

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.600 
change out the cpu cooler i can i can
get<00:02:54.870> back<00:02:55.110> behind<00:02:55.380> there<00:02:55.800> and<00:02:58.430> i'm<00:02:59.430> going<00:02:59.520> to

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
get back behind there and i'm going to

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:06.860 
get back behind there and i'm going to
cut<00:03:00.200> there<00:03:01.200> is<00:03:02.390> we<00:03:03.390> can<00:03:03.570> look<00:03:03.780> down<00:03:05.330> right<00:03:06.330> here

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
cut there is we can look down right here

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.780 
cut there is we can look down right here
right<00:03:07.800> here<00:03:08.270> I'm<00:03:09.270> be<00:03:09.989> running<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:11.840> cpu<00:03:12.840> power

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
right here I'm be running the cpu power

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:21.590 
right here I'm be running the cpu power
or<00:03:14.790> pin<00:03:15.150> power<00:03:15.330> up<00:03:15.660> along<00:03:16.280> back<00:03:17.280> here<00:03:20.420> flip<00:03:21.420> up

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
or pin power up along back here flip up

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.860 
or pin power up along back here flip up
through<00:03:22.530> there<00:03:23.060> plug<00:03:24.060> into<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.390> motherboard
