00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.230 
so yep that's loaded so it's a nice
firing<00:01:28.520> pin<00:01:28.820> is<00:01:29.030> like<00:01:29.390> a<00:01:29.420> guide<00:01:30.080> in<00:01:30.110> here<00:01:30.560> and

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
firing pin is like a guide in here and

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.550 
firing pin is like a guide in here and
you<00:01:32.240> pull<00:01:32.450> it<00:01:32.510> back<00:01:32.690> and<00:01:32.930> this<00:01:33.050> will<00:01:33.260> go<00:01:33.500> to

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
you pull it back and this will go to

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.490 
you pull it back and this will go to
place<00:01:33.890> but<00:01:34.130> it<00:01:34.190> already<00:01:34.280> is<00:01:34.490> because<00:01:35.410> it's<00:01:36.410> the

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
place but it already is because it's the

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.760 
place but it already is because it's the
first<00:01:36.530> shot<00:01:36.920> so<00:01:37.400> I<00:01:37.700> pull<00:01:38.180> it<00:01:38.240> back<00:01:38.770> doesn't

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
move the nice trigger in here so this is

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.590 
move the nice trigger in here so this is
the<00:01:46.130> first<00:01:46.310> shot<00:01:48.040> not<00:01:49.040> that<00:01:49.190> great<00:01:49.480> so<00:01:50.480> then

you<00:01:50.660> pull<00:01:50.810> it<00:01:50.870> back<00:01:51.020> again<00:01:55.600> supposed<00:01:56.600> to

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
you pull it back again supposed to

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.150 
you pull it back again supposed to
rotate<00:01:57.140> oh<00:01:57.260> okay<00:01:59.470> see<00:02:00.470> how<00:02:00.619> it<00:02:00.710> rotated

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
rotate oh okay see how it rotated

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.280 
rotate oh okay see how it rotated
instantly<00:02:01.460> after<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:01.790> shop<00:02:01.970> so<00:02:02.960> I<00:02:02.990> have<00:02:03.110> one

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:14.890 
instantly after the shop so I have one
here<00:02:03.530> I<00:02:03.740> fired<00:02:04.729> over<00:02:05.090> rotate<00:02:13.300> so<00:02:14.300> this<00:02:14.450> is<00:02:14.630> I

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
here I fired over rotate so this is I

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.500 
here I fired over rotate so this is I
don't<00:02:14.990> know<00:02:15.370> 65<00:02:16.370> feet<00:02:16.730> or<00:02:16.910> something<00:02:17.300> it's

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
don't know 65 feet or something it's

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:25.110 
don't know 65 feet or something it's
shooting<00:02:19.750> about<00:02:20.750> 60<00:02:21.230> so<00:02:21.560> it's<00:02:21.800> pretty<00:02:22.070> good

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.420
