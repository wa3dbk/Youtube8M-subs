00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.140
 here a picture here is the side with a 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:07.409
 other photo another break the top 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.780
 the other side and here is the back so 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.790
 with several breaks and its different 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.790
 faces available in the box and 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.140
 as well as his cat artemis so that's it 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.680
 for the present ja box feed or 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.680
 do the review 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.540
 so here is the content of the box then 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.490
 here we have a record for learning 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.760
 how to pull the face to put the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:34.800
 pedestal here is the time here are the elements 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:37.920
 so we have four faces in total 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.110
 two pairs of glasses which actually goes 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:46.950
 a pair with the fringe to be able to 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:49.860
 insert and have placed artemis and one has ten 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.100
 pairs of hands that's without forgetting too 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.120
 pedestal 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.260
 so now here I am going to do 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.300
 the video of each break I did everything 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.850
 simple so I left my face 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.220
 of origin so I show you in detail 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:10.080
 so she has a craze node to 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.140
 the back one can red color then 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.599
 her hair in fact she has wicks 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.940
 articulated here we can go back up to do 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.670
 a wind effect in the hair or 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:25.159
 movement so here is the blue ribbon here 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.159
 in the back here a yellow ribbon 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:35.900
 no but I show you his shoes to 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:37.820
 heels so articulated really points 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.110
 level of the wrist joint 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:48.050
 crude shoulders otherwise at the low level of the 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:50.960
 torso knees basin and worse 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.960
 here I show you artemis too who 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.630
 is really put me so his article is 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:00.740
 bottom of the head and a little bit of 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.900
 tail we have very similar so here we go 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.210
 for the first break I will do 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.140
 now at another break with them 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:12.670
 other faces and other hand so for 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.680
 change of face removes the bangs 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.390
 that's very simple and here I'm going to put 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:24.700
 another face with an expression 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:24.700
 different and deliver the fringe 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.770
 so here's another break so I have 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.400
 just changed the face is not yet 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.400
 changed hands 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.940
 so here's another break then there 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.880
 it's his attack so I 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.040
 changed it's tomorrow and his right hand 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.680
 point of the finger and I changed too 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.700
 to consider but the expression low with 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.390
 mouth open but joyous actually 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.390
 I really like this break 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.489
 so here's another break so I have 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.800
 changed hands so here I put the 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:13.140
 hand where there are actually these glasses here 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:16.880
 finally his mask gmi the mouth expression 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:20.850
 open but look angry and I put 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.840
 in fact this hand where it hurts and 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.889
 must still in feint of naked body 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.810
 so I'm going to make a last break 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:32.490
 and ag m the fringe with the glasses 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.650
 so here's the last break so I 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:41.760
 added impÃ´trapide smith and there I put 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:44.940
 his wine which is of course I changed 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.340
 also the hands here so I have you 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.990
 actually presented almost every 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.610
 breaks that I could do good I would have 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.400
 could also have a break with the fists 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.260
 closed I did not do but I told you 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:02.010

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:04.470
