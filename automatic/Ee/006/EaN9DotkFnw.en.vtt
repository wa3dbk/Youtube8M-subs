that<00:01:58.049> seems<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.710> be<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.829> good<00:01:58.950> strategy<00:01:59.159> going

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
that seems to be a good strategy going

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.910 
that seems to be a good strategy going
for<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.850> case<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.990> know<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.140> know<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.649> this

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.499 
for the case you know I know that this
is<00:02:01.979> maybe<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.460> question<00:02:02.790> more<00:02:03.000> oriented

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
is maybe a question more oriented

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.700 
is maybe a question more oriented
towards<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.780> jungler<00:02:04.079> but<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.350> are<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.500> man

what do you think about them overall as

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.429 
what do you think about them overall as
a<00:03:02.639> team<00:03:02.879> um<00:03:03.239> I<00:03:03.959> think<00:03:03.989> we<00:03:04.169> might've

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:04.439 
a team um I think we might've

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:06.580 
a team um I think we might've
underestimated<00:03:04.709> them<00:03:05.099> a<00:03:05.129> little<00:03:05.340> bit<00:03:05.549> and

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
underestimated them a little bit and

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.780 
underestimated them a little bit and
somebody<00:03:07.590> said<00:03:07.709> like<00:03:07.859> step<00:03:08.129> up<00:03:08.219> our<00:03:08.370> game<00:03:08.400> a

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
somebody said like step up our game a

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.670 
somebody said like step up our game a
little<00:03:09.120> bit<00:03:09.239> because<00:03:09.389> I<00:03:09.540> think<00:03:09.599> I<00:03:09.930> think<00:03:10.290> we're

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
little bit because I think I think we're

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.649 
little bit because I think I think we're
a<00:03:10.709> team<00:03:10.919> that<00:03:11.099> plays<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.150> level<00:03:12.540> of<00:03:12.599> the

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
a team that plays to the level of the

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.420 
a team that plays to the level of the
team<00:03:12.870> we're<00:03:13.019> playing<00:03:13.049> against<00:03:13.650> whether<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.370> be

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
team we're playing against whether it be

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.640 
team we're playing against whether it be
a<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:14.819> know<00:03:14.939> a<00:03:15.180> not<00:03:15.480> you<00:03:15.840> know<00:03:15.930> as<00:03:16.049> experienced

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
a you know a not you know as experienced

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.890 
a you know a not you know as experienced
team<00:03:16.859> or<00:03:17.129> vers<00:03:17.549> more<00:03:18.209> experienced<00:03:18.629> teams<00:03:18.810> to

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
team or vers more experienced teams to

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.039 
team or vers more experienced teams to
think<00:03:19.079> we<00:03:19.169> like<00:03:19.940> bring<00:03:20.940> our<00:03:21.269> game<00:03:21.599> differently

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
think we like bring our game differently

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.289 
think we like bring our game differently
which<00:03:22.319> is<00:03:22.500> not<00:03:22.739> something<00:03:22.919> you<00:03:23.220> should<00:03:23.519> do<00:03:23.699> but

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
which is not something you should do but

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.360 
which is not something you should do but
it's<00:03:24.479> just<00:03:24.720> something<00:03:24.959> that<00:03:25.079> happens<00:03:25.440> I<00:03:25.709> mean

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
it's just something that happens I mean

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.339 
it's just something that happens I mean
even<00:03:26.760> even<00:03:27.180> from<00:03:27.299> like<00:03:27.419> my<00:03:27.569> sports<00:03:28.079> background

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
even even from like my sports background

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.619 
even even from like my sports background
when<00:03:29.310> we<00:03:29.370> were<00:03:29.489> like<00:03:29.639> a<00:03:29.669> good<00:03:30.000> strong<00:03:30.269> team

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
when we were like a good strong team

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.270 
when we were like a good strong team
we'd<00:03:31.109> still<00:03:31.439> like<00:03:31.560> first<00:03:31.769> like<00:03:31.919> the<00:03:32.010> crappy

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
we'd still like first like the crappy

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.770 
we'd still like first like the crappy
teams<00:03:32.519> not<00:03:32.970> not<00:03:33.120> saying<00:03:33.329> any<00:03:33.449> was<00:03:33.569> crabby

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
teams not not saying any was crabby

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.030 
teams not not saying any was crabby
because<00:03:33.959> obviously<00:03:34.260> they<00:03:34.560> almost<00:03:34.680> beat<00:03:34.919> us

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
because obviously they almost beat us

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.039 
because obviously they almost beat us
but<00:03:35.579> you<00:03:35.879> know<00:03:35.970> like<00:03:36.120> verse<00:03:36.329> teams<00:03:36.599> you<00:03:36.870> don't

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
but you know like verse teams you don't

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.559 
but you know like verse teams you don't
expect<00:03:37.620> expects<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.639> seems<00:03:38.909> you<00:03:39.000> don't<00:03:39.090> expect

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:46.259 
here like oh crap like we've like we

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:47.449 
here like oh crap like we've like we
have<00:03:46.349> to<00:03:46.439> like<00:03:46.560> start<00:03:46.769> like<00:03:46.829> running<00:03:47.280> now<00:03:47.400> you

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
have to like start like running now you

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.679 
have to like start like running now you
don't<00:03:47.639> have<00:03:47.669> to<00:03:47.759> start<00:03:47.970> like<00:03:48.090> doings<00:03:48.359> do

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:48.689 
don't have to start like doings do

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:50.059 
don't have to start like doings do
making<00:03:48.959> plays<00:03:49.109> and<00:03:49.139> stuff<00:03:49.349> like<00:03:49.470> that<00:03:49.530> so<00:03:49.889> I

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
making plays and stuff like that so I

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.259 
making plays and stuff like that so I
think<00:03:50.340> that's<00:03:50.489> might<00:03:50.970> have<00:03:51.060> been<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.180> little

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
think that's might have been a little

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.369 
think that's might have been a little
bit<00:03:51.479> was<00:03:51.599> made<00:03:52.169> slight<00:03:52.709> underestimation

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
bit was made slight underestimation

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.629 
bit was made slight underestimation
maybe<00:03:55.379> from<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.650> other<00:03:55.769> players<00:03:56.250> parts<00:03:56.549> of

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
maybe from the other players parts of

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.429 
maybe from the other players parts of

00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:58.439 
meaning cop did work bot Lane so I mean

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.050 
meaning cop did work bot Lane so I mean
we<00:03:58.889> did<00:03:59.009> have<00:03:59.099> talked<00:03:59.280> MF<00:03:59.609> though<00:03:59.790> so<00:03:59.970> it's
