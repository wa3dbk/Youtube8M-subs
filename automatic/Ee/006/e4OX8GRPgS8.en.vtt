you can do this so I'm going to talk on

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.529 
you can do this so I'm going to talk on
a<00:00:23.189> fast<00:00:23.460> so<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:23.730> just<00:00:23.939> don't<00:00:24.090> always<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.330> lot<00:00:24.480> of

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
a fast so I just don't always a lot of

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.540 
a fast so I just don't always a lot of
time<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:24.990> what<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.710> do<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:25.859> basically<00:00:26.369> tap

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
time so what you do you basically tap

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.410 
time so what you do you basically tap
into<00:00:26.849> your<00:00:26.970> fog<00:00:27.300> light<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.699> cut<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.849> wires<00:00:30.060> to

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
into your fog light and cut the wires to

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.700 
into your fog light and cut the wires to
your<00:00:30.949> regular<00:00:31.949> low<00:00:32.669> beams<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.469> switch<00:00:34.469> them

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
your regular low beams and switch them

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.479 
your regular low beams and switch them
with<00:00:34.980> your<00:00:35.190> fog<00:00:35.670> lights<00:00:36.590> wires<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:38.190> can<00:00:38.370> use

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
with your fog lights wires you can use

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.770 
with your fog lights wires you can use
the<00:00:38.610> same<00:00:38.820> assembly<00:00:39.120> all<00:00:39.360> you're<00:00:39.510> doing<00:00:39.690> is

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
the same assembly all you're doing is

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.030 
the same assembly all you're doing is
cutting<00:00:39.960> wires<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.800> just<00:00:40.980> a

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
cutting wires and this is just a

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.750 
cutting wires and this is just a
temporary<00:00:41.340> fix<00:00:42.290> you<00:00:43.290> got<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.190> black<00:00:44.520> wire

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
temporary fix you got to a black wire

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.369 
temporary fix you got to a black wire
and<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> color<00:00:45.210> wire<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.539> your<00:00:45.629> fog<00:00:45.840> lamp<00:00:46.140> down

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
and a color wire on your fog lamp down

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.619 
and a color wire on your fog lamp down
below<00:00:46.710> basically<00:00:47.550> just<00:00:47.700> cut<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.059> wire<00:00:48.210> about

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
below basically just cut the wire about

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.990 
below basically just cut the wire about
two<00:00:49.110> or<00:00:49.260> three<00:00:49.469> inches<00:00:49.860> fog<00:00:50.160> from<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.850> fog

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
two or three inches fog from the fog

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.220 
two or three inches fog from the fog
lamp<00:00:51.270> leave<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.570> light<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.899> there<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.199> that

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
lamp leave the light in there so that

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.810 
lamp leave the light in there so that
way<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.500> doesn't<00:00:52.530> build<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.920> condensation<00:00:53.460> or

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
way it doesn't build a condensation or

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.000 
way it doesn't build a condensation or
moisture<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.809> there<00:00:54.989> pull<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.680> wire<00:00:55.829> all<00:00:55.980> the

from the fog to your color on the light
assembly<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.530> we're<00:01:22.650> talking<00:01:22.799> about<00:01:23.009> just

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
assembly and we're talking about just

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.920 
assembly and we're talking about just
the<00:01:23.430> wires<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.909> go<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.119> your<00:01:24.270> low<00:01:24.509> beams<00:01:24.720> not

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
the wires that go to your low beams not

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.359 
the wires that go to your low beams not
the<00:01:25.110> harness<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.920> want<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.130> leave<00:01:26.220> those

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the harness you want to leave those

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.469 
the harness you want to leave those
alone<00:01:26.549> because<00:01:26.970> you're<00:01:27.030> going<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.270> want<00:01:27.420> to

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
alone because you're going to want to

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.090 
alone because you're going to want to
have<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.720> function<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.590> rest<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.890> unit

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
have a function of the rest of the unit

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.260 
have a function of the rest of the unit
so<00:01:29.689> after<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.780> do<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.490> make<00:01:32.490> sure<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.670> that

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
so after you do that make sure to that

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.780 
so after you do that make sure to that
you<00:01:33.479> cap<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.259> other<00:01:34.590> wires<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.460> are<00:01:35.520> from

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
you cap the other wires that are from

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.450 
you cap the other wires that are from
the<00:01:35.909> where<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.659> wire<00:01:36.840> harness<00:01:37.200> goes<00:01:37.740> through

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
the where the wire harness goes through

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.370 
the where the wire harness goes through
the<00:01:38.640> chamber<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.210> where<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.990> two<00:01:40.140> wires

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
the chamber and where the two wires

taping it together to the light itself

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.499 
taping it together to the light itself
normally<00:01:58.530> if<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:58.979> came<00:01:59.159> undone<00:01:59.520> you<00:02:00.060> know

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
normally if it came undone you know

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.850 
normally if it came undone you know
still<00:02:00.750> be<00:02:00.869> dangling<00:02:01.259> there<00:02:01.469> because<00:02:01.770> the

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
you have the prongs just hit your fog

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.729 
you have the prongs just hit your fog
lights<00:02:20.909> boom<00:02:21.299> you're<00:02:21.900> good<00:02:22.079> to<00:02:22.200> go<00:02:22.349> and<00:02:22.560> then

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
when you turn off your car your fog

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.369 
when you turn off your car your fog
lights<00:02:24.120> will<00:02:24.420> actually<00:02:24.659> may<00:02:24.750> turn<00:02:25.049> off<00:02:25.200> by

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
lights will actually may turn off by

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.940 
lights will actually may turn off by
themselves<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:26.390> this<00:02:27.390> is<00:02:27.629> the<00:02:27.930> problem<00:02:28.680> we've

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
themselves and this is the problem we've

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.500 
themselves and this is the problem we've
seen<00:02:29.129> with<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.939> know<00:02:30.060> with<00:02:30.299> the<00:02:30.390> whole

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
seen with you know with the whole

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.030 
seen with you know with the whole
everybody<00:02:30.900> driving<00:02:31.319> with<00:02:31.409> their<00:02:31.560> high<00:02:31.829> beams

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
everybody driving with their high beams

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.399 
everybody driving with their high beams
on<00:02:32.280> having<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.700> hold<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:32.970> lever<00:02:33.299> no<00:02:33.870> low<00:02:34.140> beams

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
on having to hold the lever no low beams

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.500 
on having to hold the lever no low beams
so<00:02:34.980> this<00:02:35.159> is<00:02:35.250> just<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.459> temp<00:02:35.700> it's<00:02:35.909> do<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.299> same

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
so this is just a temp it's do the same

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.940 
so this is just a temp it's do the same
thing<00:02:36.750> on<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.930> reverse<00:02:37.200> side<00:02:37.439> on<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.739> other

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
thing on the reverse side on the other

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.770 
thing on the reverse side on the other
side<00:02:38.189> of<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.370> car<00:02:38.579> and<00:02:38.879> you'll<00:02:39.209> see<00:02:39.420> you'll<00:02:39.720> be

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
side of the car and you'll see you'll be

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.609 
side of the car and you'll see you'll be
good<00:02:40.049> to<00:02:40.200> go<00:02:40.379> all<00:02:40.829> right<00:02:40.950> good<00:02:41.519> luck
