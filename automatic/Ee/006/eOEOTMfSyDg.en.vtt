00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.060
 program that allows you to 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.620
 monitor your tough condition 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:13.790
 drives performs maintenance allows 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.699
 enforce potential failure failures 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.380
 Well, here are its main functions of the printer and 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.359
 technical information monitor 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.830
 user warning temperatures 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.840
 the possibility of malfunction 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.380
 Russian disks and so on who would like 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.309
 stranger, but the interface is known 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.430
 a company that launches a lot of products 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:36.380
 has gone 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.690
 the floor is one of them this one is called 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:44.930
 went thinner control 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.930
 2 version of the corresponding here it gives 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.110
 my 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:58.859
 hard disk state information 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:03.059
 certain state information common 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.199
 performance management more accurately 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.149
 temperature 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.369
 normal hard drive is cooling 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:13.070
 enough other information 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.869
 next update when happens 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:20.970
 Dara most likely you can update now 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:25.789
 look nothing has changed all the same 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:31.470
 the most so what is it take to scan 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:34.009
 hard drive write test report 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.850
 surface 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:43.619
 model sections size performance 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.149
 the temperature is now removed hard will 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.009
 tested bad sectors 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:52.340
 this process blinks a lot of time 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.340
 cancellation before interrupted process 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:05.720
 defragmentation can be dried testing 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:09.740
 carry out disc cleaning 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:13.040
 internet click favor to search 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.700
 traces of the internet so it seems to me and 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.910
 other programs will make deleted files 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:23.950
 content analysis also folds others 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:27.910
 Yes, do not be tony, here's another data deletion 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.380
 such a program is quite convenient 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.560
 who wants may even find not only 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.370
 trial version of the temporary for 40 days 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.940
 is free 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.980
 but also find the full version of it 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.120
 suggests utilities start the most 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:47.920
 testing start advanced 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:52.300
 self testing information is kind 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:55.100
 granted too 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:59.720
 in certain components of the computer and 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:03.019
 about your can someone come in handy here 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:07.269
 can reduce something doesn't move no 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.269
 This program moves
