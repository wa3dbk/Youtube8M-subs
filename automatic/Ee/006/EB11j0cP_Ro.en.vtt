00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.670
 Are you the last in Jesus today ? 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.900
 willing to do 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:12.960
 ultimately you want to put your verio 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.679
 if you are too blatant one 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.679
 trumpeter 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.670
 [Music] 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.500
 [Music] 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.469
 [Applause] 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.090
 that was so much time now 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.880
 balancing justice for it must 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.790
 The program is believed to stay in time 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.860
 the end effect will be the same 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.290
 People are older and have the nice moments 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:06.040
 we currently have the bundles 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:07.210
 not so long long 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.130
 continue on next 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.490
 continue as best you can the whole 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.570
 village out further on 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.730
 just right with swing 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.730
 [Music] 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.999
 [Applause] 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.999
 [Music] 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.130
 we arrived at a point where 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.289
 you just have to say yes now comes 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:41.439
 the topic of lung transplantation on the 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:43.450
 It can also be taken from the table 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:48.549
 the pessimistic side sees 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.360
 premature dead and 16 those are me 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.360
 I'll only be 18 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.789
 and whoever cheats anyway 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.649
 sometime in the 137th 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:00.880
 and somehow after all 20 years 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:04.000
 got around again and maybe 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.740
 so sometimes look for that so 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.740
 you can continue to perform 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.700
 a proud he sincerely first 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.700

 [Music] 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.820
