00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
so far so let's have a look first and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.990 
so far so let's have a look first and
foremost<00:00:36.950> the<00:00:37.160> most<00:00:37.370> obvious<00:00:37.670> thing<00:00:37.820> that<00:00:37.940> you

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
could deal with it wouldn't be music

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.990 
could deal with it wouldn't be music
this<00:00:39.739> is<00:00:39.920> still<00:00:40.190> you<00:00:40.550> know<00:00:40.640> it's<00:00:40.820> an<00:00:40.910> iphone

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
can be really basic and obvious and do

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:55.810 
can be really basic and obvious and do

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
obviously use that for simple maths so

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.750 
obviously use that for simple maths so
for<00:04:16.970> example<00:04:17.769> what's<00:04:18.769> the<00:04:18.919> square<00:04:19.160> root<00:04:19.220> of<00:04:19.519> 1

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
square root of that about that how about

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.510
