00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:15.139
 selestat the selection and clipping job 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:20.579
 it seems to be delicate particularly in terms of details around the tables ap 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.679
 we explain how to fix it 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:25.739
 she does not know where to go 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:28.919
 so be useful 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.809
 now that we have produced the main elements of our decor to 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:34.940
 know the sea the stands of our stadium and the sky and we have 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.989
 added the different settings that make it possible to obtain this result 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.219
 made visual of our decor and well now we will obviously integrated 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.290
 the boat 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.920
 to do this I go first but I go to the baldness panel 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.570
 select the first calculation at the very top of the calculation stack so 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.020
 that when I was moved the calculation corresponding to my boat which 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.220
 is this one will end up directly above the pile 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.220
 I will open the file corresponding to the boat 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.480
 I double click on the ship file 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.530
 like here and if I'm manhattan somewhere else you can see that I have 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.060
 different details that scream that to be very difficult to stoop and 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.950
 we might spend hours or even days before the east detour 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.070
 precisely all these details that make it possible to obtain realism 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.170
 at level two other ships 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.270
 obviously we will not have fun using it several methods for 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.670
 can selected all these little zeller mans 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.430
 we will use among others the sky that is in the background more question 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.820
 of a good in relation to prod and that at the level of your 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.610
 final compositing 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.570
 on the one hand the general colorimetric environment remains in adequacy 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.940
 with the atmosphere that are on our photograph and in addition we did not 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.050
 as I told you his in the background that will be easy between 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.980
 guilmette did not integrate relationship to the sky of our compositing among others 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.120
 and so to do that I'm going to click on that corresponding English 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.500
 ships and just pick up my file and to the extent that I 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.860
 here already a moving tool that is selected well i want everything 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.860
 just do a drag and drop inside demont compositing 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.600
 I was closing this image now 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.600
 and if I look in the panel and if I actually see that my boat 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.350
 was en route to my stack may as I had a deciphering layer here the 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.700
 property the clipping layer was it's humiliating compared my boat 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.480
 so I'm simply called on alps under pc we go out his match 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.699
 epic 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:19.529
 between the two here is my image as it is 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:22.529
 this image I'm going fame right now 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:27.029
 ship 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.510
 and on this ship so i will start to trim this one by using 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.510
 feathers feathers that I select here no my barghouti 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:39.869
 so i'm going to give the specific place in my picture here pulls out 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:43.089
 and submits enough inside this ship to be able to 

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:46.259
 start to divert him 

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:48.509
 so I will follow this first quarter of the year 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:49.609
 I click 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.589
 if necessary, press the control key on the option key if you 

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:55.589
 are under mac to be able to move each of these points 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:01.069
 and I continue so applied and to follow the ride of my boat 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.349
 left to shoot with the left mouse button to be able to appear 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.349
 tangents 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:18.560
 and follow from lower-ground much more accurate the hull of this boat 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:24.219
 in his way like these I'm the right side now 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:32.569
 and we have seen no previous states we can always come obviously on 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.569
 this plot afterwards 

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:42.729
 which allow customers a fairly accurate and efficient clipping of this 

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:46.849
 object so I continue I stop at the top of this hull here 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.689
 so the element that are here in the background corresponds to an element 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:52.689
 we breathe the next target 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.629
 as a kind of fat and maybe so we go his past obviously I 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.269
 will follow this curve again here in the upper part of the ship 

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:06.939
 one more click here coc you see that garlic and a curve that create them so 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:08.409
 I rely on halt 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.409
 or optionally on mac and moved this tangent 

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:16.959
 and I continue I want to continue this time in the void I put you in 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.379
 back so you can select the salt that I told you 

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:20.519
 previously 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.519
 so I clicked outside of this calculation that is currently doing 

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:26.759
 right here 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:28.039
 right here 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:29.740
 still a little we never know 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.740
 and so I come back to the first ends of my plot I click 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.440
 the plot so closed and it's this plot fight recover to make it a 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.610
 selection obviously integrate that much more realistic 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.610
 in our room 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.129
 ap 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:48.839
