00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.340
 we will study here about the design foliage and its elements with a margin 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:14.889
 lg walks 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.999
 all created design said jerry architectural mechanic 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:21.859
 samuca presented in a revelry 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.259
 this was the one of drawing presents several standard dimensions that in turn 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:33.000
 use margins that captions are necessary for identification and 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.080
 correct reading of the drawing 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.379
 the most common leaves 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.110
 used in projects 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.140
 ned and technical drawing 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.940
 are the format sheets at 0 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.140
 until five 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.200
 one has access to the expectations dimensions as in this table already 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.700
 on these sheets 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.640
 it depending on the format 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.150
 will have a specific margin for each of them 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.320
 and also in this case 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.780
 I'll also use a left margin 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.490
 captions captions also go 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.530
 vary according to position 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.470
 with the format of the foliage 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.440
 for each format of folio used there is a specific margin for it 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.490
 to better visualize what those margins would be, I'll 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.290
 layout and this document here 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.610
 where we can see here 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.940
 a block 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.480
 that contains the region of the year that the margins and datafolha specifies that in the 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.360
 if here is a cover 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.170
 I can see its turn this most external square that is spent in a cistern 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.160
 which is 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.130
 the boundary of foliage 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.079
 already ashton retain rectangle but yes I want it here 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.750
 represents the margin 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.400
 where within that margin will be my project 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.760
 etc to my caption 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.250
 what should be the upper and lower margins here 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.229
 is right and left for each leaflet format 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.230
 coming back to the living environment 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.889
 visualizing here is my table 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:17.379
 I can visualize that for the acerola leaves and the 1 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.579
 I have a margin 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:21.699
 of 10 millimeters 

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:29.549
 for from lower upper than right already leaves 2 to 3 and 4 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:35.709
 have a margin of 17 millimeters at the end of the leaf at five 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.019
 the cinemagic from 5 mm to the bottom and top 

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:42.709
 r right 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:43.769
 already for 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.349
 all these foliate formats 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.259
 left margin will not vary 

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:50.949
 and will have a 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:53.429
 of 25 millimeters 

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:54.529
 that is 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:57.249
 coming back here in the layout environment 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:59.949
 that left bank here 

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:01.919
 it will always be bigger 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:06.669
 than the other top and bottom and right images 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:10.039
 and that these three images are going 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.159
 have these dimensions 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.120
 which will vary according to the size of the was reused 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.069
 and already continuing here 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.049
 I'll tell you about the legend as well. 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.059
 that she was all mine 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:28.730
 d project should have a caption and this caption will also vary 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.480
 according to the format 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.859
 was used 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:32.999
 the dimension 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:37.019
 also will vary because there will depend on each case 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.430
 information will be 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.560
 placed in this region of the then so as to the position 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.000
 of leaves at 0 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.689
 up to 4 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:52.689
 it's not lucas until you give 4 if it's in a landscape format the subtitles will be 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:54.119
 positioned 

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:55.150
 on the corner 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.420
 bottom right in the party to 4 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.819
 in the format 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.470
 portrait not even this case here not landscape 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.750
 inafune 5 the caption will occupy everywhere 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.889
 bottom 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:12.089
 from the project 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:13.950
 here viewing 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.739
 this mine was from here action in unveiling that I have some information 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.220
 referring to the name of the project 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.909
 who was the designer who developed 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:25.330
 the reviewer 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.590
 of this project and crammed with 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.310
 do not house this information here in this legend will vary according to 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:35.980
 the need of each 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:42.390
 and so in that case I spoke of these dimensions of leaves and everything 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.580
 more 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.520
 this block here is a block that I developed with the was in it agenda and everything 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.330
 more 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.639
 you can create your blocks according to your needs and the 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:54.900
 dimensions 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.210
 contained 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.740
 up table 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.030
 Besides that 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.629
 at the time of day 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:05.300
 in first design also you will set the size of the foliage 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.500
 according to your need to 5 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:14.030
 at the time of creating the project you will also define the limits 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.490
 from today I'm 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.580
 In that case, I'll type here. 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:26.039
 on my command line the command limits inform the dimensions accordingly 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:27.949
 with the size of the party 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:29.909
 that I'm using 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:34.499
 in case here we go here I'm using one went to 0 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:36.810
 and the way he wants the detail is that here 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.770
 already with command limits active 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:40.900
 the information 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.370
 8 4 to 1 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.480
 comma 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.740
 11 89 and confirms with the 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.320
 so I'm also scaring the boundaries of my project 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.610
 for the foliage size used 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.050
 and thus we conclude the stahl where we speak of the folia formats 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.589
 and their images 

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:03.219
 as well as its caption 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:06.219
 her position on the project foliage 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:09.589
 information can be 

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:11.549
 available
