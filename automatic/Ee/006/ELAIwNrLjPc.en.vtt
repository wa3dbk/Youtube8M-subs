00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.570
 here the 7 of 7 nexus comes from 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.990
 google collaboration and asus yesterday is 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.529
 the first here of the quad core tablet from 7 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.900
 inches in the world with another record is 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.349
 the first the first solution that mounts 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.840
 android 4.1 jelly bean is born 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.060
 from collaboration with google e 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.369
 comes from optimization both on the front 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.410
 software that in the hardware platform 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.559
 from the hardware point of view 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.769
 main features are in fact 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.980
 a 7-inch format with a display 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:44.089
 at very high brightness 400nit 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.070
 allow the possibility of having 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:48.719
 we say the maximum readability also in 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.620
 conditions of full light therefore also 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.809
 outdoors 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.359
 the resolution the standard resolution 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.129
 for 10 inch 1200 80 x panels 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:56.789
 800 which means a density of 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.710
 pixel 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.050
 considering the form factor of 7 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.420
 inches that makes the display 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.370
 extremely comfortable and the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.610
 definition also of the characters for the 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:11.689
 reading of ebooks and contents 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.579
 extremely practical and multimedia 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.929
 restful 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:18.539
 another strength of this solution 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:23.369
 definitely the processor we talk about a 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:25.969
 nvidia tegra 3 quad core processor that 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.119
 guarantees fluidity and responsiveness 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:31.979
 absolute for the system not only 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.799
 also guarantees gaming experiences 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.110
 extremely addictive and extremely 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.890
 fluid thanks precisely to a processor 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.729
 quad core and as many as 12 graphics cores 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.390
 precisely features of the processor 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.390
 tegra tegra 3 this is an example of 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.909
 game and thanks to the game process 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.429
 optimized for this platform is 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.459
 possible let's take advantage of the 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:59.220
 absolutely pocket-sized informed gaming 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:02.000
 really everywhere especially with everyone 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.560
 the graphic effects and let's say the 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.439
 more advanced features than the 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.079
 nvidia platform makes it possible 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.460
 let's not just say it's a 7 solution 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:16.170
 inches that has a great value 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.670
 be a solution concerning 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.280
 usable simply usable 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.500
 precisely with easily challenged not 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.670
 goes into the palm of the hand and above all 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.820
 thanks to a type coating 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.430
 software makes let's say take yet 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.000
 firmer above all absolutely 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.350
 waterproof compared to scratches 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.630
 finally it completes an endowment 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.730
 extremely rich from the point of view 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.250
 of wifi connectivity ne of last 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.170
 nfc generation near field communication 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.090
 as regards the 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.040
 communications of the exchange through 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.230
 simply two devices of the 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.260
 failure of two devices with 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:01.060
 latest nfc wifi support 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:03.580
 we said bluetooth gps and lastly also 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.060
 a webcam centrally located for the 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.060
 video
