00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
really like it at the moment I mean I

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.299

that<00:00:57.460> by<00:00:57.699> playing<00:00:57.940> this<00:00:58.089> game<00:00:58.299> here<00:00:58.600> and<00:00:58.920> yeah

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
that by playing this game here and yeah

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.979 
that by playing this game here and yeah
so<00:01:00.220> there's<00:01:00.790> loads<00:01:00.940> of<00:01:01.059> gimmicks<00:01:01.540> with<00:01:01.750> this

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
so there's loads of gimmicks with this

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:03.479 
so there's loads of gimmicks with this
which<00:01:02.199> is<00:01:02.320> one<00:01:02.500> of<00:01:02.530> the<00:01:02.680> reasons<00:01:03.010> why<00:01:03.129> I<00:01:03.159> don't

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
which is one of the reasons why I don't

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.660 
which is one of the reasons why I don't
like<00:01:03.670> it<00:01:04.170> what<00:01:05.170> I<00:01:05.199> mean<00:01:05.350> by<00:01:05.409> gimmicks<00:01:05.979> is<00:01:06.310> like

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
like it what I mean by gimmicks is like

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.630 
like it what I mean by gimmicks is like
it's<00:01:07.299> stuff<00:01:07.600> like<00:01:08.100> there's<00:01:09.100> this<00:01:09.280> thing

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
it's stuff like there's this thing

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.160 
it's stuff like there's this thing
called<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:09.909> Deep<00:01:10.150> Freeze<00:01:10.180> I<00:01:10.600> think<00:01:11.020> it's

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
called the Deep Freeze I think it's

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.020 
called the Deep Freeze I think it's
called<00:01:11.409> and<00:01:11.950> basically<00:01:12.220> if<00:01:12.400> you<00:01:12.490> go<00:01:12.610> into<00:01:12.790> it

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
called and basically if you go into it

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.030 
called and basically if you go into it
you<00:01:13.090> just<00:01:13.180> get<00:01:13.360> hurt<00:01:13.510> a<00:01:13.540> lot<00:01:13.869> there's<00:01:14.470> compass

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
you just get hurt a lot there's compass

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.430 
you just get hurt a lot there's compass
tracking<00:01:15.490> I<00:01:15.700> think<00:01:15.940> so<00:01:16.180> you<00:01:16.270> can<00:01:16.420> like<00:01:16.600> see

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
tracking I think so you can like see

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.460 
tracking I think so you can like see
other<00:01:18.340> players<00:01:18.640> or<00:01:19.170> something<00:01:20.170> like<00:01:20.320> yeah

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
other players or something like yeah

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.900 
other players or something like yeah
look<00:01:20.650> here's<00:01:20.890> a<00:01:20.980> compass<00:01:21.310> I<00:01:21.460> could<00:01:21.640> see<00:01:21.760> the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
look here's a compass I could see the

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.240 
look here's a compass I could see the
nearest<00:01:22.270> player<00:01:22.480> and<00:01:22.810> how<00:01:23.620> many<00:01:23.680> blocks<00:01:24.010> away

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
nearest player and how many blocks away

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.650 
nearest player and how many blocks away
he<00:01:24.430> is<00:01:24.520> from<00:01:24.760> me<00:01:24.880> and<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.210> be<00:01:25.300> honest<00:01:25.540> I<00:01:25.600> don't

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
he is from me and to be honest I don't

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.390 
he is from me and to be honest I don't
really<00:01:25.810> like<00:01:25.990> that<00:01:26.380> it<00:01:26.680> really<00:01:26.890> takes<00:01:27.280> away

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
really like that it really takes away

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.840 
really like that it really takes away
you<00:01:27.580> know<00:01:27.910> the<00:01:28.300> app<00:01:28.450> be<00:01:28.660> normal<00:01:29.260> the<00:01:30.250> point<00:01:30.670> of

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
you know the app be normal the point of

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.640 
you know the app be normal the point of
some<00:01:31.180> other<00:01:31.330> games<00:01:31.540> in<00:01:31.750> my<00:01:31.780> opinion<00:01:32.110> this<00:01:32.590> is

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
some other games in my opinion this is

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.160 
some other games in my opinion this is
more<00:01:32.800> like<00:01:32.950> you<00:01:33.370> know<00:01:33.490> just<00:01:33.700> random<00:01:34.210> stuff<00:01:34.450> and

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
more like you know just random stuff and

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.720 
more like you know just random stuff and
there's<00:01:35.830> so<00:01:36.010> many<00:01:36.130> things<00:01:36.250> like<00:01:36.550> that<00:01:36.670> like

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
already I don't really know anything

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.229 
already I don't really know anything
about<00:02:17.500> this<00:02:17.769> server<00:02:18.069> which<00:02:18.400> is<00:02:18.640> kind<00:02:18.970> of<00:02:19.060> bad

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
about this server which is kind of bad

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.820 
about this server which is kind of bad
soon<00:02:19.659> as<00:02:19.840> I'm<00:02:19.990> not<00:02:20.140> gonna<00:02:20.260> have<00:02:20.410> a<00:02:20.470> very<00:02:20.680> good

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
soon as I'm not gonna have a very good

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.910 
soon as I'm not gonna have a very good
chance<00:02:21.420> against<00:02:22.420> some<00:02:22.630> other<00:02:22.750> guys<00:02:23.110> who<00:02:23.440> you

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
chance against some other guys who you

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.290 
chance against some other guys who you
probably<00:02:24.130> like<00:02:24.459> pros<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:24.970> stuff

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
probably like pros and stuff

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.330 
probably like pros and stuff
and<00:02:25.390> also<00:02:25.930> they<00:02:26.650> don't<00:02:26.800> have<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:26.950> leaderboard

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
and also they don't have a leaderboard

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.220 
and also they don't have a leaderboard
on<00:02:27.760> this<00:02:28.060> server<00:02:28.270> so<00:02:28.510> that's<00:02:28.660> one<00:02:28.870> reason<00:02:29.050> why

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
on this server so that's one reason why

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.930 
on this server so that's one reason why
I<00:02:29.650> don't<00:02:29.980> particularly<00:02:30.220> like<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.610> but<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.760> mean

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
I don't particularly like it but I mean

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.070 
I don't particularly like it but I mean
I'm<00:02:31.060> not<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:31.210> bothered<00:02:31.450> about<00:02:31.660> leader<00:02:31.900> bond

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
I'm not that bothered about leader bond

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.050 
I'm not that bothered about leader bond
or<00:02:32.200> not<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.650> be<00:02:32.740> honest<00:02:32.980> it's<00:02:33.790> kind<00:02:33.820> of

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
or not and to be honest it's kind of

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.250 
or not and to be honest it's kind of
good<00:02:34.210> that<00:02:34.240> they<00:02:34.450> haven't<00:02:36.810> it's<00:02:37.810> kind<00:02:37.990> of<00:02:38.080> good

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
good that they haven't it's kind of good

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.600 
good that they haven't it's kind of good
that<00:02:38.290> they<00:02:38.530> haven't<00:02:38.650> gone<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.130> leaderboard

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
that they haven't gone the leaderboard

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.760 
that they haven't gone the leaderboard
actually<00:02:40.120> because<00:02:40.570> I<00:02:41.020> just<00:02:41.380> turned<00:02:41.590> off<00:02:41.650> the

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
actually because I just turned off the

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.230 
actually because I just turned off the
rain<00:02:41.920> there<00:02:42.100> Valerie<00:02:42.340> or<00:02:42.670> whatever<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.180> was

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
rain there Valerie or whatever it was

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.300 
rain there Valerie or whatever it was
that<00:02:43.600> might<00:02:43.990> be<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.110> Deep<00:02:44.380> Freeze<00:02:44.410> actually<00:02:45.280> I

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
that might be the Deep Freeze actually I

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.920 
that might be the Deep Freeze actually I
might<00:02:45.520> do<00:02:46.060> that<00:02:46.090> when<00:02:46.390> it's<00:02:46.510> near<00:02:46.660> me<00:02:46.810> or

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
might do that when it's near me or

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.020 
might do that when it's near me or
something<00:02:47.260> but<00:02:47.710> yes<00:02:47.890> they're<00:02:48.100> basically<00:02:48.430> I

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
something but yes they're basically I

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.940 
something but yes they're basically I
was<00:02:49.720> saying<00:02:49.900> they<00:02:49.990> don't<00:02:50.110> they<00:02:50.350> didn't<00:02:50.620> decide

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
was saying they don't they didn't decide

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.860 
was saying they don't they didn't decide
to<00:02:51.100> have<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.250> leader<00:02:51.490> board<00:02:51.730> because<00:02:51.970> probably

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
to have a leader board because probably

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.350 
to have a leader board because probably
it<00:02:53.110> promotes<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:53.800> know<00:02:54.000> competitive<00:02:55.000> play

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
it promotes you know competitive play

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.880 
it promotes you know competitive play
which<00:02:55.780> they<00:02:56.020> don't<00:02:56.200> really<00:02:56.410> want<00:02:56.620> they<00:02:56.770> just

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
which they don't really want they just

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.410 
which they don't really want they just
want<00:02:57.010> people<00:02:57.160> to<00:02:57.280> play<00:02:57.490> to<00:02:57.550> play<00:02:58.000> for<00:02:58.240> fun

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
want people to play to play for fun

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.390 
want people to play to play for fun
which<00:02:58.960> is<00:02:58.990> a<00:02:59.230> hundred<00:02:59.470> percent<00:02:59.650> true<00:03:00.100> to<00:03:00.310> be

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
which is a hundred percent true to be

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.070 
which is a hundred percent true to be
honest<00:03:00.670> and<00:03:00.850> you<00:03:00.940> casually<00:03:01.270> throw<00:03:01.510> acts<00:03:01.780> as<00:03:01.960> if

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
honest and you casually throw acts as if

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.810 
honest and you casually throw acts as if
you<00:03:02.230> right-click<00:03:02.860> them<00:03:03.250> and<00:03:03.400> it<00:03:03.460> does<00:03:03.610> damage

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
you right-click them and it does damage

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.930 
you right-click them and it does damage
i<00:03:04.060> think<00:03:04.270> but<00:03:04.540> yes<00:03:04.750> so<00:03:05.100> right<00:03:06.100> let's<00:03:06.670> carry<00:03:06.880> on

that<00:06:44.449> you<00:06:44.479> can<00:06:44.630> actually<00:06:46.120> okay<00:06:47.139> the<00:06:48.139> fact<00:06:48.350> that

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:48.380 
that you can actually okay the fact that

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.189 
that you can actually okay the fact that
you<00:06:48.500> can<00:06:48.650> actually<00:06:48.770> type<00:06:49.639> in<00:06:49.880> to<00:06:50.330> start<00:06:50.930> a

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 
you can actually type in to start a

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:53.409 
you can actually type in to start a
deathmatch<00:06:51.470> like<00:06:52.100> it's<00:06:52.760> basically<00:06:53.030> a<00:06:53.120> vote<00:06:53.389> i

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:53.419 
deathmatch like it's basically a vote i

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:55.270 
deathmatch like it's basically a vote i
guess<00:06:53.840> that<00:06:54.080> loud<00:06:54.289> but<00:06:54.500> yeah<00:06:54.590> I<00:06:54.620> like<00:06:55.039> that<00:06:55.070> a

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 
guess that loud but yeah I like that a

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.850 
guess that loud but yeah I like that a
lot<00:06:55.400> because<00:06:55.820> then<00:06:56.300> gives<00:06:57.260> people<00:06:57.590> the<00:06:57.620> option

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:57.860 
lot because then gives people the option

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.439 
lot because then gives people the option
of<00:06:58.100> whether<00:06:58.280> they<00:06:58.430> want<00:06:58.580> to<00:06:58.639> end<00:06:58.850> the<00:06:59.090> game<00:06:59.120> or

00:06:59.439 --> 00:06:59.449 
of whether they want to end the game or

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:02.110 
of whether they want to end the game or
not<00:06:59.600> and<00:07:00.100> people<00:07:01.100> keep<00:07:01.190> joining<00:07:01.400> the<00:07:01.729> game<00:07:01.910> I

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.120 
not and people keep joining the game I

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.159 
not and people keep joining the game I
guess<00:07:02.300> that's<00:07:02.479> because<00:07:02.570> they're<00:07:02.840> waiting<00:07:03.050> for

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:03.169 
guess that's because they're waiting for

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:04.029 
guess that's because they're waiting for
the<00:07:03.229> game<00:07:03.320> to<00:07:03.380> finish<00:07:03.530> because<00:07:03.800> they<00:07:03.979> see

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:04.039 
the game to finish because they see

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:05.710 
the game to finish because they see
there's<00:07:04.460> not<00:07:04.550> many<00:07:04.639> people<00:07:05.000> in<00:07:05.150> and<00:07:05.510> this

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 
there's not many people in and this

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.240 
there's not many people in and this
