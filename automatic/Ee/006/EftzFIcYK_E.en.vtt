at what most of the time means to you
once<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.500> get<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> point<00:01:53.009> where<00:01:53.220> you're<00:01:53.399> in

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
once you get to a point where you're in

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.340 
once you get to a point where you're in
balance<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.450> understand<00:01:54.930> what<00:01:55.020> most<00:01:55.259> of

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
balance and you understand what most of

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
the time means for you because most of

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.270 
the time means for you because most of
the<00:01:58.110> time<00:01:58.290> for<00:01:58.469> me<00:01:58.939> eating<00:01:59.939> healthy<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:01.280> maybe

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
the time for me eating healthy is maybe

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.940 
the time for me eating healthy is maybe
I'll<00:02:02.460> have<00:02:02.670> one<00:02:02.939> or<00:02:03.450> two<00:02:03.689> meals<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.170> month<00:02:04.530> with

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
I'll have one or two meals a month with

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.649 
I'll have one or two meals a month with
my<00:02:05.100> family<00:02:05.520> when<00:02:05.729> we<00:02:05.820> go<00:02:05.969> out<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.180> dinner<00:02:06.390> and

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
my family when we go out to dinner and

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.080 
my family when we go out to dinner and
maybe<00:02:06.719> I'll<00:02:07.500> have<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.950> little<00:02:08.009> something<00:02:08.670> there

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
maybe I'll have a little something there

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.510 
maybe I'll have a little something there
but<00:02:09.780> that's<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.319> that's<00:02:10.500> what<00:02:10.679> my<00:02:10.979> most<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.459> the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
but that's so that's what my most of the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.790 
but that's so that's what my most of the
time

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
time

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.310 
time
is<00:02:11.920> anything<00:02:12.790> above<00:02:13.060> that<00:02:13.270> I'm<00:02:13.660> only<00:02:13.930> five

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
is anything above that I'm only five

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.830 
is anything above that I'm only five
foot<00:02:14.530> four<00:02:14.830> my<00:02:15.370> body<00:02:15.610> holds<00:02:15.940> fat<00:02:16.120> very<00:02:16.480> easily

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
foot four my body holds fat very easily

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.530 
foot four my body holds fat very easily
it's<00:02:17.350> a<00:02:17.470> genetic<00:02:17.980> advantage<00:02:18.880> in<00:02:19.150> terms<00:02:19.390> of

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
it's a genetic advantage in terms of

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.710 
it's a genetic advantage in terms of
like<00:02:19.690> prehistoric<00:02:20.320> days<00:02:20.500> where<00:02:21.210> you<00:02:22.210> know<00:02:22.240> the

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
like prehistoric days where you know the

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.540 
like prehistoric days where you know the
female<00:02:23.050> body<00:02:23.230> would<00:02:23.500> would<00:02:23.830> want<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:24.190> survive

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
female body would would want to survive

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.630 
female body would would want to survive
to<00:02:24.850> carry<00:02:25.750> children<00:02:25.990> but<00:02:26.800> unfortunately<00:02:27.430> in

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
to carry children but unfortunately in

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.370 
to carry children but unfortunately in
like<00:02:27.910> modern-day<00:02:28.300> times<00:02:28.630> if<00:02:28.780> I<00:02:28.900> have<00:02:28.930> anything

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
like modern-day times if I have anything

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.730 
like modern-day times if I have anything
over<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:30.250> treat<00:02:31.030> meals<00:02:31.300> a<00:02:31.450> month<00:02:31.690> my<00:02:32.410> body<00:02:32.620> just

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
over to treat meals a month my body just

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.710 
over to treat meals a month my body just
sucks<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:33.400> up<00:02:33.460> like<00:02:33.640> a<00:02:33.670> sponge<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.360> then<00:02:34.450> it's

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
sucks it up like a sponge and then it's

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.110 
sucks it up like a sponge and then it's
five<00:02:34.930> pounds<00:02:35.140> that<00:02:35.650> I<00:02:35.860> can't<00:02:36.100> get<00:02:36.190> off<00:02:36.370> so

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120
