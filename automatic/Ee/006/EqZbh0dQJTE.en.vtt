00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.000
 Hello, Today I'll show you how to make a delicious hand bread. 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.879
 Maybe you know that from festivals or from the Christmas market ... 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:15.379
 ... that's really delicious :-) 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:22.000
 This is such a loaf of what you roll in. With ham, cheese, mushrooms ... I'll show you the classic version today 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.500
 With cheese, ham and bacon 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.000
 Even if you do not know it, let yourself be surprised and have fun copying. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.610
 As ingredients you need: rye bread mix, water, cheese, ham, bacon cubes, creme fraiche and chives. 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.659
 To bread 

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:42.930
 I have a rye mixed bread of one 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.180
 cheap house brand taken 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.290
 you still need water and you need a mixer with dough hook 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.630
 and of course the mixed bread 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.550
 In the bowl you make first the mixed bread 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:08.010
 make everything empty 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.850
 and then the appropriate amount of water. I used all the bread 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.520
 and according to water 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.830
 reingemacht 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.970
 Now you are kneading the whole thing 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.630
 in the beginning on a medium level until it is a little bit mingled 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:46.910
 and then you can switch to the highest level 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.150
 cover 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.130
 with a kitchen towel ... and either in the sun (in the temperatures, of course) 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.130
 or put on the warm heating 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.520
 About for 45 minutes 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.119
 Then you see how the dough has risen nicely 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.020
 and has become really fluffy 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.300
 Then you can already start with your bread 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:13.099
 Of course, first sprinkle some flour on the work surface 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.019
 so that the dough does not cake 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.419
 a bit rub 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:21.499
 and a bit of flour to the side 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:31.369
 nachzubestÃ¤uben 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:35.279
 Now you can take about half of the dough out of the bowl 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:40.839
 and make it like a loaf of bread 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:44.529
 which you can then roll out immediately 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:03:05.729
 Since the dough was still a bit sticky, I made flour around it 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:07.669
 Now you take the role 

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:10.479
 and roll the dough 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:14.409
 to about 40 by 20 cm. 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.290
 Roll out, so that the dough is not quite as thick and on the outer edges 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:30.209
 he should be a little thinner. 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:40.000
 Now you have to cut the ham 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.700
 and sautÃ© the bacon cubes. 

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:52.689
 Now you can each half of the bacon and the ham 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:04:06.089
 distribute on the bread 

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:07.829
 Still a lot of cheese on top 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:16.930
 I took Emmentaler and Gouda 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.680
 Now you work around the small ends and then the big ones 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.199
 That's how the whole thing looks 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:26.930
 Unfortunately I have 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.529
 taken a little bit of flour 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:32.479
 that's why my first bread has become a bit sticky, so take enough flour 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:43.580
 When you get the bread, you have to turn it over 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.809
 so that is folded down 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:50.840
 and I added some flour on top of it to make it look like this 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:58.499
 as if it had just escaped from a pizza oven ;-) 

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:01.259
 Now the knocker on the baking tray 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.400
 You do the same with the second one. That has become a little bit more beautiful 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.430
 Then you take a knife and turn it around, so with the blunt side 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.350
 and makes 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.110
 for very large hand breads two 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:23.669
 partitions 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:37.849
 Then press the whole thing down a bit 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:41.539
 and cut in a diagonal slot at the top 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:44.550
 that's when the cream fraiche comes in later 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.949
 Open the slits a bit so that the filling can come out 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:52.060
 and then you are almost done. 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:57.550
 Then the whole thing comes into the oven. I baked the rye bread following the instructions 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:03.699
 At the beginning 220 degrees and then falling to 200 degrees for about 20 to 25 minutes 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.719
 cut a bit more chives 

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:08.389
 and your hand bread is ready :-)
