always a pretty sight let's go inside

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.860 
always a pretty sight let's go inside
and<00:00:35.489> check<00:00:35.670> out<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.910> carpet<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.570> looks<00:00:36.719> like

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
and check out the carpet it looks like

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.319 
and check out the carpet it looks like
Jenny<00:00:37.260> gipsy<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:37.980> Mama<00:00:38.219> stumpy<00:00:38.879> combi<00:00:39.300> and

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.540 
Jenny gipsy and Mama stumpy combi and
Congo<00:00:39.870> have<00:00:40.079> wasted<00:00:40.440> no<00:00:40.770> time<00:00:40.800> getting<00:00:41.309> used

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
Congo have wasted no time getting used

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.190 
Congo have wasted no time getting used
to<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.030> smartstrand<00:00:42.450> carpet<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:42.899> installed

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
to the smartstrand carpet we installed

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.660 
to the smartstrand carpet we installed
in<00:00:43.290> their<00:00:43.410> enclosure<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:44.070> fact<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.550> think

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
in their enclosure in fact I think

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.220 
in their enclosure in fact I think
they're<00:00:44.879> getting<00:00:44.969> quite<00:00:45.180> used<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.809> other

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
they're getting quite used to it other

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.709 
they're getting quite used to it other
than<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.530> obvious<00:00:46.710> staining<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:48.390> carpet

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
than the obvious staining the carpet

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:49.779 
than the obvious staining the carpet
fibers<00:00:48.960> seem<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.170> be<00:00:49.230> holding<00:00:49.410> up<00:00:49.530> really<00:00:49.559> well

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
fibers seem to be holding up really well

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.240 
fibers seem to be holding up really well
so<00:00:50.789> what<00:00:51.329> makes<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:51.750> durable<00:00:52.079> it's<00:00:52.890> all

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
so what makes it so durable it's all

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.299 
so what makes it so durable it's all
about<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.820> resiliency<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> fiber<00:00:55.309> see

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
about the resiliency of the fiber see

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.729 
about the resiliency of the fiber see
the<00:00:56.640> actual<00:00:57.059> fiber<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.930> zig<00:00:58.199> zag<00:00:58.230> coil

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
the actual fiber is in a zig zag coil

the actual fiber is in a zig zag coil
that's<00:00:59.219> built<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.640> give<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.149> then<00:01:00.539> spring

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870

on wear and tear that other carpets just
can't<00:01:10.409> handle<00:01:12.500> now<00:01:13.500> let's<00:01:13.740> see<00:01:13.860> how<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
can't handle now let's see how the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.140 
can't handle now let's see how the
camels<00:01:14.400> are<00:01:14.430> getting<00:01:14.670> along

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
camels are getting along

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.240 
camels are getting along
it<00:01:15.900> looks<00:01:16.049> like<00:01:16.140> Tiffany<00:01:16.590> Jewel<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.950> Isaac

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
it looks like Tiffany Jewel and Isaac

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.679 
it looks like Tiffany Jewel and Isaac
have<00:01:17.340> made<00:01:17.520> themselves<00:01:17.670> right<00:01:18.270> at<00:01:18.479> home<00:01:18.630> here

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
have made themselves right at home here

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.109 
have made themselves right at home here
on<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.049> smart<00:01:19.200> strand<00:01:19.680> looks<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:20.820> they<00:01:20.939> made

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
on the smart strand looks like they made

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.510 
on the smart strand looks like they made
a<00:01:21.150> little<00:01:21.540> bit<00:01:21.750> more<00:01:21.930> than<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.170> actually

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
a little bit more than that actually

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.370 
a little bit more than that actually
looks<00:01:23.520> pretty<00:01:23.790> messy<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.600> smartstrand<00:01:25.080> seems

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
looks pretty messy but smartstrand seems

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.140 
looks pretty messy but smartstrand seems
to<00:01:25.470> be<00:01:25.560> holding<00:01:25.830> up<00:01:25.860> pretty<00:01:26.040> well<00:01:26.159> we<00:01:26.700> got<00:01:26.850> one

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
to be holding up pretty well we got one

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.760 
to be holding up pretty well we got one
more<00:01:27.360> enclosure<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.869> check<00:01:28.080> out<00:01:28.259> let's<00:01:28.650> see

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770
