going<00:02:25.140> up<00:02:25.379> the<00:02:25.590> center<00:02:26.010> pill<00:02:26.159> brick<00:02:26.400> cable

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
going up the center pill brick cable

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.880 
going up the center pill brick cable
I've<00:02:26.909> twisted<00:02:27.299> it<00:02:27.569> around<00:02:27.659> that<00:02:28.019> then<00:02:28.650> onto

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
I've twisted it around that then onto

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.270 
I've twisted it around that then onto
the<00:02:28.980> brick<00:02:29.159> cable<00:02:29.519> itself<00:02:29.849> and<00:02:30.920> along<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.040> top

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
the brick cable itself and along the top

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.589 
the brick cable itself and along the top
tube<00:02:32.549> and<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.790> can<00:02:32.819> see<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.360> wire<00:02:33.569> is

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
tube and you can see that the wire is

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.259 
tube and you can see that the wire is
thin<00:02:34.439> enough<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.890> go<00:02:35.340> through<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.939> cable

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
thin enough to go through the cable

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:44.360 
thin enough to go through the cable
guides<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:40.019> runs<00:02:40.200> up<00:02:40.470> here<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:42.079> then<00:02:43.250> if<00:02:44.250> we

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
guides so it runs up here and then if we

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.339 
guides so it runs up here and then if we
look<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.760> comes<00:02:44.970> down<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:48.750> front<00:02:49.019> brake

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
look it comes down the the front brake

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:55.250 
look it comes down the the front brake
cable<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:50.010> then<00:02:50.970> along<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.140> front<00:02:52.440> rack<00:02:54.260> and

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
cable and then along the front rack and

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:02.449 
cable and then along the front rack and
eventually<00:02:56.690> into<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.780> front<00:02:58.079> headlamp<00:03:01.459> until

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
eventually into the front headlamp until

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.729 
eventually into the front headlamp until
a<00:03:02.489> couple<00:03:02.730> of<00:03:02.849> years<00:03:03.090> ago<00:03:03.209> I<00:03:03.599> use<00:03:04.079> the<00:03:04.319> Garmin

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
a couple of years ago I use the Garmin

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.210 
a couple of years ago I use the Garmin
GPS<00:03:04.920> that<00:03:05.519> used<00:03:05.760> double-a<00:03:06.299> batteries<00:03:07.220> but

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
GPS that used double-a batteries but

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.629 
GPS that used double-a batteries but
then<00:03:08.670> I<00:03:08.700> moved<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.239> this<00:03:09.720> model<00:03:10.049> the<00:03:10.319> edge<00:03:10.799> 705

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
then I moved to this model the edge 705

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.720 
then I moved to this model the edge 705
which<00:03:12.510> has<00:03:12.750> got<00:03:13.019> rechargeable<00:03:13.980> batteries<00:03:14.400> and
