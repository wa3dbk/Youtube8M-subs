00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:03.460
 "Our university" is growing and growing 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.430
 illustrate the rising number of applicants 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.930
 Since the founding year of the DTM Cottbus in 1991, the students have had time 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.269
 almost tripled 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.659
 Today, the university has nearly 6400 students 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.480
 every year, more students are expected 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.919
 but what is the situation when to explain 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:33.820
 We surveyed prospective students battering them as they distribute the Beat 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.820
 EU from March on became SN APA 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.910
 he had once again saved Koch a point 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.260
 GM's money needs had been neat internet 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.000
 Modesty lead the boiled 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.860
 the first picture came in Cottbus I had to make a good start 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.420
 that my body procedures 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.460
 one of them is a bit late 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.910
 Actually, I was to Mainz 05 drinking 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.320
 set up on the internet because there are still many friends here 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.810
 No, I'm happy so I can commute more to you from Berlin every day 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.080
 experience 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.510
 to test if Robert would do that for me too 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.510
 Dusseldorf must be ex-Essener 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.320
 an example of studying at b 10 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.550
 Number of students from or smaller groups here recently got me there 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.030
 urban and regional planning and what will become 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.220
 And Arndt Cottbus does not like that either 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.880
 to the megacity so you have already 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.540
 Ways to do it all a bit relaxed all this shows 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:40.870
 Look into the more than a good reputation 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.880
 The city is quite well equipped after a never seen one 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.390
 destroyed again 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.380
 the conciliator looking forward to the bones 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.840
 So I'm getting one 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.489
 m one for process engineering and that they are all so with technology and technology 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.250
 The more read clock has to do and that keeps me in the internet as time 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.830
 Standard the brochure below 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.250
 all windows offer 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.970
 more of a writing 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.880
 Wedel yes now gives off what then from who the manufacturer likes the city 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.169
 me 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:17.169
 Long's of Christians 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.779
 His degree programs are common reasons why you look for the the TVO 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:24.179
 decides 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:27.819
 Events like helping the university full-time for last-minute students 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.810
 Prospective students were interested in Mainz 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.009
 to impress on study contents and conditions 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:36.009
 and so make their decision easier 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.369
 Many vintages before were also in the election for a university 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:43.519
 decide 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.519
 that's her reason to go to a doctor 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:50.249
 the choice up 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:52.879
 Cottbus is percent 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.059
 that's why they fell because 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:03:00.430
 Percent mean NC from school my high school graduation was not very good and me 

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:01.539
 probably 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:02.999
 no other 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:04.709
 Faculty Prof 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.979
 who was taken so easy 

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:10.009
 and second, of course, Cottbus sets percent 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.799
 A great address 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.810
 we did not look so I did a rehearsal before 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.459
 From then on, you will be in first contact with professors and even students 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.139
 had current students 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:30.629
 Even the assistants are more sent to come and have themselves too 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.239
 Super open 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.420
 So guys are up to percent and that soon comes from the point where 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.349
 I know Dirk for years 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.529
 Theo Cottbus will not 

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:44.529
 you know a good decision now 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:48.830
 but in retrospect, I can actually say 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.210
 so that's all his justification had every single module 

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:57.299
 And all that quasi percent that every module rushes one from the whole 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.749
 has been 

00:03:58.749 --> 00:04:02.430
 Under the professors Hinum have really thought of 

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:03.739
 Structure of the study 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.709
 and of course the supervision by the assistants 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.519
 and that is all so familiar you really have to good line to all 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.519
 The professors are quite open to people here. "You can duh if you can 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:14.900
 would like to 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.900
 and you meet good friends too 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:24.500
 although the university is very young 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.500
 it now enjoys watching it big 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.539
 at the recent high so Wenking of the Center for Higher Education 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.030
 four degree programs in architecture engineering engineer cut the LED technology and 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.030
 Mechanical engineering outstanding 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.600
 undoubtedly benefits and with a long enrolls Christians and the 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:50.129
 Military hometowns of many students 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:53.080
 but in the end, it's the family who are the culprits 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.379
 the good equipment 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:58.039
 if overall the good reputation of the teacher why you decide his 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.719
 To study critics 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:04.809
 If the university shows he keeps these things with the poor, she will too 

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:07.809
 continue to enjoy great popularity in the future 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.110
