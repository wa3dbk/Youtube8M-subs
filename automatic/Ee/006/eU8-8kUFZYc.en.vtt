00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.790
 "Prevention of Ulcerative Colitis by Diet" 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.380
 What is behind the significant increase in occurrence 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.459
 inflammatory bowel disease 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:14.730
 Crohn's disease, in rapidly developing societies, 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.760
 that is, the countries where the disease was 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.529
 practically unknown a century ago? 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.160
 What really changed in ours 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.859
 internal and external environment 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.150
 and led to the appearance 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.560
 this terrible disease? 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.460
 Japan scored one 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.929
 of the most significant increases in this disease. 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:34.120
 Of all the changes in the diet 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.160
 the amount of animal protein appears to be the strongest factor. 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.360
 A sharp increase in newly diagnosed 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.899
 patients with Crohn's disease 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.840
 is related to the daily intake of animal protein. 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.120
 On the contrary, higher consumption of vegetable proteins 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.430
 means fewer cases of Crohn's disease. 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.840
 This is in accordance with our information 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.289
 that a larger proportion of plant foods can be 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.829
 beneficial in prevention and treatment 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:55.600
 Crohn's disease. 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.199
 But how inflammatory it is 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.769
 bowel diseases in general? 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:01.570
 The biggest study of its kind 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.110
 who have watched 60,000 people for over 10 years 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.930
 found that high total protein intake, 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.140
 specifically, animal protein has been linked 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.630
 with a significantly increased risk of further 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.360
 significant inflammatory bowel disease 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.740
 ulcerative colitis. 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.159
 These were not proteins in general; 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.640
 the relationship between high protein intake 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.430
 and the risk of inflammatory bowel disease 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.140
 limited to intake of animal protein. 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.280
 Since World War II 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.840
 animal protein intake has increased 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.280
 not only in Japan 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.049
 but also in all developed countries. 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.909
 This increase in animal protein consumption 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.549
 may partly explain the increase in incidence 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.920
 inflammatory bowel disease 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.549
 in the second half of the 20th century. 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.829
 And not just this study, 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:43.110
 the same finding 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.630
 Most other studies, but why? 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.200
 What is the difference between 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.250
 animal protein and vegetable protein? 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.979
 Maybe animal proteins tend to 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.969
 more sulfur-containing amino acids, such as methionine. 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.090
 These amino acids can turn bacteria into the gut 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.130
 v toxic gas smelling of spoiled eggs, hydrogen sulfide. 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.890
 Evidence of sulfur-containing compounds emanates from the surface 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.070
 may play a role in the development of ulcerative colitis. 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.400
 It is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.590
 affecting the large intestine and rectum. 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.950
 His typical expression is bloody diarrhea. 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.569
 The first mention of the general importance of ours 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.050
 intestinal flora comes from the 1970s, 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.590
 when scientists stood in the stool analysis 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.640
 most of its volume 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.860
 it consisted of bacteria, not undigested material. 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.590
 Most of the weight of our stools is the bacteria themselves. 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.680
 We eliminate billions of bacteria daily from the body. 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.590
 Bacteria are still multiplying. 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.190
 But they do great things for us. 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.819
 For example, they generate fiber from consumed 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.090
 a protective compound called butyrate. 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.940
 However, it depends on what we feed them. 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.930
 Bacteria can also make food toxic 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.260
 compounds such as hydrogen sulfide. 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.280
 It is created when we eat a meat-rich diet. 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.409
 Hydrogen sulfide is a poison from the action of bacteria, 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.790
 a venom that is involved in ulcerative colitis. 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.000
 All the time we assumed that the formation of sulfides in the colon 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.890
 it is driven by certain ingredients of the diet 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.769
 for example, sulfur-containing amino acids, 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.200
 however, we were not sure until we did this study. 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.319
 Researchers have given people one of five different diets. 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.540
 Diets differed in meat content 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.519
 from a vegetarian diet to an amount of one steak a day. 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.370
 And the more meat, the more sulfide; 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.040
 10 times more meat meant 10 times more sulfide. 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.379
 Scientists concluded that protein from meat is 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.730
 medium for sulphide formation 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.799
 bacteria in the human colon. 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.209
 The hydrogen sulfide can then act as a free radical 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.810
 and damage our DNA already in concentrations 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.110
 much lower than the lining of our poor intestine 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.909
 regularly exhibited. 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.530
 This can help us explain why a diet with a higher proportion of meat and a lack of meat 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.879
 pulp leads to the creation of so-called "faecal water", 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.909
 causing about twice as much damage. 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.530
 Faecal water arises when scientists 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.349
 to prepare "tea from one's stool." 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.090
 Biology of sulfur in the human intestine 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.599
 until recently, she had missed serious attention. 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.860
 Before, it was thought of as a mere source of odor 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.390
 spoiled eggs in intestinal gases. 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.900
 Increased creature of sulfur compounds 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.769
 it is not interesting after the addition of animal proteins 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.140
 only for flatology 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.820
 thus studying winds and flatulence; 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.690
 it can also play an important role 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.410
 in the development of ulcerative colitis.
