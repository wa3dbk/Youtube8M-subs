removing a glaze I'm going to use an

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.350 
removing a glaze I'm going to use an
oil-based<00:02:29.110> product<00:02:30.070> because<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.640> has<00:02:30.880> an<00:02:31.210> open

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
oil-based product because it has an open

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.040 
oil-based product because it has an open
time<00:02:31.810> which<00:02:32.130> gives<00:02:33.130> more<00:02:33.430> time<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:34.510> remove<00:02:34.840> it

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
time which gives more time to remove it
