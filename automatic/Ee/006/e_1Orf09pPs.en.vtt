00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:01.810
 Hello everyone 

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.339
 so here with the arrival of iphone 4 the game to the south 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.579
 reportage 

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:11.579
 m two leather cases and 

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.779
 in silicone coconut cyclone 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.470
 m I'm a little temptation that I do not have fire extinguishers 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.769
 but I will send it shit send his products to 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.800
 friends with theatrical accents 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.960
 one of our impressions 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.439
 tomorrow as you can see 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.320
 however this contract was planned 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.770
 to access 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.770
 other difference between m is out 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.430
 everything about parity 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.160
 104 so I opened the box by placing second ball 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.680
 they know each other by paying 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.100
 slightly hurt he was lying it's like it's brand new 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.600
 to these nine since 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.870
 what can we use the car 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.540
 the act of sale panic more 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.540
 in trial 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.610
 here you can see it 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.989
 the feeling that it is long 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.989
 so I guess like asthma but part of the plain 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.070
 here we rest 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.720
 with the little 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.720
 the iphone and so you can put 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.920
 credit cards I guess like what 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.300
 other fruits of this style 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.200
 he is pretty good 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.460
 round of Europe the comment 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.460
 toner you are mobile and the last 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.330
 me 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.940
 the possible idea to mague 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.120
 miku amicably because I understood 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.330
 so you see paris will have to go down 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.030
 the iphone 4 and 6 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.250
 but after we want to leave because they are used to it will form 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.909
 I like the moments ah yes agree to afp which theirs 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.040
 it is marked comfortable it allows to close well the world 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.590
 the upper part and then if there was cost of boiling water see a magnet 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.849
 here is the party has made care 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.009
 at first, we have forgotten pregnant by year well done 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:18.650
 - in any case closely involves generation well-known fame on the 

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:19.969
 market 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.159
 never worry with 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.409
 go but I have to see that
