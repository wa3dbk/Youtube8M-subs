getting way too easy they were just
catering<00:01:19.120> the<00:01:19.300> casuals<00:01:19.780> so<00:01:20.230> i<00:01:20.620> decided<00:01:21.370> i<00:01:21.550> won

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
catering the casuals so i decided i won

a<00:01:21.850> game<00:01:22.090> that<00:01:22.330> actually<00:01:22.810> relied<00:01:23.770> on<00:01:23.800> skill<00:01:24.310> and

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
a game that actually relied on skill and

an<00:01:25.720> action<00:01:26.200> based<00:01:26.470> MMO<00:01:27.100> is<00:01:27.610> about<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.660> closest

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
an action based MMO is about the closest

an action based MMO is about the closest
that<00:01:29.260> i<00:01:29.320> think<00:01:29.440> you<00:01:29.740> can<00:01:29.920> get<00:01:30.100> to<00:01:30.250> it<00:01:30.430> like<00:01:31.210> all

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
that i think you can get to it like all

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.280 
that i think you can get to it like all
of<00:01:32.230> my<00:01:32.380> attacks<00:01:32.740> are<00:01:33.280> based<00:01:34.120> off<00:01:34.390> of<00:01:34.450> my<00:01:34.960> key

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
of my attacks are based off of my key

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.970 
of my attacks are based off of my key
clicks<00:01:35.640> see<00:01:36.640> right<00:01:37.570> there<00:01:37.810> I<00:01:38.080> could<00:01:38.350> do<00:01:38.470> combos

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 
clicks see right there I could do combos

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.900 
clicks see right there I could do combos
and<00:01:39.510> then<00:01:40.510> I<00:01:40.540> can<00:01:40.840> do<00:01:41.050> my<00:01:41.920> special<00:01:42.370> moves<00:01:42.580> just

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
and then I can do my special moves just

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.610 
and then I can do my special moves just
all<00:01:43.180> the<00:01:43.570> key<00:01:43.750> bindings<00:01:44.200> that<00:01:44.260> are<00:01:44.440> all<00:01:44.500> my

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
all the key bindings that are all my

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.580 
all the key bindings that are all my
action<00:01:44.980> bars<00:01:45.190> so<00:01:46.030> I<00:01:46.060> mean<00:01:46.270> it's<00:01:46.450> very<00:01:46.750> user

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
at least again the bugs fixed that who

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.620 
at least again the bugs fixed that who
came<00:02:17.980> out<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.400> you<00:02:18.880> can't<00:02:19.120> really<00:02:19.270> blame<00:02:19.510> them

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
came out and you can't really blame them

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.410 
came out and you can't really blame them
for<00:02:19.840> having<00:02:20.230> bugs<00:02:20.520> like<00:02:21.520> it's<00:02:21.880> a<00:02:22.000> brand<00:02:22.300> new

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
for having bugs like it's a brand new

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.420 
for having bugs like it's a brand new
game<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.870> game's<00:02:23.050> been<00:02:23.260> out<00:02:23.380> for<00:02:23.620> maybe<00:02:24.130> two

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
game the game's been out for maybe two

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.400 
game the game's been out for maybe two
weeks<00:02:24.640> I<00:02:24.880> think<00:02:26.700> so<00:02:27.700> it's<00:02:28.600> just<00:02:28.870> ridiculous

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
weeks I think so it's just ridiculous

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.660 
weeks I think so it's just ridiculous
that<00:02:29.560> people<00:02:29.620> are<00:02:29.980> expecting<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:30.640> be

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
that people are expecting it to be

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.270 
that people are expecting it to be
completely<00:02:31.540> polished<00:02:32.110> even<00:02:32.860> games<00:02:33.070> like

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
completely polished even games like

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.710 
completely polished even games like
World<00:02:33.490> of<00:02:33.550> Warcraft<00:02:33.940> aren't<00:02:34.210> polished<00:02:34.390> all

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
World of Warcraft aren't polished all

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.060 
World of Warcraft aren't polished all
the<00:02:34.870> time<00:02:35.130> when<00:02:37.290> they've<00:02:38.290> been<00:02:38.320> out<00:02:38.650> for<00:02:38.890> five

the time when they've been out for five
years<00:02:39.400> or<00:02:39.700> something<00:02:39.940> like<00:02:40.090> that<00:02:40.500> but<00:02:41.500> yeah

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
years or something like that but yeah

of<00:03:48.010> Warcraft<00:03:48.520> but<00:03:48.820> they're<00:03:49.060> not<00:03:49.180> those<00:03:49.959> are

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
actually a lot like battlegrounds

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.150 
actually a lot like battlegrounds

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
they're all objective based you can see

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.430 
they're all objective based you can see
arenas<00:04:00.160> PvP<00:04:00.730> they<00:04:01.209> have<00:04:01.390> one<00:04:02.050> where<00:04:02.200> you<00:04:02.290> go<00:04:02.410> to

Australia that's the capture and hold
kind<00:04:05.950> of<00:04:06.040> like<00:04:06.160> a<00:04:06.190> rapey<00:04:06.610> basin<00:04:07.090> type

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
kind of like a rapey basin type

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.590 
kind of like a rapey basin type
battleground<00:04:08.709> they<00:04:09.400> have<00:04:09.610> STAR<00:04:09.970> Labs<00:04:10.000> king<00:04:10.480> of

the<00:04:10.660> hill<00:04:12.480> pretty<00:04:13.480> much<00:04:13.690> just<00:04:13.870> control<00:04:14.350> one

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
the hill pretty much just control one

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.300 
the hill pretty much just control one
area<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:15.550> whoever<00:04:16.209> controls<00:04:16.660> that<00:04:17.250> starts<00:04:18.250> to

area and whoever controls that starts to

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.120 
area and whoever controls that starts to

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.240 
get points and then moon the moon that
is<00:04:21.400> probably<00:04:21.609> one<00:04:22.480> of<00:04:22.510> the<00:04:22.690> most<00:04:22.870> fun<00:04:23.260> ones<00:04:23.650> so

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
is probably one of the most fun ones so

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.850 
is probably one of the most fun ones so
far<00:04:24.580> because<00:04:25.120> it's<00:04:25.330> not<00:04:25.450> too<00:04:25.780> big<00:04:26.050> there's<00:04:26.680> not

too many people

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.090 
too many people
it's<00:04:29.190> a<00:04:29.280> capture<00:04:29.610> the<00:04:29.640> flag<00:04:29.750> map<00:04:30.890> but<00:04:31.890> the

it's a capture the flag map but the

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.490 
it's a capture the flag map but the
thing<00:04:32.340> that<00:04:32.370> I<00:04:32.580> have<00:04:32.820> a<00:04:32.850> problem<00:04:33.330> with<00:04:33.510> is<00:04:33.810> you

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
thing that I have a problem with is you

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.560 
thing that I have a problem with is you
don't<00:04:34.650> need<00:04:34.920> to<00:04:35.070> capture<00:04:35.280> the<00:04:35.610> flag<00:04:35.850> to<00:04:36.180> win<00:04:36.360> in

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
don't need to capture the flag to win in

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.530 
don't need to capture the flag to win in
that<00:04:36.720> game<00:04:36.990> I<00:04:37.310> see<00:04:38.310> a<00:04:38.340> lot<00:04:38.610> of<00:04:38.640> teams<00:04:38.970> going<00:04:39.270> in

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
that game I see a lot of teams going in

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.680 
that game I see a lot of teams going in
there<00:04:39.750> and<00:04:40.020> turtling<00:04:40.770> and<00:04:41.180> if<00:04:42.180> you<00:04:42.510> get<00:04:42.660> a

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
there and turtling and if you get a

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.180 
there and turtling and if you get a
certain<00:04:42.960> amount<00:04:43.020> of<00:04:43.290> kills<00:04:43.470> then<00:04:43.740> you<00:04:43.830> get<00:04:43.950> 5

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
certain amount of kills then you get 5

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.540 
certain amount of kills then you get 5
points<00:04:44.220> towards<00:04:45.060> your<00:04:45.680> total<00:04:46.680> score<00:04:46.800> and<00:04:47.490> I

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
points towards your total score and I

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.300 
points towards your total score and I
think<00:04:47.640> the<00:04:47.940> score<00:04:48.330> goes<00:04:48.540> up<00:04:48.570> to<00:04:48.870> 100<00:04:49.380> so<00:04:50.070> if<00:04:50.190> you

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
think the score goes up to 100 so if you

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.340 
think the score goes up to 100 so if you
just<00:04:50.430> turtle<00:04:50.850> the<00:04:50.940> whole<00:04:51.120> game<00:04:51.390> you<00:04:52.050> can<00:04:52.200> get

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
just turtle the whole game you can get

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.960 
just turtle the whole game you can get
points<00:04:52.650> granted<00:04:52.980> when<00:04:53.130> you<00:04:53.250> capture<00:04:53.640> the<00:04:53.760> flag

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
points granted when you capture the flag

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.370 
points granted when you capture the flag
I<00:04:54.360> think<00:04:54.990> you<00:04:55.110> get<00:04:55.230> like<00:04:55.410> 15<00:04:55.830> points<00:04:56.310> so<00:04:56.670> that

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
I think you get like 15 points so that

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.790 
I think you get like 15 points so that
it<00:04:58.380> hastens<00:04:59.130> the<00:04:59.760> whole<00:05:00.600> progress<00:05:01.170> or<00:05:01.440> the

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
it hastens the whole progress or the

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.710 
it hastens the whole progress or the
whole<00:05:01.980> process<00:05:02.420> but<00:05:03.420> I<00:05:03.780> see<00:05:04.200> a<00:05:04.230> lot<00:05:04.470> of<00:05:04.530> people

whole process but I see a lot of people

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.840 
whole process but I see a lot of people
