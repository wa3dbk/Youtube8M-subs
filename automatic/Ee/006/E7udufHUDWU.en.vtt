00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.519
 those fans of the saga call of 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.830
 duty here I'll be with Ivan forever 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.230
 we are going to comment on a news item about 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.820
 filtration of the new trailer of this 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.830
 game is worth what will be the new 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.420
 call of duty called advanced software 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.189
 farc we go with them and good kids 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.840
 Well first let's see a little 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.060
 news that everything has gone officially 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.980
 what they have put and published and then 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.779
 we are going to give you our opinion of the game 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.189
 what we think and such the first thing that they have 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.840
 said the following thing I'm going to read 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.690
 literally activision has announced 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.820
 call of duty advanced warfare 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.350
 a new delivery of his from his popular 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.730
 subjective shooter the company has 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.590
 announced the release date and has 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.690
 published the first trailer that has 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.870
 surprised by the appearance of kevin 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.120
 virtual spacey that is a character from 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.030
 action or is it a character of life 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.129
 real not an actor if it's also call of 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.920
 duty to the tank warfare is being 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.690
 developed by sledgehammer that are 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.670
 those of call of duty modern warfare 3 and 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.980
 apparently it will reach our consoles 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.960
 on November 4 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.000
 I do not know if you know that this company is for 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.340
 so to say it new by creating a game just 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.110
 since at the beginning then the modern 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.060
 warfare 3 and that helped the creation 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.500
 of the game next to activision but this 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.110
 Once it would be said that it is the first time 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.430
 be a little alone creating a game 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.660
 so good the truth is that we have 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.640
 much hope in it and then what 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.440
 we will comment and keep reading 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.940
 not yet announced 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.009
 launching platforms although all 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.210
 It indicates that will soon arrive 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.850
 both to the new generation consoles 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.619
 like the old ones also also for pc 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.770
 activision has published a first 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.720
 trailer in xbox one which means that 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.369
 also they have some sort of agreement 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.490
 exclusivity as in previous deliveries 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.990
 that's the video game also apparently 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.030
 will be developed in a future in which 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.950
 there is much more technology and armament 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.899
 advanced with costumes that give skills 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.460
 superhuman to soldiers as per 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.810
 super strength super jump example 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.880
 they have also been confirmed the 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.649
 participation of the actor kevin spacey 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.960
 as I had said previously they were going 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.289
 making a version of your paper in 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.330
 house of cards, yes, kids, that's 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.220
 everything they have put and such you already know 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.959
 that in the description you will have the links 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.310
 the links to see all the 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:11.489
 videos and that's for sure 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.319
 because of the link they are erasing it or not 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.910
 I know if I left it but well if I 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.560
 delete the insurance that will appear elsewhere 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.620
 and in another place and good and the trailer 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.480
 once filtered they are not going to back out 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.340
 that is, if you are going to have it available 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.200
 all the time and nothing kids 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.239
 now let's give you a little 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.180
 opinion that we think the game and such the 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.250
 truth is that I liked about 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.540
 everything that makes it a new 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.209
 developer so to speak not because 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.209
 this may bring us something new 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.850
 novelty that is not a bit of a 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.290
 new air that you have a new air to 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.120
 what would the game be after the disappointment 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.310
 that we have taken with call of duty 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.569
 cost that good then also you know 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.250
 that then everything can be surprising because 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.630
 the trailers remember the trailer of 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.310
 call of duty goes that also seemed 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.410
 something spectacular something totally new 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.810
 new news a lot of new 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.180
 options that they had gotten and good then 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.760
 the disappointment was quite present yes 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.950
 Well what you do notice is that this 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.720
 game is already developed for new 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.750
 generation is worth later can it be that what 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.400
 adapt for xbox 360 playstation3 but 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.320
 what is the trailer is very clear that 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.730
 It has an impressive graphic quality 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.170
 that is the first time that I 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.940
 changes and so big in a call of duty 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.000
 so the truth is that he promises no and 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.409
 above all, what I liked the most 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.360
 is that as has put a new 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.709
 developer and me the trailer 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.690
 he liked it because yes there are things that 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.760
 it seems that they will change even if only 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.560
 has shown in campaign mode because that's 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.870
 take it sex outfits these give you 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.519
 super strength that you do super jumps and 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.220
 good grenades that show you the 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.870
 enemies there are things I do not know a little weird and 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.760
 different what is important because 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.980
 we already know that the call of duty does not have 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.280
 already a little scratched is worth a game 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.349
 but there's already so much of the same thing that 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.640
 end you get tired not so you need a 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.410
 new air I think this is what can 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.239
 give but yes I believe that I am totally 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.459
 I totally agree I think that 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.989
 this new developer precisely 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.269
 I think I 've put it here to give a 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.950
 fresh air because I truly already 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.109
 Mainly for people already is 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.549
 tired of always the same and good 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.870
 we hope that they fulfill their objective that 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.450
 I truly believe that that is their 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.670
 aim to make you bring back 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.739
 those people who were fans of 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.060
 this saga of videogames and good is 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.650
 possible that they can get it but 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.940
 we still do not know anything else this is what 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.799
 that has leaked this is what is 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.329
 he knows the news is very scarce 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.370
 neither can we affirm 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.650
 deny in nothing because truly 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.060
 there's nothing all it's fog so good 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.889
 little by little over these days a 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.120
 Once filtering filtered the trailer is very 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.639
 possible that they start to come out more 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.110
 news already official because once 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.300
 filtering the trailer it's clear that already 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.250
 they will start to lengthen to drop tongue 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.199
 already and there telling us more along 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.550
 these days it is very clear that 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.889
 from now on, many 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.259
 more news and in the e3 surely that 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.210
 in a little while they will present the 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:49.830
 game and so on and we can see everything 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.020
 how is it going to be a little bit 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.520
 over to see if in a few days they present 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.990
 online since the mode has gone out 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.659
 campaign I really want to see the 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.460
 online and well then basically on 4 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:02.250
 November confirmed that the game will come out 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.900
 since a little less because something of 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.610
 this call of duty cause is a bit 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.930
 of suffering because nobody likes or 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.849
 is almost nobody likes and I'm 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.979
 wishing that they take out another one of almost all the 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:13.319
 world is on target 2 because it is the 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:16.169
 so to speak the best there is 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:17.069
 after good the modern warfare 2 and 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.719
 everyone was fine but 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:20.460
 basically what people will play most 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:22.439
 that nothing is white 2 I suppose 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.449
 because good for me is also the best 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:26.009
 and I'm not saying that they take out a 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.820
 new call of duty with a new environment 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.330
 what 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:32.280
 it is very playable that many things change 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.200
 but still have that essence of 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.940
 call of duty has not been good because I 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.070
 I think we're going to fire something here 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.990
 more than to say nothing is missing but go 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.990
 queuing and for November 4 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.800
 nothing simply this I hope that you 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.080
 have liked the news as always 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.370
 us for us is how we are channels 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.650
 that we also upload this kind of 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.420
 shooters well we like to give this kind of 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.650
