MSR pocket rocket you see my review of
the<00:00:10.410> pocket<00:00:10.800> rocket<00:00:10.889> before<00:00:11.370> I'll<00:00:11.490> just

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
the pocket rocket before I'll just

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.280 
the pocket rocket before I'll just
annotate<00:00:12.030> it<00:00:12.210> in<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.480> corner<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:12.990> you<00:00:13.080> can

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
annotate it in the corner so you can

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.320 
annotate it in the corner so you can
take<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.469> look<00:00:13.650> at<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:13.889> if<00:00:14.099> you<00:00:14.190> want<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:15.150> is

firstly there we go we've got the piezo

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.349 
firstly there we go we've got the piezo
liner<00:01:01.190> just<00:01:02.190> like<00:01:02.399> on<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.730> inside<00:01:02.760> there<00:01:03.329> i

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
liner just like on the inside there i

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.880 
liner just like on the inside there i
don't<00:01:03.600> know<00:01:03.690> why<00:01:03.870> they<00:01:04.049> included<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.650> I'd

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
don't know why they included this I'd

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.070 
don't know why they included this I'd
rather<00:01:05.070> just<00:01:05.339> use<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.580> lighter<00:01:05.939> or<00:01:06.090> by<00:01:06.600> Clinton

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
rather just use a lighter or by Clinton

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.950 
rather just use a lighter or by Clinton
steal<00:01:07.409> something<00:01:07.920> like<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.720> seems<00:01:09.720> like<00:01:09.900> a

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
steal something like that seems like a

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.280 
steal something like that seems like a
lot<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.200> extra<00:01:10.590> weight<00:01:10.710> for<00:01:11.040> no<00:01:11.369> real<00:01:11.549> reason

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
lot of extra weight for no real reason

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.440 
lot of extra weight for no real reason
so<00:01:13.290> here's<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.619> stove<00:01:13.799> itself<00:01:14.189> warning<00:01:15.150> label

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
so here's the stove itself warning label

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.880 
so here's the stove itself warning label
of<00:01:15.540> course<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:15.990> always<00:01:16.259> larger<00:01:16.500> than<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
of course is always larger than the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.320 
of course is always larger than the
stove<00:01:17.159> makes<00:01:17.820> no<00:01:18.030> sense<00:01:18.270> for<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.689> either<00:01:18.869> and

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
stove makes no sense for that either and

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.760 
stove makes no sense for that either and
from<00:01:21.330> what<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.540> understand<00:01:22.110> all<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.470> have<00:01:22.619> to

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
from what I understand all you have to

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.580 
from what I understand all you have to
do<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.220> twist<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.119> legs<00:01:24.299> out<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.750> then<00:01:25.259> twist

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
do is twist the legs out and then twist

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.219 
do is twist the legs out and then twist
them<00:01:25.860> up<00:01:26.030> so<00:01:27.030> kind<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.360> pull<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.720> boat<00:01:27.930> and

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
them up so kind of pull the boat and

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.260 
them up so kind of pull the boat and
then<00:01:28.710> twist<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.310> up<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.759> I'll<00:01:29.820> show<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.119> with

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
then twist it up so I'll show you with

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.240 
then twist it up so I'll show you with
this<00:01:30.450> one<00:01:30.659> kind<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.500> pull<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.740> out<00:01:31.860> as<00:01:31.979> far<00:01:32.159> as

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
this one kind of pull it out as far as

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.130 
this one kind of pull it out as far as
it<00:01:32.340> goes<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.670> way<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.060> then<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.689> twist<00:01:33.930> it

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
it goes that way and then you twist it

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.800 
it goes that way and then you twist it
all<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> way<00:01:34.500> around<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.100> top<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:36.600> there's

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
all the way around to the top so there's

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.109 
all the way around to the top so there's
a<00:01:36.900> stove<00:01:37.229> oh<00:01:37.470> all<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.400> legs<00:01:38.579> are<00:01:38.729> out<00:01:38.820> as<00:01:38.909> far

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
a stove oh all the legs are out as far

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.810 
a stove oh all the legs are out as far
as<00:01:39.210> they<00:01:39.360> can<00:01:39.420> go<00:01:39.570> on<00:01:39.869> there<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.490> I'll<00:01:41.490> just

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
as they can go on there and I'll just

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.639 
as they can go on there and I'll just
turn<00:01:42.090> off<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.299> camera<00:01:42.420> for<00:01:42.840> now<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.140> I'll<00:01:43.259> set

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
turn off the camera for now and I'll set

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.950 
turn off the camera for now and I'll set
it<00:01:43.680> up<00:01:43.860> on<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.310> ISO<00:01:44.549> pro<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.600> i'll<00:01:45.780> probably

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
it up on the ISO pro and i'll probably

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.570 
it up on the ISO pro and i'll probably
get<00:01:46.140> out<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.799> it's<00:01:46.920> our<00:01:47.040> pocket

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
get out the and it's our pocket

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.150 
get out the and it's our pocket
as<00:01:47.760> well<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.840> I'll<00:01:48.900> take<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.290> side<00:01:49.350> off<00:01:49.770> so

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
as well and I'll take this side off so

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.650 
as well and I'll take this side off so
it's<00:01:50.490> not<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.910> way<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.240> then<00:01:51.330> I'll<00:01:51.450> light

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
it's not in the way and then I'll light

00:01:51.660 --> 00:02:09.080 
it's not in the way and then I'll light
it<00:01:51.690> up<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.080> I'll<00:01:52.170> show<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.590> how<00:01:52.800> it<00:01:52.890> works

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.889 

so<00:02:10.090> I<00:02:10.119> thought<00:02:10.240> I'd<00:02:10.420> just<00:02:10.479> do<00:02:10.720> a<00:02:10.750> quick

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
so I thought I'd just do a quick

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.800 
so I thought I'd just do a quick
comparison<00:02:11.170> here<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.190> micro<00:02:12.760> rocket<00:02:13.240> to<00:02:13.780> the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
comparison here the micro rocket to the

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.220 
comparison here the micro rocket to the
pocket<00:02:14.440> rocket<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:15.550> as<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.819> can<00:02:16.000> see<00:02:16.420> they're

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
pocket rocket so as you can see they're

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.050 
pocket rocket so as you can see they're
pretty<00:02:17.440> much<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.770> same<00:02:17.920> idea<00:02:18.340> when<00:02:18.700> screens

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
pretty much the same idea when screens

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.240 
pretty much the same idea when screens
the<00:02:19.240> same<00:02:19.480> looks<00:02:20.230> like<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.560> burners<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:20.950> little

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
the same looks like the burners a little

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.850 
the same looks like the burners a little
bit<00:02:21.400> smaller<00:02:21.819> on<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.200> micro<00:02:23.200> rocket<00:02:23.560> than<00:02:23.709> it

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
bit smaller on the micro rocket than it

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.610 
bit smaller on the micro rocket than it
is<00:02:24.010> on<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.280> pocket<00:02:24.670> rocket<00:02:24.819> here<00:02:25.239> as<00:02:26.140> far<00:02:26.440> as

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
is on the pocket rocket here as far as

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.490 
is on the pocket rocket here as far as
the<00:02:26.920> pot<00:02:27.370> stands<00:02:27.760> go<00:02:28.150> they<00:02:28.480> are<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.660> little<00:02:29.200> bit

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
the pot stands go they are a little bit

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.010 
the pot stands go they are a little bit
wider<00:02:29.970> not<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.000> huge<00:02:31.270> amount<00:02:31.360> i<00:02:31.780> don't<00:02:31.930> really

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
wider not a huge amount i don't really

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.740 
wider not a huge amount i don't really
know<00:02:32.140> how<00:02:32.440> i<00:02:32.470> can<00:02:32.590> show<00:02:32.920> you<00:02:32.950> that<00:02:33.190> but<00:02:33.750> i'm

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
know how i can show you that but i'm

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.680 
know how i can show you that but i'm
kind<00:02:35.050> of<00:02:35.110> see<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.380> here<00:02:36.270> it's<00:02:37.270> a<00:02:37.360> little<00:02:37.569> bit

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
kind of see it here it's a little bit

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.740 
kind of see it here it's a little bit
further<00:02:37.989> apart<00:02:39.030> so<00:02:40.030> it's<00:02:40.180> not<00:02:40.300> a<00:02:40.360> huge<00:02:40.450> amount

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
further apart so it's not a huge amount

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.690 
further apart so it's not a huge amount
of<00:02:41.080> difference<00:02:41.260> but<00:02:41.620> it<00:02:41.739> may<00:02:41.860> help<00:02:42.070> for<00:02:42.489> some

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
of difference but it may help for some

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.610 
of difference but it may help for some
of<00:02:42.820> the<00:02:42.910> pot<00:02:43.180> instability<00:02:44.080> issues<00:02:44.200> that

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
of the pot instability issues that

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.080 
of the pot instability issues that
people<00:02:44.860> are<00:02:45.130> saying<00:02:45.370> they<00:02:45.489> were<00:02:45.550> having<00:02:45.940> with

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
people are saying they were having with

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.690 
people are saying they were having with
the<00:02:46.330> pocket<00:02:46.840> rocket<00:02:47.040> but<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.190> windscreen<00:02:48.459> is

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
the pocket rocket but the windscreen is

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.250 
the pocket rocket but the windscreen is
the<00:02:48.790> same<00:02:49.000> just<00:02:49.180> a<00:02:49.300> little<00:02:49.510> bit<00:02:49.600> smaller<00:02:49.900> and

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
the same just a little bit smaller and

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.199 
the same just a little bit smaller and
the<00:02:50.650> actual<00:02:50.980> burner<00:02:51.310> talk<00:02:51.610> is<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:51.880> little<00:02:52.090> bit

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
the actual burner talk is a little bit

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.400 
the actual burner talk is a little bit
smaller<00:02:52.450> as<00:02:52.780> well<00:02:53.069> so<00:02:54.450> i'm<00:02:55.450> just<00:02:55.510> going<00:02:55.780> to<00:02:55.840> put

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
smaller as well so i'm just going to put

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.350 
smaller as well so i'm just going to put
it<00:02:56.500> on<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.830> my<00:02:56.950> ISIL<00:02:57.310> pro<00:02:57.489> canister<00:02:58.000> here<00:02:58.239> and

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
it on to my ISIL pro canister here and

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.390 
it on to my ISIL pro canister here and
then<00:02:58.450> I'll<00:02:58.569> light<00:02:58.750> it<00:02:58.780> up<00:02:59.010> I'm<00:03:00.010> going<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.220> try

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
then I'll light it up I'm going to try

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.390 
then I'll light it up I'm going to try
and<00:03:00.430> use<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:01.530> piezo<00:03:02.530> lighter<00:03:02.830> here<00:03:03.130> as<00:03:03.250> well

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
and use the piezo lighter here as well

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:14.460 
and use the piezo lighter here as well
just<00:03:03.700> to<00:03:03.880> see<00:03:04.060> if<00:03:04.180> it<00:03:04.300> works<00:03:10.350> don't<00:03:11.350> sweat<00:03:11.590> it

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.950 

meant<00:03:15.070> on<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:15.280> pole<00:03:15.580> right<00:03:15.760> now<00:03:16.060> but<00:03:16.360> actually<00:03:16.930> a

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
meant on a pole right now but actually a

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.330 
meant on a pole right now but actually a
little<00:03:17.050> bit<00:03:17.260> quieter<00:03:17.650> than<00:03:17.800> Hammonds<00:03:18.190> our

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
little bit quieter than Hammonds our

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.580 
little bit quieter than Hammonds our

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
pocket rocket animation

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.949 
pocket rocket animation
see<00:03:22.099> if<00:03:22.250> its<00:03:22.400> memory<00:03:25.510> so<00:03:26.510> it<00:03:26.540> actually<00:03:26.720> goes

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
see if its memory so it actually goes

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.390 
see if its memory so it actually goes
down<00:03:27.110> a<00:03:27.140> little<00:03:27.379> bit<00:03:27.530> further<00:03:27.739> than<00:03:28.010> I've<00:03:28.160> been

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
down a little bit further than I've been

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.880 
down a little bit further than I've been
able<00:03:28.519> to<00:03:28.760> get<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.120> MSR<00:03:30.110> pocket<00:03:30.500> rockets<00:03:30.800> oh

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
able to get the MSR pocket rockets oh

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.040 
able to get the MSR pocket rockets oh
that's<00:03:31.040> nice<00:03:31.280> as<00:03:31.489> well<00:03:31.670> just<00:03:32.599> turn<00:03:32.780> that<00:03:32.840> off

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
that's nice as well just turn that off

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.050 
that's nice as well just turn that off
so<00:03:36.050> that's<00:03:36.200> my<00:03:36.349> initial<00:03:37.099> little<00:03:37.370> look<00:03:37.550> at<00:03:37.819> the

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
so that's my initial little look at the

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.240 
so that's my initial little look at the
