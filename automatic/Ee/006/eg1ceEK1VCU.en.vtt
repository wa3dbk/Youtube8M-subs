00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
call them knowing how to do them is

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.600 
call them knowing how to do them is
different<00:01:54.780> from<00:01:55.079> knowing<00:01:55.590> how<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.860> use<00:01:56.040> them

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
different from knowing how to use them

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.390 
different from knowing how to use them
in<00:01:56.790> a

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
in a

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.370 
in a

all right so let me show you how I use
them<00:01:59.619> in<00:01:59.770> a<00:01:59.860> trick<00:02:00.100> so<00:02:00.520> let's<00:02:00.700> say<00:02:00.880> they're

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
them in a trick so let's say they're

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.249 
them in a trick so let's say they're
cards<00:02:01.390> at<00:02:01.509> the<00:02:01.540> top<00:02:01.810> now

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
cards at the top now

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.200 
cards at the top now
all<00:02:02.320> right<00:02:02.500> so<00:02:02.680> control<00:02:03.340> their<00:02:03.580> car<00:02:03.790> so<00:02:04.000> their

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
all right so control their car so their

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.020 
all right so control their car so their
cars<00:02:04.479> at<00:02:04.659> the<00:02:04.810> top<00:02:05.020> all<00:02:05.290> right<00:02:05.440> so<00:02:06.190> you<00:02:06.820> ask

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
cars at the top all right so you ask
