really good question and I thought it's
one<00:00:29.010> those<00:00:29.130> questions<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.849> could<00:00:29.939> go<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.240> the

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
one those questions that could go in the

book of big ones the ones that nobody
can<00:00:32.550> really<00:00:32.730> figure<00:00:33.000> out<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.270> answers<00:00:33.570> to

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
can really figure out the answers to

fight<00:00:37.010> the<00:00:38.010> doctor<00:00:38.489> or<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.760> Jedi<00:00:39.390> know<00:00:40.290> what

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
fight the doctor or a Jedi know what

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.450 
fight the doctor or a Jedi know what
you're<00:00:40.469> thinking<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.040> probably<00:00:41.160> went

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
you're thinking you probably went

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.330 
you're thinking you probably went
instantly<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.390> doctor<00:00:42.809> first<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.350> all<00:00:43.469> let's

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
instantly the doctor first of all let's

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.100 
instantly the doctor first of all let's
be<00:00:44.520> honest<00:00:44.850> he<00:00:45.149> will<00:00:45.270> probably<00:00:45.539> be<00:00:45.660> one<00:00:45.930> step

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
be honest he will probably be one step

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.440 
be honest he will probably be one step
ahead<00:00:46.260> considering<00:00:47.129> he<00:00:47.489> can<00:00:47.670> time<00:00:47.820> travel<00:00:47.850> we

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
ahead considering he can time travel we

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.020 
ahead considering he can time travel we
also<00:00:48.600> know<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.379> doctor<00:00:49.739> has<00:00:49.980> one<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.399> these<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
also know the doctor has one of these a

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.400 
also know the doctor has one of these a
sonic<00:00:51.780> screwdriver<00:00:52.879> which<00:00:53.879> can<00:00:54.600> probably

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
sonic screwdriver which can probably

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.099 
sonic screwdriver which can probably
most<00:00:55.770> likely<00:00:55.969> disable<00:00:56.969> lightsaber<00:00:57.570> from<00:00:57.930> a

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
most likely disable lightsaber from a

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.869 
most likely disable lightsaber from a
distance<00:00:58.559> I'd<00:00:58.710> rather<00:00:58.920> have<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.340> than<00:00:59.640> I

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
distance I'd rather have this than I

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.160 
distance I'd rather have this than I
like<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.180> think<00:01:00.270> now<00:01:00.480> we're<00:01:00.660> still<00:01:00.809> going<00:01:00.989> with

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
like to think now we're still going with

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.020 
like to think now we're still going with
the<00:01:01.289> assumption<00:01:01.620> here<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.550> doctor

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
the assumption here that the doctor

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.479 
the assumption here that the doctor
would<00:01:03.180> be<00:01:03.239> one<00:01:03.660> step<00:01:03.840> ahead<00:01:04.019> therefore<00:01:04.860> we

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
would be one step ahead therefore we

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.820 
would be one step ahead therefore we
also<00:01:05.909> must<00:01:06.270> assume<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.689> he<00:01:07.020> knows<00:01:07.350> about<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
also must assume that he knows about the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.950 
also must assume that he knows about the
force<00:01:08.159> powers<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.850> we'll<00:01:09.240> have<00:01:09.360> some<00:01:09.659> kind<00:01:09.900> of

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
force powers and we'll have some kind of

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.289 
force powers and we'll have some kind of
force<00:01:10.229> field<00:01:10.320> himself<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.850> defend<00:01:12.150> himself

against<00:01:12.869> these<00:01:13.049> hours<00:01:13.590> he's<00:01:13.710> gonna<00:01:13.830> be<00:01:14.010> there

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
against these hours he's gonna be there
