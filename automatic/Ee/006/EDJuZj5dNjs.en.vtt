00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
let's take a spore print read a little

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.820 
let's take a spore print read a little
bit<00:02:22.520> more<00:02:24.880> here's<00:02:25.880> a<00:02:25.990> cutaway<00:02:26.990> shot<00:02:27.380> is<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:27.680> one

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
bit more here's a cutaway shot is it one

bigger<00:02:28.100> one

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.179 

I'd<00:02:39.390> say<00:02:39.629> they're<00:02:39.810> definitely<00:02:40.189> oyster

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189

working<00:02:49.319> good<00:02:49.530> I<00:02:49.680> can<00:02:49.829> see<00:02:50.010> that

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
working good I can see that

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.190 
working good I can see that
I<00:02:50.459> mean<00:02:50.670> it's<00:02:50.790> blacks<00:02:51.000> all<00:02:51.269> right<00:02:51.569> but<00:02:52.049> it's

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
I mean it's blacks all right but it's

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.809 
I mean it's blacks all right but it's
plastic<00:02:52.829> and<00:02:53.420> it<00:02:54.420> it's<00:02:54.900> just<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:56.220> paper<00:02:56.430> works

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
plastic and it it's just the paper works

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.119 
plastic and it it's just the paper works
because<00:02:57.000> it's<00:02:57.120> orbs<00:02:57.420> of<00:02:57.569> water<00:02:57.829> you<00:02:58.829> can<00:02:58.859> see

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
because it's orbs of water you can see

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:04.759 
because it's orbs of water you can see
how<00:02:59.220> nice<00:02:59.430> print<00:02:59.849> that<00:03:00.030> made<00:03:03.170> it<00:03:04.170> doesn't<00:03:04.379> get

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
how nice print that made it doesn't get

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.860 
how nice print that made it doesn't get
black<00:03:05.040> paper<00:03:05.340> would<00:03:05.760> work<00:03:05.970> better<00:03:06.269> cuz<00:03:06.689> there

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
black paper would work better cuz there

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.420 
black paper would work better cuz there
you<00:03:07.019> can<00:03:07.139> see<00:03:07.260> is<00:03:07.319> just<00:03:07.500> water<00:03:07.769> or<00:03:07.980> laying<00:03:08.280> on
