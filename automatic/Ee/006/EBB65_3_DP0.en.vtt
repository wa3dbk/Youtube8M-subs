00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.510 
a common but I looked at it's a rare and
he's<00:05:35.970> got<00:05:36.330> like<00:05:36.540> forest<00:05:37.229> blast<00:05:37.500> and<00:05:37.919> combat

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
he's got like forest blast and combat

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.710 
he's got like forest blast and combat
reflexes<00:05:39.240> I<00:05:39.540> mean<00:05:40.440> close<00:05:41.430> combat<00:05:41.669> expert<00:05:42.180> and

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
reflexes I mean close combat expert and

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.130 
reflexes I mean close combat expert and
he's<00:05:42.900> got<00:05:43.050> a<00:05:43.080> special<00:05:43.410> power<00:05:43.740> he's<00:05:44.010> got<00:05:44.039> quake

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
he's got a special power he's got quake

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.900 
he's got a special power he's got quake
so<00:05:46.140> that's<00:05:46.320> pretty<00:05:46.560> cool

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
so that's pretty cool

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.470 
so that's pretty cool
then<00:05:48.530> the<00:05:49.530> next<00:05:49.800> one<00:05:49.920> is<00:05:50.070> guile<00:05:50.400> this<00:05:51.150> one<00:05:51.330> is

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
then the next one is guile this one is

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.990 
then the next one is guile this one is
actually<00:05:51.660> an<00:05:51.990> uncommon<00:05:52.500> one<00:05:53.000> sharpshooter

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
actually an uncommon one sharpshooter

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.360 
actually an uncommon one sharpshooter
and<00:05:54.180> pulse<00:05:54.870> wave<00:05:55.080> so<00:05:55.350> that's<00:05:55.560> really<00:05:56.130> awesome

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
and pulse wave so that's really awesome

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.280 
and pulse wave so that's really awesome
and<00:05:56.910> then<00:05:57.570> Vega

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290 
and then Vega

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.960 
and then Vega
he<00:05:59.280> has<00:05:59.670> a<00:06:00.630> trait<00:06:01.320> where<00:06:01.860> if<00:06:02.220> he<00:06:02.370> has<00:06:02.490> no<00:06:02.670> action

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
he has a trait where if he has no action

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.900 
he has a trait where if he has no action
tokens<00:06:03.330> you<00:06:03.690> can<00:06:03.870> +1<00:06:04.260> his<00:06:04.530> defense<00:06:05.010> looks<00:06:05.730> like

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
tokens you can +1 his defense looks like
