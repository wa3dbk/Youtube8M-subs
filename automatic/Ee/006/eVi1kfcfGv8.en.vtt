00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.809
 very well as you know, the 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.090
 Christmas celebration and I've had 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.370
 enough messages asking me yes 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.380
 we atheists should celebrate Christmas 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.450
 before giving my view me 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.400
 I would like to remember a bit of history 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.440
 before celebrating Christmas as the 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.570
 we know or as they were not imposed by 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.730
 Catholic Christians in antiquity 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.190
 they celebrated many things in these dates 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.349
 and more of the winter solstice that was 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.780
 the opportune moment in the season to 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.850
 get into their houses light the fire and 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.589
 just having a good time the 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.210
 celebrations in antiquity really 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:43.359
 they were very different from how we know them 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.460
 now they really were parties in fact 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:47.589
 some Nordic tribes celebrated the 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.199
 'you'll what it was to get super 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.429
 drunk and eat at will all that 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.649
 They could while I spent the winter 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:55.780
 meanwhile in rome 'was celebrated the 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.179
 saturnalia that was more or less the same 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.999
 get very drunk and eat a lot and 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:03.069
 dance and have enough sex all by 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:06.430
 celebrate the saturn god that was equal 

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:08.770
 a barbel guy with some average taste 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.250
 rare for the 4th century Christianity does not 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.500
 was 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.540
 popular as it is now and its 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.450
 festivities nobody celebrated it with 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.580
 taste so they opted for plagiarism to 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.740
 these times in roma ' December 25 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.840
 the miter god and the 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.630
 very astute Christians took this day 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.970
 to say that jesus was also born this 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.040
 day in this way the Christmas went 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.470
 proliferating in the Roman Empire without 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.229
 However, in Rome, the celebration of 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.090
 saturnalia style a christmas of the 25th 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.250
 December with a lot of music and party 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.229
 a lot of sex and good Christmas followed 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.780
 equal century after century after century until 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.710
 the 17th century where Protestants from 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.140
 England 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.390
 the so-called Puritans complained of 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.619
 that Christmas was a bit vulgar and 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.840
 they said he was not going with morality 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.550
 Christian so oliver appeared 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.680
 cromwell the defender of the good 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.750
 manners in england and caused that 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.520
 ban Christmas for almost 13 years 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.020
 until the British themselves 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.479
 they demanded the king to put back 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.580
 Christmas if I did not dethrone him 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.920
 you already know the Puritans were 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.950
 sent to america the new colony the 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.959
 Christmas was still as pathetic as he did 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.819
 with him so he was losing little to 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.590
 little bit 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.959
 Christmas was pretty boring until the 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.370
 independence from the us where they had 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.709
 what to look for festivities to celebrate 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.810
 his new achievements again came the 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.629
 Christmas and this is where Christmas 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.430
 changes completely to how we know it from 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.950
 be totally fun as they were 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.739
 saturnalia and be pretty boring as 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.079
 caused it cronwell and the puritans to what 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.239
 that today we know as the current Christmas 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.349
 that was caused by two characters in 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.909
 USA 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.739
 one of them was washington irving with 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.599
 his stories where he highlighted the 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.430
 importance of charity love to 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.650
 neighbor cursilerías that were moving away 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.689
 little by little of what carnival was 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.060
 roman on the other hand we have chardy 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:56.189
 who wrote the most famous story of 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.139
 Christmas sure they know what is true so 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.329
 important was the work of dickens that 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:03.209
 for the first time the word appeared 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:05.639
 merry christmas also managed to establish 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.230
 this celebration as something of love and peace 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:10.139
 where family members are the most 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.180
 important is in the 19th century where it 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.579
 forges what we now know as the 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.859
 current Christmas and its symbol is born 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.290
 famous that is santa claus sanz is 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.170
 inspired by St. Nicholas was born as such 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.690
 in the state poem 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.630
 clement clear and became popular with the 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.780
 illustration of the famous cartoonist 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.700
 thomas nash the idea of ​​an old man 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.040
 sympathetic magician who travels through the 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.200
 world giving gifts to children fascinated 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.360
 totally to all and as you already know 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.830
 it became the favorite weapon of a 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.720
 Refreshment but here is something 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.209
 important in Mexico the celebration of 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.040
 Christmas is divided into two, one is 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.080
 this great Christmas extracted from the 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.030
 gringos and another is the one that continues in 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.040
 rome and that the conquerors 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.650
 they brought that why we celebrated a 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.540
 way with santa the gifts the pin and 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.640
 all these things and we also do 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.290
 posadas and pastorelas and we celebrate a 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.940
 Mass on December 25 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.769
 since these customs were still tied 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.140
 in jest with Catholicism and how 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.430
 always the evangelizers 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.290
 Spanish conquistadors took the 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.850
 festivities like butyl posting posting 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.860
 to tell the natives that they were 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.450
 celebrities for jesus christ and his 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.100
 nativity and with this they created the 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.690
 pastorelas so latino friends 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.430
 polish taking into account these 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.160
 historical traits I consider that the 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.140
 Christmas is more than prostitution we know 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.150
 very well now its origins and how it has 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.610
 changed according to geography 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.290
 the culture or the historical moment without 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.360
 However let's not forget those little ones 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.520
 details that make these important 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.100
 dates like this we celebrate the solstice of 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.710
 winter the jules saturnalia to the god 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.970
 mitra or jesús the most important thing is the 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.979
 coexistence with our friends 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.780
 our relatives and all those 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.789
 people that we want and that you are 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.800
 customs are a great opportunity to 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:52.050
 live with them my opinion about what 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.030
 if an atheist should celebrate Christmas, I think 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.919
 which is very obvious I bring a hat 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.710
 I would really holy many 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:01.139
 atheists will really celebrate it as 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.910
 which is something symbolic to live with 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.889
 his relatives of whom they did not know 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.350
 a lot and give a big hug to that 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:10.590
 friend that they had a lot without giving one a 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.360
 atheist can celebrate what duty he gives 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.699
 in oneself if you really do not 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.729
 you want to celebrate, there's no problem, 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:20.820
 celebrate is another day but if you have the 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:22.530
 opportunity to celebrate and smile and 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.000
 be happy for a moment with those 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.729
 family members who have a belief 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.039
 different take advantage of it really is very 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:31.590
 satisfactory and there is no better time than 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:34.289
 spend it with friends and with family 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.719
 so only you know 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.849
