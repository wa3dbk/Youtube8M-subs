00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
really planned on the sequel even before

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.190 
really planned on the sequel even before
the<00:00:08.069> first<00:00:08.309> one<00:00:08.490> was<00:00:09.059> over<00:00:09.210> with<00:00:09.450> cap<00:00:09.690> no

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.039 
the first one was over with cap no
actually<00:00:11.130> you<00:00:11.219> know<00:00:11.280> what<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.759> think<00:00:11.910> we<00:00:12.719> talked

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
actually you know what I think we talked

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.600 
actually you know what I think we talked
about<00:00:13.230> it<00:00:13.530> because<00:00:13.799> we<00:00:13.920> left<00:00:14.099> so<00:00:14.280> much<00:00:14.429> stuff

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
about it because we left so much stuff

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.939 
about it because we left so much stuff
on<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.849> table<00:00:15.030> with<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:15.929> couples<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.740> where

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
on the table with the couples and where

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.769 
on the table with the couples and where
their<00:00:17.130> relationships<00:00:17.609> could<00:00:17.730> possibly<00:00:18.119> go<00:00:18.359> so

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
their relationships could possibly go so

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.260 
their relationships could possibly go so
you<00:00:19.230> know<00:00:19.380> box<00:00:20.070> office<00:00:20.400> number<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.730> speak<00:00:20.970> and

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
you know box office number to speak and

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.150 
you know box office number to speak and
because<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.109> first<00:00:22.260> one<00:00:22.439> did<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:22.740> well<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.070> was

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
because the first one did so well it was

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.189 
because the first one did so well it was
a<00:00:23.189> no-brainer<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:24.090> all<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.630> talk<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:24.900> was

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
a no-brainer and all the talk that was

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.650 
a no-brainer and all the talk that was
hypothetical<00:00:25.650> became<00:00:26.189> reality<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:27.060> we<00:00:27.480> said

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
hypothetical became reality so we said

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.849
