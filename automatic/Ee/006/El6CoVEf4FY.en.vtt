00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
potatoes of this review let's talk about

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.570 
potatoes of this review let's talk about
what<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.289> might<00:00:22.470> use<00:00:22.680> this<00:00:22.830> knife<00:00:23.039> for<00:00:23.340> and

what you might use this knife for and

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.310 
what you might use this knife for and
form<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.600> little<00:00:24.720> context<00:00:25.439> for<00:00:25.619> my<00:00:25.769> critique

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
form a little context for my critique

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.380 
form a little context for my critique
I'd<00:00:28.320> start<00:00:28.619> off<00:00:28.740> by<00:00:28.920> saying<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:30.029> would<00:00:30.210> be<00:00:30.359> a

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
I'd start off by saying this would be a

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.930 
I'd start off by saying this would be a
great<00:00:30.689> EDC<00:00:31.679> knife<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.340> would<00:00:32.550> be<00:00:32.730> its

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
great EDC knife and that would be its

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.530 
great EDC knife and that would be its
primary<00:00:33.329> role<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:34.079> my<00:00:34.230> book<00:00:35.030> it's<00:00:36.030> got<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> three

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
primary role in my book it's got a three

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.479 
primary role in my book it's got a three
inch<00:00:36.690> blade<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.260> overall<00:00:37.710> length<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:38.100> seven

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
inch blade and overall length of seven

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.639 
inch blade and overall length of seven
inches<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> weight<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.300> three<00:00:39.870> ounces<00:00:40.320> so

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
inches and a weight of three ounces so

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.850 
inches and a weight of three ounces so
you<00:00:41.239> do<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.390> math<00:00:42.600> that's<00:00:42.870> about<00:00:43.110> perfect<00:00:43.800> for

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
you do the math that's about perfect for

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.150 
you do the math that's about perfect for
EDC<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.579> my<00:00:44.730> book<00:00:45.649> you<00:00:46.649> might<00:00:46.890> prefer

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
definitely not a primary use but you

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.760 
definitely not a primary use but you
have<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.630> keep<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:24.930> mind<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> very

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
have to keep in mind this is a very

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.330 
have to keep in mind this is a very
strong<00:01:26.250> knife<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.090> lock<00:01:27.299> on<00:01:27.509> it's<00:01:27.689> strong<00:01:28.340> the

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
edge and the point are incredibly sharp

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.899 
edge and the point are incredibly sharp
the<00:01:33.090> ergonomics<00:01:33.689> are<00:01:33.810> good<00:01:33.960> too<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.710> if<00:01:35.670> it's

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
the ergonomics are good too so if it's

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.480 
the ergonomics are good too so if it's
all<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.150> had<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.450> your<00:01:36.509> pocket<00:01:37.310> you<00:01:38.310> could

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
all you had in your pocket you could

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.230 
all you had in your pocket you could
certainly<00:01:38.990> do<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.140> job<00:01:40.670> especially<00:01:41.670> compared

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
certainly do the job especially compared

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.950 
certainly do the job especially compared
to<00:01:42.329> other<00:01:42.450> knives<00:01:44.329> so<00:01:45.329> let's<00:01:45.509> take<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> look<00:01:45.840> at

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
to other knives so let's take a look at

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.679 
to other knives so let's take a look at
the<00:01:46.020> blade<00:01:46.229> here<00:01:46.700> as<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.939> can<00:01:48.060> see<00:01:48.299> it's<00:01:48.600> a

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
the blade here as you can see it's a

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.789 
the blade here as you can see it's a
classic<00:01:49.200> Spyderco<00:01:49.740> leaf<00:01:49.950> shaped<00:01:50.220> design

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
classic Spyderco leaf shaped design

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.630 
classic Spyderco leaf shaped design
fully<00:01:52.799> flat<00:01:53.130> ground<00:01:53.720> very<00:01:54.720> nice<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.460> it's<00:01:56.460> got

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
fully flat ground very nice and it's got

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.620 
fully flat ground very nice and it's got
a<00:01:56.670> special<00:01:57.530> laminated<00:01:58.530> blade<00:01:59.360> and<00:02:00.360> what<00:02:00.479> that

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
a special laminated blade and what that

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.959 
a special laminated blade and what that
means<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.170> basically<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.340> like<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.520> sandwich

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
means is basically it's like a sandwich

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.910 
means is basically it's like a sandwich

there which is kind of cool one negative
I<00:03:38.109> guess<00:03:38.349> if<00:03:38.530> you<00:03:38.650> were<00:03:38.799> to<00:03:40.349> want<00:03:41.349> to<00:03:41.409> point

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
I guess if you were to want to point

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.469 
I guess if you were to want to point
some<00:03:41.799> negative<00:03:42.129> things<00:03:42.849> out<00:03:43.030> with<00:03:43.180> this<00:03:43.269> knife

some negative things out with this knife

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:46.349 
some negative things out with this knife
is<00:03:43.959> that<00:03:43.989> it<00:03:44.799> is<00:03:44.919> bolted<00:03:45.310> together<00:03:45.430> as<00:03:46.090> you<00:03:46.209> can

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
is that it is bolted together as you can

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.539 
is that it is bolted together as you can
see<00:03:46.540> here<00:03:46.780> these<00:03:46.900> are<00:03:47.079> not<00:03:47.199> screws<00:03:47.590> these<00:03:48.400> are

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549

see here these are not screws these are
rivets<00:03:48.909> oh<00:03:50.129> and<00:03:51.129> when<00:03:51.250> I<00:03:51.310> say<00:03:51.519> bolted<00:03:52.030> I'm<00:03:52.150> I

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
rivets oh and when I say bolted I'm I

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.330 
rivets oh and when I say bolted I'm I
mean<00:03:52.569> riveted<00:03:52.959> together<00:03:53.109> as<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:54.069> you<00:03:54.129> can't

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
mean riveted together as and you can't

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.490 
mean riveted together as and you can't
take<00:03:54.459> them<00:03:54.579> apart<00:03:54.729> so<00:03:55.299> if<00:03:56.019> you<00:03:56.109> were<00:03:56.199> to<00:03:56.259> dunk

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
take them apart so if you were to dunk

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.899 
take them apart so if you were to dunk
this<00:03:56.650> in<00:03:56.829> salt<00:03:57.069> water<00:03:57.280> or<00:03:57.430> something<00:03:57.819> like

this in salt water or something like

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.689 
this in salt water or something like
that<00:03:58.439> the<00:03:59.439> only<00:03:59.590> way<00:03:59.919> you<00:03:59.979> could<00:04:00.220> take<00:04:00.489> these

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:00.699 
that the only way you could take these

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:02.490 
that the only way you could take these
scales<00:04:01.000> off<00:04:01.299> is<00:04:01.479> if<00:04:01.629> you<00:04:01.750> drilled<00:04:02.049> out<00:04:02.259> the

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
scales off is if you drilled out the

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.390 
scales off is if you drilled out the
