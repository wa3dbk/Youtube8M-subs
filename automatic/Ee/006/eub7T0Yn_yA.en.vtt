00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
who don't know a DWR coating stands for

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.200 
who don't know a DWR coating stands for
durable<00:00:15.990> water<00:00:16.289> repellent<00:00:16.920> coating<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.520> it's

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
durable water repellent coating and it's

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.420 
durable water repellent coating and it's
a<00:00:18.300> coating<00:00:18.720> that's<00:00:18.900> put<00:00:19.140> on<00:00:19.170> generally<00:00:20.160> at<00:00:20.310> the

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
a coating that's put on generally at the

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.730 
a coating that's put on generally at the
factory<00:00:20.910> on<00:00:21.199> most<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.470> your<00:00:22.529> lower<00:00:23.460> end<00:00:23.820> and

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
factory on most of your lower end and

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.060 
factory on most of your lower end and
sometimes<00:00:25.740> higher-end<00:00:26.689> water<00:00:27.949> resistant<00:00:28.949> or

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
sometimes higher-end water resistant or

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.240 
sometimes higher-end water resistant or
waterproof<00:00:29.160> coats<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.619> what<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.189> a

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
waterproof coats and what it is is a

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.900 
waterproof coats and what it is is a
coating<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.800> some<00:00:34.800> type<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.010> polymer<00:00:35.640> that

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
coating of some type of polymer that

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.299 
coating of some type of polymer that
basically<00:00:36.719> beads<00:00:37.079> up<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.440> water<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.040> allows

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
basically beads up the water and allows

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.010 
basically beads up the water and allows
it<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.520> quickly<00:00:38.760> shed<00:00:39.210> off<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.450> jacket<00:00:39.719> so

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
it to quickly shed off the jacket so

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.170 
it to quickly shed off the jacket so
your<00:00:40.320> jacket<00:00:40.680> doesn't<00:00:40.980> wet<00:00:41.190> out<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.610> hold<00:00:42.030> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
your jacket doesn't wet out and hold the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.330 
your jacket doesn't wet out and hold the
water<00:00:42.360> on<00:00:42.660> it

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
water on it

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.520 
water on it
now<00:00:44.340> most<00:00:44.899> higher-end<00:00:45.899> materials<00:00:46.379> like

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
now most higher-end materials like

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.190 
now most higher-end materials like
gore-tex<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.309> even<00:00:47.670> they<00:00:48.270> naturally<00:00:48.870> do<00:00:49.020> this

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
gore-tex and even they naturally do this

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.740 
gore-tex and even they naturally do this
so<00:00:49.379> they<00:00:49.500> don't<00:00:49.530> need<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.890> DWR<00:00:50.579> coating<00:00:50.750> but

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
so they don't need a DWR coating but

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.260 
so they don't need a DWR coating but
sometimes<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.649> DWR<00:00:53.219> coating<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.699> applied<00:00:53.730> to

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
sometimes a DWR coating is applied to

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.910 
sometimes a DWR coating is applied to
those<00:00:54.420> types<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.809> materials<00:00:55.289> just<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.710> shed

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
those types of materials just to shed

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.939 
those types of materials just to shed
water<00:00:56.100> water<00:00:56.699> even<00:00:57.180> faster<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.870> make<00:00:58.710> sure

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
water water even faster and make sure

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.360 
water water even faster and make sure
that<00:00:59.129> they<00:00:59.280> stay<00:00:59.340> waterproof<00:01:00.800> now<00:01:01.800> in<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
that they stay waterproof now in the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.210 
that they stay waterproof now in the
case<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.820> most<00:01:03.090> jackets<00:01:03.390> like<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.260> one<00:01:04.530> these

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
case of most jackets like this one these

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.700 
case of most jackets like this one these
lower<00:01:05.489> end<00:01:05.729> jackets<00:01:06.210> don't<00:01:07.020> even<00:01:07.260> really<00:01:07.500> use

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
lower end jackets don't even really use

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.710 
lower end jackets don't even really use
waterproof<00:01:08.310> material<00:01:08.909> like<00:01:09.090> gore-tex<00:01:09.570> or

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
waterproof material like gore-tex or

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.649 
waterproof material like gore-tex or
something<00:01:10.080> they<00:01:10.530> just<00:01:10.770> use<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.510> form<00:01:12.510> of

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
something they just use a form of

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.170 
something they just use a form of
ripstop<00:01:13.049> nylon<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.830> then<00:01:14.549> they<00:01:14.700> put<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> heavy

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
ripstop nylon and then they put a heavy

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.749 
ripstop nylon and then they put a heavy
coat<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.689> DWR<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:16.740> top<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.549> make<00:01:17.729> it

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
coat of DWR on top of that to make it

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.850 
coat of DWR on top of that to make it
waterproof

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
waterproof

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.999

anything else this DWR coating tends to
wear<00:01:33.900> off<00:01:34.110> pretty<00:01:34.860> fast<00:01:35.329> so<00:01:36.329> over<00:01:36.750> time<00:01:36.990> you're

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.670 
heavier use like the top of your
shoulders<00:04:09.069> where<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.340> pack<00:04:09.519> straps<00:04:09.849> may<00:04:10.090> be

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
shoulders where the pack straps may be

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.869 
shoulders where the pack straps may be
you<00:04:11.680> may<00:04:11.829> want<00:04:12.040> to<00:04:12.099> put<00:04:12.340> a<00:04:12.370> little<00:04:12.579> bit<00:04:12.699> of<00:04:12.819> a

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
you may want to put a little bit of a

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.390 
you may want to put a little bit of a
heavier<00:04:13.180> coating<00:04:13.509> just<00:04:13.900> to<00:04:14.199> make<00:04:14.949> sure<00:04:15.159> those

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
heavier coating just to make sure those

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.460 
heavier coating just to make sure those
spots<00:04:15.669> get<00:04:15.909> covered<00:04:16.299> well<00:04:16.479> because<00:04:17.259> they're

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
spots get covered well because they're

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.479 
spots get covered well because they're
the<00:04:17.590> ones<00:04:17.739> that<00:04:17.919> wear<00:04:18.070> out<00:04:18.099> the<00:04:18.430> fastest<00:04:19.289> and

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
the ones that wear out the fastest and

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.649 
the ones that wear out the fastest and
so<00:04:21.489> let's<00:04:21.700> just<00:04:21.760> go<00:04:21.969> ahead<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:22.240> get<00:04:22.360> started

00:04:22.649 --> 00:04:22.659 
so let's just go ahead and get started

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:33.060 
so let's just go ahead and get started
here

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.520 

just<00:04:34.070> nice<00:04:34.280> even<00:04:34.880> strokes<00:04:35.350> make<00:04:36.350> sure

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
just nice even strokes make sure

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:46.990 
just nice even strokes make sure
everything<00:04:36.979> gets<00:04:37.130> coated<00:04:44.590> and<00:04:45.699> I'll<00:04:46.699> just<00:04:46.850> go

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
everything gets coated and I'll just go

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.610 
everything gets coated and I'll just go
ahead<00:04:47.120> and<00:04:47.419> speed<00:04:47.750> this<00:04:47.870> up<00:04:48.050> here<00:04:48.259> so<00:04:48.410> you<00:04:48.500> can

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
ahead and speed this up here so you can

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.580 
ahead and speed this up here so you can
see<00:04:48.889> what<00:04:49.550> the<00:04:49.639> whole<00:04:49.759> jacket<00:04:50.210> is<00:04:50.500> what<00:04:51.500> it

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
see what the whole jacket is what it

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.529 
see what the whole jacket is what it
looks<00:04:51.770> like<00:04:51.830> when<00:04:52.250> I<00:04:52.280> get<00:04:52.370> done<00:04:52.759> I'm<00:04:53.270> going<00:04:53.479> to

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
looks like when I get done I'm going to

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:55.990 
looks like when I get done I'm going to
let<00:04:53.690> this<00:04:53.870> sit<00:04:54.199> for<00:04:54.590> two<00:04:55.160> three<00:04:55.550> minutes<00:04:55.850> maybe

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
let this sit for two three minutes maybe

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.300 
let this sit for two three minutes maybe
five<00:04:56.300> minutes<00:04:56.690> and<00:04:56.840> then<00:04:56.960> use<00:04:57.590> this<00:04:57.770> rag<00:04:58.070> to

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
five minutes and then use this rag to

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.240 
five minutes and then use this rag to
wipe<00:04:58.340> off<00:04:58.669> any<00:04:58.849> excess<00:04:59.560> DWR<00:05:00.560> coating<00:05:00.590> that<00:05:01.070> may

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
wipe off any excess DWR coating that may

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:12.100 
wipe off any excess DWR coating that may
be<00:05:01.310> left

I<00:05:57.380> am<00:05:57.740> back<00:05:58.040> the<00:05:58.580> jacket<00:05:59.210> has<00:06:00.050> been<00:06:00.470> drying

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 
I am back the jacket has been drying

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.190 
I am back the jacket has been drying
overnight<00:06:01.430> before<00:06:02.150> that<00:06:02.480> I<00:06:02.510> actually<00:06:02.780> allowed

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:03.200 
overnight before that I actually allowed

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.560 
overnight before that I actually allowed
the<00:06:03.320> DWR<00:06:03.920> to<00:06:04.250> stay<00:06:04.490> on<00:06:04.670> the<00:06:04.760> jacket<00:06:05.150> for<00:06:05.300> around

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:05.570 
the DWR to stay on the jacket for around

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.400

five minutes

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.440 
five minutes
and<00:06:06.500> then<00:06:07.310> I<00:06:07.370> just<00:06:07.550> wiped<00:06:07.790> it<00:06:07.910> off<00:06:08.090> with<00:06:08.120> this

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
and then I just wiped it off with this

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.360 
and then I just wiped it off with this
rag<00:06:08.690> like<00:06:08.960> you<00:06:09.080> would<00:06:09.230> wipe<00:06:09.560> water<00:06:09.860> off<00:06:10.130> of<00:06:10.160> a

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
rag like you would wipe water off of a

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.680 
rag like you would wipe water off of a
table<00:06:10.700> or<00:06:10.820> something<00:06:11.150> just<00:06:11.270> to<00:06:11.390> get<00:06:11.540> the

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
table or something just to get the

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.500 
table or something just to get the
excess<00:06:11.780> off<00:06:12.260> and<00:06:12.880> then<00:06:13.880> after<00:06:14.210> drying

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.510 
excess off and then after drying

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.920 
excess off and then after drying
overnight<00:06:14.870> this<00:06:15.440> jacket<00:06:15.920> is<00:06:16.040> good<00:06:16.310> to<00:06:16.430> go

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
overnight this jacket is good to go

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.520 
overnight this jacket is good to go
some<00:06:17.930> people<00:06:18.230> recommend<00:06:19.780> taking<00:06:20.780> an<00:06:20.900> iron<00:06:21.200> and

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
some people recommend taking an iron and

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.470 
some people recommend taking an iron and
actually<00:06:21.920> going<00:06:22.130> over<00:06:22.400> the<00:06:22.640> jacket<00:06:23.060> on<00:06:23.150> a<00:06:23.180> very

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:23.480 
actually going over the jacket on a very

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.590 
actually going over the jacket on a very
low<00:06:23.750> setting<00:06:24.230> I<00:06:24.760> have<00:06:25.760> not<00:06:25.970> done<00:06:26.210> that<00:06:26.270> I<00:06:26.450> don't

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:26.600 
low setting I have not done that I don't

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.210 
low setting I have not done that I don't
think<00:06:26.990> I<00:06:27.080> actually<00:06:27.230> have<00:06:27.440> a<00:06:27.560> setting<00:06:28.040> low

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.220 
think I actually have a setting low

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.940 
think I actually have a setting low
enough<00:06:28.520> for<00:06:29.210> this<00:06:29.840> type<00:06:30.050> of<00:06:30.080> material<00:06:30.260> so<00:06:30.770> I'm

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:30.950 
enough for this type of material so I'm

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.250 
enough for this type of material so I'm
not<00:06:31.070> going<00:06:31.250> to<00:06:31.310> risk<00:06:31.520> it<00:06:31.760> and<00:06:32.260> that's

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:33.260 
not going to risk it and that's

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.510 
not going to risk it and that's
something<00:06:33.350> you<00:06:33.680> do<00:06:33.800> want<00:06:33.980> to<00:06:34.010> be<00:06:34.130> careful

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 
something you do want to be careful

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.700 
something you do want to be careful
about<00:06:34.610> if<00:06:34.880> you<00:06:35.000> try<00:06:35.390> to<00:06:35.450> do<00:06:35.900> that<00:06:36.050> yourself<00:06:36.560> you

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
about if you try to do that yourself you

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.320 
about if you try to do that yourself you
really<00:06:37.100> want<00:06:37.340> to<00:06:37.400> have<00:06:37.490> a<00:06:37.550> low<00:06:37.760> setting<00:06:38.030> so<00:06:38.300> you

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330 
really want to have a low setting so you

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.410 
really want to have a low setting so you
don't<00:06:38.450> burn<00:06:38.630> through<00:06:38.990> the<00:06:39.050> plastic<00:06:39.260> here<00:06:40.420> but

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:41.420 
don't burn through the plastic here but

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.260 
don't burn through the plastic here but
I'll<00:06:41.750> go<00:06:41.900> ahead<00:06:41.990> and<00:06:42.170> show<00:06:42.380> you<00:06:42.440> now<00:06:43.270> hopefully

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
I'll go ahead and show you now hopefully

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.120 
I'll go ahead and show you now hopefully
this<00:06:44.690> will<00:06:44.810> beat<00:06:45.020> up<00:06:45.200> much<00:06:45.560> better<00:06:45.800> than<00:06:46.010> it

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.130 
this will beat up much better than it

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.490 
this will beat up much better than it
did<00:06:46.280> beforehand<00:06:46.910> and<00:06:47.090> not<00:06:47.750> really<00:06:48.050> soak<00:06:48.320> into

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:48.500 
did beforehand and not really soak into

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.320 
did beforehand and not really soak into
the<00:06:48.590> jacket<00:06:49.040> at<00:06:49.130> all<00:06:50.590> yeah<00:06:51.590> it's<00:06:51.800> much<00:06:52.040> better

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
the jacket at all yeah it's much better

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.800 
the jacket at all yeah it's much better
you<00:06:53.330> can<00:06:53.450> see<00:06:53.630> it's<00:06:53.810> really<00:06:54.260> beating<00:06:54.800> up<00:06:54.950> there

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810 
you can see it's really beating up there

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.140 
you can see it's really beating up there
there<00:06:56.810> actually<00:06:57.260> there<00:06:58.040> is<00:06:58.190> one<00:06:58.430> small<00:06:58.850> spot

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.150 
there actually there is one small spot

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.970 
there actually there is one small spot
up<00:06:59.360> here<00:06:59.420> where<00:06:59.870> it's<00:06:59.990> starting<00:07:00.230> to<00:07:00.440> soak<00:07:00.710> in

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:00.980 
up here where it's starting to soak in

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.280

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:21.200 
your jacket but that actually doesn't

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.960 
your jacket but that actually doesn't
look<00:07:21.500> too<00:07:21.770> bad<00:07:21.800> it<00:07:22.100> really<00:07:22.280> didn't<00:07:22.550> soak<00:07:22.760> in

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:22.970 
look too bad it really didn't soak in

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.930 
look too bad it really didn't soak in
too<00:07:23.150> much<00:07:23.330> and<00:07:23.890> if<00:07:24.890> I<00:07:25.010> were<00:07:25.190> moving<00:07:25.370> that<00:07:25.730> water

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:25.940 
too much and if I were moving that water

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.090 
too much and if I were moving that water
would<00:07:26.150> shed<00:07:26.420> right<00:07:26.630> off<00:07:26.810> if<00:07:27.020> this<00:07:27.920> were

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:28.100 
would shed right off if this were

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.040 
would shed right off if this were
vertical<00:07:28.700> where<00:07:29.150> the<00:07:29.210> water<00:07:29.420> would<00:07:29.570> just<00:07:29.630> drop

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.050 
vertical where the water would just drop

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.490 
vertical where the water would just drop
off<00:07:30.260> and<00:07:30.670> so<00:07:31.670> that<00:07:31.820> is<00:07:31.970> how<00:07:32.120> you<00:07:32.150> DWR<00:07:32.990> treat<00:07:33.350> a

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:33.500 
off and so that is how you DWR treat a

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.280 
off and so that is how you DWR treat a
jacket<00:07:34.130> I<00:07:34.340> hope<00:07:34.700> you<00:07:34.850> enjoyed<00:07:35.240> more<00:07:35.810> videos<00:07:36.140> to
