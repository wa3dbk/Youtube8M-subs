the<00:00:18.660> ice<00:00:18.810> away<00:00:19.040> this<00:00:20.040> should<00:00:20.280> extend<00:00:20.730> your

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
the ice away this should extend your

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.710 
the ice away this should extend your
season<00:00:21.360> into<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.350> duck<00:00:22.650> hunting<00:00:22.980> fall<00:00:23.340> by<00:00:24.240> you

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
season into the duck hunting fall by you

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.810 
season into the duck hunting fall by you
know<00:00:24.870> literally<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.290> couple<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.830> weeks<00:00:26.040> it's

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
know literally a couple of weeks it's

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.850 
know literally a couple of weeks it's
fully<00:00:27.180> adjustable<00:00:27.780> to<00:00:28.050> be<00:00:28.290> able<00:00:28.440> to<00:00:28.590> adjust

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
fully adjustable to be able to adjust

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.730 
fully adjustable to be able to adjust
with<00:00:29.130> removing<00:00:29.850> one<00:00:30.060> bolt<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.960> can<00:00:30.990> raise<00:00:31.380> or

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
with removing one bolt you can raise or

with removing one bolt you can raise or
lower

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
lower

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.509 
lower
the<00:00:32.509> angles<00:00:32.899> so<00:00:33.260> right<00:00:33.500> now<00:00:33.739> you<00:00:33.800> can<00:00:34.160> see<00:00:34.370> the

00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:34.519 
the angles so right now you can see the

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:36.430 
the angles so right now you can see the
unit<00:00:34.760> that<00:00:34.879> I've<00:00:35.030> got<00:00:35.210> out<00:00:35.449> in<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:35.780> water

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
unit that I've got out in the water

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.040 
unit that I've got out in the water
it's<00:00:36.890> creating<00:00:37.339> a<00:00:37.429> bit<00:00:37.609> of<00:00:37.640> a<00:00:37.789> stir<00:00:38.120> and<00:00:38.449> a<00:00:38.870> bit

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
it's creating a bit of a stir and a bit

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.930 
it's creating a bit of a stir and a bit
of<00:00:39.140> a<00:00:39.199> froth<00:00:39.559> that<00:00:39.589> you<00:00:39.980> can<00:00:40.129> actually<00:00:40.309> see<00:00:40.640> and

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
of a froth that you can actually see and

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.479 
of a froth that you can actually see and
maybe<00:00:41.359> some<00:00:41.629> potentially<00:00:42.140> some<00:00:42.350> noise<00:00:42.589> now

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
maybe some potentially some noise now

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.340 
maybe some potentially some noise now
with<00:00:43.729> just<00:00:44.000> adjusting<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:44.659> angle<00:00:44.780> or

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
with just adjusting the angle or

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.639 
with just adjusting the angle or
adjusting<00:00:45.949> the<00:00:46.159> legs<00:00:46.940> you<00:00:47.750> can<00:00:47.929> literally

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
adjusting the legs you can literally

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.889 
adjusting the legs you can literally
eliminate<00:00:49.489> that<00:00:49.670> or<00:00:49.969> you<00:00:50.570> could<00:00:50.719> actually

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
eliminate that or you could actually

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.380 
eliminate that or you could actually
turn<00:00:51.350> it<00:00:51.500> so<00:00:51.859> it's<00:00:52.010> pointed<00:00:52.460> straight<00:00:52.850> upward

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
turn it so it's pointed straight upward

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.750 
turn it so it's pointed straight upward
and<00:00:53.629> then<00:00:54.140> you<00:00:54.260> could<00:00:54.440> create<00:00:54.649> a<00:00:54.979> froth<00:00:55.399> that

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
and then you could create a froth that

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.149 
and then you could create a froth that
would<00:00:55.879> actually<00:00:56.210> create<00:00:56.449> some<00:00:56.719> aeration<00:00:57.170> now

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
would actually create some aeration now

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.479 
would actually create some aeration now
this<00:00:58.309> will<00:00:58.519> remove<00:00:59.000> or<00:00:59.600> push<00:00:59.960> away<00:01:00.170> any<00:01:00.739> algae

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
this will remove or push away any algae

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.749 
this will remove or push away any algae
or<00:01:02.000> duckweed<00:01:02.539> or<00:01:03.199> things<00:01:03.469> like<00:01:03.559> that<00:01:03.710> but<00:01:04.550> most

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
or duckweed or things like that but most

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:06.070 
or duckweed or things like that but most
importantly<00:01:05.269> the<00:01:05.479> reason<00:01:05.810> why<00:01:05.929> I'm<00:01:06.050> bringing

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
importantly the reason why I'm bringing

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.070 
importantly the reason why I'm bringing

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
the typical ice that were forming now

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.139 
the typical ice that were forming now
here's<00:01:14.929> the<00:01:15.110> great<00:01:15.319> thing<00:01:15.350> about<00:01:15.590> this
