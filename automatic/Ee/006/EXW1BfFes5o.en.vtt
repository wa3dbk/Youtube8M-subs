00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.050 
front spoiler now has a lower chin for
aerodynamics<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.680> also<00:01:56.159> more<00:01:56.340> ducting<00:01:56.880> to

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
aerodynamics and also more ducting to

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.620 
aerodynamics and also more ducting to
increase<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.570> air<00:01:57.689> flow<00:01:57.719> into<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.290> coolers

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
increase the air flow into the coolers

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.090 
increase the air flow into the coolers
and<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:00.869> we<00:02:00.990> come<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.409> racing<00:02:01.799> model

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100
