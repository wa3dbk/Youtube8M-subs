00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 greetings you dear friends and 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.170
 enjoyed here is vassili zaitsev and 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.340
 today we have a video with the d 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:16.130
 110 4 the american hunting tank of the 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:19.770
 Stage ten with a tower with a tower 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:23.220
 limited swinging range of 180 degrees 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.840
 swivel left and right so 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:33.420
 90 degrees thereabouts 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:36.960
 after the update 08 11 this was 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:41.940
 armor slightly toned means annoyed 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.829
 why because allegedly because many have 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.500
 complains because the damage of the 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:53.480
 Level 10 chases were so high 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:57.600
 with 850+ here in this particular case 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:01.710
 and this was lowered at this 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:08.729
 and on some other tanks around 100 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:13.490
 units down to 750 ok 750 the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.630
 number is not synonymous little but 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.670
 This tank was not the one anyway 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.790
 strongest tank in the game 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.840
 yes and then you are annoying because how can you 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.060
 a man has anyway already with movie so 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.610
 I think that our unjustified 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.930
 in this tank especially the tank 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:37.409
 has a lot of disadvantages and that's why 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.049
 also not very popular and indeed 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.820
 the armor is not very strong 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.540
 has a lot of weak spots here and 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.220
 something like that and the cannon counts the longest 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.920
 from all hunting tanks 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:56.850
 who come up with similar damage 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:01.330
 29 seconds have been very long 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.220
 which fortunately is not worth radiation 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.700
 so if you are from the 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.810
 hÃ¼ft shoots I say it is always 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.840
 very often possible to meet without 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:18.550
 to collect completely 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:26.320
 only the total damage output or 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:28.870
 output was lowered to lower 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:33.760
 value if you so so with me 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:36.760
 Example 3.6 to 3.7 damage in the cut 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:45.820
 out came fight woman that is now 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:48.720
 went down to 3,3000 in 2000 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:53.040
 mischievously fighting on average 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.570
 why if the damage at 100 if the 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.380
 damage per shot is reduced by 100 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:02.350
 why then will total output hurt 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.630
 sinking, therefore sinks related 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.280
 but then we count on the shows 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.320
 do 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.470
 45 feet in the battle with damage 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.980
 then there must be 500 damage 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.980
 or something 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:20.640
 and then the wall shots or the 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:23.099
 number of players that one switches when and then 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.659
 have the content had 100 or something 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:28.379
 that means we will not be 500 anymore 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:30.659
 but about 3 400 difference 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:36.900
 in reality it is so that you 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:40.889
 the bank hurt the lower one so how 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.200
 here now the 97 in the 193 left 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.879
 remained 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.340
 because of this you often lose yourself under one 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:52.159
 dies earlier in many stories than 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:54.079
 it would have been earlier this year 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:58.639
 died 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:04:00.959
 and that brings just that said 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:04.590
 reduction of the loss emissions 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:06.959
 Overall, I think that's a shame 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:11.280
 because one would have to differentiate , of course 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:15.139
 which ansa should go often 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:18.150
 which does not work especially first of all 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:21.750
 one said yes yes the tanks suffer 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:27.000
 no york because there is an increase 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:30.510
 the shot follows that is depending on 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.720
 Charging time is reduced what happened 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:38.150
 one has increased the loading time a bit 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:41.190
 but not so much around on the 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.580
 So dpm will do harm per minute 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:50.100
 that is, to come from earlier 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:52.700
 In the past , the value is sooner 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.700
 so 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:06.810
 here we are currently 2300 and earlier 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:11.669
 the value at 2,400 or something above it 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:14.460
 say so by hundreds of wm fans output 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.710
 100 per minute can be quite a 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.199
 role-play 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:22.020
 and I'll tell you when the tank is in 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:24.389
 the statistics a bit better 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:29.700
 would have been different or strong 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:31.620
 would be unusual then gm but at one 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.660
 panzer e.on is popular and when 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:38.250
 my servers overlap the statistics 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:41.010
 from 48 to 49 percent why I know 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.550
 not so that was in my view 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.550
 complete 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.880
 unwarranted and I think so 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.530
 I'm sorry for my part anyway 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.639
 does not like the tank as well as 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.800
 earlier and even consider the 30 times 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:02.130
 to get back 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.400
 and he has at least a full tower 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:08.759
 and one 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.759
 good good really area down 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:22.240
 and the damage was at 750 earlier and 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:25.530
 is still 750 that is that 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:29.500
 Panzer was not annoyed then 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:32.110
 and in the fight you see we have that 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:35.199
 enemy team wiped out by the 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:37.060
 putsch on one side on a flank 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:38.650
 so that the opponents also the other 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.320
 flank were no longer in agreement 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:43.389
 one has driven back one is like 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:46.690
 further before ridden one in the rent 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:49.810
 went out and therefore they could 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:52.840
 All are easily wiped out 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:55.510
 individually I can only recommend you if 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:58.949
 something like that happens collects you all 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:07:02.979
 forces will agree on what you do 

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:05.710
 continue as shown and scattered 

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:09.039
 not if it is already 14 to 9 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:11.080
 or so do not dissipate that it will 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:12.789
 your only chance is that the 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.460
 opponents then say come we do not know 

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:18.160
 we'll finish it or 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.389
 at least that could hurt more 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.389
 do even more and complete 

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:26.830
 perhaps even a well-kept 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:28.690
 battle exit walls and at this 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:33.669
 good note I briefly show the results 

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:35.530
 that's the kind of note that will make me 

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:37.690
 video finish thank you for your 

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:41.740
 Attention is what you write 

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:44.229
 about this, he this year from the 110 4 

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:48.180
 think mine there are already tanks 

00:07:44.229 --> 00:07:50.320
 were too strong some but all that 

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:53.220
 total statistics was just not too 

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.660
 strong and 

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:59.110
 four did not belong to the determined 

00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:00.820
 most dangerous tanks in the game so 

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:03.430
 leave your comments now 

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:06.700
 more please once so a thumbs up 

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:09.930
 and please subscribe to channel 

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.930
 goodbye soon
