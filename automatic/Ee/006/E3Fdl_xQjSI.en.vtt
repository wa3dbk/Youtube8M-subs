00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.370 
those images I made of myself while
reading<00:03:03.210> the<00:03:03.240> text<00:03:03.780> of<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:05.190> Bible<00:03:06.050> so<00:03:07.050> it

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
reading the text of the Bible so it

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.280 
reading the text of the Bible so it
seems<00:03:08.040> to<00:03:08.160> me<00:03:08.250> that<00:03:08.690> these<00:03:09.690> were<00:03:09.930> miracles

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290

act that is hopefully an act of

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.300 
act that is hopefully an act of
salvation<00:04:09.019> so<00:04:10.019> when<00:04:10.350> we<00:04:10.500> talk<00:04:10.680> about<00:04:10.739> miracle
