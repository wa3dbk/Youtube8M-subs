00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.329 

and<00:00:32.850> strain<00:00:33.390> these<00:00:33.570> shows<00:00:33.899> come<00:00:34.679> sell<00:00:37.010> 3gs<00:00:38.010> I'm

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:38.339 
and strain these shows come sell 3gs I'm

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:44.630 
and strain these shows come sell 3gs I'm
on<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.699> screen<00:00:40.640> we<00:00:41.640> have<00:00:42.260> don't<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.640> lab

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
on the screen we have don't have the lab

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.369 
on the screen we have don't have the lab
bar<00:00:44.909> there<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.449> signal<00:00:45.839> bar<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.229> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
bar there is the signal bar and the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.910 
bar there is the signal bar and the
right<00:00:46.589> bar<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.579> battery<00:00:48.329> bar<00:00:48.589> so<00:00:49.589> we

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
right bar that is the battery bar so we

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.299 
right bar that is the battery bar so we
find<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.489> works<00:00:51.079> when<00:00:52.079> we<00:00:52.859> have<00:00:53.010> tried

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
find that this works when we have tried

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.979 
find that this works when we have tried
to<00:00:53.399> prove<00:00:53.609> that<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:54.000> actually<00:00:54.269> works<00:00:54.690> so

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
to prove that this actually works so

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.450 
to prove that this actually works so
we're<00:00:55.199> going<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.500> try<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.010> phone<00:00:56.339> call<00:00:58.430> when<00:00:59.430> i

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
we're going to try a phone call when i

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:18.280 
we're going to try a phone call when i
call<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.269> other<00:01:00.420> number

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.010 

so<00:01:18.830> right<00:01:19.130> now<00:01:19.160> it<00:01:19.460> is<00:01:19.730> ringing<00:01:20.240> it's<00:01:20.840> been

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
so right now it is ringing it's been

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.490 
so right now it is ringing it's been
seeing<00:01:21.260> this<00:01:21.740> it<00:01:22.130> has<00:01:22.310> a<00:01:23.110> incoming<00:01:24.110> phone<00:01:24.290> call

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
seeing this it has a incoming phone call

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.310 
seeing this it has a incoming phone call
so<00:01:24.860> we<00:01:25.100> go<00:01:25.190> touch<00:01:25.430> it<00:01:25.640> good<00:01:26.060> another<00:01:26.320> say

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
so we go touch it good another say

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.400 
so we go touch it good another say
actually<00:01:27.530> works<00:01:27.980> as<00:01:28.520> you<00:01:28.640> can<00:01:28.730> see<00:01:28.940> so<00:01:29.930> it<00:01:30.110> does

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
actually works as you can see so it does

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.620
