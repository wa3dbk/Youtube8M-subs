when<00:01:10.460> I'm<00:01:10.550> in<00:01:11.300> transport<00:01:11.900> this<00:01:12.500> is<00:01:12.560> what<00:01:12.770> it

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
when I'm in transport this is what it

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:13.810 
when I'm in transport this is what it
would<00:01:12.920> look<00:01:13.010> like<00:01:13.070> if<00:01:13.340> I<00:01:13.430> was<00:01:13.520> getting<00:01:13.640> ready

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
would look like if I was getting ready

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.360 
would look like if I was getting ready
to<00:01:13.909> go<00:01:14.060> on<00:01:14.150> a<00:01:14.210> transport<00:01:14.750> here<00:01:15.020> I<00:01:15.740> probably

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
to go on a transport here I probably

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.880 
to go on a transport here I probably
would<00:01:16.640> not<00:01:16.820> have<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.390> fish<00:01:18.170> finder<00:01:18.470> with<00:01:18.800> the

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
would not have the fish finder with the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.000 
would not have the fish finder with the
chair<00:01:19.190> there<00:01:19.460> but<00:01:19.760> I<00:01:20.630> went<00:01:21.170> on<00:01:21.290> a<00:01:21.320> local<00:01:21.740> trip

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
chair there but I went on a local trip

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.010 
chair there but I went on a local trip
this<00:01:22.250> weekend<00:01:22.729> and<00:01:23.000> just<00:01:23.150> left<00:01:23.360> them<00:01:23.540> on<00:01:23.659> and

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
this weekend and just left them on and

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.219 
this weekend and just left them on and
they<00:01:24.650> were<00:01:24.710> totally<00:01:25.100> fine<00:01:25.340> I<00:01:25.990> think<00:01:26.990> for

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
they were totally fine I think for

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.630 
they were totally fine I think for
longer<00:01:27.530> trips<00:01:27.680> I'd<00:01:27.950> probably<00:01:28.100> strip<00:01:28.430> all<00:01:28.610> that

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
longer trips I'd probably strip all that

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.020 
longer trips I'd probably strip all that
off<00:01:28.909> of<00:01:29.060> there<00:01:29.180> but<00:01:30.100> for<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:31.190> time<00:01:31.400> being
