00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.760 

I<00:00:01.300> just<00:00:02.300> got<00:00:02.510> through<00:00:02.690> installing<00:00:03.050> a<00:00:03.409> French

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:03.770 
I just got through installing a French

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.440 
I just got through installing a French
door<00:00:04.130> and<00:00:04.400> I<00:00:05.270> removed<00:00:05.630> an<00:00:05.780> old<00:00:06.020> window<00:00:06.470> and<00:00:07.450> now

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.450 
door and I removed an old window and now

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.800 
door and I removed an old window and now
I<00:00:08.480> need<00:00:09.050> to<00:00:09.350> seal<00:00:10.040> the<00:00:10.400> building<00:00:10.610> paper<00:00:11.269> to

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:11.810 
I need to seal the building paper to

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.460 
I need to seal the building paper to
create<00:00:12.140> some<00:00:12.440> type<00:00:12.710> of<00:00:12.740> a<00:00:12.980> water<00:00:13.370> proof<00:00:14.470> water

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.470 
create some type of a water proof water

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.470 
create some type of a water proof water
resistant<00:00:16.189> would<00:00:16.309> be<00:00:16.460> a<00:00:16.490> better<00:00:16.760> word<00:00:17.060> because

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
resistant would be a better word because

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.210 
resistant would be a better word because
you<00:00:17.630> can't<00:00:17.839> really<00:00:18.050> make<00:00:18.259> a<00:00:18.320> waterproof

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.519 

building<00:00:22.220> seal<00:00:22.640> using<00:00:23.239> water<00:00:23.720> resistant

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
building seal using water resistant

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.649 
building seal using water resistant
materials<00:00:25.460> so<00:00:25.999> you'd<00:00:26.239> have<00:00:26.269> to<00:00:26.480> use

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:26.659 
materials so you'd have to use

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:29.050 
materials so you'd have to use
waterproof<00:00:27.079> materials<00:00:27.949> which<00:00:28.249> we<00:00:28.460> don't<00:00:28.609> use

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
waterproof materials which we don't use

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.019 
waterproof materials which we don't use
and<00:00:29.419> there's<00:00:29.659> a<00:00:29.720> good<00:00:29.899> reason<00:00:29.929> why<00:00:30.289> we<00:00:30.619> don't

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
and there's a good reason why we don't

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.380 
and there's a good reason why we don't
the<00:00:32.029> building<00:00:32.450> needs<00:00:32.630> to<00:00:32.750> breathe<00:00:33.079> so<00:00:34.390> the

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
the building needs to breathe so the

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.680 
the building needs to breathe so the
arrow<00:00:35.629> black<00:00:36.170> arrow<00:00:36.410> is<00:00:36.620> pointing<00:00:37.160> to<00:00:37.460> a<00:00:37.760> bead

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
arrow black arrow is pointing to a bead

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.229 
arrow black arrow is pointing to a bead
of<00:00:38.719> caulking<00:00:39.440> that<00:00:40.039> I<00:00:40.070> put<00:00:40.370> down<00:00:40.399> and<00:00:40.940> this<00:00:41.059> is

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
of caulking that I put down and this is

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.110 
of caulking that I put down and this is
a<00:00:41.269> polyurethane<00:00:42.969> caulking

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
a polyurethane caulking

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.040 
a polyurethane caulking
I'm<00:00:44.690> sorry<00:00:45.079> polybutylene<00:00:46.449> caulking<00:00:47.449> and

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.299 

silicone<00:00:51.050> would<00:00:51.230> probably<00:00:51.559> work<00:00:51.710> fine<00:00:51.980> here

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
silicone would probably work fine here

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.770 
silicone would probably work fine here
also<00:00:52.519> but<00:00:53.239> since<00:00:53.570> I'm<00:00:53.809> not<00:00:54.050> going<00:00:54.410> to<00:00:54.829> beat<00:00:55.780> you

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
also but since I'm not going to beat you

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.079 
also but since I'm not going to beat you
know<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.920> stucco<00:00:58.370> off<00:01:00.190> its<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:01.579> building

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
know the stucco off its the building

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.840 
know the stucco off its the building
paper<00:01:02.300> needs<00:01:02.629> to<00:01:02.749> lap<00:01:03.050> 12<00:01:03.440> inches

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
paper needs to lap 12 inches

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.460 
paper needs to lap 12 inches
whenever<00:01:05.390> runs<00:01:05.690> in<00:01:05.840> a<00:01:05.900> horizontal<00:01:06.200> direction

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
whenever runs in a horizontal direction

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.770 
whenever runs in a horizontal direction
and<00:01:07.190> I'm<00:01:07.280> not<00:01:07.520> going<00:01:07.910> to<00:01:08.030> do<00:01:08.180> that<00:01:08.390> because<00:01:08.630> I

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
and I'm not going to do that because I

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.600 
and I'm not going to do that because I
would<00:01:08.960> need<00:01:09.230> to<00:01:09.350> chip<00:01:09.650> the<00:01:09.830> whole<00:01:10.010> damn<00:01:10.250> wall

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
would need to chip the whole damn wall

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.770 
would need to chip the whole damn wall
off<00:01:10.850> to<00:01:11.090> make<00:01:11.270> it<00:01:11.450> to<00:01:11.960> make<00:01:12.140> it<00:01:12.610> work<00:01:13.610> so<00:01:13.940> what<00:01:14.750> I

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
off to make it to make it work so what I

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.690 
off to make it to make it work so what I
did<00:01:14.930> was<00:01:15.290> I<00:01:15.440> installed<00:01:15.830> a<00:01:15.980> bead<00:01:16.220> of<00:01:16.250> caulking

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
did was I installed a bead of caulking

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.540 
did was I installed a bead of caulking
and<00:01:17.200> then<00:01:18.200> in<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:18.590> next<00:01:18.740> video<00:01:19.130> you're<00:01:19.400> going

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
and then in the next video you're going

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.060 
and then in the next video you're going
to<00:01:19.610> see<00:01:19.850> where<00:01:20.060> I<00:01:20.270> put<00:01:20.810> some<00:01:21.500> building<00:01:21.860> paper

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
to see where I put some building paper

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.050 
to see where I put some building paper
over<00:01:22.640> that<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:23.150> then<00:01:23.810> I<00:01:24.080> put<00:01:24.860> more<00:01:25.310> caulking

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
over that and then I put more caulking

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.570 
over that and then I put more caulking
on<00:01:26.270> it<00:01:26.540> again<00:01:26.960> as<00:01:27.260> much<00:01:27.500> as<00:01:27.680> I<00:01:27.800> can<00:01:27.860> I<00:01:28.430> mean

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
on it again as much as I can I mean

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.090 
on it again as much as I can I mean
whenever<00:01:29.570> you<00:01:29.810> run<00:01:29.960> into<00:01:30.170> a<00:01:30.200> situation<00:01:30.290> like

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
whenever you run into a situation like

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.850 
whenever you run into a situation like
this<00:01:31.430> more<00:01:32.060> is<00:01:32.390> probably<00:01:32.960> always<00:01:33.200> going<00:01:33.620> to<00:01:33.740> be

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
this more is probably always going to be

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.410 
this more is probably always going to be
better

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.220 

okay<00:01:38.420> here's<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:38.930> building<00:01:39.350> paper<00:01:39.830> I<00:01:41.140> put<00:01:42.140> it

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
okay here's the building paper I put it

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.350 
okay here's the building paper I put it
over<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:45.010> caulking<00:01:46.010> that<00:01:46.520> I<00:01:46.550> put<00:01:46.850> down<00:01:47.090> and

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
over the caulking that I put down and

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.200 
over the caulking that I put down and
again<00:01:47.690> you<00:01:47.870> can<00:01:48.050> always<00:01:48.460> put<00:01:49.460> more<00:01:49.700> building

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
again you can always put more building

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.690 
again you can always put more building
paper<00:01:50.480> on<00:01:50.780> slide<00:01:51.260> as<00:01:51.500> much<00:01:51.680> building<00:01:52.100> paper<00:01:52.340> as

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
paper on slide as much building paper as

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.740 
paper on slide as much building paper as
you<00:01:53.270> can<00:01:53.540> behind<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.920> stucco<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:55.850> in<00:01:56.510> order

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
you can behind the stucco and in order

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.820 
you can behind the stucco and in order
to<00:01:56.900> do<00:01:57.050> this<00:01:57.200> you're<00:01:57.350> going<00:01:57.410> to<00:01:57.590> need<00:01:57.740> to

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
to do this you're going to need to

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.160 
to do this you're going to need to
remove<00:01:58.130> all<00:01:58.370> of<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:58.610> nails<00:01:58.880> or<00:01:59.120> staples<00:01:59.270> which

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
remove all of the nails or staples which

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.010 
remove all of the nails or staples which
is<00:02:00.350> what<00:02:00.560> I<00:02:00.590> did<00:02:01.100> I<00:02:01.370> beat<00:02:01.910> the<00:02:02.060> stucco<00:02:02.300> back<00:02:02.660> far

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
is what I did I beat the stucco back far

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.160 
is what I did I beat the stucco back far
enough<00:02:03.050> to<00:02:03.380> where<00:02:03.830> I<00:02:04.100> could<00:02:04.370> remove<00:02:04.850> as<00:02:05.270> many

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
enough to where I could remove as many

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.270 
enough to where I could remove as many
nails<00:02:06.620> a<00:02:08.229> that's<00:02:09.229> right<00:02:09.410> this<00:02:09.590> was<00:02:09.830> nailed<00:02:10.100> on

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
nails a that's right this was nailed on

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.310 
nails a that's right this was nailed on
it<00:02:10.429> wasn't<00:02:10.759> stapled<00:02:11.209> on<00:02:11.330> this<00:02:11.780> house<00:02:11.930> is<00:02:11.959> built

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
it wasn't stapled on this house is built

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.380 
it wasn't stapled on this house is built
in<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.590> 50s<00:02:13.070> so<00:02:13.520> there's<00:02:13.820> a<00:02:13.880> good<00:02:14.030> chance<00:02:14.270> that

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
in the 50s so there's a good chance that

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.690 
in the 50s so there's a good chance that
you're<00:02:14.630> not<00:02:14.660> going<00:02:14.990> to<00:02:15.050> find<00:02:15.260> any<00:02:15.470> staples<00:02:16.010> on

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
you're not going to find any staples on

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.480 
you're not going to find any staples on
them<00:02:17.120> so<00:02:17.480> I<00:02:17.840> took<00:02:17.990> the<00:02:18.230> nails<00:02:18.440> out<00:02:18.709> and<00:02:21.490> slid

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
I could but again the main part that is

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.229 
I could but again the main part that is

going to provide us where the protection
is<00:02:32.630> going<00:02:32.959> to<00:02:33.080> be<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.470> caulking<00:02:34.040> now<00:02:34.520> another

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
is going to be the caulking now another

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.449 
is going to be the caulking now another
thing<00:02:35.270> I'd<00:02:35.390> like<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.570> point<00:02:35.750> out<00:02:36.170> this<00:02:36.980> is<00:02:37.040> on<00:02:37.430> a

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
thing I'd like to point out this is on a

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.970 
thing I'd like to point out this is on a
single-story<00:02:38.120> house<00:02:38.480> with<00:02:38.930> about<00:02:39.050> an<00:02:39.320> 18-inch

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
single-story house with about an 18-inch

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.160 
single-story house with about an 18-inch
roof<00:02:40.250> overhang<00:02:40.820> there's<00:02:41.360> not<00:02:41.660> going<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:41.989> be<00:02:42.080> a

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
roof overhang there's not going to be a

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.160 
roof overhang there's not going to be a
lot<00:02:42.380> of<00:02:42.410> water<00:02:42.739> hitting<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:44.120> stucco<00:02:44.600> here

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
lot of water hitting the stucco here

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.910 
lot of water hitting the stucco here
now<00:02:45.769> if<00:02:45.950> this<00:02:46.130> was<00:02:46.400> on<00:02:46.580> a<00:02:46.610> two-story<00:02:47.300> home<00:02:47.920> at

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
now if this was on a two-story home at

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.539 
now if this was on a two-story home at
the<00:02:49.280> bottom<00:02:49.840> and<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.350> Rena<00:02:51.590> train<00:02:52.040> hit

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
the bottom and and the Rena train hit

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.370 
the bottom and and the Rena train hit
the<00:02:52.880> wall<00:02:53.090> at<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.360> right<00:02:53.630> angle<00:02:53.989> this<00:02:54.140> thing

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
the wall at the right angle this thing

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.150 
the wall at the right angle this thing
could<00:02:54.560> just<00:02:54.590> get<00:02:54.890> bashed<00:02:55.400> with<00:02:55.820> water<00:02:56.330> and<00:02:57.160> you

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
could just get bashed with water and you

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.560 
could just get bashed with water and you
would<00:02:58.459> need<00:02:58.670> to<00:02:58.850> take<00:02:59.030> a<00:02:59.090> few<00:02:59.390> more

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
would need to take a few more

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.410 
would need to take a few more
precautions<00:03:00.410> if<00:03:00.650> that<00:03:00.830> was<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.160> situation<00:03:01.420> so

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
precautions if that was the situation so

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.100 
precautions if that was the situation so
again<00:03:02.870> this<00:03:03.049> is<00:03:03.230> one<00:03:03.560> method<00:03:04.130> that<00:03:05.110> works

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
again this is one method that works

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.470 
again this is one method that works
under<00:03:06.620> certain<00:03:06.890> conditions<00:03:07.730> but<00:03:07.820> it<00:03:08.030> will<00:03:08.239> not

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
under certain conditions but it will not

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.549 
under certain conditions but it will not
work<00:03:08.720> under<00:03:08.989> every<00:03:09.530> single<00:03:09.799> condition
