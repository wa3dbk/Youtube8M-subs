00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.799
 more than ten percent of all gasoline 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 sold in Moscow is a surrogate 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.150
 which can damage the engine in 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.040
 last year more than 50 thousand cars 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.630
 got into service because of bad fuel 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.460
 This statistics only official 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.230
 our service stations 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.270
 correspondent Mark Dranitsyn got a job 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.210
 work for one of Moscow gas stations 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.960
 and from the inside I saw what was poured and 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.960
 our gas tank 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.890
 habit of refueling to full tank 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.960
 Of course it's good, but as it shows 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.030
 practice is completely disadvantageous i only have 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.460
 we can pour gasoline more than 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.360
 placed in the tank to pay on the card 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.560
 wood 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.480
 check 10 liters a year in the car 600 liters 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.980
 in addition to talking to 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.230
 teammates yes on the car forum 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.660
 no one more than 50 8 could score but 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.980
 most do not add truckers 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.200
 limits 150 somewhere 10-15 liters for sure 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.239
 do not add all the black revenue is 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.580
 tens of thousands of rubles divided among themselves 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.680
 Managing Oases proper man 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.540
 which inserts a gun into the tank we 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.700
 decided to find out how this works 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.410
 systems settled us with later 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.770
 some time we were told part 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:19.729
 Secrets and no shifts sell without cheek 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.430
 700 liters of checks there is still some 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.640
 golem tee like don't be afraid if they come 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.680
 with miller either she will take 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.820
 turns off and what should I do when 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.790
 this is where the automatics circle understand 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.160
 this sarah type north columns 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.170
 narah there was such there are two 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.300
 deception method first is the bug 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.400
 installed but the column itself which 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.290
 spinning up an electronic meter 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.600
 already corrected data fall 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.400
 payment system otherwise usually these 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.650
 bugs supply Russia from Poland and 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.990
 Finland is such a device from 300 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.520
 thousand rubles they already understand who is in it 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.440
 maybe just interested 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.619
 suggest i think it is this way 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.659
 happens and offer no head 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.580
 Tom can be there manager 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.130
 for out of pain some kind of low link 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.000
 program method is easier and cheaper 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.010
 analog meter column 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.570
 twist by hand already under it 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.790
 customized readings in the computer 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.250
 accounting system such columns are configured 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.620
 work honestly only when they take 10 20 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.900
 50 liters in case of checking because 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.450
 measuring tanks is only such volume and 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.430
 yet not at all with prefer complicated 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.950
 path bugs did not give you much 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.750
 easier to sell cheap fuel along with 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.760
 activists who are trying to fight 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.890
 selling a surrogate and sent by 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.549
 M7 highway refuel on the first 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.430
 got refueling bought 4 liters of 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.350
 the fact here is three four hundred 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.940
 drive a few more kilometers 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.940
 the situation is absolutely similar 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.190
 near sell summer diesel here at all 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.290
 there are no documents where government agencies look 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.820
 why them for this no one was watching, and so 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.740
 another petrol station in 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.200
 Vladimir region oddly enough she 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.300
 with mechanical speakers nonetheless 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.220
 then none of motorists do not confuse 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.230
 because here is always on the board 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.150
 you can see a very attractive course on 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.620
 all fuels for small from a 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.960
 the only way to survive is 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.240
 collaborate with underground refineries where 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.920
 no one controls the quality of gasoline 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.930
 all purchased in the Vladimir region 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.370
 gasoline we send for examination in 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:24.900
 lab say which bottle 95 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.150
 And in which octane is much lower it is impossible 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.340
 here are the results of the examination at the norm 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.260
 grays 50 milligrams per kilogram 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.960
 there was more fuel in our samples 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.080
 8000 and total octane at 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.820
 95 standard barely reached 80 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.770
 almost any car after 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.990
 refueling with such gasoline will break already 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.120
 after a few kilometers trip 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.830
 In most cases low prices are 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.630
 signal for customers because no one 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.940
 refueling will not work at a loss 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.410
 easier to buy low-quality fuel and 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.140
 sell it under the guise of products 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.390
 European sample and even if you do not 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.360
 want to overpay better give up 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.190
 habit to fill up to full tank
