hair the hair also comes wrapped in this
neck<00:03:12.880> to<00:03:13.090> prevent<00:03:13.390> it<00:03:13.540> from<00:03:13.570> tangling<00:03:14.110> so<00:03:14.410> just

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
neck to prevent it from tangling so just

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.140 
neck to prevent it from tangling so just
in<00:03:14.709> case<00:03:14.830> you<00:03:15.010> want<00:03:15.160> to<00:03:15.250> put<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:15.550> up<00:03:15.670> afterwards

in case you want to put it up afterwards

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.820 
in case you want to put it up afterwards
you<00:03:16.269> can<00:03:16.390> go<00:03:16.570> ahead<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:16.900> put<00:03:17.050> your<00:03:17.080> net<00:03:17.410> over

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
it so I really think this was very

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.839 
go in and get some more layers going in
in<00:04:11.319> the<00:04:11.440> front<00:04:11.739> because<00:04:11.890> I<00:04:12.160> have<00:04:12.310> a<00:04:12.340> very<00:04:12.549> wrong

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
in the front because I have a very wrong

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:15.900 
in the front because I have a very wrong
face<00:04:13.360> so<00:04:14.019> I<00:04:14.080> really<00:04:14.410> want<00:04:15.040> to<00:04:15.190> go<00:04:15.310> in<00:04:15.489> some<00:04:15.760> more

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
face so I really want to go in some more

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.270 
face so I really want to go in some more
and<00:04:16.090> get<00:04:16.209> some<00:04:16.359> more<00:04:16.570> layers<00:04:16.810> on<00:04:17.199> the<00:04:17.680> top<00:04:17.859> part

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
and get some more layers on the top part

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.280 
and get some more layers on the top part
of<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.549> way<00:04:18.669> but<00:04:19.269> it's<00:04:19.389> pretty<00:04:19.540> cool<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:20.199> way

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
of the way but it's pretty cool the way

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.379 
of the way but it's pretty cool the way
it<00:04:20.320> is<00:04:20.500> already<00:04:20.829> layered<00:04:21.070> so<00:04:22.000> the<00:04:22.120> difference

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
it is already layered so the difference

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:23.610 
it is already layered so the difference
between<00:04:22.479> the<00:04:22.690> four<00:04:22.840> or<00:04:22.990> five<00:04:23.229> are<00:04:23.350> here<00:04:23.470> from

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
hair is the fact that this can be sad

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.300

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.450 
amount of heat that you actually use
because<00:04:40.630> it<00:04:40.750> is<00:04:40.960> designed<00:04:41.169> to<00:04:41.919> be<00:04:42.039> used<00:04:42.070> with

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
because it is designed to be used with

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.730 
because it is designed to be used with
direct<00:04:42.970> heat<00:04:43.300> so<00:04:43.810> you<00:04:43.840> can<00:04:44.020> go<00:04:44.139> ahead<00:04:44.260> and<00:04:44.410> use

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
direct heat so you can go ahead and use

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.680 
direct heat so you can go ahead and use
your<00:04:44.889> flat<00:04:45.190> irons<00:04:45.610> or<00:04:45.850> curling<00:04:46.180> irons<00:04:46.510> or

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
your flat irons or curling irons or

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.450 
your flat irons or curling irons or
curling<00:04:46.960> wands<00:04:47.199> and<00:04:47.440> all<00:04:47.560> of<00:04:47.710> that<00:04:47.740> just<00:04:48.310> add

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
curling wands and all of that just add

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.219 
curling wands and all of that just add
that<00:04:48.639> here<00:04:48.789> at<00:04:48.880> to<00:04:49.030> your<00:04:49.180> desire<00:04:49.539> and<00:04:49.690> I<00:04:49.900> really

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
that here at to your desire and I really

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:52.260 
that here at to your desire and I really
think<00:04:50.410> that's<00:04:50.530> very<00:04:50.949> awesome<00:04:51.370> because<00:04:51.669> a<00:04:51.910> lot

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
think that's very awesome because a lot

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.000 
think that's very awesome because a lot
of<00:04:52.300> these<00:04:52.510> synthetic<00:04:52.720> cures<00:04:53.199> can't<00:04:53.500> use<00:04:53.830> the

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
of these synthetic cures can't use the

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.370 
of these synthetic cures can't use the
direct<00:04:54.280> heat<00:04:54.490> or<00:04:54.699> it<00:04:54.820> will<00:04:54.970> burn<00:04:55.180> but<00:04:55.780> not<00:04:56.229> this

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
direct heat or it will burn but not this

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.960 
direct heat or it will burn but not this
one<00:04:56.740> and<00:04:56.979> I<00:04:57.190> think<00:04:57.250> that's<00:04:57.550> just<00:04:57.639> pretty<00:04:57.820> cool

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
one and I think that's just pretty cool

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.540 
one and I think that's just pretty cool
so<00:04:58.720> for<00:04:58.900> the<00:04:59.050> closure<00:04:59.260> I<00:04:59.710> really<00:05:00.220> afraid<00:05:00.430> of

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
so for the closure I really afraid of

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.700 
so for the closure I really afraid of
closures<00:05:00.970> generally<00:05:01.599> I<00:05:01.630> run<00:05:02.139> away<00:05:02.320> from<00:05:02.380> them

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
closures generally I run away from them

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.409 
closures generally I run away from them
because<00:05:02.860> they<00:05:03.310> tend<00:05:03.520> to<00:05:03.580> look<00:05:03.729> so<00:05:03.910> fake<00:05:04.150> but

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
because they tend to look so fake but

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:05.909 
because they tend to look so fake but
this<00:05:04.840> is<00:05:04.990> a<00:05:05.110> lace<00:05:05.349> closure

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
this is a lace closure

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.670 
this is a lace closure
I<00:05:06.070> have<00:05:06.220> not<00:05:06.400> bleached<00:05:06.669> anything<00:05:07.300> all<00:05:08.080> I<00:05:08.110> do<00:05:08.289> is

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
I have not bleached anything all I do is

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.589 
I have not bleached anything all I do is
just<00:05:08.979> I<00:05:09.160> ensure<00:05:09.460> that<00:05:09.490> my<00:05:09.789> hair<00:05:10.030> underneath

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
just I ensure that my hair underneath

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:13.440 
just I ensure that my hair underneath
the<00:05:10.750> wig<00:05:10.900> is<00:05:11.080> laying<00:05:11.380> really<00:05:11.919> really<00:05:12.160> flat<00:05:12.450> and

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
the wig is laying really really flat and

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.060 
the wig is laying really really flat and
then<00:05:13.570> I<00:05:13.660> go<00:05:13.780> ahead<00:05:13.870> and<00:05:13.960> I<00:05:14.139> put<00:05:14.169> a<00:05:14.530> stocking<00:05:15.039> cap

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
then I go ahead and I put a stocking cap

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.430 
then I go ahead and I put a stocking cap
on<00:05:15.400> and<00:05:15.669> then<00:05:16.060> after<00:05:16.330> that<00:05:16.419> I<00:05:16.479> put<00:05:16.750> my<00:05:16.930> ensure

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
on and then after that I put my ensure

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.990 
on and then after that I put my ensure
that<00:05:17.560> my<00:05:17.680> edges<00:05:17.950> are<00:05:18.039> laid<00:05:18.250> I<00:05:18.280> try<00:05:18.669> to<00:05:18.729> ensure

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
that my edges are laid I try to ensure

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.250 
that my edges are laid I try to ensure
that<00:05:19.120> my<00:05:19.330> edges<00:05:19.599> are<00:05:19.660> laid<00:05:19.810> all<00:05:19.990> the<00:05:20.020> time

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
that my edges are laid all the time

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.930 
that my edges are laid all the time
before<00:05:20.380> I<00:05:20.530> put<00:05:20.680> the<00:05:20.770> wig<00:05:20.889> on<00:05:20.979> because<00:05:21.370> if<00:05:21.729> it's

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
before I put the wig on because if it's

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.310 
before I put the wig on because if it's
not<00:05:22.120> then<00:05:22.360> you're<00:05:22.570> just<00:05:22.780> going<00:05:22.960> to<00:05:23.020> have<00:05:23.169> that

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
not then you're just going to have that

not then you're just going to have that
obvious<00:05:23.770> closure<00:05:24.070> effect<00:05:24.940> and<00:05:25.180> I<00:05:25.300> really<00:05:25.630> hate

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
obvious closure effect and I really hate

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.890 
obvious closure effect and I really hate
seeing<00:05:26.110> nut<00:05:26.320> so<00:05:26.770> I<00:05:26.800> try<00:05:27.010> to<00:05:27.039> ensure<00:05:27.250> that<00:05:27.400> my

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
edges are laid and then after I put the

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.089 
edges are laid and then after I put the
wig<00:05:30.729> on<00:05:30.849> I<00:05:31.150> line<00:05:31.690> it<00:05:31.720> with<00:05:32.020> the<00:05:32.139> part<00:05:32.410> in<00:05:32.770> my<00:05:32.919> own

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
your comb because it does get tangled
