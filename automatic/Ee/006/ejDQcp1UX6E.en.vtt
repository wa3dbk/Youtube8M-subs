earlier<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.340> video<00:00:41.670> I'm<00:00:42.120> gonna<00:00:42.329> be<00:00:42.390> showing

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
earlier this video I'm gonna be showing

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.060 
earlier this video I'm gonna be showing
these<00:00:42.960> layers<00:00:43.350> for<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.040> piece<00:00:45.050> a<00:00:46.070> couple

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
these layers for this piece a couple

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.850 
these layers for this piece a couple
people<00:00:47.219> wanted<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.850> see<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.629> layers<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.410> guess

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
people wanted to see the layers I guess

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.850 
people wanted to see the layers I guess
they<00:00:50.039> want<00:00:50.250> proof<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.140> final

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
they want proof and this is the final

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.950 
they want proof and this is the final
piece<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.670> I'm<00:00:53.969> gonna<00:00:54.059> just<00:00:54.239> take<00:00:54.480> our<00:00:54.719> look

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
piece and I'm gonna just take our look

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.830 
piece and I'm gonna just take our look
look<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.530> layers<00:00:55.770> off<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:57.120> just<00:00:57.510> show<00:00:57.690> them

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
look the layers off and just show them

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.540 
look the layers off and just show them
whenever<00:00:58.440> time<00:00:58.890> starting<00:00:59.670> with<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> eyes<00:01:01.550> and

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
whenever time starting with the eyes and

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.130 
whenever time starting with the eyes and
I<00:01:02.640> did<00:01:02.879> do<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.270> little<00:01:03.539> different<00:01:04.019> and

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
I did do this a little different and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.320 
I did do this a little different and
this<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.739> left<00:01:04.979> eye<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.000> right<00:01:06.270> eye

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
this is the left eye and the right eye

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.969 
this is the left eye and the right eye
but<00:01:07.080> with<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:09.080> created<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.590> white<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
but with this I created the white of the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:19.060 
but with this I created the white of the
eye<00:01:11.220> with<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.090> section<00:01:12.900> around<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:16.549> just

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
eye with that section around it so just

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.520 
eye with that section around it so just
and<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.280> was<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.549> way<00:01:21.210> more<00:01:21.540> detailed<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.470> I

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
and this was a way more detailed and I

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.399 
and this was a way more detailed and I
usually<00:01:23.100> put<00:01:23.400> into<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> gradient<00:01:24.150> mesh<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.990> you

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
usually put into a gradient mesh and you

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.950 
usually put into a gradient mesh and you
see<00:01:25.650> some<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.159> layers<00:01:26.369> will<00:01:26.970> reveal<00:01:27.570> some

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
see some of the layers will reveal some

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.350 
see some of the layers will reveal some
of<00:01:27.990> my<00:01:28.259> mistakes<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:29.310> make<00:01:29.579> with<00:01:29.820> not<00:01:30.060> really

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
of my mistakes I make with not really

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.710 
of my mistakes I make with not really
mistakes<00:01:30.810> they're<00:01:31.820> things<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.119> cover<00:01:33.570> up

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
mistakes they're things that I cover up

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.170 
mistakes they're things that I cover up
with<00:01:34.110> other<00:01:34.350> sections<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.340> using<00:01:36.060> these

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
with other sections so using these

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.350 
with other sections so using these
layers<00:01:36.509> correctly<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.950> can<00:01:38.250> hide<00:01:38.790> things

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
layers correctly you can hide things

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.999 
layers correctly you can hide things
that<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.869> want<00:01:40.079> don't<00:01:40.320> want<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.680> viewer<00:01:40.890> to

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
that you want don't want the viewer to

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.950 
that you want don't want the viewer to
see<00:01:41.130> but<00:01:41.790> with<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.090> video<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.689> will<00:01:42.930> be

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
see but with this video I will be

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.700 
see but with this video I will be
showing<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.530> all<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.280> but<00:01:45.240> here<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:46.350> far

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
showing you all that but here is so far

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.920 
showing you all that but here is so far
I<00:01:46.740> showing<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.430> outline<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.299> it's<00:01:48.689> all

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
I showing you the outline and it's all

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:59.149 
I showing you the outline and it's all
gradient<00:01:49.530> mesh<00:01:56.899> and<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.560> right<00:01:58.770> side

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
gradient mesh and this is the right side

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.149 
gradient mesh and this is the right side
of<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.549> face<00:01:59.820> including<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.200> ear<00:02:01.469> when<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:01.920> say

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
of the face including the ear when I say

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:13.869 
of the face including the ear when I say
right<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.850> viewers<00:02:03.270> right

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.750 

trying<00:02:14.879> to<00:02:14.970> figure<00:02:15.150> out<00:02:15.950> where<00:02:16.950> my<00:02:17.129> layers<00:02:17.400> are

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
trying to figure out where my layers are

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.520 
trying to figure out where my layers are
now<00:02:18.180> this<00:02:18.450> piece<00:02:20.239> this<00:02:21.239> lower<00:02:21.569> jaw<00:02:21.959> section

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
now this piece this lower jaw section

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.500 
now this piece this lower jaw section
the<00:02:22.980> reason<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.370> left<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.819> lot<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.390> out

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
the reason I left a lot of it out

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.180 
the reason I left a lot of it out
because<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:25.080> was<00:02:25.140> putting<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.590> lot<00:02:25.769> of<00:02:25.800> strain

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
because it was putting a lot of strain

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.300 
because it was putting a lot of strain
on<00:02:26.250> my<00:02:26.580> computer<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:27.810> went<00:02:28.769> as<00:02:28.860> far<00:02:29.069> as<00:02:29.130> I

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
on my computer so I went as far as I

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.460 
on my computer so I went as far as I
wanted<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.910> then<00:02:30.569> I<00:02:30.690> started<00:02:30.989> filling<00:02:31.260> in

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
wanted to then I started filling in

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.030 
wanted to then I started filling in
these<00:02:31.849> sections<00:02:32.849> that<00:02:33.239> I<00:02:33.300> call<00:02:33.599> the<00:02:33.630> fix<00:02:34.230> the

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
these sections that I call the fix the

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.860 
these sections that I call the fix the
fixes<00:02:35.840> so<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:37.489> put<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.610> fixes<00:02:39.060> on<00:02:39.239> top<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.720> this

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
fixes so I put the fixes on top of this

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.460 
fixes so I put the fixes on top of this
lower<00:02:40.140> jaw<00:02:40.730> so<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:41.940> is<00:02:42.090> just<00:02:42.299> so<00:02:42.959> I<00:02:43.019> can<00:02:43.110> blend

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
lower jaw so it is just so I can blend

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.850 
lower jaw so it is just so I can blend
them<00:02:43.709> in<00:02:43.980> with<00:02:44.370> what<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.120> had<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:45.750> far<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.410> I<00:02:46.620> did

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
them in with what I had so far and I did

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.979 
them in with what I had so far and I did
the<00:02:47.040> top<00:02:47.280> lip<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.790> left<00:02:48.060> off<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.450> bottom<00:02:48.780> lip

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
the top lip and left off the bottom lip

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.440 
the top lip and left off the bottom lip
as<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.410> see<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:50.579> it<00:02:50.790> was<00:02:50.940> just<00:02:51.209> it<00:02:51.420> just

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
as you see and it was just it just

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.410 
as you see and it was just it just
worked<00:02:51.840> out<00:02:51.989> that<00:02:52.049> way<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.349> had<00:02:52.590> intent<00:02:53.069> or

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
worked out that way I had intent or

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.059 
worked out that way I had intent or
intended<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.630> leave<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:55.079> bottom<00:02:55.470> lip<00:02:55.620> off<00:02:55.860> of

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
intended to leave that bottom lip off of

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.039 
intended to leave that bottom lip off of
this<00:02:56.220> mesh<00:02:56.489> anyway<00:02:56.940> because<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.630> have<00:02:57.840> more

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
this mesh anyway because you have more

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.949 
this mesh anyway because you have more
detail<00:02:58.530> than<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:58.890> top<00:02:59.130> one<00:02:59.370> so<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.150> see<00:03:00.510> these

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
detail than the top one so you see these

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:08.470 
detail than the top one so you see these
are<00:03:01.610> being<00:03:02.610> replaced<00:03:03.060> with<00:03:03.269> my<00:03:03.540> fixes<00:03:07.370> and

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
are being replaced with my fixes and

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.680 
are being replaced with my fixes and
when<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.630> do<00:03:09.900> great<00:03:10.739> unless<00:03:11.099> you<00:03:11.340> can<00:03:11.690> create

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
when you do great unless you can create

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.039 
when you do great unless you can create
a<00:03:13.019> bigger<00:03:14.010> mesh<00:03:14.430> like<00:03:14.819> I<00:03:15.000> did<00:03:15.269> when<00:03:15.750> I

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
a bigger mesh like I did when I

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.860 
a bigger mesh like I did when I
initially<00:03:16.530> intended<00:03:17.069> for<00:03:17.609> it<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:18.420> work<00:03:18.600> out

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
initially intended for it to work out

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.720 
initially intended for it to work out
but<00:03:19.170> I<00:03:19.230> didn't<00:03:19.530> have<00:03:19.769> idea<00:03:20.250> it<00:03:20.430> was<00:03:20.519> gonna

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
but I didn't have idea it was gonna

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.000 
but I didn't have idea it was gonna
strain<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.299> computer<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:21.989> mean<00:03:22.319> just<00:03:22.829> the

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
strain the computer I mean just the

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.910 
strain the computer I mean just the
clicking<00:03:23.459> was<00:03:23.609> so<00:03:23.790> tedious<00:03:24.440> but<00:03:25.440> here<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:25.769> the

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
clicking was so tedious but here is the

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.520 
clicking was so tedious but here is the
face<00:03:26.160> so<00:03:26.459> far<00:03:28.069> all<00:03:29.069> gradient<00:03:29.910> mesh<00:03:30.150> I<00:03:30.600> had<00:03:31.380> to

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
face so far all gradient mesh I had to

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.940 
face so far all gradient mesh I had to
zoom<00:03:31.769> in<00:03:32.040> at<00:03:32.280> certain<00:03:32.489> times<00:03:32.910> at<00:03:33.180> like<00:03:33.359> 400<00:03:34.019> 400

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
zoom in at certain times at like 400 400

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.509 
zoom in at certain times at like 400 400
4,000<00:03:35.579> percent<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.359> see<00:03:36.600> my<00:03:37.079> dice<00:03:37.319> clearly<00:03:37.920> so

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
4,000 percent to see my dice clearly so

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.059 
4,000 percent to see my dice clearly so
a<00:03:38.910> lot<00:03:39.239> of<00:03:39.389> detail<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:40.200> this<00:03:40.650> was<00:03:40.889> the

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
a lot of detail and this was the

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.840 
a lot of detail and this was the
original<00:03:41.100> neck<00:03:41.880> that<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.209> did<00:03:42.739> but<00:03:43.739> I<00:03:44.100> went<00:03:44.579> back

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
original neck that I did but I went back

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.680 
original neck that I did but I went back
and<00:03:45.090> added<00:03:45.299> a<00:03:45.630> second<00:03:46.579> more<00:03:47.579> detailed<00:03:48.150> version

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
and added a second more detailed version

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.729 
and added a second more detailed version
on<00:03:48.810> top<00:03:49.139> for<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.470> right<00:03:49.709> side<00:03:50.040> of<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.340> neck

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
on top for the right side of the neck

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.710 
on top for the right side of the neck
because<00:03:52.739> my<00:03:52.920> first<00:03:53.250> mesh<00:03:53.670> wasn't<00:03:54.239> picking<00:03:54.450> up

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
because my first mesh wasn't picking up

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.199 
because my first mesh wasn't picking up
what<00:03:55.380> I<00:03:55.410> wanted<00:03:55.889> so<00:03:56.099> I<00:03:56.310> went<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.700> created<00:03:57.120> a

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
what I wanted so I went to created a

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.930 
what I wanted so I went to created a
second<00:03:57.660> one<00:03:57.810> then<00:03:58.139> I<00:03:58.260> just<00:03:58.470> blend<00:03:58.829> it<00:03:59.069> now<00:03:59.609> this

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
second one then I just blend it now this

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.080 
second one then I just blend it now this
is<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.450> hair<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:01.290> underneath<00:04:01.829> section<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:03.000> I

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
is the hair the underneath section and I

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.300 
is the hair the underneath section and I
did<00:04:03.389> it<00:04:03.540> in<00:04:03.690> sections<00:04:04.349> to<00:04:04.680> different<00:04:05.099> sections

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
did it in sections to different sections

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.550 
did it in sections to different sections
where<00:04:06.000> actually<00:04:06.389> three<00:04:06.720> for<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.049> right<00:04:07.260> side

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
where actually three for the right side

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.180 
where actually three for the right side
and<00:04:08.280> you<00:04:08.430> see<00:04:08.669> how<00:04:08.880> it<00:04:09.090> doesn't<00:04:09.329> look<00:04:09.660> awesome

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
and you see how it doesn't look awesome

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.979 
and you see how it doesn't look awesome
I'm<00:04:11.190> about<00:04:11.519> to<00:04:11.700> make<00:04:11.880> it<00:04:11.940> look<00:04:12.239> awesome<00:04:12.769> later

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
I'm about to make it look awesome later

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.729 
I'm about to make it look awesome later
and<00:04:15.989> I<00:04:16.889> use<00:04:17.190> what<00:04:17.700> I<00:04:17.729> did<00:04:18.060> here<00:04:18.479> to<00:04:18.780> cover<00:04:19.109> up<00:04:19.500> my

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
and I use what I did here to cover up my

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:20.330 
and I use what I did here to cover up my
man

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
man

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.780 
man
blending<00:04:20.970> in<00:04:21.120> with<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.299> back

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
blending in with the back

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.580 
blending in with the back
around<00:04:22.090> did<00:04:22.450> a<00:04:22.480> couple<00:04:22.750> of<00:04:22.930> tricky<00:04:23.230> things

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
around did a couple of tricky things

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.650 
around did a couple of tricky things
with<00:04:23.980> it<00:04:24.160> and<00:04:24.370> I<00:04:24.670> think<00:04:25.060> it<00:04:25.180> turned<00:04:25.360> out<00:04:25.600> pretty

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
with it and I think it turned out pretty

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.430 
with it and I think it turned out pretty
nice<00:04:26.670> but<00:04:27.670> if<00:04:27.970> you<00:04:28.240> see<00:04:28.570> it<00:04:28.750> as<00:04:28.990> it's<00:04:29.230> being

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
nice but if you see it as it's being

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.380 
nice but if you see it as it's being
created<00:04:29.980> you<00:04:30.130> think<00:04:30.460> like<00:04:30.610> what<00:04:30.760> the<00:04:30.880> heck

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
created you think like what the heck

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.200 
created you think like what the heck
like<00:04:31.750> what<00:04:31.900> is<00:04:32.050> this<00:04:32.260> but<00:04:33.190> it's<00:04:33.700> all<00:04:33.850> about<00:04:34.090> the

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
like what is this but it's all about the

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.280 
like what is this but it's all about the
finished<00:04:34.600> product<00:04:36.420> I'm<00:04:37.420> putting<00:04:37.960> this<00:04:38.050> right

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
finished product I'm putting this right

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.640 
finished product I'm putting this right
shoulder<00:04:38.860> in<00:04:39.040> I<00:04:39.430> went<00:04:40.150> back<00:04:40.420> and<00:04:40.660> added<00:04:41.470> more

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
shoulder in I went back and added more

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.550 
shoulder in I went back and added more
detail<00:04:42.160> to<00:04:42.520> it<00:04:42.730> and<00:04:43.090> this<00:04:43.450> is<00:04:43.510> the<00:04:43.690> chest<00:04:44.170> area

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
detail to it and this is the chest area

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.620 
detail to it and this is the chest area
see<00:04:44.890> that<00:04:45.040> big<00:04:45.220> white<00:04:45.520> spot<00:04:45.970> that<00:04:46.270> I<00:04:46.360> left

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
see that big white spot that I left

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.900 
see that big white spot that I left
there<00:04:46.990> it'd<00:04:47.530> all<00:04:47.770> be<00:04:48.010> covered<00:04:48.430> up<00:04:48.580> it's

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
there it'd all be covered up it's

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.850 
there it'd all be covered up it's
actually<00:04:49.470> that<00:04:50.470> of<00:04:50.680> zero<00:04:51.420> opacity<00:04:52.710> so<00:04:53.710> it's

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
actually that of zero opacity so it's

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.300 
actually that of zero opacity so it's
picking<00:04:54.070> up<00:04:54.400> was<00:04:55.330> 10%<00:04:56.170> opacity<00:04:56.260> is<00:04:56.800> picking<00:04:57.160> up

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
picking up was 10% opacity is picking up

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.620
