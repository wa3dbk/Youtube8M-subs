00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
little bit and that's usually what I

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.510 
little bit and that's usually what I
would<00:01:07.390> do<00:01:07.630> on<00:01:07.960> a<00:01:08.560> typical<00:01:08.799> day<00:01:09.040> when<00:01:09.369> I<00:01:09.400> was

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
would do on a typical day when I was

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.470 
would do on a typical day when I was
listing<00:01:09.970> my<00:01:10.090> hair

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.910 

I<00:01:13.570> want<00:01:14.200> to<00:01:14.320> say<00:01:14.710> that<00:01:15.130> how<00:01:16.170> tight<00:01:17.170> you<00:01:17.380> put<00:01:17.410> in

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
I want to say that how tight you put in

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.220 
I want to say that how tight you put in
your<00:01:18.130> twist<00:01:18.490> is<00:01:18.730> really<00:01:19.090> important<00:01:19.660> how<00:01:19.900> long

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230 
your twist is really important how long

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.950 
your twist is really important how long
you're<00:01:20.500> able<00:01:20.890> to<00:01:21.040> maintain<00:01:21.250> them<00:01:22.000> sometimes<00:01:22.750> I

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
you're able to maintain them sometimes I

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.190 
you're able to maintain them sometimes I
peep<00:01:23.230> see<00:01:23.530> people's<00:01:24.070> twist<00:01:24.940> and<00:01:25.300> they're<00:01:25.930> so

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
peep see people's twist and they're so

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.230 
peep see people's twist and they're so
loose<00:01:26.500> at<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:26.830> roots<00:01:27.340> and<00:01:27.550> they're<00:01:27.730> asking<00:01:27.910> me

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
loose at the roots and they're asking me

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.170 
loose at the roots and they're asking me
why<00:01:28.600> they're<00:01:29.080> not<00:01:29.110> lasting<00:01:29.980> long<00:01:30.220> and<00:01:30.580> I

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
why they're not lasting long and I

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.820 
why they're not lasting long and I
really<00:01:31.450> think<00:01:31.570> a<00:01:31.750> part<00:01:31.990> of<00:01:32.170> that<00:01:32.410> is<00:01:32.620> that

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
really think a part of that is that

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.680 
really think a part of that is that
you're<00:01:33.010> not<00:01:33.220> really<00:01:33.490> twisting<00:01:34.120> all<00:01:34.360> the<00:01:34.540> way

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
you're not really twisting all the way

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.370 
you're not really twisting all the way
down<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.370> root<00:01:36.730> so<00:01:37.270> my<00:01:37.480> next<00:01:37.750> tip<00:01:38.080> would<00:01:38.320> be

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
down to the root so my next tip would be

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.950 
down to the root so my next tip would be
to<00:01:38.500> make<00:01:38.800> sure<00:01:39.130> that<00:01:39.970> you<00:01:40.180> section<00:01:40.810> your<00:01:40.930> hair

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
to make sure that you section your hair

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.550 
to make sure that you section your hair
off<00:01:41.620> small<00:01:42.520> enough<00:01:42.970> when<00:01:43.630> you<00:01:43.810> if<00:01:44.050> you<00:01:44.200> expect

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
off small enough when you if you expect

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.100 
off small enough when you if you expect
the<00:01:44.710> twist<00:01:45.010> to<00:01:45.190> last<00:01:45.430> a<00:01:45.730> while<00:01:45.880> so<00:01:46.600> that<00:01:46.840> you

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
the twist to last a while so that you

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.620 
the twist to last a while so that you
can<00:01:48.360> twist<00:01:49.360> all<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:50.110> way<00:01:50.260> down<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.240> root

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
can twist all the way down to the root

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.040 
can twist all the way down to the root
when<00:01:53.440> you<00:01:53.560> put<00:01:53.800> them<00:01:54.010> in<00:01:54.190> or<00:01:54.880> else<00:01:55.360> you're<00:01:55.810> just

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
when you put them in or else you're just

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.080 
when you put them in or else you're just
going<00:01:56.320> to<00:01:56.410> end<00:01:56.620> up<00:01:56.860> with<00:01:56.920> puffy<00:01:57.580> roots<00:01:57.820> do<00:01:58.000> you

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
going to end up with puffy roots do you

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.690 
going to end up with puffy roots do you
see<00:01:58.330> how<00:01:58.540> I'm<00:01:58.690> able<00:01:58.900> to<00:01:59.200> really<00:01:59.590> twist<00:02:00.130> all<00:02:00.460> the

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
see how I'm able to really twist all the

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.400 
see how I'm able to really twist all the
way<00:02:00.820> at<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.120> root<00:02:01.540> and<00:02:01.750> then<00:02:01.900> it's<00:02:02.170> not<00:02:02.350> so

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
way at the root and then it's not so

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.980 
way at the root and then it's not so
tight<00:02:03.040> that<00:02:03.070> is<00:02:03.400> yanking<00:02:03.820> my<00:02:04.000> hair<00:02:04.030> if<00:02:04.480> it

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
tight that is yanking my hair if it

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.870 
tight that is yanking my hair if it
feels<00:02:05.230> uncomfortable<00:02:06.010> that<00:02:06.190> means<00:02:06.460> it's<00:02:06.640> too

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
feels uncomfortable that means it's too

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.010 
feels uncomfortable that means it's too
tight<00:02:08.100> now<00:02:09.100> notice<00:02:09.429> that<00:02:09.820> if<00:02:09.970> I<00:02:10.119> get<00:02:10.420> a<00:02:10.630> really

know that's what which are fine they

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.100 
know that's what which are fine they
don't<00:02:15.550> last<00:02:15.760> as<00:02:16.060> long<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.450> I<00:02:16.510> try<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:16.810> twist

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
don't last as long and I try to twist

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.320 
don't last as long and I try to twist
that<00:02:17.380> down<00:02:17.709> to<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.130> root<00:02:18.340> you<00:02:18.820> know<00:02:18.970> I<00:02:19.000> only

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
that down to the root you know I only

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.810 
that down to the root you know I only
can<00:02:19.660> get<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:19.959> so<00:02:20.170> tight<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:20.830> then<00:02:21.070> it<00:02:21.280> puffs<00:02:21.550> up

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
can get it so tight and then it puffs up

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.440 
can get it so tight and then it puffs up
it<00:02:22.150> just<00:02:22.209> really<00:02:22.870> it<00:02:23.110> doesn't<00:02:23.590> work<00:02:23.890> as<00:02:24.100> well

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.920 

I<00:02:26.510> think<00:02:27.440> placement<00:02:28.310> is<00:02:28.520> very<00:02:28.810> important<00:02:29.810> in

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
I think placement is very important in

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.070 
I think placement is very important in
making<00:02:30.170> your<00:02:30.470> twist<00:02:30.920> look<00:02:31.099> nice<00:02:31.550> neat<00:02:32.080> and

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
making your twist look nice neat and

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.350 
making your twist look nice neat and
even<00:02:33.440> almost<00:02:33.860> professional<00:02:34.370> if<00:02:34.790> you<00:02:34.970> really

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
even almost professional if you really

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.869 
even almost professional if you really
do<00:02:35.599> them<00:02:35.890> if<00:02:36.890> you<00:02:37.069> really<00:02:37.340> place<00:02:37.610> them

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
do them if you really place them

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.869 
do them if you really place them
properly<00:02:38.420> I<00:02:38.720> pay<00:02:39.500> particular<00:02:40.220> attention<00:02:40.250> to

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
properly I pay particular attention to

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.140 
properly I pay particular attention to
the<00:02:41.780> size<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:42.530> placement<00:02:42.890> of<00:02:43.220> my<00:02:43.430> parts<00:02:43.910> in

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
the size and placement of my parts in

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.570 
the size and placement of my parts in
this<00:02:44.540> area<00:02:45.019> up<00:02:45.230> here<00:02:45.260> because<00:02:46.130> that's<00:02:46.340> where<00:02:46.550> I

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
this area up here because that's where I

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.199 
this area up here because that's where I
part<00:02:46.940> my<00:02:47.000> hair<00:02:47.470> around<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.769> sides<00:02:49.069> because<00:02:49.910> I

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
part my hair around the sides because I

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.839 
part my hair around the sides because I
usually<00:02:50.810> pull<00:02:51.080> my<00:02:51.290> hair<00:02:51.590> back<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:52.099> in<00:02:52.670> this

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
usually pull my hair back and in this

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.940 
usually pull my hair back and in this
section<00:02:53.180> right<00:02:53.390> here<00:02:53.630> because<00:02:54.290> that's<00:02:54.709> what

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
section right here because that's what

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.500 
section right here because that's what
people<00:02:55.130> that's<00:02:55.519> what<00:02:55.760> people<00:02:56.030> are<00:02:56.150> going<00:02:56.360> to

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
people that's what people are going to

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.229 
people that's what people are going to
see<00:02:56.720> when<00:02:56.989> they<00:02:57.110> see<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.530> back<00:02:57.739> of<00:02:58.010> my<00:02:58.549> head<00:02:58.910> I

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
see when they see the back of my head I

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.830 
see when they see the back of my head I
usually<00:02:59.930> make<00:03:00.080> those<00:03:00.349> parts<00:03:00.950> smaller<00:03:01.730> as<00:03:02.239> well

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
usually make those parts smaller as well

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.509 
usually make those parts smaller as well
as<00:03:03.019> neither<00:03:03.290> now<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.620> parts<00:03:04.040> under<00:03:04.280> there

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
as neither now the parts under there

as neither now the parts under there
sometimes<00:03:05.090> aren't<00:03:05.900> as<00:03:06.170> small<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:06.860> as<00:03:07.010> neat<00:03:07.280> I

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
sometimes aren't as small and as neat I

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.250 
sometimes aren't as small and as neat I
can<00:03:07.760> have<00:03:07.910> a<00:03:07.940> little<00:03:08.150> more<00:03:08.390> leeway<00:03:08.660> with<00:03:09.019> those

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
can have a little more leeway with those

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.940 
can have a little more leeway with those
but<00:03:10.010> here<00:03:10.519> here<00:03:11.269> and<00:03:11.450> through<00:03:11.900> here<00:03:12.290> you<00:03:12.650> want

neat parts other videos my hair is
naturally<00:03:23.420> pretty<00:03:23.599> dense<00:03:23.930> I<00:03:24.230> have<00:03:24.500> a<00:03:24.769> lot<00:03:25.340> of

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
naturally pretty dense I have a lot of

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.150 
naturally pretty dense I have a lot of
hair<00:03:25.880> but<00:03:26.329> even<00:03:26.750> still<00:03:26.930> you<00:03:27.349> can<00:03:27.530> avoid<00:03:27.650> that

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
hair but even still you can avoid that

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.910 
hair but even still you can avoid that
scalping<00:03:28.849> look<00:03:29.090> by<00:03:29.599> doing<00:03:30.079> what<00:03:30.290> i<00:03:30.349> call<00:03:30.709> a

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
scalping look by doing what i call a

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.090 
scalping look by doing what i call a
windowpane<00:03:31.430> effect<00:03:32.239> when<00:03:32.840> you<00:03:32.989> put<00:03:33.290> in<00:03:33.500> your

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
windowpane effect when you put in your

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.430 
windowpane effect when you put in your
twill<00:03:34.519> caso<00:03:34.819> I<00:03:35.000> went<00:03:35.209> ahead<00:03:35.299> and<00:03:35.840> put<00:03:36.109> three

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
twill caso I went ahead and put three

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.340 
twill caso I went ahead and put three
twists<00:03:36.980> in<00:03:37.130> now<00:03:37.850> what<00:03:38.150> I<00:03:38.180> mean<00:03:38.569> by<00:03:38.630> window

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
twists in now what I mean by window

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.559 
twists in now what I mean by window
painting<00:03:39.709> is<00:03:40.069> that<00:03:40.340> I<00:03:40.370> don't<00:03:40.549> just<00:03:41.030> park<00:03:41.389> the

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
painting is that I don't just park the

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.080 
painting is that I don't just park the
hair<00:03:41.870> straight<00:03:42.410> back<00:03:42.680> and<00:03:42.980> then<00:03:43.370> twist<00:03:43.819> all

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
hair straight back and then twist all

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.840 
hair straight back and then twist all
the<00:03:44.269> hair<00:03:44.569> in<00:03:44.780> their<00:03:45.470> road<00:03:45.799> to<00:03:46.100> me<00:03:46.340> that<00:03:46.579> leaves

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
the hair in their road to me that leaves

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.240 
the hair in their road to me that leaves
the<00:03:47.090> hair<00:03:47.269> looking<00:03:47.600> really<00:03:47.930> scalping<00:03:48.560> and<00:03:48.739> the

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
the hair looking really scalping and the

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.660 
the hair looking really scalping and the
twist<00:03:49.609> look<00:03:49.970> thinner<00:03:50.840> what<00:03:51.769> I<00:03:51.799> do<00:03:51.980> is<00:03:52.220> actually

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
twist look thinner what I do is actually

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.660 
twist look thinner what I do is actually
part<00:03:53.209> in<00:03:53.510> between<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.739> parts<00:03:55.160> i<00:03:55.280> guess<00:03:55.459> that's

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
part in between the parts i guess that's

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.979 
part in between the parts i guess that's
why<00:03:55.819> i<00:03:55.880> call<00:03:56.209> it<00:03:56.450> um<00:03:57.220> window<00:03:58.220> pane<00:03:58.690> and<00:03:59.690> what

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
why i call it um window pane and what

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.440 
why i call it um window pane and what
that<00:04:00.200> does<00:04:00.500> is<00:04:00.980> makes<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:01.880> hair<00:04:02.060> look<00:04:02.239> less

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
that does is makes the hair look less

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.319 
that does is makes the hair look less
scalby<00:04:02.780> thus<00:04:03.170> it<00:04:03.410> looks<00:04:03.650> fuller<00:04:04.160> so<00:04:05.120> you'll

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
scalby thus it looks fuller so you'll

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.509 
scalby thus it looks fuller so you'll
see<00:04:05.569> this<00:04:05.720> first<00:04:06.019> row<00:04:06.350> I<00:04:06.620> put<00:04:06.859> these<00:04:07.100> twists

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
see this first row I put these twists

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.520 
see this first row I put these twists
and<00:04:07.730> I<00:04:07.790> didn't<00:04:08.150> you<00:04:08.450> know<00:04:08.480> pretty<00:04:08.930> quick<00:04:09.349> I'm

just doing this for the video and then
this<00:04:12.190> second<00:04:13.190> row<00:04:13.430> you<00:04:13.880> notice<00:04:14.209> I<00:04:14.359> didn't<00:04:14.720> part

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
this second row you notice I didn't part

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.009 
this second row you notice I didn't part
directly<00:04:15.260> behind<00:04:15.799> this<00:04:16.340> twist<00:04:16.729> I<00:04:17.000> parted<00:04:17.810> off

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
directly behind this twist I parted off

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.770 
directly behind this twist I parted off
to<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.440> side<00:04:18.709> to<00:04:19.130> it<00:04:19.160> and<00:04:19.549> this<00:04:20.120> twist<00:04:20.539> is

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
to the side to it and this twist is

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.500 
to the side to it and this twist is
actually<00:04:21.380> in<00:04:21.560> the<00:04:21.799> middle<00:04:22.039> of<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.430> other<00:04:23.120> two
