 get to know them before they come and visit 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.170
 mr leggins at your service 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:29.220
 I'm surrounded by dwarves who make us 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.679
 therefore the choir is a cheerful band 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.300

 precise advantage with he arrived 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.190
 this opportunity to take back us more

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:08.810
 but he thousand courage then this is the 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.830
 Your purpose to enter the mountain you have 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.880
 to say 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.100
 some would not consider it a wise one 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.780
 dark power has found the way of 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.540
 return to the world because we don't play 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.800
 to the riddles and if he loses that 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.660

 done deal 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.640
 I would choose each of these years instead 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.640
 of a powerful army 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:56.070
 in reality I can't do a willing heart 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.070
 ask for more 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:03.610
