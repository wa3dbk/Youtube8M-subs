00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
link yeah now that noise our VMS my

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.599 
link yeah now that noise our VMS my
third<00:00:57.899> favorite<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.590> why<00:00:58.620> i<00:00:58.890> like<00:00:59.190> these<00:00:59.370> more

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
third favorite and why i like these more

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.189 
third favorite and why i like these more
even<00:00:59.879> though<00:00:59.940> they're<00:01:00.059> very<00:01:00.359> similar<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.989> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
even though they're very similar to the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.709 
even though they're very similar to the
eight<00:01:01.410> tracks<00:01:01.879> the<00:01:02.879> reason<00:01:03.239> why<00:01:03.329> i<00:01:03.390> like<00:01:03.570> these

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
eight tracks the reason why i like these

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.750 
eight tracks the reason why i like these
more<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.049> because<00:01:04.379> they<00:01:04.619> got<00:01:04.739> system<00:01:05.159> g2<00:01:05.489> in

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
more is because they got system g2 in

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.840 
more is because they got system g2 in
the<00:01:06.030> hill<00:01:08.210> that's<00:01:09.210> why<00:01:09.420> there's<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.470> lot<00:01:10.710> more

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
the hill that's why there's a lot more

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.570 
the hill that's why there's a lot more
impact<00:01:11.850> support<00:01:12.270> these<00:01:12.720> shoes<00:01:13.220> the<00:01:14.220> color<00:01:14.460> is

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
now this a little different the g2 is

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.770 
now this a little different the g2 is
actually<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.070> insert<00:01:59.399> that's<00:02:00.390> just<00:02:00.630> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
actually on the insert that's just the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.459 
actually on the insert that's just the
answer<00:02:00.869> here<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.320> no<00:02:01.850> this<00:02:02.850> right<00:02:03.119> here

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
answer here is no this right here

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:06.499 
answer here is no this right here
although<00:02:04.469> like<00:02:04.860> it's<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.820> fusion<00:02:06.180> technology

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
although like it's the fusion technology

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:13.400 
although like it's the fusion technology
the<00:02:09.200> so<00:02:10.200> i'll<00:02:10.860> explain<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.970> review

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410

on these shoes I'll explain the whole
fusion<00:02:15.960> thing<00:02:16.520> I'll<00:02:17.520> probably<00:02:17.820> want<00:02:18.210> to<00:02:18.270> make

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
fusion thing I'll probably want to make

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
I've had so far I think maybe once in

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.460 
I've had so far I think maybe once in
the<00:03:27.390> altamonte<00:03:27.990> collabs<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.560> skated<00:03:30.440> but<00:03:31.440> I

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
the altamonte collabs I skated but I

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.410 
the altamonte collabs I skated but I
think<00:03:31.830> that<00:03:31.950> was<00:03:32.040> really<00:03:32.130> about<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:32.580> and<00:03:32.730> these

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
think that was really about it and these

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.480 
think that was really about it and these
are<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.720> ones<00:03:33.900> I<00:03:34.080> kickflip<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.620> DC<00:03:34.920> plaza<00:03:35.190> 9

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
are the ones I kickflip the DC plaza 9

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:36.800 
are the ones I kickflip the DC plaza 9
in<00:03:35.730> so<00:03:35.910> I'm<00:03:36.000> always<00:03:36.180> going<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.480> have<00:03:36.540> these
