so<00:00:09.110> this<00:00:09.410> module<00:00:09.620> explains<00:00:10.010> how<00:00:10.610> to<00:00:10.670> install

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 
so this module explains how to install

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.890 
so this module explains how to install
processing<00:00:11.990> libraries<00:00:12.470> so<00:00:13.360> the<00:00:14.360> processing

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
processing libraries so the processing

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.299 
processing libraries so the processing
there<00:00:15.080> are<00:00:15.200> many<00:00:15.350> libraries<00:00:15.799> too<00:00:16.040> there<00:00:16.280> are

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309 
there are many libraries too there are

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.950 
there are many libraries too there are
built<00:00:16.730> in<00:00:16.850> libraries<00:00:17.360> and<00:00:17.390> there<00:00:17.810> are

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
built in libraries and there are

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.560 
built in libraries and there are
third-party<00:00:18.230> or<00:00:18.830> other<00:00:19.280> libraries<00:00:19.910> which<00:00:20.360> are

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
third-party or other libraries which are

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.240 
third-party or other libraries which are
available<00:00:21.050> on<00:00:21.140> the<00:00:21.260> web<00:00:21.410> or<00:00:21.710> in<00:00:22.039> the

available on the web or in the
processing<00:00:22.700> website<00:00:23.180> so<00:00:24.050> you<00:00:25.010> can<00:00:25.040> download

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
processing website so you can download

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.160 
processing website so you can download
these<00:00:25.760> libraries<00:00:26.240> by<00:00:26.450> going<00:00:26.750> to<00:00:28.570> this<00:00:29.570> given

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
these libraries by going to this given

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.920 
these libraries by going to this given
link<00:00:30.410> it's<00:00:31.400> processing<00:00:32.059> that<00:00:32.390> org<00:00:32.630> slash

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
link it's processing that org slash

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.160 
link it's processing that org slash
reference<00:00:33.649> slash<00:00:34.040> libraries<00:00:34.550> and<00:00:35.020> we<00:00:36.020> will

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
reference slash libraries and we will

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.260 
reference slash libraries and we will
see<00:00:36.320> how<00:00:36.500> you<00:00:36.559> can<00:00:36.710> get<00:00:37.100> it<00:00:37.280> install<00:00:37.730> and<00:00:38.059> then

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
see how you can get it install and then

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.279 
see how you can get it install and then
you<00:00:38.540> can<00:00:39.399> see<00:00:40.399> also<00:00:40.579> how<00:00:40.910> we<00:00:40.969> can<00:00:41.269> use<00:00:41.870> them<00:00:42.109> and

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289 
you can see also how we can use them and

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:47.560 
you can see also how we can use them and
explore<00:00:43.010> them<00:00:43.269> so<00:00:44.269> um<00:00:45.309> so<00:00:46.309> this<00:00:46.489> we<00:00:47.359> go<00:00:47.510> to

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
explore them so um so this we go to

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.829 
explore them so um so this we go to
processing<00:00:48.579> dot<00:00:49.579> org<00:00:49.879> reference<00:00:50.359> libraries

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
processing dot org reference libraries

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:52.809 
processing dot org reference libraries
so<00:00:51.109> you<00:00:51.140> can<00:00:51.350> see<00:00:51.530> there<00:00:51.739> are<00:00:51.890> many<00:00:52.249> libraries

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:52.819 
so you can see there are many libraries

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:55.329 
so you can see there are many libraries
here<00:00:53.140> they<00:00:54.140> are<00:00:54.260> categorized<00:00:54.769> by<00:00:54.980> these

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
here they are categorized by these

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:02.649 
here they are categorized by these
different<00:00:59.920> sections<00:01:00.920> like<00:01:01.550> video<00:01:02.030> for<00:01:02.539> our

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659 
different sections like video for our

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:05.830 
different sections like video for our
genome<00:01:03.109> 4<00:01:03.920> networks<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:04.580> serials<00:01:05.059> with<00:01:05.330> PDFs

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
genome 4 networks and serials with PDFs

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.990 
genome 4 networks and serials with PDFs
and<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:06.409> on<00:01:06.530> so<00:01:06.740> forth<00:01:07.010> and<00:01:07.280> there<00:01:07.729> are<00:01:07.850> also

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
and so on so forth and there are also

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.039 
and so on so forth and there are also
other<00:01:09.610> third-party<00:01:10.659> libraries<00:01:11.659> which<00:01:11.840> have

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
other third-party libraries which have

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.370 
other third-party libraries which have
been<00:01:12.229> developed<00:01:12.469> and<00:01:13.149> one<00:01:14.149> thing<00:01:14.360> of<00:01:14.509> cons<00:01:14.840> of

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
been developed and one thing of cons of

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.370 
been developed and one thing of cons of
importance<00:01:15.950> is<00:01:16.189> your<00:01:17.799> OpenCV<00:01:18.799> library<00:01:20.380> so

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
importance is your OpenCV library so

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.770 
importance is your OpenCV library so
this<00:01:21.649> is<00:01:21.829> actually<00:01:22.219> Intel<00:01:23.090> based<00:01:23.770> -<00:01:25.090> which<00:01:26.090> is

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
this is actually Intel based - which is

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.620 
this is actually Intel based - which is
commonly<00:01:27.140> used<00:01:27.439> for<00:01:27.799> image<00:01:28.579> processing<00:01:28.820> and

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.410 

people<00:01:32.630> have<00:01:32.780> actually<00:01:34.420> transfer

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
people have actually transfer

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.560 
people have actually transfer
transformed<00:01:36.320> that<00:01:37.070> OpenCV<00:01:37.850> library<00:01:37.880> for

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
transformed that OpenCV library for

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.679 
transformed that OpenCV library for
processing<00:01:39.460> similarly<00:01:40.460> you<00:01:40.640> have<00:01:40.689> other

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
processing similarly you have other

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.789 
processing similarly you have other
libraries<00:01:42.350> of<00:01:42.560> interest<00:01:43.070> which<00:01:43.909> include<00:01:44.799> so

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
libraries of interest which include so

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.599 
libraries of interest which include so
ctrl<00:01:46.280> p5<00:01:47.060> that's<00:01:47.600> a<00:01:48.130> library<00:01:49.130> which<00:01:49.280> allows

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:49.609 
ctrl p5 that's a library which allows

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:53.740 
ctrl p5 that's a library which allows
you<00:01:49.789> to<00:01:49.969> create<00:01:50.810> fancy<00:01:51.880> controls<00:01:52.880> like<00:01:53.299> knobs

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
you to create fancy controls like knobs

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.099 
you to create fancy controls like knobs
and<00:01:54.200> sliders<00:01:54.890> and<00:01:55.579> so<00:01:55.729> on<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.060> forth<00:01:56.090> so<00:01:56.570> there

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.109 
and sliders and so on so forth so there

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:58.630 
and sliders and so on so forth so there
are<00:01:57.170> also<00:01:57.259> a<00:01:57.469> bunch<00:01:57.560> of<00:01:57.950> network<00:01:58.429> and

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
are also a bunch of network and

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:06.160 
are also a bunch of network and
communication<00:01:59.270> related<00:02:02.409> libraries<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:05.170> if

on there and then you can save now we
can<00:03:13.430> open<00:03:13.819> it<00:03:13.940> so<00:03:14.180> before<00:03:15.050> that<00:03:16.000> what<00:03:17.000> we<00:03:17.120> can

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
can open it so before that what we can

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.869 
can open it so before that what we can
also<00:03:17.450> do<00:03:17.810> is<00:03:17.870> try<00:03:18.590> to<00:03:18.650> figure<00:03:18.950> out<00:03:19.069> which<00:03:19.549> is

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
also do is try to figure out which is

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.979 
also do is try to figure out which is
the<00:03:20.180> location<00:03:20.900> which<00:03:21.290> you<00:03:21.440> want<00:03:21.650> to<00:03:21.709> install

the location which you want to install
our<00:03:23.989> air<00:03:24.730> processing<00:03:25.730> library<00:03:26.150> so<00:03:26.900> that<00:03:26.930> is

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
our air processing library so that is

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.059 
our air processing library so that is
actually<00:03:27.440> determined<00:03:28.190> by<00:03:28.780> a<00:03:29.920> parameter<00:03:30.920> which

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
actually determined by a parameter which

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.490 
actually determined by a parameter which
is<00:03:31.099> found<00:03:31.459> in<00:03:31.610> processing<00:03:32.239> so<00:03:32.450> once<00:03:32.750> you<00:03:32.930> click

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
is found in processing so once you click

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.870 
is found in processing so once you click

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
processing IDE once the crossing ID is

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.280 
processing IDE once the crossing ID is
opened<00:03:47.709> go<00:03:48.709> to<00:03:48.769> preferences<00:03:49.099> and<00:03:50.290> in

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
opened go to preferences and in

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.009 
opened go to preferences and in
preferences<00:03:52.010> you<00:03:52.310> will<00:03:52.340> see<00:03:52.670> that<00:03:52.900> what<00:03:53.900> is

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
preferences you will see that what is

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.640 
preferences you will see that what is
the<00:03:54.260> location<00:03:54.910> in<00:03:55.910> which<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.450> sketch<00:03:56.750> or<00:03:57.079> the

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
the location in which the sketch or the

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.720 
the location in which the sketch or the
processing<00:03:58.220> is<00:04:00.040> all<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.280> libraries<00:04:01.700> should

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
processing is all the libraries should

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.599 
processing is all the libraries should
be<00:04:02.180> installed<00:04:02.629> so<00:04:02.870> that<00:04:02.900> tells<00:04:03.319> you<00:04:03.609> the

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
be installed so that tells you the

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:10.000 
be installed so that tells you the
processing<00:04:05.560> location<00:04:06.560> so<00:04:07.540> now<00:04:08.540> our<00:04:08.959> goal<00:04:09.769> is

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
processing location so now our goal is

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.280 
processing location so now our goal is
to<00:04:10.040> make<00:04:10.370> sure<00:04:10.549> that<00:04:10.730> these<00:04:11.569> libraries<00:04:12.049> would

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
to make sure that these libraries would

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.900 
to make sure that these libraries would
need<00:04:12.650> to<00:04:12.769> be<00:04:12.859> installed<00:04:13.280> under<00:04:13.519> this

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
need to be installed under this

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.339 
need to be installed under this
directory<00:04:14.120> so<00:04:15.019> therefore<00:04:15.410> I<00:04:15.440> cancel<00:04:17.289> go<00:04:18.289> to

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:18.349 
directory so therefore I cancel go to

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:24.940 
directory so therefore I cancel go to
the<00:04:18.500> folder<00:04:21.820> documents<00:04:22.820> its<00:04:23.240> location<00:04:23.990> and

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
the folder documents its location and

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.700 
the folder documents its location and
then<00:04:25.099> we<00:04:25.340> can<00:04:25.550> see<00:04:25.820> that<00:04:26.240> we<00:04:27.050> have<00:04:27.349> processing

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
then we can see that we have processing

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.580 
then we can see that we have processing
folder<00:04:31.120> so<00:04:32.120> in<00:04:32.180> case<00:04:32.450> if<00:04:32.690> you<00:04:32.810> don't<00:04:32.930> have<00:04:33.260> a

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
folder so in case if you don't have a

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.070 
folder so in case if you don't have a
folder<00:04:34.130> called<00:04:34.160> libraries<00:04:34.910> so<00:04:35.599> you<00:04:35.630> have<00:04:35.960> to

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
folder called libraries so you have to

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.140 
folder called libraries so you have to
create<00:04:36.320> the<00:04:36.590> folder<00:04:36.979> called<00:04:37.220> libraries<00:04:37.789> and

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
create the folder called libraries and

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:48.440 
create the folder called libraries and
then<00:04:39.610> drag<00:04:40.610> and<00:04:40.789> drop

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.260 

so<00:04:49.380> once<00:04:49.590> the<00:04:49.800> library<00:04:50.190> is<00:04:50.490> drag<00:04:50.880> and<00:04:50.910> drop

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
so once the library is drag and drop

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.970 
so once the library is drag and drop
saying<00:04:51.570> you<00:04:51.660> can<00:04:51.810> see<00:04:51.990> that's<00:04:52.170> the<00:04:52.440> structure

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
saying you can see that's the structure

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.960 
saying you can see that's the structure
that's<00:04:53.250> the<00:04:53.490> actual<00:04:53.820> library<00:04:55.400> which<00:04:56.400> has<00:04:56.730> the

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
that's the actual library which has the

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.540 
that's the actual library which has the
jar<00:04:57.210> file<00:04:57.540> and<00:04:57.890> then<00:04:58.890> they<00:04:59.220> have<00:04:59.520> some

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
jar file and then they have some

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.960 
jar file and then they have some
examples<00:05:00.330> now<00:05:00.600> if<00:05:01.320> you<00:05:01.500> actually<00:05:01.680> go<00:05:02.040> into<00:05:02.070> the

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
examples now if you actually go into the

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.580 
examples now if you actually go into the
processing<00:05:03.600> and<00:05:03.840> then<00:05:04.020> if<00:05:04.140> you<00:05:04.260> go<00:05:04.410> to<00:05:04.470> the

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
processing and then if you go to the

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.760 
processing and then if you go to the
file<00:05:04.860> and<00:05:05.520> you<00:05:05.580> go<00:05:05.790> to<00:05:05.850> examples<00:05:06.510> so<00:05:07.440> here<00:05:07.650> you

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
file and you go to examples so here you

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.160 
file and you go to examples so here you
can<00:05:07.920> see<00:05:08.190> that<00:05:10.280> in<00:05:11.280> the<00:05:11.460> examples<00:05:12.060> so<00:05:12.810> you<00:05:12.840> have

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
can see that in the examples so you have

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.950 
can see that in the examples so you have
these<00:05:13.920> basic<00:05:15.410> examples<00:05:16.410> which<00:05:16.560> are<00:05:16.770> there<00:05:17.010> and

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
these basic examples which are there and

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.360 
these basic examples which are there and
these<00:05:18.960> are<00:05:19.230> the<00:05:19.350> built<00:05:19.560> in<00:05:19.770> libraries<00:05:20.250> which

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
these are the built in libraries which

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.770 
these are the built in libraries which
are<00:05:20.520> available<00:05:20.610> there<00:05:21.090> but<00:05:21.330> there<00:05:21.480> are<00:05:21.600> no

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
are available there but there are no

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.310 
are available there but there are no
third-party<00:05:22.050> libraries<00:05:22.800> so<00:05:23.870> what<00:05:24.870> we<00:05:25.020> need<00:05:25.200> to

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
third-party libraries so what we need to

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.440 
third-party libraries so what we need to
do<00:05:25.440> is<00:05:25.650> we<00:05:26.310> need<00:05:26.430> to<00:05:26.670> restart<00:05:27.620> our<00:05:29.450> processing

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
do is we need to restart our processing

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.250 
do is we need to restart our processing
so<00:05:31.350> when<00:05:31.530> we<00:05:31.680> restart<00:05:32.160> processing<00:05:32.790> so<00:05:33.630> you

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
so when we restart processing so you

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.920 
so when we restart processing so you
will<00:05:34.440> see<00:05:34.650> that<00:05:34.830> now<00:05:35.220> automatically<00:05:36.060> it<00:05:36.780> is

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
will see that now automatically it is

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.210 
will see that now automatically it is
going<00:05:37.140> to<00:05:37.260> go<00:05:37.380> through<00:05:37.650> these<00:05:37.830> different

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
going to go through these different

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.170 
going to go through these different
libraries<00:05:41.220> which<00:05:41.430> are<00:05:41.550> installed<00:05:41.850> on<00:05:42.150> that

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
libraries which are installed on that

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.340 
libraries which are installed on that
folder<00:05:42.720> and<00:05:43.460> those<00:05:44.460> libraries<00:05:44.970> will<00:05:45.180> be

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
folder and those libraries will be

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:51.560 
folder and those libraries will be
available<00:05:46.350> for<00:05:46.950> use<00:05:49.760> so<00:05:50.760> here<00:05:51.090> you<00:05:51.180> can<00:05:51.300> see

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
available for use so here you can see

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:58.210 
available for use so here you can see
you<00:05:52.080> now<00:05:52.230> go<00:05:52.440> to<00:05:52.500> go<00:05:53.340> to<00:05:53.400> examples<00:05:54.980> and

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.950 

examples<00:05:59.220> they<00:05:59.940> see<00:06:00.270> now<00:06:00.420> you<00:06:00.480> have<00:06:00.780> to

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
examples they see now you have to

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.780 
examples they see now you have to
contribute<00:06:01.410> the<00:06:01.500> libraries<00:06:01.980> and<00:06:02.250> you<00:06:02.400> have<00:06:02.610> to

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
contribute the libraries and you have to

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.330 
contribute the libraries and you have to
here<00:06:03.000> G<00:06:03.900> and<00:06:04.170> that's<00:06:04.290> your<00:06:04.500> example<00:06:05.070> so<00:06:05.280> you

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
here G and that's your example so you

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.940 
here G and that's your example so you
can<00:06:05.430> click<00:06:05.730> on<00:06:05.910> with<00:06:06.120> examples<00:06:06.450> and<00:06:06.900> you<00:06:07.770> can

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
can click on with examples and you can

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.310 
can click on with examples and you can
see<00:06:08.130> now<00:06:08.340> this<00:06:08.820> is<00:06:09.000> how<00:06:09.390> you<00:06:09.420> import<00:06:10.230> a

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
see now this is how you import a

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.220 
see now this is how you import a
particular<00:06:10.710> library<00:06:10.920> into<00:06:11.910> your<00:06:12.060> sketch<00:06:12.390> by

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.230 
particular library into your sketch by

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.830 
particular library into your sketch by
import<00:06:13.770> and<00:06:14.040> then<00:06:14.610> the<00:06:15.000> name<00:06:15.150> of<00:06:15.180> the<00:06:15.330> library

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
import and then the name of the library

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:28.520 
import and then the name of the library
so<00:06:16.590> and<00:06:17.160> this<00:06:17.400> tells<00:06:17.730> you<00:06:18.380> different

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.860 

sketch<00:06:29.639> configurations<00:06:30.639> and<00:06:31.360> then<00:06:31.659> by

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
sketch configurations and then by

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.640 
sketch configurations and then by
executing<00:06:32.740> this<00:06:33.129> we<00:06:33.879> can<00:06:34.090> simply<00:06:34.569> use<00:06:35.379> the

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
executing this we can simply use the

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:42.629 
executing this we can simply use the
library<00:06:36.069> and<00:06:37.830> invoke<00:06:39.000> your<00:06:41.639> processing

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 
library and invoke your processing

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:47.939 
library and invoke your processing
sketch<00:06:46.020> so<00:06:47.020> this<00:06:47.169> is<00:06:47.289> a<00:06:47.319> very<00:06:47.560> simple

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:47.949 
sketch so this is a very simple

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:51.420 
sketch so this is a very simple
application<00:06:48.069> which<00:06:48.939> is<00:06:49.210> trying<00:06:50.050> to<00:06:50.430> so

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
application which is trying to so

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.999 
application which is trying to so
generate<00:06:52.360> the<00:06:53.110> various<00:06:53.530> possible

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:54.009 
generate the various possible

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:56.279 
generate the various possible
combinations<00:06:54.729> of<00:06:54.939> integers<00:06:55.599> that<00:06:55.840> will

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:56.289 
combinations of integers that will

00:06:56.289 --> 00:06:59.219 
combinations of integers that will
produce<00:06:56.650> the<00:06:57.009> number<00:06:57.280> 30<00:06:57.550> so<00:06:58.509> here<00:06:58.719> again<00:06:58.840> you

00:06:59.219 --> 00:06:59.229 
produce the number 30 so here again you

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:01.019 
produce the number 30 so here again you
can<00:06:59.319> see<00:06:59.439> there<00:06:59.919> is<00:07:00.039> a<00:07:00.069> genetic<00:07:00.729> algorithm

00:07:01.019 --> 00:07:01.029 
can see there is a genetic algorithm

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:04.769 
can see there is a genetic algorithm
which<00:07:01.479> basically<00:07:01.930> goes<00:07:02.740> and<00:07:03.099> tries<00:07:03.310> to<00:07:03.779> pick

00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:04.779 
which basically goes and tries to pick

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:07.080 
which basically goes and tries to pick
up<00:07:04.930> numbers<00:07:05.650> in<00:07:05.830> random<00:07:06.279> and<00:07:06.460> then<00:07:06.610> tries<00:07:06.909> to

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:07.090 
up numbers in random and then tries to

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.480 
up numbers in random and then tries to
add<00:07:07.270> them<00:07:07.539> to<00:07:07.810> make<00:07:07.960> sure<00:07:08.139> they<00:07:08.319> are<00:07:08.439> tidy<00:07:08.680> so

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:09.490 
add them to make sure they are tidy so

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.450 
add them to make sure they are tidy so
here<00:07:09.699> is<00:07:09.849> another<00:07:09.969> we<00:07:10.509> want<00:07:10.750> to<00:07:10.840> create<00:07:11.110> 39<00:07:11.680> so

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:12.460 
here is another we want to create 39 so

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:19.230 
here is another we want to create 39 so
that's<00:07:12.729> a<00:07:12.939> solution<00:07:13.539> now<00:07:14.229> 25<00:07:15.900> so<00:07:17.099> sure<00:07:18.240> the

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:19.240 
that's a solution now 25 so sure the

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.850 
that's a solution now 25 so sure the
simple<00:07:19.659> genetic<00:07:19.990> algorithm<00:07:20.319> is<00:07:20.680> actually

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:20.860 
simple genetic algorithm is actually

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.089 
simple genetic algorithm is actually
used<00:07:21.310> to<00:07:21.610> guess<00:07:21.819> the<00:07:22.000> values<00:07:22.710> for<00:07:23.710> numbers

00:07:24.089 --> 00:07:24.099 
used to guess the values for numbers

00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:26.939 
used to guess the values for numbers
whose<00:07:24.430> sum<00:07:24.789> will<00:07:25.389> be<00:07:25.419> equal<00:07:25.779> to<00:07:25.810> 25<00:07:26.439> and<00:07:26.770> there

00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:26.949 
whose sum will be equal to 25 and there

00:07:26.949 --> 00:07:29.510 
whose sum will be equal to 25 and there
could<00:07:27.129> be<00:07:27.159> many<00:07:27.430> such<00:07:27.669> options<00:07:28.150> so<00:07:28.389> it's<00:07:29.199> just

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 
could be many such options so it's just

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:36.469 
could be many such options so it's just
doing<00:07:30.520> a<00:07:30.879> ramp<00:07:31.089> Oh<00:07:31.270> a<00:07:31.509> sample<00:07:33.629> pole<00:07:34.629> and<00:07:35.339> then

00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 
doing a ramp Oh a sample pole and then

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:41.879 
doing a ramp Oh a sample pole and then
trying<00:07:37.479> to<00:07:37.830> come<00:07:38.830> up<00:07:38.979> with<00:07:39.219> a<00:07:39.520> solution
