 here 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.100
 and there we let it cook until the 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.960
 potato is busted in 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:26.620

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:28.760
 minutes of boiling and I'm going to add 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.800
 good cure to twilight and thankfully 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.810

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.750
 of the lion and creaminess ten minutes 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.490
 in ten good minutes and this is the photo 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.920

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.700
 pot-au-feu we skimmed so he is he is 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.740

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.580
 was made with the chorizo that we have 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:54.100
 brought and then we came out after 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:56.360
 20 to 30 minutes our roast must watch 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.940
 perfect that's it then I'm going to cut it in 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.650

 minutes 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.690
