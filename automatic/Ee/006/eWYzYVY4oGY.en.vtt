00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.660 
what that does t coughs this is only
effective<00:01:57.509> for<00:01:58.069> well<00:01:59.069> technically<00:01:59.429> it<00:01:59.580> is

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
effective for well technically it is

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.130 
effective for well technically it is
effective<00:02:00.000> for<00:02:00.119> everyone<00:02:00.209> but<00:02:00.539> it<00:02:00.630> makes<00:02:00.959> more

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
effective for everyone but it makes more

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.330 
effective for everyone but it makes more
sense<00:02:01.200> with<00:02:01.560> blaster<00:02:01.920> characters<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.280> that's

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
sense with blaster characters and that's

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.410 
sense with blaster characters and that's
something<00:02:02.610> that's<00:02:02.729> kind<00:02:02.819> of<00:02:02.939> cool<00:02:03.090> as<00:02:03.240> head

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
something that's kind of cool as head

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.889 
something that's kind of cool as head
every<00:02:03.990> time<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.259> hit<00:02:04.349> c-3po<00:02:04.950> he<00:02:05.159> loses<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.580> limb

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
every time you hit c-3po he loses a limb

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:14.720 
every time you hit c-3po he loses a limb
kind<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:06.959> funny<00:02:07.140> actually<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:13.519> just<00:02:14.519> always

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
kind of funny actually I just always

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.770 
kind of funny actually I just always
thought<00:02:14.910> that<00:02:14.970> was<00:02:15.180> kind<00:02:15.329> of<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.450> funny<00:02:15.630> little

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
thought that was kind of a funny little

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.850 
thought that was kind of a funny little
thing<00:02:15.930> about<00:02:16.260> him<00:02:17.030> so<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.569> makes<00:02:18.900> Vader<00:02:19.530> and

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
thing about him so it makes Vader and

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.920 
thing about him so it makes Vader and
lightsaber<00:02:20.340> characters<00:02:20.880> use<00:02:21.360> their

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
lightsaber characters use their

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.099 
lightsaber characters use their
lightsaber<00:02:22.680> make<00:02:23.100> it<00:02:23.190> look<00:02:23.280> like<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.430> teacup

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:24.109 
lightsaber make it look like a teacup

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:27.830 
lightsaber make it look like a teacup
versus<00:02:25.109> blaster<00:02:25.709> characters<00:02:26.280> will<00:02:27.269> pull<00:02:27.690> out

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
versus blaster characters will pull out

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.059 
versus blaster characters will pull out
a<00:02:28.140> teacup<00:02:28.620> instead<00:02:28.950> of<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.069> blaster

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
a teacup instead of a blaster

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.319 
a teacup instead of a blaster
so<00:02:32.069> with<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:32.370> off<00:02:32.579> we're<00:02:32.819> gonna<00:02:32.910> head<00:02:33.120> to

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
so with that off we're gonna head to

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.830 
so with that off we're gonna head to
brushes<00:02:34.370> brushes<00:02:35.370> make<00:02:35.790> lightsabers<00:02:36.569> turn

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
brushes brushes make lightsabers turn

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.490 
brushes brushes make lightsabers turn
into<00:02:37.350> brushes<00:02:38.780> kind<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:39.840> funny<00:02:40.019> actually<00:02:40.230> the

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
into brushes kind of funny actually the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.910 
into brushes kind of funny actually the
blaster<00:02:40.889> characters<00:02:41.280> remain<00:02:41.549> the<00:02:41.670> same<00:02:41.910> and

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
blaster characters remain the same and

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.900

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
look a lot like the Jean Ocean guns and

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.350 
look a lot like the Jean Ocean guns and
it<00:03:33.100> sort<00:03:33.250> of<00:03:33.310> changes<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:33.700> color<00:03:34.000> of<00:03:34.120> the

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
it sort of changes the color of the

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.240 
it sort of changes the color of the
blaster<00:03:34.780> whichever<00:03:35.110> expert<00:03:35.590> you're<00:03:35.710> using<00:03:38.250> so

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
blaster whichever expert you're using so

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.860 
blaster whichever expert you're using so
that<00:03:39.400> is<00:03:39.520> actually<00:03:39.910> all<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.090> extras<00:03:40.660> so

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
that is actually all the extras so

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.670 
that is actually all the extras so
there's<00:03:41.020> really<00:03:41.170> nothing<00:03:41.500> else<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.710> show<00:03:41.950> off

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
there's really nothing else to show off

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.180 
there's really nothing else to show off
so<00:03:44.680> with<00:03:45.010> that<00:03:45.250> guys<00:03:45.720> we<00:03:46.720> have<00:03:46.930> 100%<00:03:47.650> completed

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
so with that guys we have 100% completed

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.620 
so with that guys we have 100% completed
the<00:03:48.370> game<00:03:48.550> as<00:03:48.700> I<00:03:48.790> said<00:03:48.970> before<00:03:49.090> all<00:03:49.300> these
