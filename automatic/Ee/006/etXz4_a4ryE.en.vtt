projects in this particular case we

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.820 
projects in this particular case we
enlarge<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.810> size<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.350> numbers<00:00:19.650> so<00:00:19.800> that

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
enlarge the size of the numbers so that

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.970

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
and slide on your fabric the only angle

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.819 
and slide on your fabric the only angle
that<00:01:23.939> we<00:01:24.090> have<00:01:24.299> on<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:24.630> ruler<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> 45

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
that we have on this ruler is a 45

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:28.100 
that we have on this ruler is a 45
degree<00:01:25.979> angle<00:01:26.579> that<00:01:26.610> starts<00:01:27.210> at<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.509> zero

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
degree angle that starts at the zero

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.440 
degree angle that starts at the zero
points<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:28.829> when<00:01:29.039> I<00:01:29.189> want<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.060> square<00:01:30.270> up<00:01:30.390> a

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
points so when I want to square up a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.270 
points so when I want to square up a
half<00:01:30.600> square<00:01:30.840> triangle<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.469> simply<00:01:31.890> put<00:01:32.100> that

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
half square triangle I simply put that

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.240 
half square triangle I simply put that
angle<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:32.969> the<00:01:33.750> seam<00:01:34.020> allowance<00:01:34.590> or<00:01:34.859> the<00:01:35.039> seam

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.990 
angle on the seam allowance or the seam
line<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.600> I<00:01:36.600> can<00:01:36.869> trim<00:01:37.109> those<00:01:37.289> down<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.740> size

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
line and I can trim those down to size

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.270 
line and I can trim those down to size
this<00:01:39.000> ruler<00:01:39.539> is<00:01:39.780> marked<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.130> be

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
this ruler is marked so that it can be

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.870 
this ruler is marked so that it can be
used<00:01:41.549> from<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:42.030> right<00:01:42.270> or<00:01:42.420> left<00:01:42.450> hander<00:01:43.109> if<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:44.130> am

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
used from a right or left hander if I am

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.719 
used from a right or left hander if I am
a<00:01:45.119> left-hander<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.930> simply<00:01:46.469> place<00:01:46.679> it<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.369> the

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
a left-hander I simply place it so the

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.270 
a left-hander I simply place it so the
one<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.359> in<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.899> bottom<00:01:49.229> left<00:01:49.469> hand<00:01:49.560> corner<00:01:49.770> if

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
one is in the bottom left hand corner if

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.569 
one is in the bottom left hand corner if
I<00:01:50.880> am<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> right-hander<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.079> place<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.979> one<00:01:53.250> in

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
I am a right-hander I place the one in

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.639 
I am a right-hander I place the one in
the<00:01:53.850> bottom<00:01:54.210> right<00:01:54.420> hand<00:01:54.450> corner<00:01:54.780> so

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
the bottom right hand corner so

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.260 
the bottom right hand corner so
therefore<00:01:56.130> all<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.579> numbers<00:01:56.880> will<00:01:57.060> read

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
therefore all of the numbers will read

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.749
