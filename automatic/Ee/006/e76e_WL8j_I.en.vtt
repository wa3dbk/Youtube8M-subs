00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:16.360

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.790

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.590
 a bit of chain 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.650

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.650
 scissors 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.059
 and silicone 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.380
 The first thing we are going to do then is 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.910
 begin to apply the silicone in the 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.910
 little piece of cloth that we have 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.810
 and then then let's take the tape 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.930
 of strass that we are going to take the measure in 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:57.590
 the doll leaving a small space of 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:01.360
 a centimeter and a half more or less to 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.360
 to be able to stick it in the cloth 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.830
 let's start to paste the first layer 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.020
 of the fruit cord for that we're going to 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.070
 again silicone again in all 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.050
 the outline and so with much 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.200
 calm let's go placing the cord 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.010
 giving the shape that is leaving us the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.010
 strass ribbon 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.850
 let's be going for small 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.130
 moments until the tape is well 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.410
 stuck with the shape and once 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.290
 done this we are going to repeat the process 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.090
 for the other side and then we're going to 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.870
 repeat with the following colors that 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.870
 we want to drive 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.230
 well, that's how it is fitting into our project 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.120
 let's let it dry and then then 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.390
 let's start trimming all the 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.069
 outline with the scissors until we 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.069
 stay with the shape we want 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.069
 well once we have cut back then already 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.340
 our project we are going to take the auction 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.280
 suitcase type that is the size of the 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.650
 bracelet that we are making and we are going to 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.569
 start tightening then with the 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.569
 Craftsman's tongs to close it 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.110
 once we have placed the auction type 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.720
 suitcase on both sides we have this way 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:06.590
 our bracelet we go then now to 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:09.070
 take the ring the peak the gold and the 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.070
 chain 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.840
 and let's start by opening the ring 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:22.280
 to put it through the hole of the auction 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.800
 and then place the peak the gold or the 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.970
 brooch that you wish to place the 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:31.130
 we close 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.130
 we repeat the action for the other side 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.180
 again we take the ring we open it 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.890
 we put it through the hole and then 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.890
 then we add the chain 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.620
 well so then our 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.030
