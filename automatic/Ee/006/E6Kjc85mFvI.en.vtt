 and then at 45 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.800
 and we will make an effort of the unaf 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.800
 in a more classic way to chrome what is pâté hénaff 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.850

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.300

 and we see the mix not at all new live 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:01.990
 as part of a strong body the gelatin leaves 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.000
 and here we will mix it with the pathé nintendo and the image analysis dtc 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.470
 first to the end and to the poultry 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.479

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.540

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.950
 go on 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.720
 then we take voc year for the year to soak in cold water 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.380
 this is the same when cutting, which also 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.380
 now we are going to copenhagen 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.280

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.720
 does not see them cut into small screens which is also de facto 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.030
 been married 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.300

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.320
 in white vinegar 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.430
 so now 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.730
 we will resume but excellent lap ahead puts the game in play 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.070
 the four elements 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.250
 so the 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.330
 we mix it well 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.570
 but the four elements 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.330
 we will play it 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.980

 now we will cut to the shape we want we're going to cut into a triangle 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:16.310
