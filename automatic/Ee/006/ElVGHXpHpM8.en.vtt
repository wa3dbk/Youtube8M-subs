so you're going to measure back from the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.630 
so you're going to measure back from the
front<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.210> curb<00:01:33.479> back<00:01:33.810> about<00:01:34.079> 8<00:01:34.380> inches

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
front of the curb back about 8 inches

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.679 
front of the curb back about 8 inches
and<00:01:35.640> then<00:01:35.759> you're<00:01:35.909> going<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.060> go<00:01:36.210> back<00:01:36.360> another

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
and then you're going to go back another

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.289 
and then you're going to go back another
8<00:01:36.930> inches<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.439> for<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> total<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.189> about<00:01:38.340> 16

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
8 inches so for a total of about 16

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.380 
8 inches so for a total of about 16
inches<00:01:39.350> is<00:01:40.350> where<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.890> want<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.610> front<00:01:42.060> of

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
is make sure that it's plumb and you

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.460 
is make sure that it's plumb and you

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.560 
probably see that there's some bracing
here<00:05:37.770> so<00:05:38.010> what<00:05:38.250> I<00:05:38.280> did<00:05:38.400> is<00:05:38.699> I<00:05:38.789> simply<00:05:39.000> drove<00:05:39.389> a

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
here so what I did is I simply drove a

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.719 
here so what I did is I simply drove a
couple<00:05:39.870> steaks<00:05:40.229> one<00:05:40.680> to<00:05:40.800> the<00:05:40.919> side<00:05:41.159> and<00:05:41.430> one<00:05:41.610> to

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
couple steaks one to the side and one to

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:44.300 
couple steaks one to the side and one to
the<00:05:41.820> back<00:05:42.030> and<00:05:42.810> I<00:05:42.990> just<00:05:43.169> ran<00:05:43.349> a<00:05:43.409> hood<00:05:43.800> down<00:05:44.099> the

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
the back and I just ran a hood down the

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.960 
the back and I just ran a hood down the
side<00:05:44.550> at<00:05:44.789> an<00:05:44.880> angle<00:05:45.360> and<00:05:46.080> I<00:05:46.380> put<00:05:46.590> a<00:05:46.620> level<00:05:47.430> up<00:05:47.729> to

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
side at an angle and I put a level up to

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.839 
side at an angle and I put a level up to
it<00:05:48.120> make<00:05:48.360> sure<00:05:48.389> it's<00:05:48.780> plumb<00:05:49.080> and<00:05:49.490> then<00:05:50.490> once<00:05:50.699> I

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:50.849 
it make sure it's plumb and then once I

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:52.460 
it make sure it's plumb and then once I
spotted<00:05:51.210> that<00:05:51.330> it<00:05:51.449> was<00:05:51.570> plumb<00:05:51.810> I<00:05:51.840> nailed<00:05:52.289> it

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
spotted that it was plumb I nailed it

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.740 
spotted that it was plumb I nailed it
then<00:05:52.830> I<00:05:52.860> went<00:05:53.130> to<00:05:53.220> the<00:05:53.370> back<00:05:53.580> I<00:05:53.970> did<00:05:54.389> the<00:05:54.539> same

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
then I went to the back I did the same

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.960 
then I went to the back I did the same
thing<00:05:55.110> and<00:05:55.650> that's<00:05:55.919> going<00:05:56.099> to<00:05:56.190> make<00:05:56.400> sure<00:05:56.669> not

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
thing and that's going to make sure not

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.760 
thing and that's going to make sure not
only<00:05:57.000> that<00:05:57.270> it's<00:05:57.539> plumb<00:05:57.870> but<00:05:58.110> it<00:05:58.199> holds<00:05:58.530> it<00:05:58.650> in

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
only that it's plumb but it holds it in

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.529 
only that it's plumb but it holds it in
place<00:05:58.979> in<00:05:59.340> the<00:05:59.430> right<00:05:59.610> place<00:05:59.940> as<00:06:00.150> you<00:06:00.270> pour

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539
