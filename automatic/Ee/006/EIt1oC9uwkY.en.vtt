00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.209
 very good everyone today I bring you here 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:08.960
 a new news well the game freak has 

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:10.670
 talked about a new way or a thing 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.960
 new about the world of which manuel 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:17.390
 four would be shuffling or thinking a 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.289
 possibility of creating a pokémon game 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:25.009
 with all the regions together in which 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:28.970
 means in which then to be able to 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:31.849
 visit all regions of the games 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.989
 of pokémon in a game that is canton 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:41.210
 giotto young who is the sign of celia and 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:44.390
 carlos all in one and the method is not 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:49.140
 new since when it premiered we can 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:53.820
 gold and pokémon soulsilver your image 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.550
 mjs there were two regions together that were 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.640
 the first the region of u2 in which no 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.129
 we passed it and directly we went to the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.650
 Kanto region to fight with all its 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.110
 free well the possibility that 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.620
 is shuffling in internal that can be 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.980
 an idea that 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:17.000
 then finish in dry dock but what 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:21.170
 they are shuffling like a simple storm 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.080
 of ideas as it is called and that would shuffle 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.090
 all the regions in a game but here 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.110
 let's see let's do a little 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.720
 sensible all the regions in a game 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:36.650
 Well America we would be good game 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:40.080
 would fly a lot but in the duration that 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:43.500
 it would take forever 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:47.370
 unless they include something new that 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.030
 it implies that the game is no longer 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.360
 less 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.180
 because if they put all the leaders of 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.470
 gym and all the elites force in a 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.680
 same game well let's go you'll last a thousand 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.890
 years the game and on the other hand you're going to 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:10.060
 result a bit and get to the region 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:13.220
 destination and then not have 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:18.320
 and do not get tired but what 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:23.600
 a bit of saturation of the information 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:27.140
 or things but it would be fine but that 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.550
 other things as they do since more 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.370
 doubt has said this 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.770
 if I could if we could find one 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.200
 way to make it really interesting 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.390
 then it would be something that we would like 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.820
 put into practice but for me 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.980
 personally as a theory I think that 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.860
 it would be more fun for all of us 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.900
 enjoying different places and 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.480
 then share that experience together 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.390
 that everyone has the same experience in 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.410
 the same region 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.000
 that is to say that he 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.670
 because it fits the idea that 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.430
 people when they play then have 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.320
 different experiences when visiting 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.860
 different regions in the same game 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:15.760
 that not in the same and that everyone 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.730
 Well, have the same opinions but for 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.690
 another side as he said is one thing that 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.459
 can be put into practice but that 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.880
 it stays there in time as in a 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:31.860
 storm ideas or an idea that have had 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.860
 so you have to give the thing a greeting
