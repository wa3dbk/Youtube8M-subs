it has the cutout armpits which is a
phenomenal<00:01:32.130> addition<00:01:33.259> they<00:01:34.259> did<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> much

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
phenomenal addition they did a much

better<00:01:34.890> job<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.780> kidney<00:01:37.140> belt

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
better job on the on the kidney belt

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.060 
better job on the on the kidney belt
than<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.460> cheaper<00:01:38.939> TMS<00:01:39.420> version<00:01:39.869> but<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.829> still

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
than the cheaper TMS version but I still

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.039 
than the cheaper TMS version but I still
use<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.490> cheap<00:01:41.700> cheap<00:01:42.090> or<00:01:42.299> TMS<00:01:42.630> version

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
use the cheap cheap or TMS version

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.960 
use the cheap cheap or TMS version
because<00:01:43.350> it's<00:01:43.500> really<00:01:43.680> easy<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.250> take<00:01:44.430> off<00:01:44.700> now

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
to show you the big flaw of this armor

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.819 
to show you the big flaw of this armor
coming<00:01:51.060> up<00:01:51.149> soon<00:01:51.360> once<00:01:52.049> again<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.380> think<00:01:52.560> with

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
coming up soon once again I think with

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.030 
coming up soon once again I think with
any<00:01:53.009> armor<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:53.640> type<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.119> does<00:01:54.329> have<00:01:54.570> the

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
any armor of this type it does have the

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.440 
any armor of this type it does have the
protrusion<00:01:56.040> factor<00:01:56.490> going<00:01:56.670> on<00:01:56.939> where<00:01:57.210> that's

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
protrusion factor going on where that's

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.889 
protrusion factor going on where that's
a<00:01:57.570> little<00:01:57.750> bit<00:01:57.930> awkward<00:01:59.390> but<00:02:00.390> it's<00:02:00.540> really<00:02:00.780> not

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
a little bit awkward but it's really not

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.080 
a little bit awkward but it's really not
