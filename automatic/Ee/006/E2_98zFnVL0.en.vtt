00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
cartoon section of it and this would be

in the cartoon episode finally the very
last<00:02:34.320> one<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:34.800> retro<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.820> what<00:02:36.210> I<00:02:36.240> mean<00:02:36.390> by

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
last one is retro and what I mean by

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.780 
last one is retro and what I mean by
retro<00:02:36.960> is<00:02:37.110> something<00:02:37.590> like<00:02:37.740> elled<00:02:38.040> pack<00:02:38.340> this

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
retro is something like elled pack this

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.700 
retro is something like elled pack this
isn't<00:02:39.120> exactly<00:02:39.210> like<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.870> because<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.440> this

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
isn't exactly like it because the this

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.370 
isn't exactly like it because the this
isn't<00:02:41.010> right<00:02:41.160> but<00:02:41.310> for<00:02:41.520> example<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:42.120> elf<00:02:43.080> pack

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
isn't right but for example a elf pack

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.920 
isn't right but for example a elf pack
kind<00:02:43.830> of<00:02:44.010> looks<00:02:44.220> like<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.430> zelda<00:02:44.880> ii<00:02:44.910> texture<00:02:45.450> so

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
kind of looks like a zelda ii texture so

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.180 
kind of looks like a zelda ii texture so
that<00:02:46.140> would<00:02:46.290> go<00:02:46.410> in<00:02:46.560> there<00:02:46.740> because<00:02:46.920> it's

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
that would go in there because it's

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.860 
that would go in there because it's
zelda<00:02:47.580> texture<00:02:47.880> I've<00:02:48.030> got<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.210> couple<00:02:48.360> of<00:02:48.570> Zelda

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
zelda texture I've got a couple of Zelda

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.510 
zelda texture I've got a couple of Zelda
ones<00:02:49.050> Mario<00:02:49.560> all<00:02:49.770> this<00:02:49.920> different<00:02:50.070> stuff<00:02:50.220> if

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
ones Mario all this different stuff if

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.930 
ones Mario all this different stuff if
it<00:02:50.670> looks<00:02:50.880> like<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.120> video<00:02:51.390> game<00:02:51.540> or<00:02:52.220> is<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.580> copy

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
it looks like a video game or is a copy

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.510 
it looks like a video game or is a copy
of<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.210> video<00:02:54.330> game<00:02:54.450> or<00:02:54.810> whatever<00:02:54.990> reason<00:02:55.560> for

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
of a video game or whatever reason for

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.740 
of a video game or whatever reason for
example<00:02:56.880> here's<00:02:57.030> another<00:02:57.180> example<00:02:57.300> that<00:02:57.660> I

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
example here's another example that I

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.230 
example here's another example that I
did<00:02:58.220> if<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.700> haven't<00:02:59.940> seen<00:03:00.060> this<00:03:00.180> one

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
did if you haven't seen this one

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.290 
did if you haven't seen this one
probably<00:03:00.600> not<00:03:00.840> it's<00:03:01.080> not<00:03:01.200> out<00:03:01.350> yet<00:03:01.380> but<00:03:01.590> uh

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
probably not it's not out yet but uh

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.230 
probably not it's not out yet but uh
border<00:03:03.300> craft<00:03:04.340> this<00:03:05.340> would<00:03:05.550> be<00:03:05.670> an<00:03:05.730> example<00:03:05.790> of

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
border craft this would be an example of

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.420 
border craft this would be an example of
one<00:03:06.420> of<00:03:06.510> those<00:03:06.570> ones<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:06.900> goes<00:03:07.170> in<00:03:07.410> just<00:03:08.340> to

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
one of those ones that goes in just to

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.880 
one of those ones that goes in just to
ignore<00:03:08.670> it<00:03:09.000> it<00:03:09.120> looks<00:03:09.720> weird<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.770> I've

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
ignore it it looks weird and I've

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.920 
ignore it it looks weird and I've
mentioned<00:03:11.160> on<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.520> video<00:03:11.730> but<00:03:12.000> border<00:03:12.690> craft

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
mentioned on the video but border craft

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.450 
mentioned on the video but border craft
for<00:03:13.140> example<00:03:13.560> would<00:03:13.650> be<00:03:13.710> one<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.070> those<00:03:14.160> ones

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
for example would be one of those ones

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.670 
for example would be one of those ones
that<00:03:14.580> would<00:03:14.790> go<00:03:14.970> in<00:03:15.150> as<00:03:15.360> a<00:03:15.420> video<00:03:16.200> game<00:03:16.530> or

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
that would go in as a video game or

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.740 
that would go in as a video game or
retro<00:03:17.430> submission<00:03:18.030> because<00:03:18.180> it<00:03:18.300> looks<00:03:18.510> like

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750
