00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
the first character and then I did I had

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.740 
the first character and then I did I had
a<00:06:10.280> lot<00:06:10.460> of<00:06:10.580> characters<00:06:10.940> ready<00:06:11.120> to<00:06:11.270> go<00:06:11.420> because

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
a lot of characters ready to go because

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.590 
a lot of characters ready to go because
I<00:06:11.840> created<00:06:12.140> them<00:06:12.230> Groundlings<00:06:12.800> and<00:06:13.120> I<00:06:14.120> think

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
I created them Groundlings and I think

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.620 
I created them Groundlings and I think
that<00:06:14.780> was<00:06:14.930> Lauren's<00:06:15.400> lure<00:06:16.400> Michael's<00:06:16.760> uh<00:06:16.820> he

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 
that was Lauren's lure Michael's uh he

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.790 
that was Lauren's lure Michael's uh he
knew<00:06:17.750> that<00:06:17.900> was<00:06:18.050> gonna<00:06:18.110> happen

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
knew that was gonna happen

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.560 
knew that was gonna happen
I<00:06:18.920> think<00:06:19.280> that's<00:06:19.400> why<00:06:19.520> he<00:06:19.700> hired<00:06:20.120> me<00:06:20.270> at<00:06:20.420> that

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
I think that's why he hired me at that

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.440 
I think that's why he hired me at that
moment<00:06:20.750> cuz<00:06:21.050> it<00:06:21.140> was<00:06:21.260> six<00:06:21.500> weeks<00:06:21.560> before<00:06:21.920> the

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:22.450 
moment cuz it was six weeks before the

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.050 
moment cuz it was six weeks before the
the<00:06:23.450> first<00:06:23.960> season<00:06:24.530> was<00:06:24.980> gonna<00:06:25.370> end<00:06:25.700> which

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
the first season was gonna end which

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.480 
the first season was gonna end which
does<00:06:26.690> you<00:06:26.930> don't<00:06:27.170> hire<00:06:27.440> people<00:06:27.800> usually<00:06:28.100> at

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
does you don't hire people usually at

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.340 
does you don't hire people usually at
that<00:06:28.550> point<00:06:28.940> Breyer<00:06:29.240> midseason<00:06:29.780> right<00:06:30.230> but

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:30.350 
that point Breyer midseason right but

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.320 
that point Breyer midseason right but
not<00:06:30.410> six<00:06:30.740> weeks<00:06:30.920> before<00:06:31.100> the<00:06:31.460> seasons<00:06:32.150> gonna

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
not six weeks before the seasons gonna

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.330 
not six weeks before the seasons gonna
end<00:06:32.480> and<00:06:32.750> so<00:06:33.260> that<00:06:33.410> was<00:06:33.530> really<00:06:33.560> just<00:06:33.830> kind<00:06:34.310> of

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.340 
end and so that was really just kind of

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.860 
end and so that was really just kind of
disruptive<00:06:34.820> to<00:06:34.940> a<00:06:34.970> lot<00:06:35.120> of<00:06:35.150> other<00:06:35.390> cast

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.870 
disruptive to a lot of other cast

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.840 
disruptive to a lot of other cast
