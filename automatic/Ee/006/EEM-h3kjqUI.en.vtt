the mighty Columbia and I thought oh man
well<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.700> guess<00:01:26.939> if<00:01:27.150> there<00:01:27.390> were<00:01:27.509> two<00:01:27.720> nations

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.749 
well I guess if there were two nations
that<00:01:28.140> were<00:01:28.229> gonna<00:01:28.409> have<00:01:28.530> some<00:01:28.740> tujhe<00:01:29.280> beastly

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
that were gonna have some tujhe beastly

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.640 
that were gonna have some tujhe beastly
strikers<00:01:30.150> up<00:01:30.299> front<00:01:30.509> matchup<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.079> guess<00:01:31.229> Falcao

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
strikers up front matchup I guess Falcao

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.890 
strikers up front matchup I guess Falcao
Edo<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.610> would<00:01:32.790> be<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:32.939> way<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.210> out<00:01:33.720> that

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
Edo that would be the way to out that

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.969 
Edo that would be the way to out that
would<00:01:33.990> be<00:01:34.079> one<00:01:34.229> way<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.409> look<00:01:34.560> at<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.740> but

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
well-rounded strikers as far as they go

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.700 
well-rounded strikers as far as they go
for<00:05:16.919> a<00:05:16.949> team<00:05:17.220> I<00:05:17.460> add<00:05:18.389> in<00:05:18.720> Mexico<00:05:19.289> that<00:05:19.530> you're

not going to be matching up against the
top<00:05:21.389> teams<00:05:21.780> so<00:05:22.530> you<00:05:22.590> don't<00:05:22.740> have<00:05:22.830> to<00:05:22.949> worry

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
top teams so you don't have to worry

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.040 
top teams so you don't have to worry
about<00:05:23.250> playing<00:05:23.639> any<00:05:23.820> of<00:05:23.970> this<00:05:24.120> super<00:05:24.690> super

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
centre-backs so they end up doing a

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.850 
centre-backs so they end up doing a
really<00:05:27.330> really<00:05:27.570> nice<00:05:27.780> job<00:05:28.110> taking<00:05:28.530> advantage

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
more of them in there than you think for

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.170 
more of them in there than you think for
line<00:05:42.240> i<00:05:42.270> think<00:05:42.630> is<00:05:42.840> still<00:05:43.440> in<00:05:43.710> the<00:05:43.860> mix<00:05:44.099> but<00:05:44.699> as

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
line i think is still in the mix but as

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.700 
line i think is still in the mix but as
far<00:05:45.750> as<00:05:45.810> the<00:05:45.930> centre-backs<00:05:46.349> go<00:05:46.530> you've<00:05:46.680> got

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
far as the centre-backs go you've got

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.580 
far as the centre-backs go you've got
lugano<00:05:47.190> you've<00:05:47.490> got<00:05:47.639> good<00:05:47.849> Dean<00:05:48.260> but<00:05:49.260> they<00:05:49.440> are

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
lugano you've got good Dean but they are

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.820 
lugano you've got good Dean but they are
not<00:05:50.070> that<00:05:50.729> fast<00:05:51.570> and<00:05:52.050> they<00:05:52.169> can<00:05:52.349> kind<00:05:52.650> of<00:05:52.740> be

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
not that fast and they can kind of be

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.339 
not that fast and they can kind of be
taken<00:05:53.159> advantage<00:05:53.250> of<00:05:53.699> if<00:05:53.909> you<00:05:54.840> give<00:05:55.050> up<00:05:55.199> the

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349 
taken advantage of if you give up the

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:56.540 
taken advantage of if you give up the
ball<00:05:55.560> in<00:05:55.590> the<00:05:55.800> midfield<00:05:56.009> which<00:05:56.340> is<00:05:56.460> an

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
ball in the midfield which is an

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.670 
ball in the midfield which is an
absolute<00:05:56.970> no-no<00:05:57.210> on<00:05:57.539> this<00:05:57.690> game<00:05:57.840> do<00:05:58.110> not<00:05:58.139> do

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
absolute no-no on this game do not do

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.649 
absolute no-no on this game do not do
that<00:05:58.919> I've<00:05:59.729> managed<00:05:59.970> to<00:06:00.030> Nick<00:06:00.240> it<00:06:00.360> away<00:06:00.509> and

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:00.659 
that I've managed to Nick it away and

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:02.330 
that I've managed to Nick it away and
that's<00:06:00.720> just<00:06:00.870> going<00:06:00.990> to<00:06:01.110> be<00:06:01.139> an<00:06:01.289> easy<00:06:01.590> clinical

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
that's just going to be an easy clinical

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.010 
that's just going to be an easy clinical
little<00:06:02.550> finish<00:06:02.820> into<00:06:03.300> the<00:06:03.389> far<00:06:03.570> corner<00:06:03.599> in<00:06:03.960> the

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
little finish into the far corner in the

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.560 
little finish into the far corner in the
57th<00:06:04.740> minute<00:06:04.800> and<00:06:05.220> I<00:06:05.370> was<00:06:05.580> scoring<00:06:06.150> I<00:06:06.300> could

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
57th minute and I was scoring I could

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.029 
57th minute and I was scoring I could
have<00:06:06.659> scored<00:06:06.780> a<00:06:06.930> lot<00:06:07.169> more<00:06:07.409> goals<00:06:07.680> in<00:06:07.860> this

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
have scored a lot more goals in this

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:12.710 
have scored a lot more goals in this
game<00:06:08.449> as<00:06:09.449> well<00:06:09.840> because<00:06:10.520> this<00:06:11.520> team<00:06:11.759> flies

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
game as well because this team flies

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.710 
game as well because this team flies
forward<00:06:13.470> I<00:06:13.889> was<00:06:14.190> absolutely<00:06:14.430> shocked<00:06:15.210> I<00:06:15.509> think

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 
forward I was absolutely shocked I think

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.330 
forward I was absolutely shocked I think
I<00:06:15.990> think<00:06:16.380> they'll<00:06:16.500> get<00:06:16.590> quite<00:06:16.889> a<00:06:16.919> bit<00:06:17.009> of<00:06:17.220> use

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
I think they'll get quite a bit of use

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.279 
I think they'll get quite a bit of use
on<00:06:17.550> the<00:06:17.639> world<00:06:17.849> cup<00:06:17.909> game<00:06:18.240> for<00:06:18.960> that<00:06:19.080> reason

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:19.289 
on the world cup game for that reason

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:20.960 
on the world cup game for that reason
but<00:06:19.530> that<00:06:19.680> is<00:06:19.800> how<00:06:19.889> this<00:06:20.070> one<00:06:20.310> is<00:06:20.580> going<00:06:20.849> to

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
but that is how this one is going to

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.260 
but that is how this one is going to
come<00:06:21.330> to<00:06:21.479> a<00:06:21.509> close<00:06:21.979> was<00:06:22.979> that<00:06:23.039> three<00:06:23.460> nil<00:06:24.240> I

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
come to a close was that three nil I

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.490 
come to a close was that three nil I
don't<00:06:24.539> think<00:06:24.659> I<00:06:24.690> gave<00:06:24.840> up<00:06:24.990> a<00:06:25.050> goal<00:06:25.169> that<00:06:25.229> game

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
don't think I gave up a goal that game

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.719 
don't think I gave up a goal that game
maybe<00:06:25.680> just<00:06:25.949> three<00:06:26.159> nel<00:06:26.310> it<00:06:26.430> could<00:06:26.580> have<00:06:26.669> been

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:26.729 
maybe just three nel it could have been

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:29.510 
maybe just three nel it could have been
four<00:06:27.030> or<00:06:27.060> five<00:06:27.360> maybe<00:06:28.139> not<00:06:28.590> six<00:06:28.949> probably<00:06:29.159> five

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
four or five maybe not six probably five

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.189 
four or five maybe not six probably five
would<00:06:29.789> have<00:06:29.880> been<00:06:30.000> maybe<00:06:30.509> what<00:06:30.810> I<00:06:30.840> would<00:06:31.169> have

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 
would have been maybe what I would have

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:32.659 
would have been maybe what I would have
expected<00:06:31.320> it<00:06:31.800> to<00:06:31.889> be<00:06:31.919> and<00:06:32.039> actually<00:06:32.310> I<00:06:32.490> don't

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:32.669 
expected it to be and actually I don't

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:33.010 
expected it to be and actually I don't
