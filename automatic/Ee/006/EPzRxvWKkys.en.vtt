assembled it's back together it turns a
little<00:02:23.490> bit<00:02:23.700> harder<00:02:24.060> now<00:02:25.520> but<00:02:26.520> it's<00:02:26.670> got<00:02:26.880> brand

heavy-duty<00:02:29.550> grease<00:02:30.090> in<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.450> so<00:02:30.990> I<00:02:32.120> expected

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
heavy-duty grease in it so I expected

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.280 
heavy-duty grease in it so I expected
they're<00:02:33.209> trying<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.540> little<00:02:33.720> hard<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:34.080> can't

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
turn it with my fingers anymore but if I

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.250 
turn it with my fingers anymore but if I
put<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.420> pulley<00:02:36.660> on<00:02:36.930> it

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.530 
put the pulley on it
I<00:02:37.290> can<00:02:37.860> still<00:02:38.070> spin<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.520> so<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.090> know<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.390> all

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
I can still spin it so I know it all

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.720 
I can still spin it so I know it all
works<00:02:41.930> it<00:02:42.930> doesn't<00:02:43.140> shift<00:02:43.470> as<00:02:43.709> easy<00:02:43.920> as<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.340> did

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
works it doesn't shift as easy as it did

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.080 
works it doesn't shift as easy as it did
before<00:02:45.560> but<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.680> does<00:02:46.890> shift<00:02:47.160> through<00:02:47.790> all<00:02:47.910> the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
before but it does shift through all the

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.660 
before but it does shift through all the
gears<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:49.320> I'm<00:02:49.410> gonna<00:02:49.590> leave<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.430> alone

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
gears so I'm gonna leave it alone

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:58.310 
gears so I'm gonna leave it alone
and<00:02:53.840> I'll<00:02:54.840> just<00:02:55.140> install<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:57.320> hopefully

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
and I'll just install it and hopefully

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.190 
and I'll just install it and hopefully
it'll<00:02:58.650> work<00:02:59.330> or<00:03:00.330> I'll<00:03:00.480> be<00:03:00.600> looking<00:03:00.870> for<00:03:01.020> a<00:03:01.050> new

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
it'll work or I'll be looking for a new

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:08.110 
it'll work or I'll be looking for a new
rerun<00:03:02.510> all<00:03:03.510> right<00:03:03.720> so<00:03:04.459> you<00:03:05.459> got<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.760> motor<00:03:05.970> out

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
rerun all right so you got the motor out

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.910 
rerun all right so you got the motor out
and<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.810> reason<00:03:10.050> that<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.350> motor<00:03:10.530> out<00:03:10.739> this

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
and the reason that the motor out this

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.170 
and the reason that the motor out this
is<00:03:11.070> we're<00:03:11.160> going<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.340> deal<00:03:11.520> with<00:03:11.670> this<00:03:11.760> pulley

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.280 

originally<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:15.209> thought<00:03:15.630> I<00:03:15.690> was<00:03:15.870> gonna<00:03:15.959> put<00:03:16.260> a

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
originally I thought I was gonna put a

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.199 
originally I thought I was gonna put a
great<00:03:16.560> big<00:03:16.590> pulley<00:03:17.070> on<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.489> motor<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:20.209> make

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
great big pulley on the motor and make

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:29.030 
great big pulley on the motor and make
it<00:03:22.070> haul<00:03:23.930> but<00:03:24.930> I<00:03:27.260> think<00:03:28.260> what<00:03:28.440> I'm<00:03:28.530> going<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:28.799> do

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
it haul but I think what I'm going to do

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.250 
it haul but I think what I'm going to do
is<00:03:29.610> I<00:03:29.790> think<00:03:29.850> I'm<00:03:30.209> just<00:03:30.330> going<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.600> cut<00:03:31.049> this

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
is I think I'm just going to cut this

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.380 
is I think I'm just going to cut this
bottom<00:03:31.860> pull<00:03:32.100> it<00:03:32.250> off<00:03:33.290> okay<00:03:34.940> just<00:03:35.940> to<00:03:36.090> get<00:03:36.239> this

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
bottom pull it off okay just to get this

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.720 
bottom pull it off okay just to get this
out<00:03:36.630> of<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.290> way<00:03:37.500> they<00:03:38.100> don't<00:03:38.310> want<00:03:38.459> anything

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
out of the way they don't want anything

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.930 
out of the way they don't want anything
for<00:03:39.180> it<00:03:39.239> to<00:03:39.420> catch<00:03:39.810> on<00:03:40.049> and<00:03:43.010> I'm<00:03:44.010> pulling<00:03:44.670> on

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
for it to catch on and I'm pulling on

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.539 
for it to catch on and I'm pulling on
the<00:03:45.540> rear<00:03:45.720> end<00:03:46.970> so<00:03:48.950> it'll<00:03:49.950> go<00:03:50.100> a<00:03:50.130> little<00:03:50.340> bit

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
the rear end so it'll go a little bit

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.060 
the rear end so it'll go a little bit
faster<00:03:52.610> but<00:03:53.610> I'll<00:03:53.760> still<00:03:54.000> have<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.360> power

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
faster but I'll still have the power

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.180 
faster but I'll still have the power
I'll<00:03:56.070> still<00:03:56.310> have<00:03:56.489> some<00:03:56.670> power<00:03:56.850> to<00:03:57.150> that<00:03:58.190> from

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
I'll still have some power to that from

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:05.140 
I'll still have some power to that from
the<00:03:59.310> motor

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.470 

just<00:04:05.900> to<00:04:06.049> help<00:04:06.230> you<00:04:06.409> compare<00:04:07.060> this<00:04:08.060> is<00:04:08.269> what

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
just to help you compare this is what

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.759 
just to help you compare this is what
came<00:04:08.720> on<00:04:08.959> the<00:04:09.110> rear<00:04:09.319> end<00:04:09.530> on<00:04:09.860> the<00:04:10.519> transaxle

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
came on the rear end on the transaxle

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.719 
came on the rear end on the transaxle
listen<00:04:12.769> what<00:04:12.920> I'm<00:04:13.010> putting<00:04:13.280> on<00:04:13.370> it<00:04:14.769> so<00:04:15.769> pull

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
listen what I'm putting on it so pull

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.180 
listen what I'm putting on it so pull
these<00:04:16.850> swaps<00:04:17.209> are<00:04:17.419> easy<00:04:17.680> this<00:04:18.680> is<00:04:18.739> what<00:04:19.070> I'm

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
these swaps are easy this is what I'm

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.520 
these swaps are easy this is what I'm
going<00:04:19.370> to<00:04:19.400> go<00:04:19.549> for<00:04:19.880> right<00:04:20.090> now<00:04:20.350> we're<00:04:21.350> going<00:04:21.470> to

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
going to go for right now we're going to

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.930 
going to go for right now we're going to
try<00:04:21.680> this<00:04:21.739> first<00:04:23.080> so<00:04:24.550> we'll<00:04:25.550> see<00:04:25.729> how<00:04:25.880> that

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
try this first so we'll see how that

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.659 
try this first so we'll see how that
goes

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
goes

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.600 
goes
and<00:04:28.669> then<00:04:28.790> I'm<00:04:28.880> going<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.060> use<00:04:29.210> this<00:04:29.510> pulley<00:04:30.610> to

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
and then I'm going to use this pulley to

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.270 
and then I'm going to use this pulley to
power<00:04:32.860> the<00:04:33.860> special<00:04:34.310> edition<00:04:35.800> no<00:04:36.800> no<00:04:37.010> if<00:04:37.130> I

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
power the special edition no no if I

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.770 
power the special edition no no if I
told<00:04:37.550> you<00:04:37.729> about<00:04:37.760> that<00:04:37.940> yet<00:04:38.300> I'm<00:04:38.419> going<00:04:38.570> to<00:04:38.690> go

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
told you about that yet I'm going to go

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.120 
told you about that yet I'm going to go
back<00:04:38.990> and<00:04:39.139> look<00:04:39.229> at<00:04:39.350> my<00:04:39.470> videos<00:04:41.139> so<00:04:42.139> that's

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
back and look at my videos so that's

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.219 
back and look at my videos so that's
what<00:04:43.370> we're<00:04:43.520> gonna<00:04:43.610> do<00:04:43.850> this<00:04:44.690> little<00:04:45.020> tiny

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
what we're gonna do this little tiny

00:04:45.229 --> 00:06:02.420 
what we're gonna do this little tiny
pulley<00:04:46.690> and<00:04:47.690> the<00:04:47.870> original<00:04:48.289> Drive<00:04:48.560> pulley

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.459 

all<00:06:03.430> right

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:04.469 
all right

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:08.040 
all right
so<00:06:05.469> cut<00:06:05.680> it<00:06:05.800> off<00:06:05.919> clean<00:06:06.249> it<00:06:06.370> up<00:06:06.520> put<00:06:07.270> it<00:06:07.419> on<00:06:07.479> it's

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
so cut it off clean it up put it on it's

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.429 
so cut it off clean it up put it on it's
not<00:06:08.199> torque<00:06:08.650> down<00:06:08.999> it's<00:06:09.999> just<00:06:10.180> on<00:06:10.360> there<00:06:10.659> just

00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:11.439 
not torque down it's just on there just

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:15.629 
not torque down it's just on there just
for<00:06:11.590> mock<00:06:11.800> up<00:06:13.620> now<00:06:14.620> let's<00:06:14.770> get<00:06:14.919> the<00:06:15.039> frame<00:06:15.279> okay

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 
for mock up now let's get the frame okay

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:17.219 
for mock up now let's get the frame okay
all<00:06:15.789> right<00:06:15.969> so<00:06:16.240> as<00:06:16.389> you<00:06:16.449> can<00:06:16.629> see<00:06:16.689> it<00:06:16.990> got<00:06:17.110> to

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:17.229 
all right so as you can see it got to

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:21.119 
all right so as you can see it got to
frame<00:06:17.469> up<00:06:17.770> here<00:06:18.479> boiler<00:06:19.479> on<00:06:19.779> it<00:06:19.990> a<00:06:20.199> couple<00:06:20.860> of

00:06:21.119 --> 00:06:21.129 
frame up here boiler on it a couple of

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:23.550 
frame up here boiler on it a couple of
bolts<00:06:21.340> in<00:06:21.490> the<00:06:21.580> motor<00:06:21.759> to<00:06:21.969> line<00:06:22.150> it<00:06:22.180> up<00:06:22.419> so<00:06:22.689> that

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
bolts in the motor to line it up so that

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.170 
bolts in the motor to line it up so that
it's<00:06:23.710> in<00:06:24.009> where<00:06:24.279> it's<00:06:24.430> supposed<00:06:24.490> to<00:06:24.729> be<00:06:24.819> here

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
it's in where it's supposed to be here

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.649 
it's in where it's supposed to be here
at<00:06:25.330> least<00:06:25.360> really<00:06:25.840> really<00:06:26.080> close<00:06:26.289> so<00:06:27.419> I've<00:06:28.419> got

00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:28.659 
at least really really close so I've got

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:36.119 
at least really really close so I've got
the<00:06:28.779> rear<00:06:28.930> end<00:06:28.990> on<00:06:30.449> and<00:06:33.300> I've<00:06:34.300> run<00:06:34.599> a<00:06:35.129> bungee
