00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.380
 [Music] 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.230
 we are going through 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:30.869
 so that when we start we are 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:34.320
 We are covering for what I want 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.840
 live with the waste heart so that 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.260
 I want life after what you've done to me 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.260
 fact 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:50.280
 for today because you were both the been 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:01:00.960
 fran that was expected because you played 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:01:03.659
 with me lives and I've brought the whole thing 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.390
 the world forget me the deceptions and 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:10.040
 bitterness but what you do not exist 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.040
 my soul endures 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:20.770
 [Applause] 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:26.170
 he has also recorded let me go to 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:28.360
 themes of the black we have known topics 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.619
 of atahualpa you know what you mean 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.290
 you know I want us to talk about 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.970
 chama mind that recorded church july 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.990
 adds a chamamé but recorded it with 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.909
 song rhythm 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.159
 I hope it's very popular to be direct 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:43.150
 they can ice the river to look at it as 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:46.420
 one day ago the last memory of touching 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.100
 in me that I had and that is an author of 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.039
 my water zone 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.810
 good as Spain that will leave me 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.869
 love your rhythms because I think 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.550
 also that I'm going to sing the way 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:02.229
 that is when we talk about music 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.850
 regional autochthonous of the country I think 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.380
 that's where you can get the 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.460
 fruit where the source is removed and from there 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.400
 is where you can best drink 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.220
 because if it's already there what it is 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:21.050
 true then you put a voice 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:24.380
 flamenco that sounds these drums 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.690
 Andean sounds not very Andean mud 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.300
 here not clear 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.100
 and it's another concept changed directly 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.580
 or an orange tree in bloom for example 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.040
 some dizzy things of those that according to 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.620
 I've been finding them and I've been getting to know them 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.450
 Exciting husband and husband 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.720
 getting drunk with happiness how it came 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.010
 this music the family particularly 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.420
 Look, I tell you the first time that I 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.090
 I got to Buenos Aires I arrived with 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.440
 black tears in the moon park and 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.950
 we came, I gave chucho valdés 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.340
 then they gave me the whole anthology 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.320
 of goyeneche of polish and gardel and 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.020
 julio sosa and flamenco purists 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.250
 they say you question me is that you know 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:14.220
 what happens since he lived with the 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:17.370
 flamencólicos flamencólogos in his day in 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.010
 his day they were benevolent and and to whom not 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.770
 he liked the tear disc finished 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.800
 liking him 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:28.250
 and those gentlemen who in their day could 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:32.120
 criticize or put the santón in the sky 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.770
 with tears in the end they had to give 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.740
 his arm to twist not for nothing because 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.050
 how to start sir egg valdés in 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.680
 music of the soul sounds of truth 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.690
 Black sounds usually say and that was 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.660
 that imprint and had that success only 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.640
 for two things and I'm going to say it well 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.590
 I see he said to me you sing as he edits 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.710
 not that you are that I play the piano 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.540
 like that Cuban that I am, they were clear and 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.270
 that was the chemistry and from there 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.940
 so much with my buddy yuming with jerzy 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.990
 that we already have 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:08.130
 years working on this I can tell you that 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:11.040
 every time we sing tears 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:14.010
 never comes out the same and even with the same 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:18.180
 repertoire never on a stage is to 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.630
 never like that because it's always 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:25.170
 you are already in soon is already that 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:27.690
 inspiration that if I'm sunny I leave 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.940
 of solidarity and only to him or if he stops 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.440
 finish him and he is already quickly and he 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:37.620
 yes isidro we are always in that 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.150
 perfect musical and harmonic communion that 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.270
 there must be 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.580
 and above all 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.420
 also what to do a group or make a 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.370
 acoustic group 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.390
 with four musicians in this case I have 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.860
 three 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:56.669
 but is that if it is filled with much more 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.669
 it is lost 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:05.409
 less is more less is more 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:07.750
 I love that album that you name tear 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:09.879
 black is here was a smash there 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.310
 somewhere and there is a particular topic 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:15.159
 I think people ask you a lot here 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.460
 fogs the creek like fire 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:17.460
 sane 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.590
 to 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:41.629
 shady anchorages where they will stop 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.660
 boats on the dock and forever where 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:48.980
 remains 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:51.500
 shadows that come out in the night of pain 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.870
 Castaway of the world 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.109
 who have lost their hearts 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.529
 [Music] 

00:05:57.109 --> 00:06:01.889
 remembering 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:08.520
 where people have a car 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:13.910
 for coalmen who love safe 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:16.710
 deaf cemetery of ships kamboni 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:21.650
 they sound however 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.650
 that the sea must depart 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:27.150
 He talks to me about the floors 

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:39.509
 They moored remember I keep waiting for you 

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:39.509
 and talk about soil 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:45.120
 of samur forever 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.810
 [Music] 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.810
 all right 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:59.760
 never again did I ever see her again 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:59.760
 more his love does not name me together 

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:07.210
 that moves me 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.210
 every day god 

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:16.210
 what happens when I found out that the creek 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:18.870
 really explanation what do you think of the 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.870
 issues that 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:24.780
 I drink from you, it excites a lot 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:26.169
 when he told me you have to sing the 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:30.310
 topic 

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:33.729
 the record was recorded three days before and they are 

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:35.020
 three days how good the inah in this case 

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:38.259
 a while longer with us because we want 

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:40.240
 keep knowing you can be good 

00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:42.400
 this the truth that with this closure 

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.319
 we can go quietly after a cut 

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.360
 and we're going to continue talking with Diego the 

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:48.189
 Cigala is in his musicians also here 

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.020
 we are prepared for a grand finale 

00:07:48.189 --> 00:07:51.550
 you do not move from the screen of the 

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.810
 public television for a little while 

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.810
 much drier to start 

00:07:54.940 --> 00:08:01.250
 [Applause]
