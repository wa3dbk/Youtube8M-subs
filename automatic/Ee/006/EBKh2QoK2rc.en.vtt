00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:15.930
 and well hello to all this hello to all 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.670
 these weeks 09 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.100
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.320
 new video on slender the rivals I 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.350
 am in the company of r4 n evokes that it 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:32.090
 was going so today we're going to you 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:34.710
 present an easter egg on the vel jpeg 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:39.949
 for the purpose of the video we will 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:44.659
 so use a cheat code we raise the 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.659
 sail to his step 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:57.920
 that's ok ok I'll let you do a 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:02.510
 pleasure to comment on this video 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:05.350
 so when we go out of this house there 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.810
 must see on our left pebbles 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.400
 and he leaves the shadows but that's 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.280
 really important to really get out 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.920
 of this love this is where 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.050
 so good it's not more complicated than that 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.740
 in fact we must go along the stones on 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.670
 the on our left must not go must 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.610
 not go very very fast 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.350
 you really have to slowly 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.200
 a tactic also that allows to know 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.910
 if we are there if we will get there she 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.490
 goes up it's if we go through the 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:41.990
 pebble so look a little to the right 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.369
 yeah so beautiful good enough here we go 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.360
 happen because we looked through 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.070
 the pebble the ear arrive good that 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:57.190
 it's cool that we did not arrive from the first 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:02:00.640
 blow here rather nice here nickel so 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.619
 to dream at the place of 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.549
 once the myth chouvalidzé but that's it 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.989
 So walking along the rocks along 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:15.080
 the pebbles finally not too far away 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:17.750
 pebbles anyway me no 7 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.220
 so here's once rice and the cleach 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.950
 realized so you find a place 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.330
 of the map you are pretty quiet 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.800
 free to do what you want 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.340
 but you're not going too far 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.950
 get away 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.450
 because otherwise you go you go 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.910
 die the smell will you catch 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.980
 directly so here I had to 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.599
 not pass or people so it takes 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:43.930
 walk along the pebbles here we go 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:43.930
 the pebble here we must follow nickel 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:50.120
 the purpose of this video is for 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.150
 show a little how to get out of the 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.319
 map and then history and this terrain 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.209
 Clement baker must not return 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.049
 in so first building so that 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.880
 it's a point of appearance I am 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.890
 here it is not necessary to appear here so 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.190
 there we must continue we see a small 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.720
 house in the background first we must continue 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.160
 go to the house 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.850
 So here we go away a little bit 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.440
 of the map but it is enough so here is 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.139
 so arrived home will still do 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.950
 langer we eat our left 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:23.950
 exactly 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:36.030
 here is can see yet another time 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:39.290
 our positions an appearance and no 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.690
 frankly I still hurt not like a game 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.340
 this time so here we go 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.670
 very very good but here on the left 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:53.370
 again he can see a tour 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:55.260
 turn then it's nice to see but hey 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.760
 rather buggy was here rather vague and 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.120
 so you'll see we can go to 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.420
 through 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.600
 here and two teeth dance auditions 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.030
 nice enough here is dallas name since 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.470
 there are lots of cats everywhere so here we go 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:11.100
 the soil of the tower and textures and 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.460
 cats it's pretty weird but hey it's 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.010
 like that 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:17.280
 so here we were surprised a hole at that 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.840
 that's how powerful it is 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.610
 so after that we can fill you ace 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:26.090
 on his about me on what makes one think of 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.090
 superman 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.140
 that's exactly 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.740
 so here is the cat there is little and weird 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:38.850
 but me yes it's cute here are the 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:41.340
 Minions so you laugh it's we do not 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.140
 do not know what's the point 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.390
 it's weird that's how it's 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.700
 sas and here you go to go throw 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.100
 a look here is good after 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.750
 even when you show it again you can see that 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.790
 what does it do if we go too far 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.040
 so here I am going to send in the aude 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:05:00.390
 where you are I do not know if you see 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.260
 there is a species of the class has there is the 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.760
 music of this land 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.009
 we will slip into the mode all 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.900
 gently hello pebbles 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:09.039
 it is not rather not stones give way 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.960
 in the long run yes 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:13.930
 So here we are at the bottom of the water so 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:17.020
 that's it's me guèye year aurelio ya 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:20.999
 it gives me somewhere for you 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:23.649
 show them also not returning to anything 

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:25.930
 we will show you what makes us nothing 

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:28.210
 in fact finally outside the map 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:33.490
 we see it very closely we can go 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:36.789
 get very close but I am is 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:43.089
 sure will and I believe they have 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:44.529
 disappeared I came here and therefore there 

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:47.439
 apparently normally he should already 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:48.339
 kill us a little bit but good 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:50.469
 here 

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:54.089
 he's here he's doing us nothing and is 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:56.830
 quiet it is well approached already 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:58.089
 do not have time in my pocket 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.309
 so you see as if we are moving away a 

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:01.389
 little too much of my card so if you do not 

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:03.939
 especially in the water but if you 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:09.300
 you 're going away here you're going to have a 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:13.469
 message to say that and you will see 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:17.060
 so that's all for this video 

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:18.990

 swore after presenting the log 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:10.280
 20h besson on the map the eight page 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:11.600
 so you have to get here as long as 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.310
 you'll know if it's really good 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.949

 shit so here to continue for 

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:28.090
 go to the cities rules it takes 

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:31.610
 follow the rocks there to the left 

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:34.789
 right is so it's to the left or 

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:41.560
 the right have not been right wanted 

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:43.729
 go to a crazy and to the left I say 

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.530
 so you have to go along the pebbles 

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:47.770
 left but the pebbles the right boom 

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.770
 too long
