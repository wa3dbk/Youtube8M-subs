over here so you're going to pop the
housing<00:00:42.899> off<00:00:43.399> before<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.430> do<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.940> just<00:00:45.090> want

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
housing off before I do that I just want

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.450 
housing off before I do that I just want
to<00:00:45.270> make<00:00:45.360> sure<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.750> disconnect<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.260> battery<00:00:46.559> so

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
to make sure I disconnect the battery so

00:00:47.460 --> 00:01:02.630 
to make sure I disconnect the battery so
no<00:00:48.120> shortage<00:00:48.510> happens<00:01:01.010> alright<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.219> just<00:01:02.250> for

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
no shortage happens alright so just for

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.840 
no shortage happens alright so just for
viewing<00:01:02.789> purposes<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.539> have<00:01:04.110> attached<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.640> two

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
viewing purposes I have attached the two

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:15.230 
viewing purposes I have attached the two
wires<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.520> actual<00:01:08.520> bulb<00:01:09.150> housing<00:01:13.790> so<00:01:14.790> I've

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
wires to the actual bulb housing so I've

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.539 
wires to the actual bulb housing so I've
wrapped<00:01:15.600> around<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.990> wire<00:01:16.250> around<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
wrapped around the wire around the

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.499 
wrapped around the wire around the
electrodes<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:19.130> the<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> housing<00:01:21.360> and

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
electrodes of the of the housing and

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.920 
electrodes of the of the housing and
then<00:01:22.470> what<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.460> have<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.820> actually<00:01:23.970> do<00:01:24.390> to

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
then what you have to actually do to

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.960 
then what you have to actually do to
create<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.409> solid<00:01:25.650> connection<00:01:25.979> without<00:01:26.820> any

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
create a solid connection without any

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.429 
create a solid connection without any
sort<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.299> problems<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.750> splice<00:01:27.990> into<00:01:28.229> these

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
sort of problems is splice into these

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.679 
sort of problems is splice into these
two<00:01:28.650> wires<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.159> then<00:01:30.030> just<00:01:30.180> take<00:01:30.329> any<00:01:30.479> random

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
two wires and then just take any random

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.800 
two wires and then just take any random
wire<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.290> just<00:01:31.619> slice<00:01:32.460> into<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.759> that's<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
wire and just slice into it that's the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.310 
wire and just slice into it that's the
best<00:01:33.960> way<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.110> do<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:35.840> let's<00:01:36.840> simply<00:01:37.110> what<00:01:37.259> I'm

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
best way to do it let's simply what I'm

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.770 
best way to do it let's simply what I'm
doing<00:01:37.560> for<00:01:37.680> viewing<00:01:37.860> purposes<00:01:38.100> is

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
doing for viewing purposes is

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.960 
doing for viewing purposes is
temporarily<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:40.100> attaching<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.220> housing

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
temporarily just attaching this housing

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.660 
temporarily just attaching this housing
like<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.790> you<00:01:44.790> will<00:01:44.939> need<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.119> drill<00:01:45.560> with<00:01:46.560> the

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
like this you will need a drill with the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:54.080 
like this you will need a drill with the
moderately<00:01:47.670> sized<00:01:47.880> drill<00:01:48.119> bit

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.640 

so<00:01:55.090> what<00:01:55.210> I'll<00:01:55.300> be<00:01:55.420> doing<00:01:55.540> I'll<00:01:56.290> be<00:01:56.410> drilling

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
so what I'll be doing I'll be drilling

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.250 
so what I'll be doing I'll be drilling
right<00:01:56.860> into<00:01:57.070> here<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:58.540> get<00:01:58.720> access<00:01:58.900> to<00:01:59.080> those

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
right into here to get access to those

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.540 
right into here to get access to those
wires<00:01:59.500> so<00:01:59.650> I'm<00:01:59.710> gonna<00:01:59.830> do<00:01:59.980> a<00:02:00.010> little<00:02:00.190> higher<00:02:00.370> up

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
wires so I'm gonna do a little higher up

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:11.340 
wires so I'm gonna do a little higher up
so<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.820> wires<00:02:01.030> are<00:02:01.750> not<00:02:01.840> noticeable<00:02:10.350> decent

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
so the wires are not noticeable decent

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:52.850 
so the wires are not noticeable decent
sized<00:02:11.500> hole<00:02:13.500> clean<00:02:14.500> up<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.770> hole

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.320 

now<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:53.920> crimp<00:02:54.460> these<00:02:54.640> wires<00:02:54.910> together<00:02:55.090> and

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
now you crimp these wires together and

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.130 
now you crimp these wires together and
you<00:02:56.320> tuck<00:02:56.530> this<00:02:56.650> away<00:02:56.770> knee<00:02:57.570> all<00:02:58.570> right<00:02:58.870> so<00:02:59.110> I

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
you tuck this away knee all right so I

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.590 
you tuck this away knee all right so I
went<00:02:59.410> ahead<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.620> crimped<00:03:00.150> these<00:03:01.150> two<00:03:01.390> wires

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
went ahead and crimped these two wires

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.850 
went ahead and crimped these two wires
together

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.580 

now<00:03:05.860> remove<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.450> 3m<00:03:07.450> tape<00:03:07.600> on<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.810> back<00:03:07.990> and

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
now remove the 3m tape on the back and

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.830 
now remove the 3m tape on the back and
stick<00:03:08.830> it<00:03:08.950> here<00:03:09.000> money<00:03:12.090> up<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.270> way<00:03:13.360> nice<00:03:13.570> neat

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
stick it here money up the way nice neat

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.900 
stick it here money up the way nice neat
the<00:03:14.770> only<00:03:15.040> thing<00:03:15.130> I<00:03:15.220> wasn't<00:03:15.370> able<00:03:15.520> to<00:03:15.640> do<00:03:15.760> was

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
the only thing I wasn't able to do was

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.290 
the only thing I wasn't able to do was
yet<00:03:16.840> was<00:03:17.290> hide<00:03:17.800> the<00:03:17.950> wires<00:03:18.130> away<00:03:18.340> so<00:03:19.090> I'm<00:03:19.150> gonna

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
yet was hide the wires away so I'm gonna

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.810 
yet was hide the wires away so I'm gonna
think<00:03:19.840> of<00:03:19.990> something<00:03:20.350> to<00:03:20.410> do<00:03:20.530> to<00:03:21.340> hide<00:03:21.520> them<00:03:21.700> or

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
think of something to do to hide them or

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:30.170 
think of something to do to hide them or
something<00:03:22.090> like<00:03:22.150> that

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.239
