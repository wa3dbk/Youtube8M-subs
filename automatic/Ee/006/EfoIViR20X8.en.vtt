 despite the fact that I'm on vacation 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:17.910
 I did a training and there I am in 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.770

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.550
 hall before a meal I hope 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.579
 because I spent a lot of money 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.800

 novelties that are also part of the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.809
 up there that I discovered during my 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.870
 training at s is the academy so 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.360
 the makeup academy so for 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:57.300
 come back to makeup you realized this 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.190
 tutorial here today what does that look like 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.170
 the eyes 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.300
 so I did something quite 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.870
 light over the entire eyelid and 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.570
 fixed 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.450
 I dig a little my eyelid 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.180
 as you see here with a little one 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.070
 lighthouse of the year quest 3 then I 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.920
 used the pallet track 2 you go 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.070
 see this way and I colored my ras 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.040
 of lower lashes and I made a big 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.479
 line of liner with a liner I love 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.640
 I'll show you that in the video there 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.229
 you will talk about it in my favorites of 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.430
 month it's really a killing this 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.640
 thing there I did not know absolutely 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.290
 I do not know what you think 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.009
 but I love I made a fresh complexion 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.860
 with course at benefit ista 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.110
 and the bronze herbach manama and a red 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.960
 Lip these minutes in makeup 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.880
 for ever 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.340
 so all that with a small break 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.280
 simple enough which you did a tutorial 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.799
 last summer so the combo I find that 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.960
 pretty cool the makeup is very 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.329
 easy to perform and very fast 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.930
 I leave you with the explanations of 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.299
 so I've already done my time 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.149
 put my foundation and my loose powder 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.459
 from make up for ever in the hd range 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.010
 so now I'm applying I'm applying 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.890
 hamon 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.709
 a friend from mac is the plane tree 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.230
 painter reads then I want to take 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.650
 my is only 3 and I take the far 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.409
 north hours so it's a superb 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.000
 pharma pts a little violated turn that 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:32.049
 I apply in my eyelid 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.299
 in order to draw it the crucible and 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.299
 to intensify that part of my eye 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.920
 then I come to take advice pallet 2 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.920
 and I take the lighthouse dope 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.599
 it seems to me yes that's fine so I 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.480
 applied on my eyelid 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:55.450
 city ​​at least what has not been touched 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.680
 by the lighthouse an honor and I have 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.989
 also under an eyebrow 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.349
 then I reapplied a little farner 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.030
 with always the same brush I take 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.040
 then always vispa the help of 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.079
 the toxic lighthouse I'm applying 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.040
 really in touch of light on my 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:17.260
 eyelid and after a nice pencil 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.169
 from urban chic and so those 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.879
 reached lost so this is a rape is a 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:24.040
 little dice to see it was worth a little since the 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.739
 purple blue lighthouse that I'm going to put 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:31.000
 just after so that's a rape is 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:34.209
 really flashy so i would say my real 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.190
 Hollow friends lower and higher and 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:44.019
 so I take the super lighthouse beast trio 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:46.150
 of the two pallet screw so this is a 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.870
 color I will not be parents to write in 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.359
 purple blue finally a blue purple that 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.870
 depends on the perception of everyone in 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:57.400
 done if we see bluer or if we see 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.560
 more milk I would say that in purple 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.199
 with blue reflections then I come 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.739
 take my pro check so it's a 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:07.540
 eiffel liner in Paris so it's 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.549
 something is a discovery 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.930
 and it's really one of my favorites 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.940
 month I 'll talk about it again in a 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.970
 next video it's a beacon 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.549
 apply with water and a brush and 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.930
 it really makes it really 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.340
 a lot of things and as you go 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.360
 to see it is very very easy 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.159
 Application 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.500
 you just have to wet a little 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:31.090
 your brush to take a little bit of 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:33.969
 dark matter actually and then you 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.960
 do what you want and it's 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:37.539
 very very black 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.030
 it applies but great well finally 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.650
 it's really great I'm really 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.010
 super happy to have discovered these 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.010
 products 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.940
 then I apply a little bit of 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.510
 mascara to find missiles 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.990
 and create already 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.970
 a fairly stable material to pose 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:23.610
 my little fossils that you will see 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:25.560
 just after that so I come to take but 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.180
 also individual so that's the 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.910
 mark and they had it's a mark 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.500
 you can find at claire's 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:34.110
 at Monoprix brand fossils 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.630
 very well known and therefore jappix with maccoll 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:40.530
 from the top nkam can actually see it's 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:46.790
 in small tufts of 4.5 possible so 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:51.660
 I apply fossil small tufts 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:56.430
 on my inner corner and then three 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:59.550
 other August 2 or 3 three more on everything 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.920
 the rest of death does it actually allow this 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.750
 to flesh out your look to give a little 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.970
 more volume and puts it all really 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.340
 naturally 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:11.520
 then I take my perfume montbron 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:14.570
 hours earlier bamana of the ball so 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.730
 in really top brothers 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.350
 who is who and not too dark for me 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.640
 and not too clearly it helps to 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.100
 to really do something natural 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:27.080
 to warm the complexion really so 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:30.480
 discreet is quite sophisticated I will go 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.790
 so I apply that with my brush cima 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.000
 so a really great brush made for 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.000
 it 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.880
 for those who would ask themselves 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:52.000
 question the cimade brush cef 25 it's 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:54.610

 take my body to the ista home 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.830
 benefit so at a really blush 

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:02.410
 opt for the season I would say with 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.789

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.680

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.370
 at make up for ever reaching 30 and 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.729
