00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
and if you're really bad at reeling in

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.039 
and if you're really bad at reeling in
the<00:01:56.460> rod<00:01:56.700> for<00:01:57.000> whatever<00:01:57.180> reason<00:01:57.600> or<00:01:57.810> reeling

the rod for whatever reason or reeling

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.380 
the rod for whatever reason or reeling
in<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.170> fishing<00:01:58.500> pole<00:01:58.710> what<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.640> like<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.030> do<00:02:00.180> is

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
in the fishing pole what I like to do is

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.179 
in the fishing pole what I like to do is
it's<00:02:00.659> easier<00:02:00.930> for<00:02:00.960> me<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.200> close<00:02:01.439> my<00:02:01.680> eyes<00:02:01.890> and

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
it's easier for me to close my eyes and

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.620 
it's easier for me to close my eyes and
listen<00:02:02.430> for<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.640> sound<00:02:02.969> because<00:02:03.420> there's<00:02:03.570> a

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
listen for the sound because there's a

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.389 
listen for the sound because there's a
very<00:02:03.869> short<00:02:04.020> amount<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.619> time<00:02:04.680> for<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.310> to

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
very short amount of time for you to

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.130 
very short amount of time for you to
push<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.790> button<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.479> reel<00:02:06.630> in<00:02:06.780> your<00:02:06.810> catch
