00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 say rock people go to the same 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:09.330
 test arrived at her turn 7970 already raps 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.769
 delicious edition here is well came the plate 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.099
 is so good so good that it comes with a 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.859
 No, she likes to put hot on the 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.150
 cover did not serve the series is a strategy 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.730
 Of marketing 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.109
 I think this page and it's not me 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.939
 I think that there are more manufacturers that 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.420
 doing is a common strategy in the 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.880
 the vision is to use a hot you go in 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.460
 Expectation that is good, together, is for 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.500
 gamer need same is not back 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.969
 tomorrow she comes back tomorrow, right? 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.920
 Let's continue talking, I'm not going. 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.670
 keep talking electric head look 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.040
 he just needs to lift his head and go 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.050
 modest 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.780
 I can not say much, guys. 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.199
 this 3970 is so although more powerful 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.680
 md post that will probably be 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:01:00.359
 taken by law 9 296 I understand that the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.530
 will be taken and not another in the 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.040
 throne 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.490
 then 9 119 x soon enough to take the 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.840
 place there on the hd 6970 he's rolling 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.400
 now here at bs-4 average 150 frames per 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.320
 second and are finding fruit that is 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.950
 finishing recording is totally 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:25.590
 stabilized here at 50 fps also at one 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:28.829
 result similar to the 672 1970 and is 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.520
 almost a 675 on livestock which is a 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.729
 slightly less than 671 slightly lower 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:41.820
 at 680 she's there in the middle is in the middle 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:44.850
 of the way is to learn to look, man, it's okay 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.380
 It is remembering that there is a 6970 one plate was 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.649
 released in the middle of last year she was 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.360
 launched in June 2012 and is a plaque 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.500
 that actually came to combat gtx 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.780
 580 it is and I thing she got 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.540
 to successfully do in the era an average of 30 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.960
 percent faster than that at 580 and 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.400
 then see 680 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.200
 nvidia and then yes it is not 7970 680 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.990
 faster than the 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.770
 morning in most games than it is 79 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.480
 70 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.480
 but this of course depends a lot on the game in 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.090
 question then is the year we battlefield 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.280
 3 he knows that nvidia boards 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.050
 It tends to get a little better, right? 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.780
 in other games such as the yen 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.110
 worst hitman the boards heh region 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.090
 usually it's even better fps nÃ© 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.720
 so it depends a lot on the game that you go 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.760
 running a friend might be better or a 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.840
 nvidia in the case of beto after four 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.690
 is seeing results 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:45.160
 at first is at least now appeared 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.600
 leave with the 670 but it's a sign that goes 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.700
 depend heavily on the game he expects 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.769
 a little bit soon in the 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.120
 The truth is we do not get out of roxy. 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.250
 in comparison with all games for 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.930
 you can compare in all 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.550
 possible situations and choose what is 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.760
 better pro game you prefer 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:08.010
 one thing is possible that this issue of 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:10.840
 optimization amd nvidia card rho 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.150
 It makes much difference if it think 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.829
 people have this doubt if it really is 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.019
 that happens in two situations is that 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.459
 who used the game's developer works 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.530
 together with the manufacturer of the video card 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.459
 to develop a game that spins better 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.230
 huh 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.370
 but this does not always reflect 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.260
 best results for that 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.340
 specific manufacturer because it happens 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.019
 that the architecture of the boards are 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.090
 totally different, right? 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.709
 for example the amd boards have very 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.180
 more in processes that are the 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.400
 parallel processors on the 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.480
 video than nvidia boards but 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.310
 This does not mean that they are more 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.540
 then the structure of the plates 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.010
 completely changes 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.079
 so it's normal for you to have 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.660
 a given game the most performance 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.670
 high because the game uses the card 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.670
 different ways to it is because 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.250
 ps3 had this issue of MPB as has the 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.250
 f4 now but the result with an nvidia 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.630
 Do not leave anything like that and we are 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.060
 seeing in the tests that we are 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.549
 making you drink 4 is very much like 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.010
 f3 in the sense that the plates of the 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.720
 nvidia are getting better, right? 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.870
 all the tests we've done until 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.150
 now nvidia boards are from models 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.400
 compatible them sex model 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.079
 competing among themselves the doors me 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.900
 delivering happier per second without 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.970
 talk about the practicality that nvidia 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.710
 It's over, it will seem like everything is over 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.840
 simple that nvidia we felt 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.669
 in this brain in the drivers so the 10 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.280
 they seem to be more functional 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.870
 fast and they no less problems right 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.949
 to have an idea he had to format 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.500
 hd several times to get 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.780
 install driver give 13 10 beta 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.340
 netherlands the problem to get 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.680
 install without problem but we had 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.050
 a number of problems for those already 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.660
 this same stressor can make the 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.669
 md unpack and as well the drivers 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.260
 They gave a funny son, it 's true. 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.090
 this is it is a characteristic medium 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.979
 known must have the development of 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.789
 drivers is a bit slower a bit 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:05:00.220
 more unsolved than those of nvidia 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:02.199
 The more you trigger a question, the 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.940
 complicated because it really has 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:06.310
 to be placed on the scale is the cost 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.840
 benefit of the board if it really goes 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.419
 fulfill what you are looking for 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.490
 The game you are looking for 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.900
 all in the balance and remembering more 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.550
 since it has new demand line 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.099
 Arriving there, it's good to keep an eye, is not it? 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.660
 but that's a positive sign because 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.729
 may indicate a fall in prices of the 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.020
 my aunt and make a purchase situation 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:24.580
 Nice to you, you 're looking for a 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.300
 strong plate to rotate 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.909
 so that's right trout is these averages of 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.570
 50 frames hahnemann cool at the end of 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:37.270
 video now you will see our test 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:39.460
 with flex that tse the defeat so the 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:43.830
 Thanks, thanks so we can 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:46.240
 see if we can have a situation 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.449
 really exempt, because we 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.280
 without taking any frame for recording and 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:54.789
 in the end you see the minimum average 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.080
 maximum and also on the site of rock always 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.599
 comparative with the other 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.979
 video cards in this medium for you 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:02.530
 have an idea how the board 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:04.780
 f4 blood compared to the others 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:08.050
 this is it people subscribe to the channel 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:10.120
 that little joy that will make new 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.970
 friends go there on site go to a site 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.229
 to compare the boards has always seen such 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.889
 Login to the forum to ask your questions 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:19.919
 is also selling to participate there 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:22.229
 was also leaving opinions and opinions 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:26.490
 all the possible dreams there is that there 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:31.229
 people are staying there with Eric and his 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:36.680
 beauty in the background a hug out exemption 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:36.680
 beauty and good sound
