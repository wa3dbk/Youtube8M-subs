because<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.149> looks<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:09.420> good<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.020> do

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
because it looks so good that you do

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.229 
because it looks so good that you do
have<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.619> have<00:02:10.649> him<00:02:10.979> kind<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.640> looking<00:02:12.030> at<00:02:12.120> the

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
have to have him kind of looking at the

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:12.760 
have to have him kind of looking at the
ground

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
ground

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.880 
ground
or<00:02:13.030> having<00:02:14.030> his<00:02:14.240> arms<00:02:14.900> hands<00:02:15.560> sticking

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
or having his arms hands sticking

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.490 
or having his arms hands sticking
straight<00:02:16.280> out<00:02:16.460> to<00:02:16.640> balance<00:02:17.060> and<00:02:17.360> it's<00:02:18.170> just<00:02:18.380> a

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
straight out to balance and it's just a

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.700 
straight out to balance and it's just a
lot<00:02:18.800> of<00:02:18.830> weight<00:02:19.220> up<00:02:19.490> top<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:21.050> ball<00:02:21.260> joints

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
lot of weight up top and the ball joints

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.790 
lot of weight up top and the ball joints
here<00:02:22.100> in<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.520> hips<00:02:22.790> are<00:02:23.030> very<00:02:23.450> loose

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
here in the hips are very loose

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.560 
here in the hips are very loose
unfortunately<00:02:24.800> but<00:02:25.490> that's<00:02:25.940> not<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.270> say<00:02:26.300> it's

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
unfortunately but that's not to say it's

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.710 
unfortunately but that's not to say it's
a<00:02:26.630> bad<00:02:26.870> figure<00:02:27.760> transformation<00:02:28.760> is<00:02:28.940> pretty

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
a bad figure transformation is pretty

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.530 
a bad figure transformation is pretty
simple<00:02:30.170> but<00:02:30.320> neat<00:02:30.710> so<00:02:31.670> we'll<00:02:31.970> start<00:02:32.210> off<00:02:32.330> by

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
simple but neat so we'll start off by

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.510 
simple but neat so we'll start off by
taking<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:33.170> wings<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:33.800> folding<00:02:34.160> them<00:02:34.280> down

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
taking the wings and folding them down

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.370 
taking the wings and folding them down
taking<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.150> rear<00:02:35.360> of<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.570> vehicle<00:02:35.930> and

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
taking the rear of the vehicle and

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.320 
taking the rear of the vehicle and
folding<00:02:36.770> it<00:02:36.890> down<00:02:36.920> that<00:02:37.790> will<00:02:37.940> allow<00:02:38.120> us<00:02:38.150> to

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
folding it down that will allow us to

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.750 
folding it down that will allow us to
fold<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.810> head<00:02:39.050> back<00:02:39.410> up<00:02:39.680> into<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.400> back<00:02:40.550> of

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
fold the head back up into the back of

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.320 
fold the head back up into the back of
the<00:02:40.850> figure<00:02:41.200> then<00:02:42.200> take<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.800> arms<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:43.460> fold

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
the figure then take the arms and fold

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.000 
the figure then take the arms and fold
them<00:02:44.540> up<00:02:44.690> to<00:02:44.990> where<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.230> head<00:02:45.440> was<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:45.980> just

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
them up to where the head was and just

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.800 
them up to where the head was and just
attach<00:02:46.880> them<00:02:47.350> like<00:02:48.350> so<00:02:49.100> and<00:02:49.280> then<00:02:50.240> that<00:02:50.450> double

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
attach them like so and then that double

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.080 
attach them like so and then that double
hinge<00:02:51.080> that<00:02:51.230> we<00:02:51.470> mentioned<00:02:51.950> is<00:02:52.070> where<00:02:52.280> comes

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
hinge that we mentioned is where comes

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.670 
hinge that we mentioned is where comes
into<00:02:53.360> play<00:02:53.510> in<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.720> transformation<00:02:54.470> so

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
into play in the transformation so

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.430 
into play in the transformation so
folded<00:02:55.160> into<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:56.090> chest<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:56.630> then<00:02:56.840> fold<00:02:57.230> it

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
folded into the chest and then fold it

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.550 
folded into the chest and then fold it
up<00:02:57.620> and<00:02:58.040> over<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.970> back<00:02:59.180> and<00:02:59.930> that<00:03:00.080> will<00:03:00.230> peg

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
up and over the back and that will peg

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.110 
up and over the back and that will peg
into<00:03:01.190> place<00:03:01.780> right<00:03:02.780> there<00:03:03.910> be<00:03:04.910> up<00:03:05.030> in<00:03:05.150> a<00:03:05.240> second

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
into place right there be up in a second

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.090 
into place right there be up in a second
so<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.450> last<00:03:08.600> thing<00:03:08.840> we're<00:03:08.960> gonna<00:03:09.020> do<00:03:09.260> is<00:03:09.590> fold

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
so the last thing we're gonna do is fold

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.950 
so the last thing we're gonna do is fold
the<00:03:10.520> rear<00:03:10.820> of<00:03:10.850> the<00:03:11.060> vehicle<00:03:11.150> down<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.870> then

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
the rear of the vehicle down and then

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.000 
the rear of the vehicle down and then
take<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.350> legs<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:13.550> fold<00:03:13.820> them<00:03:14.030> up<00:03:14.240> and<00:03:15.020> pick

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
take the legs and fold them up and pick

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.280 
take the legs and fold them up and pick
them<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.670> bottom<00:03:17.420> of<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.570> feet<00:03:17.750> into<00:03:18.020> these

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
them the bottom of the feet into these

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.860 
them the bottom of the feet into these
red<00:03:18.590> pegs<00:03:18.890> now<00:03:19.190> why<00:03:19.550> these<00:03:19.850> pegs<00:03:20.120> are<00:03:20.360> red<00:03:20.600> I

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
red pegs now why these pegs are red I

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.580 
red pegs now why these pegs are red I
have<00:03:21.020> no<00:03:21.530> idea<00:03:22.540> but<00:03:23.540> you<00:03:23.990> just<00:03:24.200> pick<00:03:24.350> them<00:03:24.440> in

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
have no idea but you just pick them in

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.820 
have no idea but you just pick them in
there<00:03:24.770> and<00:03:25.130> then<00:03:25.370> fold<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:25.820> wings<00:03:26.000> down<00:03:26.150> and

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
there and then fold the wings down and

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.230 
there and then fold the wings down and
here<00:03:27.830> we<00:03:28.100> go<00:03:28.930> and<00:03:30.100> we<00:03:31.100> can<00:03:31.280> attach<00:03:31.580> the<00:03:31.610> gun

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
here we go and we can attach the gun

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.540 
here we go and we can attach the gun
that's<00:03:32.510> life<00:03:32.780> are<00:03:33.080> the<00:03:33.230> weapons<00:03:33.650> like<00:03:34.010> this<00:03:34.280> I

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
that's life are the weapons like this I

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.340 
that's life are the weapons like this I
don't<00:03:35.090> want<00:03:35.270> to<00:03:35.330> call<00:03:35.510> them<00:03:35.570> guns<00:03:35.870> because<00:03:36.230> I'm

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
don't want to call them guns because I'm

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.570 
don't want to call them guns because I'm
not<00:03:36.440> sure<00:03:36.800> but<00:03:37.160> the<00:03:37.730> weapons<00:03:38.090> there<00:03:38.959> we<00:03:39.020> go

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
not sure but the weapons there we go

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.100 
not sure but the weapons there we go
unfortunately<00:03:40.580> there<00:03:40.730> is<00:03:40.850> not<00:03:41.090> another<00:03:41.540> peg

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
unfortunately there is not another peg

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.040 
unfortunately there is not another peg
anywhere<00:03:42.860> for<00:03:43.760> another<00:03:44.270> weapon<00:03:44.480> to<00:03:44.720> be<00:03:44.840> picked

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
anywhere for another weapon to be picked

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.140 
anywhere for another weapon to be picked
in<00:03:45.230> but<00:03:45.740> overall<00:03:45.830> I<00:03:46.220> like<00:03:46.459> the<00:03:46.610> vehicle<00:03:47.000> mode<00:03:47.120> I

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
in but overall I like the vehicle mode I

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.760 
in but overall I like the vehicle mode I
think<00:03:47.240> the<00:03:47.450> vehicle<00:03:47.750> mode<00:03:47.870> looks<00:03:48.080> really<00:03:48.590> good

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
think the vehicle mode looks really good

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.520 
think the vehicle mode looks really good
it<00:03:49.550> it<00:03:50.150> definitely<00:03:50.480> looks<00:03:51.080> cool<00:03:51.350> it's

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
it it definitely looks cool it's

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.410 
it it definitely looks cool it's
definitely<00:03:51.920> Starscream<00:03:52.370> having<00:03:53.000> the<00:03:53.120> feet

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
definitely Starscream having the feet

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.850 
definitely Starscream having the feet
sticking<00:03:53.840> up<00:03:54.080> out<00:03:54.260> of<00:03:54.380> the<00:03:54.440> middle<00:03:54.650> of<00:03:54.770> the

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
sticking up out of the middle of the

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.280 
sticking up out of the middle of the
fuselage<00:03:55.310> is<00:03:55.580> a<00:03:55.640> little<00:03:56.090> weird<00:03:56.390> but<00:03:56.660> if<00:03:57.140> you

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
fuselage is a little weird but if you

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.260 
fuselage is a little weird but if you
fold<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.740> feet<00:03:57.920> in<00:03:58.100> like<00:03:58.340> that<00:03:58.550> that<00:03:58.940> kind<00:03:59.209> of

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
fold the feet in like that that kind of

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.820 
fold the feet in like that that kind of
mitigates<00:03:59.720> it<00:03:59.900> a<00:03:59.959> little<00:04:00.140> bit<00:04:00.350> and<00:04:00.560> it<00:04:00.680> does

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
mitigates it a little bit and it does

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.070 
mitigates it a little bit and it does
look<00:04:01.040> a<00:04:01.130> little<00:04:01.220> sleeker<00:04:01.580> so<00:04:02.270> that's<00:04:02.720> not<00:04:02.930> too

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
look a little sleeker so that's not too
