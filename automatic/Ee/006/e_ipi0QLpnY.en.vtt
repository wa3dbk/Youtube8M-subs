00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:13.639
 hello today I prepare simple pretzels 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.580
 which are good on all occasions 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:28.050
 these are the ingredients then of the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:32.550
 anchovies in oil and peppers yuste in 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:37.050
 bittersweet possibly enough pieces 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:41.539
 large so as to be able to cut and then 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.539
 of puff pastry if possible 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:44.539
 rectangular 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.100
 Let's start Italian new step in three 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.100
 set off 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:12.020
 we cut the peppers more or less in parts 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:12.020
 equal and then prepare the puff pastry 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.400
 and we cut it that way 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:37.930
 we begin to prepare the pretzels 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.930
 let's start with viruses 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:47.240
 we collect in this way from one 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:54.070
 wider part 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:59.620
 we lean ariosto and then roll it up 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.620
 we do not fill with peppers 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.480
 take another sheet of pasta 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.480
 puff pastry 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:33.370
 let's talk about the rectangles if possible 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.370
 all the same like that 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.840
 we begin to fill the puff pastry 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.989
 with anchovies 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:55.800
 in this way we place an anise above 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:58.550
 the puff pastry and then roll it up into 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.550
 this way 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:20.340
 arrange the pretzels on a baking sheet and if 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:24.930
 if you like parmesan you can 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:28.670
 sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over the ones on 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.670
 pretzels with anchovies 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:51.580
 then we want to bake at 180 degrees for 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:54.610
 10 minutes and here is just the pretzels 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.980
 baked the pretzels with anchovies 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.730
 you have to remove it slightly before 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.630
 baked good appetite 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.630
