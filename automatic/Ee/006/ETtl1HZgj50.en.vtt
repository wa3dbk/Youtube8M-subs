00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
you what was in this box before I

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.070 
you what was in this box before I
thought<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.609> just<00:00:23.820> cut<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.300> open<00:00:24.390> right<00:00:24.570> now<00:00:24.750> and

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
thought I just cut it open right now and

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.750 
thought I just cut it open right now and
so<00:00:25.289> like<00:00:25.439> I've<00:00:25.590> said<00:00:25.769> before<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:26.250> box<00:00:26.550> is

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
so like I've said before this box is

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.310 
so like I've said before this box is
pretty<00:00:26.789> unique<00:00:27.300> for<00:00:27.689> like<00:00:27.779> subscription

glass it's actually really light i used

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.219 
glass it's actually really light i used
to<00:01:50.189> have<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> plastic<00:01:50.670> double-walled<00:01:51.450> clear

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229

mug and it was just about as light as
this<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.990> thought<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.259> was<00:01:55.380> going<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.590> be<00:01:55.649> a

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
this I thought this was going to be a

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.550 
this I thought this was going to be a
lot<00:01:55.860> heavier<00:01:55.950> but<00:01:56.880> two<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.240> these<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.290> that

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
lot heavier but two of these and so that

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.800

between calls and texts though that is

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.120 
between calls and texts though that is
exactly<00:06:10.640> what<00:06:11.640> I'm<00:06:11.820> thinking<00:06:12.210> it<00:06:12.390> removes
