00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.960
 upload and cyprien realized 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.220
 at the last moment it was an idea 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.140

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.680
 late a very good director in 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.090
 self-taught he made some films 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.620
 on the big screen to finally get back 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.390
 in contact with georges the case with 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.579
 which he directed at the 4th trilogy of 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.079
 star wars squeeze on his side continues to 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.640
 gaming videos becoming the figure of 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.289
 problems of French gaming 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.850

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.350
 well yes in the end the canons of gaming 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.000
 like a flower popularized by you 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.230
 not and end up running out of steam 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.090
 turning then to the chain of 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.250
 hooper and bibi300 cleverly 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.390
 named bibi or three without fear a string 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.949
 which comes down to mainly 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.719
 videos in oculus rift with kittens 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.129

 re-elected holland who lives an advantageous 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.810
 economic placement in the future 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.790
 a risky bet that was successful 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.860
 because in 2024 the state will recover french fries 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.780
 this placement, which is estimated at some 173 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.729
 billion euros and luckily it was 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.799
 precisely the public deficit figure 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.729
 in 2024 France can go again 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.470
 from the front she becomes the second 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.180

 India and Russia in 2040 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.580
 let's not forget that she owed her 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.020
 renewal thanks to the internet and the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.490
 Francophone community of videographers and 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.869

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.040
 contaminants most countries of the 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.210
 globe everything now goes for the better 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.290
 in the best of all worlds the model 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.450
 French who brought prosperity 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.340

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.290
 adopted by all even north korea 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.430
 the entire planet could initiate 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.200

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.399
 in conclusion if cyprien gaming had 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.439
 never existed humanity would have advanced 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.460
