00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.355
 Hey, Alex here. How can we help people understand how important it is 

00:00:02.355 --> 00:00:02.915
 the sustainability, 

00:00:02.915 --> 00:00:06.435
 in the most useful and best way? Well, one of the things 

00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:11.095
 What I use is the funnel's metaphor to illustrate the fact that there is no better time 

00:00:11.095 --> 00:00:12.204
 that now 

00:00:12.204 --> 00:00:15.235
 to act on sustainability. Here we go! To draw! 

00:00:15.235 --> 00:00:18.695
 In the previous video on the ecological footprint 

00:00:18.695 --> 00:00:22.215
 We discovered the Earth's ability to provide what we need 

00:00:22.215 --> 00:00:26.025
 is in decline There are fewer forests and fish today 

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:30.304
 that they had been there a hundred years ago. This affects the ability of the planet 

00:00:30.304 --> 00:00:34.955
 to provide what we call "ecosystem services". Things that are necessary for 

00:00:34.955 --> 00:00:35.775
 to support life 

00:00:35.775 --> 00:00:39.455
 and in which we trust; how is climate regulation now? 

00:00:39.455 --> 00:00:42.944
 water leakage, soil generation, etc. 

00:00:42.944 --> 00:00:47.755
 At the same time, the speed at which we consume resources 

00:00:47.755 --> 00:00:51.575
 And we generate waste is increasing. 

00:00:51.575 --> 00:00:55.165
 But this is not all. It is not only on supply and demand, 

00:00:55.165 --> 00:00:58.775
 The biggest consumer awareness, makes this consumer 

00:00:58.775 --> 00:01:01.885
 I expect a new behavior of companies and governments. 

00:01:01.885 --> 00:01:05.175
 Governments change laws, 

00:01:05.175 --> 00:01:09.285
 which are increasingly stricter, the confidence of people is dwindling, 

00:01:09.285 --> 00:01:13.585
 the prices rise, the abuse of power 

00:01:13.585 --> 00:01:17.605
 leads to a growing inequality in the world, resulting in greater social tension, 

00:01:17.605 --> 00:01:21.544
 the population of the world grows, etc. 

00:01:21.544 --> 00:01:26.085
 Thus, there is more pressure 

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:29.504
 in individuals, communities and companies. 

00:01:29.504 --> 00:01:33.735
 It seems as if all these trends are converging, right ?! 

00:01:33.735 --> 00:01:37.004
 And we do not want to see what happens 

00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:41.964
 when they are. It's as if we were going inside in a funnel 

00:01:41.964 --> 00:01:46.364
 The pressure increases over time and we have less room for maneuver. 

00:01:46.364 --> 00:01:49.855
 Therefore, each one has his favorite topic, 

00:01:49.855 --> 00:01:53.794
 maybe it's an environmental one: save forests, 

00:01:53.794 --> 00:01:58.345
 Save whales, stop climate change, or maybe 

00:01:58.345 --> 00:02:02.644
 It is a social topic: face the difference between rich and poor 

00:02:02.644 --> 00:02:06.214
 prevent children from swaying the streets, changing public policies, 

00:02:06.214 --> 00:02:09.735
 create more jobs,, etc. The fact is 

00:02:09.735 --> 00:02:14.175
 that all these issues are related to the key issue of sustainability, 

00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:17.235
 Our ability to survive and evolve as a species 

00:02:17.235 --> 00:02:21.414
 and they all impact our ability to live, work and play on Earth 

00:02:21.414 --> 00:02:25.245
 I do not know a person or a company 

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:29.265
 You do not feel these pressures in one way or another. That's why the funnel's metaphor 

00:02:29.845 --> 00:02:33.625
 It is so useful to explain why we should act in sustainability. 

00:02:33.625 --> 00:02:39.865
 We need to relieve pressure. There are thousands of examples of countries 

00:02:39.865 --> 00:02:44.134
 and companies striking the walls of the funnel. Some have recovered 

00:02:44.134 --> 00:02:48.365
 as in the case of Nike after the affair of poor labor practices in manicures 

00:02:48.365 --> 00:02:49.194
 It was exposed by Greenpeace. 

00:02:49.194 --> 00:02:53.975
 Others do not, as in the case of the island's Easter civilization 

00:02:53.975 --> 00:02:58.685
 which collapsed after destroying its own environment. Others are still trying 

00:02:58.685 --> 00:02:59.345
 recover 

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:02.705
 like Greece or the city of Detroit 

00:03:02.705 --> 00:03:06.825
 they are facing bankruptcies. The funnel metaphor 

00:03:06.825 --> 00:03:10.625
 It also suggests more things: there is no better time than now for 

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:14.024
 acture Wait, it only limits 

00:03:14.024 --> 00:03:17.145
 even more our options. So, 

00:03:17.145 --> 00:03:21.175
 When someone asks: How can I help people to better understand how sustainability is important, 

00:03:21.175 --> 00:03:24.825
 in the most useful and best way? Consider 

00:03:24.825 --> 00:03:29.145
 the metaphor of the funnel. What we have to do is stop convergence 

00:03:29.145 --> 00:03:32.895
 of all these pressures, and find a way we can 

00:03:32.895 --> 00:03:37.194
 ideally begin to "open the funnel" and create a resilient society, 

00:03:37.194 --> 00:03:42.865
 that allows its individuals to feel realized and to evolve in the limits of the nature. 

00:03:42.914 --> 00:03:44.355
 As usual, here are the key points: 

00:03:44.355 --> 00:03:48.515
 The pressure in society, individuals, businesses and communities 

00:03:48.515 --> 00:03:52.164
 it increases over time; there is no better time to act 

00:03:52.164 --> 00:03:55.535
 Now, the more we expect less room for maneuver we will have. 

00:03:55.535 --> 00:04:00.274
 The funnel's metaphor may be useful to help people understand how important 

00:04:00.274 --> 00:04:01.825
 is sustainability 

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:06.895
 We need to find a different way of doing things and ideally "open the funnel." 

00:04:06.895 --> 00:04:10.865
 Therefore, I will bring you more videos about converting sustainability into something that is relevant to you 

00:04:10.895 --> 00:04:11.535
 and your audience. 

00:04:11.535 --> 00:04:13.715
 So, what are you waiting for and thanks for following us?
