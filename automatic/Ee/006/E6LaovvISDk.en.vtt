00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.149 
think it's a pro and the pros outweigh
the<00:02:52.040> cons<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:53.450> is<00:02:53.629> very<00:02:53.840> long-lasting<00:02:54.230> like<00:02:55.040> I

through that I still have to use

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.020 
through that I still have to use
concealer<00:03:23.959> over<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:24.590> top<00:03:24.889> so<00:03:25.579> I<00:03:25.639> don't<00:03:25.819> I

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030

don't<00:03:26.449> necessarily<00:03:27.199> consider<00:03:27.379> it<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.769> full

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.009 
don't necessarily consider it a full
coverage<00:03:28.310> because<00:03:28.970> it<00:03:29.120> doesn't<00:03:29.480> completely

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019
