00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.939 
just barely won so I get mean
technically<00:00:28.080> we<00:00:28.230> didn't<00:00:28.410> smack<00:00:28.710> them

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
technically we didn't smack them

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.939 
technically we didn't smack them
anything<00:00:29.189> but<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:30.449> guys<00:00:30.599> probably<00:00:30.900> saw<00:00:31.170> my

so<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:17.970> thought<00:02:18.270> you<00:02:18.450> know<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:19.080> gets<00:02:19.290> kind

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
so I thought you know that it gets kind

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.980 
so I thought you know that it gets kind
of<00:02:19.620> annoying<00:02:19.740> I'm<00:02:20.250> not<00:02:20.400> gonna<00:02:20.580> lie<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.270> that's

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
of annoying I'm not gonna lie and that's

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.320 
of annoying I'm not gonna lie and that's
why<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.260> brought<00:02:22.470> actually<00:02:23.010> some<00:02:23.520> additional

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
why I brought actually some additional

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.240 
why I brought actually some additional
video<00:02:24.810> for<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.200> guys<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.620> see<00:02:25.860> just<00:02:26.130> because

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
video for you guys to see just because

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.090 
video for you guys to see just because
you<00:02:27.030> know<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.180> wanted<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.630> investigate<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.530> not

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
you know I wanted to investigate and not

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.770 
you know I wanted to investigate and not
really<00:02:29.400> investigate<00:02:29.970> but<00:02:30.090> just<00:02:30.300> look<00:02:30.540> into

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
really investigate but just look into

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.780 
really investigate but just look into
the<00:02:30.870> issue<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.170> little<00:02:31.410> bit<00:02:31.560> more<00:02:31.770> so<00:02:32.070> I<00:02:32.100> took<00:02:32.370> I

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
the issue a little bit more so I took I

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.790 
the issue a little bit more so I took I
guess<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.330> couple<00:02:33.630> minutes<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:34.110> go<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.410> see

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
guess a couple minutes to go and see

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.740 
guess a couple minutes to go and see
because<00:02:34.980> when<00:02:35.340> i<00:02:35.370> was<00:02:35.580> in<00:02:35.610> o.p<00:02:35.820> i<00:02:36.060> knew<00:02:36.510> they
