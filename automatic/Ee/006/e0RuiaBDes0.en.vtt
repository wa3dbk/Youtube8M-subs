 Riding on a shovel 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:28.460
 I wonder how you are 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.460
 Call Pegasus to arrange the jets first 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:46.530
 Then you will see the name of the helicopter or plane you purchased, so you will see the vehicle name you need. 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.530
 The place will be displayed to the decision Osu trader 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:02.230
 This time it is not so far, but sometimes it will be arranged at an extremely distant point 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:12.490

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.490

 I had a cut and arranged to a new place 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.810
 This time whirl 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:11.009
 I 've got a gun that I've come here, hey, but it's not a Lang Attack 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.100
 Is expected 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.610
 I'm sorry 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.610
 What should I do 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.330
 I'm completely waiting 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:28.739
 First of all , let's get on a stealth plane without arming anything 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.739
 I hope I have noticed this 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.290
 I realized it was impossible 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.060
 It is already overkilled 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.370
 It does not come Ugh 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.519
 Ah 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.510
 It's a quick takeoff. 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.990
 It is beaten up 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.069
 I do not want to defeat the enemy 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.519
 Take off early 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.519
 Science 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.400
 Yo 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.180
 I feel relieved with this 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.269
 I'm going to a nearby runway because I want to introduce a Samarima airplane 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:19.540
 I thought, but there is a player on the runway and can not land easily 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.540
 It's like I'm turning at a low altitude flight 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.520
 Landed 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.750
 There are no players nearby so far 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:49.920
 Go to the introduction by say 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:53.370
 I thought I was around but it wasn't that good 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:58.069
 Well, the reason is the same at a glance 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.069
 Let's take off because it felt the time being dangerous 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:12.040
 I feel like I can see something with fire 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:16.530
 This dangerous 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.530
 Why are you forced to take off from a while ago ? 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.699
 I was relieved without any major trouble 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.699
 Ye 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:38.580
 Anyway gta 5 graphics are very beautiful and I like it 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.580
 I feel the evolution very much compared to the previous work 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.900
 We came into town 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:08.380
 I wondered what to do with this 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:11.400
 I have not introduced an airplane 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:14.360
 N'it's just only had seen landscape 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.360
 Well 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.160
 By the way, I almost lost my money 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:33.270
 Usually it crashed If you think you try to reproduce the 911 and Well really Let's make the house I suddenly explosion 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.270
 Just 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:54.370
 It will be over soon, so from now on it will be a little more serious than gta online 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:06:00.510
 I'm going to make a video 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:00.510
 This time it is a meaning test video, so it was 5 cities.
