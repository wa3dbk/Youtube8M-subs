have some massive rocks a little bit of
a<00:01:46.539> design<00:01:46.869> tip<00:01:47.170> when<00:01:47.350> we're<00:01:47.470> working<00:01:47.800> with

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
a design tip when we're working with

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.249 
a design tip when we're working with
these<00:01:48.130> larger<00:01:48.490> boulders<00:01:48.910> is<00:01:49.119> I<00:01:49.509> always<00:01:49.810> want

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
these larger boulders is I always want

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.710 
these larger boulders is I always want
to<00:01:50.350> over<00:01:50.649> excavate<00:01:51.220> so<00:01:51.399> as<00:01:51.520> you<00:01:51.670> see<00:01:51.910> we<00:01:52.090> over

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
to over excavate so as you see we over

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.469 
to over excavate so as you see we over
dig<00:01:52.960> everything<00:01:53.740> with<00:01:53.950> our<00:01:54.130> construction<00:01:54.479> put

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
dig everything with our construction put

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.480 
dig everything with our construction put
our<00:01:55.600> liner<00:01:55.869> in<00:01:56.140> place<00:01:56.289> then<00:01:56.890> we<00:01:57.039> place<00:01:57.310> the

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
our liner in place then we place the

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.310 
our liner in place then we place the
boulders<00:01:57.940> so<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.179> boulders<00:01:58.630> look<00:01:58.899> good

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
boulders so the boulders look good

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.320 
boulders so the boulders look good
we<00:01:59.530> don't<00:01:59.800> go<00:01:59.979> off<00:02:00.039> the<00:02:00.130> excavation<00:02:01.030> we<00:02:01.149> want

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
we don't go off the excavation we want

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.969 
we don't go off the excavation we want
to<00:02:01.420> make<00:02:01.539> the<00:02:01.659> boulders<00:02:02.079> look<00:02:02.290> good<00:02:02.439> first<00:02:02.799> of

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
to make the boulders look good first of

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.160 
to make the boulders look good first of
all<00:02:03.130> then<00:02:03.610> we<00:02:03.729> just<00:02:03.880> simply<00:02:04.240> backfill<00:02:04.869> our<00:02:05.020> way

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
all then we just simply backfill our way

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.710 
all then we just simply backfill our way
up<00:02:05.439> around<00:02:05.619> everything<00:02:06.509> we've<00:02:07.509> already

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
up around everything we've already

up around everything we've already
completed<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.560> one<00:02:08.739> section<00:02:09.130> to<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.310> west

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
completed the one section to the west

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:10.919 
completed the one section to the west
and<00:02:09.790> what<00:02:09.910> we're<00:02:10.060> doing<00:02:10.090> is<00:02:10.329> we're<00:02:10.450> gonna<00:02:10.540> wrap

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
and what we're doing is we're gonna wrap

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.720 
and what we're doing is we're gonna wrap
around<00:02:10.959> this<00:02:11.590> waterfall<00:02:12.070> we<00:02:12.220> want<00:02:12.400> to<00:02:12.489> finish

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730

finally got all the electrical stuff
taken<00:03:31.690> care<00:03:31.720> of<00:03:31.959> with<00:03:32.950> our<00:03:33.129> control<00:03:33.400> panels<00:03:33.970> we

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
taken care of with our control panels we

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.789 
taken care of with our control panels we

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
have it set up on a timer system to go

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.920 
have it set up on a timer system to go
off<00:03:36.010> and<00:03:36.250> on<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.970> whole<00:03:37.180> idea<00:03:37.540> with<00:03:37.720> this

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
sustainability so less electrical

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.160 
sustainability so less electrical
consumption<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.400> less<00:03:42.760> usage<00:03:43.209> of<00:03:43.390> water<00:03:43.540> the
