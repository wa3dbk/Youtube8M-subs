watching it again I still get the

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.070 
watching it again I still get the
feeling<00:05:33.850> that<00:05:33.970> pinky's<00:05:34.360> abilities<00:05:34.900> are

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
feeling that pinky's abilities are

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.930 
feeling that pinky's abilities are
attributed<00:05:35.620> to<00:05:35.650> how<00:05:35.890> much<00:05:36.070> joy<00:05:36.490> she<00:05:36.790> can

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
attributed to how much joy she can

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.270 
attributed to how much joy she can
spread<00:05:37.300> into<00:05:37.630> the<00:05:37.660> lives<00:05:37.960> of<00:05:38.140> others<00:05:38.290> that<00:05:39.130> if

care about her and want to spend time
with<00:05:43.000> her<00:05:43.330> that<00:05:43.540> she<00:05:43.690> wouldn't<00:05:43.990> be<00:05:44.140> able<00:05:44.229> to
