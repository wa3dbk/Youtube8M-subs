what<00:02:16.060> I'm<00:02:16.180> going<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.390> do<00:02:16.630> is<00:02:16.930> I'm<00:02:17.320> going<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:17.530> put

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to put

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.550 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to put
my<00:02:18.010> needle<00:02:18.250> through<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:19.630> bottom<00:02:20.200> bead<00:02:20.410> again

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
my needle through the bottom bead again

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.970 
my needle through the bottom bead again
just<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.100> bottom<00:02:21.400> bead<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:22.740> run<00:02:23.740> it<00:02:23.890> on

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
just the bottom bead and run it on

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:33.290 
just the bottom bead and run it on
through<00:02:29.040> if<00:02:30.040> I<00:02:30.220> can<00:02:30.370> get<00:02:30.490> that<00:02:30.700> here<00:02:31.360> we<00:02:31.570> go

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
through if I can get that here we go

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.480 
through if I can get that here we go
so<00:02:34.300> you<00:02:34.600> see<00:02:34.810> how<00:02:35.020> they're<00:02:35.200> lining<00:02:35.500> up<00:02:35.800> one<00:02:36.340> on

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
so you see how they're lining up one on

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.870 
so you see how they're lining up one on
top<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:36.940> each<00:02:37.060> other<00:02:37.240> like<00:02:37.540> a<00:02:37.690> little<00:02:38.080> ladder

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
top of each other like a little ladder

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.610 
top of each other like a little ladder
okay<00:02:39.880> now<00:02:40.420> I've<00:02:40.570> got<00:02:40.600> my<00:02:40.959> working<00:02:41.380> thread

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
and put another bead on this time I'm

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.210 
and put another bead on this time I'm
going<00:02:57.459> to<00:02:57.550> use<00:02:57.610> one<00:02:57.880> of<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.030> red<00:02:58.209> ones<00:02:58.770> and<00:02:59.770> you

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
see I'm putting it down the green bead

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.600 
see I'm putting it down the green bead
pulling<00:03:05.470> it<00:03:05.590> on<00:03:05.680> through<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:07.739> then<00:03:08.739> back<00:03:09.310> up

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.000 

so<00:03:19.460> here<00:03:19.640> we<00:03:19.760> go<00:03:20.150> ladder<00:03:20.810> now<00:03:21.080> has<00:03:21.350> three<00:03:21.740> beads

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
so here we go ladder now has three beads

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.550 
so here we go ladder now has three beads
on<00:03:22.250> it<00:03:23.260> okay<00:03:24.550> do<00:03:25.550> this<00:03:25.760> again<00:03:26.090> put<00:03:27.080> on<00:03:27.230> another

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
on it okay do this again put on another

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.820 
on it okay do this again put on another
red<00:03:27.830> bead<00:03:28.100> go<00:03:28.940> up<00:03:29.209> through<00:03:29.840> and<00:03:30.110> one<00:03:30.530> way<00:03:30.770> to

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
red bead go up through and one way to

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.270 
red bead go up through and one way to
tell<00:03:31.490> which<00:03:31.730> way<00:03:31.970> to<00:03:32.030> go<00:03:32.900> through<00:03:33.230> as<00:03:33.470> you<00:03:34.069> see

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
tell which way to go through as you see

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.540 
tell which way to go through as you see
where<00:03:34.490> your<00:03:34.700> your<00:03:35.600> thread<00:03:35.959> is<00:03:35.990> exiting<00:03:36.650> always

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
where your your thread is exiting always

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.090 
where your your thread is exiting always
put<00:03:37.790> your<00:03:37.970> needle<00:03:38.150> through<00:03:38.300> in<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.170> opposite

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
put your needle through in the opposite

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.500 
put your needle through in the opposite
way<00:03:41.740> so<00:03:42.740> here<00:03:42.950> we<00:03:43.070> go<00:03:43.220> again

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.380 

sometimes<00:03:47.510> a<00:03:48.340> squiggle<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.520> little<00:03:49.850> so<00:03:50.270> you

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
sometimes a squiggle a little so you

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.640 
sometimes a squiggle a little so you
have<00:03:50.510> to<00:03:50.660> line<00:03:50.840> them<00:03:51.020> up<00:03:51.850> but<00:03:52.850> there<00:03:53.090> you<00:03:53.239> go

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
have to line them up but there you go

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:01.420

up<00:05:06.740> my<00:05:07.130> stop<00:05:07.520> bead<00:05:07.790> some<00:05:08.180> so<00:05:09.140> that<00:05:09.980> helps<00:05:10.340> to

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
up my stop bead some so that helps to

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.240 
up my stop bead some so that helps to
keep<00:05:10.970> the<00:05:11.150> work<00:05:11.330> tighter<00:05:11.660> so<00:05:12.050> you<00:05:12.140> see<00:05:12.470> how<00:05:13.040> is

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
keep the work tighter so you see how is

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.520 
keep the work tighter so you see how is
kind<00:05:13.490> of<00:05:13.550> floppy<00:05:13.850> earlier<00:05:14.390> now<00:05:15.170> it's<00:05:15.350> a<00:05:15.410> bit

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
kind of floppy earlier now it's a bit

wiggle these beads a little bit just so

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.360 
wiggle these beads a little bit just so
they<00:07:01.490> behave<00:07:01.669> there<00:07:02.479> they<00:07:02.690> go

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:03.370

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:07.220 
okay here is your first two rows of the

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.659 
okay here is your first two rows of the
herringbone<00:07:07.580> stitch<00:07:08.979> you<00:07:09.979> can<00:07:10.009> see<00:07:10.340> that<00:07:10.550> it's

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:10.669 
herringbone stitch you can see that it's

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:12.219 
herringbone stitch you can see that it's
starting<00:07:11.000> to<00:07:11.060> get<00:07:11.180> the<00:07:11.330> herringbone<00:07:11.720> shape

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:12.229 
starting to get the herringbone shape

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:17.620 
starting to get the herringbone shape
with<00:07:12.620> the<00:07:12.800> V's<00:07:13.789> on<00:07:14.210> the<00:07:14.479> beads<00:07:14.720> so<00:07:16.419> let's<00:07:17.419> go

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:17.630 
with the V's on the beads so let's go

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.080 
with the V's on the beads so let's go
ahead<00:07:17.840> and<00:07:17.960> turn<00:07:18.110> around<00:07:18.169> and<00:07:18.830> go<00:07:19.789> for<00:07:20.000> the
