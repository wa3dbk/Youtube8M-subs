00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.890 
pinned up but I made sure to rinse every
single<00:02:22.390> day<00:02:22.570> and<00:02:22.920> as<00:02:23.920> my<00:02:24.490> weeks<00:02:24.790> went<00:02:25.420> on<00:02:25.570> I

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
single day and as my weeks went on I

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.500 
single day and as my weeks went on I
just<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:27.220> know<00:02:27.250> I<00:02:27.550> couldn't<00:02:27.970> it<00:02:28.120> seemed<00:02:28.390> as

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
just you know I couldn't it seemed as

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.480 
just you know I couldn't it seemed as
though<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.990> bigger<00:02:29.410> by<00:02:29.650> twist<00:02:29.980> words<00:02:30.190> and

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
though the bigger by twist words and

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
though the bigger by twist words and
more<00:02:30.640> tangles<00:02:31.150> I<00:02:31.240> got<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:32.290> I<00:02:33.120> think<00:02:34.120> that<00:02:34.360> it's

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
more tangles I got so I think that it's

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.970 
more tangles I got so I think that it's
best<00:02:34.720> if<00:02:34.930> you<00:02:34.960> start<00:02:35.260> with<00:02:35.500> maybe<00:02:35.710> medium

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
best if you start with maybe medium

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.430 
best if you start with maybe medium
sized<00:02:36.400> twists<00:02:36.850> not<00:02:37.180> don't<00:02:37.810> make<00:02:37.930> them<00:02:38.050> too<00:02:38.200> big

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
sized twists not don't make them too big

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.760 
sized twists not don't make them too big
make<00:02:39.040> them<00:02:39.220> medium<00:02:39.400> sized<00:02:39.850> and<00:02:40.350> I<00:02:41.350> think

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
make them medium sized and I think

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.860 
make them medium sized and I think
you'll<00:02:41.890> have<00:02:42.040> an<00:02:42.190> easier<00:02:42.550> time<00:02:42.580> of<00:02:43.180> it<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.840> the

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
you'll have an easier time of it the the

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.960 
you'll have an easier time of it the the
sebum<00:02:44.650> will<00:02:44.860> move<00:02:45.040> down<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.430> length<00:02:45.640> of<00:02:45.850> those

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
sebum will move down the length of those

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.950 
sebum will move down the length of those
up<00:02:46.320> twists<00:02:47.320> a<00:02:47.500> lot<00:02:47.680> faster<00:02:48.430> then<00:02:49.000> if<00:02:49.390> you<00:02:49.720> have

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
up twists a lot faster then if you have

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.590 
up twists a lot faster then if you have
bigger<00:02:50.230> twists<00:02:50.530> like<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:50.800> started<00:02:51.190> off<00:02:51.310> with

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
bigger twists like I started off with

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.800 
bigger twists like I started off with
but<00:02:52.600> yes<00:02:53.290> so<00:02:53.590> bigger<00:02:53.920> twist<00:02:54.100> is<00:02:54.630> better<00:02:55.630> than

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
but yes so bigger twist is better than

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.120 
but yes so bigger twist is better than
the<00:02:55.870> really<00:02:56.080> small<00:02:56.320> turns<00:02:56.560> like<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.770> have<00:02:56.920> right

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
the really small turns like I have right

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.160 
the really small turns like I have right
now<00:02:57.160> but<00:02:57.850> don't<00:02:58.000> go<00:02:58.210> too<00:02:58.270> big<00:02:58.600> because<00:02:58.780> then

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
now but don't go too big because then

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.600 
now but don't go too big because then
your<00:02:59.290> hair<00:02:59.470> will<00:02:59.500> get<00:02:59.740> more<00:02:59.920> tangling<00:03:00.400> you'll

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
your hair will get more tangling you'll

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.430 
your hair will get more tangling you'll
have<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:00.910> be<00:03:01.030> twist<00:03:01.300> your<00:03:01.480> you'll<00:03:02.050> have<00:03:02.200> to<00:03:02.320> do

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
have to be twist your you'll have to do

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.110 
have to be twist your you'll have to do
your<00:03:02.470> hair<00:03:02.890> more<00:03:03.190> often<00:03:03.460> than<00:03:03.850> what<00:03:04.000> you

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
your hair more often than what you

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.830 
your hair more often than what you
probably<00:03:04.390> would<00:03:04.840> be<00:03:04.960> in<00:03:05.050> the<00:03:05.110> mood<00:03:05.290> to<00:03:05.440> do<00:03:05.590> so

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
probably would be in the mood to do so

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.270 
probably would be in the mood to do so
medium<00:03:07.840> sized<00:03:08.080> twist<00:03:08.380> is<00:03:08.500> better<00:03:08.710> and<00:03:09.060> I'd<00:03:10.060> see

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
medium sized twist is better and I'd see

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.380 
medium sized twist is better and I'd see
it<00:03:12.280> took<00:03:12.610> me<00:03:13.410> about<00:03:14.410> I<00:03:14.950> want<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.370> say<00:03:15.580> three

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
it took me about I want to say three

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.620 
it took me about I want to say three
weeks<00:03:16.830> to<00:03:17.830> get<00:03:18.040> three<00:03:18.550> to<00:03:18.670> four<00:03:18.910> weeks<00:03:19.150> to<00:03:19.390> get

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
weeks to get three to four weeks to get

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.520 
weeks to get three to four weeks to get
the<00:03:19.810> total<00:03:21.330> length<00:03:22.330> of<00:03:22.510> my<00:03:22.690> hair<00:03:22.900> covered<00:03:23.380> with

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
the total length of my hair covered with

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.800 
the total length of my hair covered with
sebum<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.190> it<00:03:24.970> probably<00:03:25.330> didn't<00:03:25.540> even<00:03:25.600> really

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
sebum and it probably didn't even really

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.350 
sebum and it probably didn't even really
take<00:03:26.050> me<00:03:26.200> that<00:03:26.350> long<00:03:26.700> I'd<00:03:27.700> have<00:03:27.760> to<00:03:28.060> go<00:03:28.180> you

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
take me that long I'd have to go you

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.120 
take me that long I'd have to go you
know<00:03:28.390> what<00:03:28.630> I<00:03:28.660> did<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:28.960> journal<00:03:29.410> I'm<00:03:29.680> going<00:03:30.070> to

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
know what I did a journal I'm going to

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.430 
know what I did a journal I'm going to
have<00:03:30.310> to<00:03:30.490> go<00:03:31.030> back<00:03:31.060> and<00:03:31.450> look<00:03:31.630> to<00:03:32.080> find<00:03:32.230> out

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
have to go back and look to find out

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.080 
have to go back and look to find out
when<00:03:32.620> I<00:03:32.650> received<00:03:33.130> total<00:03:33.280> coverage<00:03:33.820> and<00:03:34.000> then

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
when I received total coverage and then

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.760 
when I received total coverage and then
I'll<00:03:34.240> make<00:03:34.420> sure<00:03:34.600> that<00:03:35.080> I<00:03:35.140> put<00:03:35.440> it<00:03:35.560> at<00:03:35.620> the

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
I'll make sure that I put it at the

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.100 
I'll make sure that I put it at the
bottom<00:03:35.950> of<00:03:36.370> this<00:03:36.490> video<00:03:36.850> so<00:03:37.150> you'll<00:03:37.390> know<00:03:37.960> how

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
bottom of this video so you'll know how

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.600 
bottom of this video so you'll know how
long<00:03:38.290> it<00:03:38.440> actually<00:03:38.470> took<00:03:38.920> me<00:03:39.100> for<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.400> length

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
long it actually took me for the length

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.750 
long it actually took me for the length
of<00:03:39.730> my<00:03:39.940> hair<00:03:40.290> okay<00:03:41.290> um<00:03:42.240> my<00:03:43.240> hair<00:03:43.480> right<00:03:43.690> now<00:03:43.750> is

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
of my hair okay um my hair right now is

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.400 
of my hair okay um my hair right now is
well<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:46.000> bet<00:03:46.180> is<00:03:46.330> cut<00:03:46.540> in<00:03:46.660> layers<00:03:46.840> so<00:03:47.260> the

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
well the bet is cut in layers so the

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.160 
well the bet is cut in layers so the
back<00:03:47.620> is<00:03:47.950> pretty<00:03:48.580> much<00:03:48.790> almost<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.660> the<00:03:49.810> very

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.630 

mm<00:03:53.170> I<00:03:53.290> want<00:03:53.470> to<00:03:53.560> say<00:03:53.709> with<00:03:53.950> that<00:03:53.980> that<00:03:54.430> little

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
mm I want to say with that that little

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.120 
mm I want to say with that that little
dip<00:03:55.120> is<00:03:55.360> where<00:03:55.720> your<00:03:55.870> bottom<00:03:56.230> is<00:03:56.410> and<00:03:56.830> it<00:03:56.950> meets

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
dip is where your bottom is and it meets

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.340 
dip is where your bottom is and it meets
your<00:03:57.280> back<00:03:57.459> that's<00:03:58.090> where<00:03:58.270> the<00:03:58.360> where<00:03:59.230> the

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
your back that's where the where the

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.699 
your back that's where the where the
back<00:03:59.530> of<00:03:59.680> my<00:03:59.800> hair<00:04:00.040> is<00:04:00.190> and<00:04:00.550> then<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.209> sides

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
back of my hair is and then the sides

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.140 
back of my hair is and then the sides
this<00:04:02.760> about<00:04:03.760> here<00:04:04.600> I<00:04:04.810> want<00:04:05.620> to<00:04:05.680> say<00:04:05.970> but<00:04:06.970> anyway

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
this about here I want to say but anyway

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.940 
this about here I want to say but anyway
it's<00:04:07.570> all<00:04:07.750> different<00:04:08.110> lengths<00:04:08.410> because<00:04:08.740> I

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
it's all different lengths because I

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.160 
it's all different lengths because I
have<00:04:09.190> my<00:04:09.310> hair<00:04:09.490> cut<00:04:09.670> in<00:04:09.760> layers<00:04:09.880> and<00:04:10.780> it<00:04:10.900> didn't

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
have my hair cut in layers and it didn't

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.170 
have my hair cut in layers and it didn't
take<00:04:11.320> me<00:04:11.440> that<00:04:11.560> long<00:04:11.620> to<00:04:12.040> get<00:04:12.280> the<00:04:12.520> the<00:04:12.820> sebum

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
take me that long to get the the sebum

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.520 
take me that long to get the the sebum
down<00:04:13.330> the<00:04:13.450> length<00:04:13.690> so<00:04:13.900> it<00:04:14.170> really<00:04:14.440> just
