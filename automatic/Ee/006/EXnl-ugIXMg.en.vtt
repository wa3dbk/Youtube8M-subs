00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 hello today we're going to learn a trick for 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.980
 lighten dark circles and reduce bags 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.929
 of the eyes 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:14.160
 we need a cucumber and a couple of potatoes 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.780
 we see it, we wash our potatoes well 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.240
 and the cucumber that we are going to use 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.590
 make sure they are from agriculture 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.100
 ecological 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.380
 ah 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.690
 I'm going to use a blender but if 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.670
 you have not can do it from the 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.740
 traditional way is to say we call it 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.680
 the cucumber and the potato and then not 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.790
 we squeeze with using a cloth or a 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.790
 gauze to remove 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.820
 and refreshing properties and 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.609
 decongestant and it suits us very well 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.850
 to reduce eye bags and the 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:49.070
 layer whitens skin over all the skin 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.769
 of the dark circles with the pulp that has 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.170
 I left we can add half yogurt 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.839
 we stir well and we have a mask 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.410
 ideal for whitening nourish and tone 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:05.710
 neck face neckline 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:08.500
 [Music] 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:12.310
 and it's done we 're going to put 10 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:15.040
 droplets of chamomile essential oil 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.680
 whoever wants to wear it is optional 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:22.030
 It puts it not because there nothing happens 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:25.810
 Chamomile is that it tones and is very 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.439
 relaxing apart from its smell it calms us 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.039
 very much 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.039
 stir well 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.939
 and now what we have prepared 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.810
 are some discs we can use the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.670
 lifelong makeup remover discs or 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.580
 we can make our own records 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.619
 with an old wipe we cut it in 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.830
 circles and we have our own 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.619
 discs is the greenest option and 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:59.600
 economic as they are reusable the 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.420
 we put in our sumo 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.880
 so that they are well soaked 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.920
 our discs are already well soaked 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.310
 in our liquid our juice and now 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.739
 We are going to put it in bags of 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.980
 freezing because they are going to freeze the 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.200
 goal to the freezer 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.060
 before putting the discs in our eyes 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.730
 we should take five or ten minutes 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.090
 before the freezer since we must 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.920
 get cold but not frozen 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.560
