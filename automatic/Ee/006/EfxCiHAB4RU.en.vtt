00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
easy to set up so like in my case I set

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.729 
easy to set up so like in my case I set
up<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.239> directory<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.420> wireless<00:00:46.320> hot<00:00:46.500> shot

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
up the directory a wireless hot shot

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.529 
up the directory a wireless hot shot
where<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:46.980> keep<00:00:47.250> all<00:00:47.399> my<00:00:47.460> videos<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.210> can<00:00:48.390> go

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
where I keep all my videos and I can go

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.260 
where I keep all my videos and I can go
in<00:00:48.690> here<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.219> it's<00:00:50.219> real<00:00:50.610> fast<00:00:50.879> because<00:00:51.090> it

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
in here and it's real fast because it

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.790 
in here and it's real fast because it
runs<00:00:51.420> off<00:00:51.570> your<00:00:51.719> network<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:54.440> got<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> lot<00:00:55.770> of

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
runs off your network I got a lot of

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.670 
runs off your network I got a lot of
content<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.960> folder<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.289> that's<00:00:58.469> why<00:00:58.590> it

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
content in this folder so that's why it

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.279 
content in this folder so that's why it
takes<00:00:58.859> forever<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.250> load<00:00:59.660> so<00:01:00.660> here's<00:01:01.079> all<00:01:01.260> my

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
takes forever to load so here's all my

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.380 
takes forever to load so here's all my
videos<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:01.980> can<00:01:02.160> watch<00:01:02.370> any<00:01:02.760> one<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.149> them

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
videos and I can watch any one of them

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.080 
videos and I can watch any one of them

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.510 

take<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.719> little<00:01:31.140> bit<00:01:31.409> longer<00:01:31.649> to<00:01:32.070> load<00:01:32.250> than

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
take a little bit longer to load than

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:42.319 
take a little bit longer to load than
usual<00:01:33.000> for<00:01:33.240> some<00:01:33.570> reason<00:01:40.640> so<00:01:41.640> there<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.000> it

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
usual for some reason so there it is it

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.210 
usual for some reason so there it is it
usually<00:01:42.750> does<00:01:42.929> not<00:01:43.110> take<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.530> long<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.829> load

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
usually does not take that long to load

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.340 
usually does not take that long to load
but<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.030> guess<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.600> took<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.840> little<00:01:45.990> bit<00:01:46.110> longer

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
but I guess it took a little bit longer

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.760 
but I guess it took a little bit longer
to<00:01:46.740> load<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.399> time<00:01:47.899> see<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.200> quality<00:01:49.649> is

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
to load that time see in the quality is

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.469 
to load that time see in the quality is
really<00:01:49.799> good<00:01:50.189> it's<00:01:50.610> just<00:01:50.700> as<00:01:51.119> good<00:01:51.210> as<00:01:51.390> the

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
really good it's just as good as the

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.520 
really good it's just as good as the
quality<00:01:51.869> on<00:01:52.579> your<00:01:53.579> computer<00:01:54.450> itself<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.170> like

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
quality on your computer itself so like

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.669 
quality on your computer itself so like
in<00:01:55.649> my<00:01:55.740> case<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:56.159> 1080p<00:01:56.789> I<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.140> looks<00:01:58.350> set

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
in my case is 1080p I and it looks set

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:00.710 
in my case is 1080p I and it looks set
1080p<00:01:59.310> right<00:01:59.490> here<00:01:59.759> so<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.119> looks<00:02:00.270> really<00:02:00.539> good

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
1080p right here so it looks really good

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
iphone 4 so you can pretty much do a lot

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.509 
iphone 4 so you can pretty much do a lot
of<00:03:10.260> stuff<00:03:10.590> it's<00:03:11.370> pretty<00:03:11.670> cool<00:03:13.310> i'll<00:03:14.310> go<00:03:14.489> ahead

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
and no you can't scroll the add two

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.379 
and no you can't scroll the add two
tasks<00:03:16.769> so<00:03:16.889> if<00:03:17.010> i<00:03:17.130> add<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.609> the<00:03:17.730> task<00:03:18.030> it

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
tasks so if i add that to the task it

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.330 
tasks so if i add that to the task it
will<00:03:18.540> start<00:03:18.870> converting<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:19.859> over<00:03:20.069> and<00:03:20.190> as<00:03:20.280> you

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
will start converting it over and as you

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.390 
will start converting it over and as you
can<00:03:20.489> see<00:03:20.519> it<00:03:20.910> like<00:03:21.660> it<00:03:21.810> was<00:03:21.840> going<00:03:22.049> fast<00:03:22.139> on<00:03:22.560> now

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
can see it like it was going fast on now

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.559 
can see it like it was going fast on now
it's<00:03:23.549> going<00:03:23.730> slower<00:03:23.970> because<00:03:24.150> it's<00:03:24.389> got<00:03:24.510> a

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
it's going slower because it's got a

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.339 
it's going slower because it's got a
three<00:03:25.139> minute<00:03:25.350> video<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.370> convert<00:03:27.000> 1080<00:03:27.930> or<00:03:28.319> I

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
three minute video to convert 1080 or I

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.400 
three minute video to convert 1080 or I
mean<00:03:28.590> HD<00:03:29.549> in<00:03:29.609> general<00:03:30.000> so<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:30.989> it<00:03:31.079> will<00:03:31.139> take

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
mean HD in general so that it will take

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:38.150 
mean HD in general so that it will take
a<00:03:31.440> while<00:03:31.739> so<00:03:35.840> here<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:36.959> is<00:03:37.019> just<00:03:37.380> finishing<00:03:37.829> up

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
a while so here it is just finishing up

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.140 
a while so here it is just finishing up
and<00:03:39.199> I<00:03:40.199> don't<00:03:41.160> know<00:03:41.250> if<00:03:41.370> it<00:03:41.459> really<00:03:41.489> says<00:03:41.850> it's

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
and I don't know if it really says it's

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.460 
and I don't know if it really says it's
done<00:03:42.419> or<00:03:42.600> anything<00:03:42.959> but

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
done or anything but

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.770

I'll go ahead and click cancel and that
will<00:03:45.960> pretty<00:03:46.260> much<00:03:46.380> go<00:03:46.650> back<00:03:46.860> to<00:03:47.100> even<00:03:47.280> if

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
will pretty much go back to even if

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.340 
will pretty much go back to even if
you're<00:03:47.550> in<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.940> conversion<00:03:48.360> it<00:03:48.630> will<00:03:48.780> it's

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
you're in a conversion it will it's
