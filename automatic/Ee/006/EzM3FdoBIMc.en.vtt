for a supporting point being going from
a<00:00:43.670> several<00:00:44.670> years<00:00:44.850> where<00:00:45.030> we<00:00:45.180> have<00:00:45.300> just<00:00:45.329> been

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:45.630 
a several years where we have just been

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.380 
a several years where we have just been
making<00:00:45.900> sequels<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:47.040> a<00:00:47.070> brand<00:00:47.579> new<00:00:47.700> IP<00:00:47.910> on<00:00:48.329> a

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
making sequels to a brand new IP on a

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.270 
making sequels to a brand new IP on a
new<00:00:48.900> platform<00:00:49.200> was<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.980> big<00:00:50.130> challenge

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
new platform was the big challenge

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.610 
new platform was the big challenge
especially<00:00:51.120> since<00:00:51.780> we<00:00:51.900> made<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.200> decision<00:00:52.590> to

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
especially since we made the decision to

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.560 
especially since we made the decision to
try<00:00:52.950> to<00:00:52.980> away<00:00:53.310> from<00:00:53.489> platformers<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.510> I

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
try to away from platformers so I

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.080 
try to away from platformers so I
thought<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.020> inspiration<00:00:55.800> for<00:00:56.010> i-5<00:00:56.430> was<00:00:56.820> kind

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
thought the inspiration for i-5 was kind

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.290 
thought the inspiration for i-5 was kind
of<00:00:57.210> Tomb<00:00:57.960> Raider<00:00:57.989> meets<00:00:58.710> zelda<00:00:59.149> there<00:01:00.149> was<00:01:00.270> a

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
of Tomb Raider meets zelda there was a

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.600 
of Tomb Raider meets zelda there was a
book<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.870> think<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.230> thick<00:01:01.590> somewhere<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
book I think this thick somewhere in the

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.249 
book I think this thick somewhere in the
studio<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.450> was<00:01:03.510> like<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.809> whole<00:01:03.899> design

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
studio that was like the whole design

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:09.379 
studio that was like the whole design
and<00:01:04.559> maybe<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:06.079> design<00:01:07.079> Bible<00:01:07.770> for<00:01:07.950> i-5<00:01:08.430> to

00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:09.389 
and maybe the design Bible for i-5 to

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:11.870 
and maybe the design Bible for i-5 to
track<00:01:09.749> that<00:01:09.960> down<00:01:10.170> we<00:01:11.069> really<00:01:11.340> realized<00:01:11.729> we

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
track that down we really realized we

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.129 
track that down we really realized we
had<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.060> get<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> head<00:01:12.479> start<00:01:12.600> because<00:01:12.960> everyone

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:13.139 
had to get a head start because everyone

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:16.069 
had to get a head start because everyone
would<00:01:13.710> be<00:01:13.859> finishing<00:01:14.219> Spyro<00:01:14.700> rolling<00:01:15.630> off<00:01:15.810> and

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
would be finishing Spyro rolling off and

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:19.190 
would be finishing Spyro rolling off and
then<00:01:16.200> doing<00:01:16.380> what<00:01:16.499> and<00:01:17.869> there<00:01:18.869> was<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> lot<00:01:19.170> of

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
then doing what and there was a lot of

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.319 
then doing what and there was a lot of
pressure<00:01:19.439> because<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.700> took<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.999> entire

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
pressure because it took the entire

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:23.149 
pressure because it took the entire
studio<00:01:21.689> just<00:01:21.959> to<00:01:22.049> finish<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.409> game<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.009> mean

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
studio just to finish a game and I mean

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.760 
studio just to finish a game and I mean
still<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.969> still<00:01:24.209> does<00:01:24.389> it<00:01:24.810> but<00:01:25.439> then<00:01:25.560> we<00:01:25.649> knew

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
still it still does it but then we knew

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.980 
still it still does it but then we knew
we<00:01:25.859> had<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.009> start<00:01:26.429> the<00:01:26.639> new<00:01:26.819> game<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.840> was

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
we had to start the new game so that was

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.499 
we had to start the new game so that was
a<00:01:28.020> really<00:01:28.409> challenging<00:01:28.649> time<00:01:29.249> ten<00:01:30.149> years<00:01:30.299> ago

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
a really challenging time ten years ago

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.080 
a really challenging time ten years ago
I<00:01:30.539> remember<00:01:30.689> insomniac<00:01:31.560> we<00:01:32.009> were<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.310> one<00:01:32.549> big

algebra and I think we were all looking

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.190 
algebra and I think we were all looking
for<00:01:57.119> something<00:01:57.420> different<00:01:57.630> because<00:01:58.020> we've

for something different because we've

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.050 
for something different because we've
been<00:01:58.319> working<00:01:58.439> on<00:01:58.679> Spyro<00:01:58.950> yeah<00:01:59.249> years<00:01:59.639> and<00:01:59.939> we

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
just didn't we were thinking we got a

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.919 
just didn't we were thinking we got a
brain<00:02:01.679> yeah<00:02:01.829> I'm<00:02:02.069> too<00:02:02.399> cute<00:02:02.609> anymore<00:02:02.849> yeah<00:02:03.450> we

had<00:02:04.259> multiple<00:02:04.709> like<00:02:04.859> round<00:02:05.069> tables<00:02:05.369> everyone

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
had multiple like round tables everyone

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.940 
had multiple like round tables everyone
get<00:02:05.880> together<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.119> fish<00:02:06.389> and<00:02:06.599> I<00:02:06.659> think<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.679> was<00:02:07.799> L

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950

I<00:02:24.550> think<00:02:24.700> at<00:02:24.790> one<00:02:24.819> point<00:02:24.940> she<00:02:25.390> was<00:02:25.470> like<00:02:26.470> this

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
I think at one point she was like this

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.280 
I think at one point she was like this
dark-haired<00:02:27.250> short<00:02:27.940> like<00:02:28.480> ten<00:02:28.780> year<00:02:28.930> old<00:02:29.050> girl

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
and she kind of started to age yes she

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.050 
and she kind of started to age yes she
came<00:02:31.810> I<00:02:32.080> think<00:02:32.319> we<00:02:32.560> realized<00:02:33.250> that<00:02:33.459> she<00:02:33.849> was

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
came I think we realized that she was

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.130 
came I think we realized that she was
too<00:02:34.450> generic<00:02:35.440> looking<00:02:35.830> and<00:02:36.190> then<00:02:37.120> we<00:02:37.630> started

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
too generic looking and then we started

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.960 
too generic looking and then we started
experimenting<00:02:38.470> with<00:02:38.739> a<00:02:38.769> very<00:02:39.130> tan<00:02:39.640> girl<00:02:39.790> with

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
arms that would start glowing when she

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.890

maybe<00:02:50.890> this<00:02:51.010> isn't<00:02:51.190> right<00:02:51.430> but<00:02:51.579> I<00:02:51.640> recall<00:02:52.030> most

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
maybe this isn't right but I recall most

I<00:04:06.010> don't<00:04:06.549> know<00:04:06.609> if<00:04:06.670> we<00:04:06.760> ever<00:04:06.790> got<00:04:07.060> that<00:04:07.239> off<00:04:07.389> of

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
I don't know if we ever got that off of

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.370 
I don't know if we ever got that off of
paper<00:04:07.840> but<00:04:08.459> it<00:04:09.459> sounded<00:04:09.700> pretty<00:04:09.880> cool

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
paper but it sounded pretty cool

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.150 
paper but it sounded pretty cool
something<00:04:11.380> else<00:04:11.590> that<00:04:11.739> happened<00:04:12.040> with<00:04:12.130> that

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
something else that happened with that

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.509 
something else that happened with that
project<00:04:12.430> that<00:04:13.530> probably<00:04:14.530> wasn't<00:04:14.769> as<00:04:14.980> a<00:04:15.010> parent

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
project that probably wasn't as a parent

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.849 
project that probably wasn't as a parent
at<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.419> time<00:04:16.660> was<00:04:16.930> that<00:04:16.959> we<00:04:17.109> we<00:04:17.470> hit<00:04:17.650> this

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
at the time was that we we hit this

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.890 
at the time was that we we hit this
no-man's<00:04:18.639> land<00:04:18.789> in<00:04:19.060> terms<00:04:19.239> of<00:04:19.389> our<00:04:19.479> art<00:04:19.660> style

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
no-man's land in terms of our art style

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.659 
no-man's land in terms of our art style
where<00:04:20.349> we<00:04:20.380> were<00:04:20.560> going<00:04:20.889> from<00:04:21.039> Spiro<00:04:21.459> to

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
where we were going from Spiro to

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.339 
where we were going from Spiro to
something<00:04:22.150> that<00:04:22.180> we<00:04:22.360> profess<00:04:22.720> to<00:04:22.780> us<00:04:23.050> for<00:04:23.320> a

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.349 
something that we profess to us for a

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:25.950 
something that we profess to us for a
mature<00:04:23.680> audience<00:04:23.740> and<00:04:24.430> it<00:04:25.210> ended<00:04:25.450> up

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
mature audience and it ended up

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.140 
mature audience and it ended up
looking<00:04:26.139> back<00:04:26.259> at<00:04:26.289> the<00:04:26.710> videos<00:04:27.310> pretty<00:04:28.000> darn

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
looking back at the videos pretty darn

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.360 
looking back at the videos pretty darn
cartoony<00:04:28.569> still<00:04:28.990> another<00:04:29.889> character<00:04:30.190> change

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
cartoony still another character change

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.680 
cartoony still another character change
so<00:04:30.460> many<00:04:30.610> times<00:04:30.729> I<00:04:30.880> think<00:04:31.030> people<00:04:31.240> just<00:04:31.509> had<00:04:31.660> a

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
so many times I think people just had a

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.719 
so many times I think people just had a
hard<00:04:31.900> time<00:04:32.009> every<00:04:33.009> single<00:04:33.130> time<00:04:33.310> you<00:04:33.520> would<00:04:33.639> do

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
hard time every single time you would do

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.339 
hard time every single time you would do
something<00:04:34.060> and<00:04:34.330> then<00:04:34.479> have<00:04:34.660> to<00:04:34.780> a<00:04:34.810> couple

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:35.349 
something and then have to a couple

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:36.809 
something and then have to a couple
months<00:04:35.470> later<00:04:35.560> to<00:04:35.800> redo<00:04:36.069> the<00:04:36.160> whole<00:04:36.220> thing<00:04:36.340> you

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:36.819 
months later to redo the whole thing you

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:38.400 
months later to redo the whole thing you
just<00:04:37.030> lost<00:04:37.300> a<00:04:37.449> little<00:04:37.660> bit<00:04:37.780> of<00:04:37.840> energy<00:04:38.020> on<00:04:38.380> the

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
just lost a little bit of energy on the

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.920 
just lost a little bit of energy on the
project<00:04:38.830> I<00:04:39.160> just<00:04:39.550> remember<00:04:39.940> working<00:04:40.479> on<00:04:40.690> a<00:04:40.720> map

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
project I just remember working on a map

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.900 
project I just remember working on a map
for<00:04:41.199> i-5<00:04:41.620> and<00:04:41.650> I<00:04:42.099> was<00:04:42.220> making<00:04:42.639> these<00:04:42.729> little

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
for i-5 and I was making these little

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.909 
for i-5 and I was making these little
fine<00:04:43.330> adjustments<00:04:44.289> I<00:04:44.440> kept<00:04:44.680> being<00:04:44.800> as

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
fine adjustments I kept being as

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.159 
fine adjustments I kept being as
creeping<00:04:45.400> feeling<00:04:46.030> that<00:04:46.240> this<00:04:46.840> was<00:04:47.020> all

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
creeping feeling that this was all

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.270 
creeping feeling that this was all
pointless<00:04:49.349> my<00:04:50.349> new<00:04:50.530> things<00:04:50.830> here<00:04:51.069> there's

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
pointless my new things here there's

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.260 
pointless my new things here there's
moving<00:04:51.550> enemy<00:04:51.759> a<00:04:51.789> little<00:04:51.970> bit<00:04:52.060> to<00:04:52.150> the<00:04:52.240> left

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
moving enemy a little bit to the left

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.300 
moving enemy a little bit to the left
and<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:53.259> project<00:04:53.590> actually<00:04:53.710> I<00:04:53.889> cancelled

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
and the project actually I cancelled

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:00.360 
and the project actually I cancelled
that<00:04:54.430> day<00:04:56.490> my<00:04:57.490> sixth<00:04:57.819> sense<00:04:57.849> kicked<00:04:58.330> in<00:04:58.539> I<00:04:59.370> mean

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
that day my sixth sense kicked in I mean

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.909 
that day my sixth sense kicked in I mean
honestly<00:05:00.610> I<00:05:00.669> thought<00:05:00.820> Sony<00:05:01.090> was<00:05:01.300> really

however we don't think that there's
going<00:05:15.520> to<00:05:15.580> be<00:05:15.639> a<00:05:15.729> market<00:05:15.910> for<00:05:16.060> this<00:05:16.300> game<00:05:16.539> and

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
going to be a market for this game and

and<00:05:18.430> it<00:05:18.520> was<00:05:18.610> cool<00:05:18.820> and<00:05:18.849> for<00:05:19.180> us<00:05:19.530> it<00:05:20.530> was<00:05:20.710> a

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
and it was cool and for us it was a

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.740 
and it was cool and for us it was a
right<00:05:20.919> approach<00:05:21.009> because<00:05:21.669> I<00:05:21.699> think<00:05:21.909> had<00:05:22.270> any

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
right approach because I think had any

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.499 
right approach because I think had any
publisher<00:05:23.169> come<00:05:23.380> in<00:05:23.500> and<00:05:23.620> said<00:05:24.210> we<00:05:25.210> don't<00:05:25.240> like

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:25.509 
publisher come in and said we don't like

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:27.270 
publisher come in and said we don't like
this<00:05:25.630> game<00:05:25.840> we<00:05:26.139> just<00:05:26.169> don't<00:05:26.470> don't<00:05:26.979> like<00:05:27.130> it

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
this game we just don't don't like it

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.529 
this game we just don't don't like it
we're<00:05:27.580> gonna<00:05:27.669> cancel<00:05:27.940> it<00:05:28.210> we<00:05:28.360> would<00:05:28.509> have

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
we're gonna cancel it we would have

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:29.909 
we're gonna cancel it we would have
fought<00:05:28.810> back<00:05:29.050> hard

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
fought back hard

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:31.409 
fought back hard
this<00:05:30.220> way<00:05:30.370> we<00:05:30.520> had<00:05:30.669> to<00:05:30.699> kind<00:05:30.849> of<00:05:30.940> look<00:05:31.090> inward

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
this way we had to kind of look inward

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.930 
this way we had to kind of look inward
and<00:05:31.599> say<00:05:31.780> okay<00:05:32.740> well<00:05:33.039> they're<00:05:33.550> telling<00:05:33.849> us

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
and say okay well they're telling us

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.399 
and say okay well they're telling us
this<00:05:34.180> and<00:05:34.330> wait<00:05:34.479> half<00:05:34.810> of<00:05:34.930> the<00:05:34.990> team<00:05:35.169> really

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:35.409 
this and wait half of the team really

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:37.560 
this and wait half of the team really
doesn't<00:05:35.680> like<00:05:35.740> this<00:05:35.860> game<00:05:36.070> anyway<00:05:36.310> so<00:05:36.570> they're

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
doesn't like this game anyway so they're

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.570 
doesn't like this game anyway so they're
right<00:05:37.810> we<00:05:38.560> should<00:05:38.710> do<00:05:38.800> something<00:05:39.099> different<00:05:39.130> I

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
right we should do something different I

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.399 
right we should do something different I
remember<00:05:40.000> driving<00:05:40.180> home<00:05:40.479> from<00:05:40.509> work<00:05:40.750> today

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
remember driving home from work today

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:44.159 
remember driving home from work today
when<00:05:41.740> cancelled<00:05:42.310> and<00:05:42.520> and<00:05:42.909> it<00:05:43.090> felt<00:05:43.389> so<00:05:43.659> good

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
when cancelled and and it felt so good

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.770 
when cancelled and and it felt so good
I<00:05:44.440> felt<00:05:45.159> so<00:05:45.400> light<00:05:45.699> and<00:05:46.090> like<00:05:46.360> I<00:05:46.449> could<00:05:46.659> do

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
I felt so light and like I could do

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.659 
I felt so light and like I could do
anything<00:05:46.810> and<00:05:47.440> this<00:05:47.740> weight<00:05:48.099> had<00:05:48.340> just<00:05:48.520> been

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
anything and this weight had just been

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:50.909 
anything and this weight had just been
taken<00:05:48.849> away<00:05:49.120> from<00:05:49.270> us<00:05:49.570> and<00:05:49.750> I<00:05:49.840> think<00:05:49.900> that<00:05:50.320> made

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
taken away from us and I think that made

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:52.589 
taken away from us and I think that made
me<00:05:50.949> realize<00:05:51.219> that<00:05:51.610> tough<00:05:51.880> decisions<00:05:52.360> aren't

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
me realize that tough decisions aren't

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:54.600 
me realize that tough decisions aren't
bad<00:05:52.750> decisions<00:05:53.259> are<00:05:53.440> just<00:05:53.590> that<00:05:54.310> they're<00:05:54.490> the

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
bad decisions are just that they're the

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.790 
bad decisions are just that they're the
right<00:05:54.789> decision<00:05:55.330> and<00:05:55.509> I<00:05:55.960> think<00:05:56.560> the<00:05:56.650> whole

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
right decision and I think the whole

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.290 
right decision and I think the whole
studio<00:05:57.099> came<00:05:57.400> back<00:05:57.580> to<00:05:57.729> work<00:05:57.880> the<00:05:58.030> next<00:05:58.150> day

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
studio came back to work the next day

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.480 
studio came back to work the next day
and<00:05:58.509> just<00:05:58.630> just<00:05:59.289> like<00:05:59.500> build<00:05:59.919> into<00:06:00.250> the<00:06:00.370> new

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
and just just like build into the new

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.640 
and just just like build into the new
project<00:06:01.030> and<00:06:01.270> it<00:06:01.840> was<00:06:02.050> awesome<00:06:02.440> I<00:06:02.560> think

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
project and it was awesome I think

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.110 
project and it was awesome I think
that's<00:06:02.979> a<00:06:03.070> big<00:06:03.219> lesson<00:06:03.370> that<00:06:03.610> we<00:06:03.699> all<00:06:03.820> learned

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
that's a big lesson that we all learned

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.459 
that's a big lesson that we all learned
is<00:06:04.360> that<00:06:04.389> you<00:06:04.630> can<00:06:04.780> be<00:06:04.870> very<00:06:04.990> close<00:06:05.259> to

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:05.469 
is that you can be very close to

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:07.909 
is that you can be very close to
something<00:06:05.889> but<00:06:06.130> it's<00:06:06.520> just<00:06:06.699> not<00:06:06.849> working<00:06:07.090> and

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
something but it's just not working and

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:10.140 
something but it's just not working and
repeatedly<00:06:08.919> you're<00:06:09.310> hearing<00:06:09.580> from<00:06:09.610> your<00:06:09.909> team

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
repeatedly you're hearing from your team

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.629 
repeatedly you're hearing from your team
that's<00:06:10.539> not<00:06:10.840> working<00:06:11.050> that<00:06:11.289> it's<00:06:12.280> just<00:06:12.460> best

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 
that's not working that it's just best

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.879 
that's not working that it's just best
to<00:06:12.789> kill<00:06:13.570> it<00:06:13.719> move<00:06:13.840> on<00:06:13.960> to<00:06:14.050> something<00:06:14.349> new<00:06:14.500> you

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:14.889 
to kill it move on to something new you

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:16.800 
to kill it move on to something new you
spent<00:06:15.159> so<00:06:15.370> much<00:06:15.490> time<00:06:15.550> on<00:06:15.820> paper<00:06:16.389> and

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
spent so much time on paper and

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.529 
spent so much time on paper and
discussions<00:06:17.710> and<00:06:18.009> arguments<00:06:18.789> about<00:06:19.120> the<00:06:19.360> game

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:19.539 
discussions and arguments about the game

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:21.270 
discussions and arguments about the game
and<00:06:19.840> you<00:06:19.900> just<00:06:20.080> started<00:06:20.650> making<00:06:20.979> it<00:06:21.099> and

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 
and you just started making it and

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.100 
and you just started making it and
playing<00:06:22.000> it<00:06:22.240> I<00:06:22.449> think<00:06:22.690> we<00:06:22.780> could<00:06:22.900> have<00:06:22.990> learned

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
playing it I think we could have learned

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.480 
playing it I think we could have learned
those<00:06:23.320> lessons<00:06:23.349> a<00:06:23.770> lot<00:06:23.919> quicker<00:06:24.130> and<00:06:24.400> that's

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
those lessons a lot quicker and that's

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.700 
those lessons a lot quicker and that's
something<00:06:24.820> we're<00:06:25.090> really<00:06:25.360> committed<00:06:26.169> to<00:06:26.320> now

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
something we're really committed to now

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.680 
something we're really committed to now
and<00:06:27.039> it's<00:06:27.430> making<00:06:27.759> things<00:06:27.880> a<00:06:28.030> lot<00:06:28.150> better<00:06:28.389> I

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:28.690 
and it's making things a lot better I

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.540 
and it's making things a lot better I
kept<00:06:29.289> on<00:06:29.410> picking<00:06:29.650> cotton<00:06:29.830> we<00:06:30.009> do<00:06:30.100> everything

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.100 
kept on picking cotton we do everything
what<00:06:31.090> are<00:06:31.150> we<00:06:31.240> going<00:06:31.330> to<00:06:31.389> do<00:06:31.479> next<00:06:31.690> because<00:06:31.870> at

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
what are we going to do next because at

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.900 
what are we going to do next because at
that<00:06:32.229> point<00:06:32.440> we<00:06:32.620> hadn't<00:06:33.039> you<00:06:33.490> know<00:06:33.580> come<00:06:33.789> up

next<00:06:53.410> two<00:06:53.530> years<00:06:53.770> we<00:06:54.370> think<00:06:54.699> back<00:06:54.850> about<00:06:55.000> that

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240 
next two years we think back about that

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.779 
next two years we think back about that
with<00:06:55.720> mixed<00:06:55.990> feelings<00:06:56.289> I<00:06:56.500> you<00:06:57.039> know<00:06:57.130> some
