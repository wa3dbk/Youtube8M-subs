00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
find them they're not detectable like

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.700 
find them they're not detectable like
this<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.390> only<00:00:42.570> way<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.110> they'll<00:00:43.260> open<00:00:43.559> is

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
this the only way that they'll open is

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.830 
this the only way that they'll open is
with<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.070> door<00:00:44.519> knob<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.970> is<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.330> my<00:00:45.540> hand

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
with this door knob that is in my hand

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.450 
with this door knob that is in my hand
and<00:00:46.170> I'll<00:00:46.320> show<00:00:46.470> you<00:00:46.500> how<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.739> make<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.129> just

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
and I'll show you how to make that just

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.040 
and I'll show you how to make that just
a<00:00:47.550> minute<00:00:47.760> here<00:00:47.790> so<00:00:48.480> if<00:00:48.540> you<00:00:48.600> notice<00:00:48.750> there's

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
a minute here so if you notice there's

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.759 
a minute here so if you notice there's
brick<00:00:49.460> stone<00:00:50.460> cobblestone<00:00:51.360> dirt<00:00:51.840> wood<00:00:52.559> and

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
brick stone cobblestone dirt wood and

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:55.640 
brick stone cobblestone dirt wood and
sand<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.900> basically<00:00:54.900> that's<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.379> right<00:00:55.590> there

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
sand and basically that's it right there

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.130 
sand and basically that's it right there
so<00:00:56.040> if<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.190> click<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.460> again<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.330> I<00:00:57.780> can<00:00:57.960> close

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
so if I click it again and I can close

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.200 
so if I click it again and I can close
them<00:00:58.320> just<00:00:58.650> like<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:58.949> that's<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.670> only<00:01:00.089> way

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
them just like this that's the only way

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.880 
them just like this that's the only way
that<00:01:00.420> they<00:01:00.540> will<00:01:00.690> open<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.110> close<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.620> by<00:01:01.860> a

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
that they will open and close is by a

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.229 
that they will open and close is by a
doorknob<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.729> have<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.940> make<00:01:03.059> this

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
doorknob so you have to make this

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.090 
doorknob so you have to make this
special<00:01:03.479> doorknob<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.170> then<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.739> can<00:01:04.890> create

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
special doorknob and then you can create

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.210 
special doorknob and then you can create
this<00:01:05.309> hidden<00:01:05.670> entrance<00:01:06.120> into<00:01:07.100> however<00:01:08.100> you

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
this hidden entrance into however you

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.310 
this hidden entrance into however you
want<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.430> do<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.700> your<00:01:08.880> base<00:01:09.090> or<00:01:09.570> whatever<00:01:10.110> I

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
want to do it your base or whatever I

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.050 
want to do it your base or whatever I
think<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.040> pretty<00:01:11.190> neat<00:01:11.400> little<00:01:11.580> mod<00:01:11.820> I

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
think it's a pretty neat little mod I

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.300 
think it's a pretty neat little mod I
think<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.479> has<00:01:12.659> once<00:01:13.470> again<00:01:13.590> likes<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.190> grow

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
think it has once again likes to grow

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.789 
think it has once again likes to grow

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
wide like this would be cool to have the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.320 
wide like this would be cool to have the
other<00:02:07.470> one<00:02:07.710> right<00:02:07.950> here<00:02:08.310> where<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:09.060> could<00:02:09.179> do

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
other one right here where you could do

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.809

this<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.810> do<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.409> same<00:02:10.590> thing<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.640> went

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
this and do the same thing and it went

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.180 
this and do the same thing and it went
down<00:02:12.060> almost<00:02:12.420> like<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:13.110> adjusted<00:02:13.590> itself<00:02:13.890> like

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
down almost like it adjusted itself like

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.550

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560
