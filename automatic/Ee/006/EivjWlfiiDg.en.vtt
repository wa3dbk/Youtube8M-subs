00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.390
 happy 

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:07.300
 to make goals always important to 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.930
 we carry on but my 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.960
 priority is always to help 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.090
 help the team 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.940
 this is my full job india grabbing 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.839
 a contribution 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.839
 on the bench 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.329
 are situations that can happen in the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.599
 match very well the team was 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:33.059
 lasting well but it can happen after 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.840
 he did well with two goals and 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.840
 then according to time 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.050
 I would try to help with a goal 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.550
 assistance some colleagues also and 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.550
 well we are happy 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:53.590
 how well we are happy with him 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:58.240
 fourth call one player more than 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.240
 can help we are happy about it 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.550
 but it's still not decided we have 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.980
 we go there and play and we know it's a 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.360
 complicated state against a good team 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:16.490
 but 30 is a good advantage but I think 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.070
 that we are going to go with the ambition of wanting 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.330
 score a goal and I thought that we can 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.330
 pass transition 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.770
 you say although some 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.990
 time but the truth that we are 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.810
 reacting well sometimes it seems that 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.690
 we have to make a goal to wake up 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.790
 but let's try to improve in this 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.150
 aspect of marking first that the 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.150
 adversaries 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.880
 very good golf too and michelena very 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.880
 it feels good 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.830
 I do not believe much miracles but 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.710
 it may be possible but now it's very 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.920
 difficult almost impossible but we have to 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.690
 to continue in football everything is possible and 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.910
 you have to win to at least win 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.220
 gain confidence for the champions and 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.320
 for the cup in this case because winning 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.600
 always gives confidence and this puestamente 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.600
 what we have to have if it's not worth
