00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
your guest operating system is as if it

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.030 
your guest operating system is as if it
was<00:02:35.860> just<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.400> native<00:02:36.790> application<00:02:37.739> running<00:02:38.739> in

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
was just a native application running in

was just a native application running in

whatever your host operating system is
in<00:02:41.530> this<00:02:41.709> case<00:02:41.950> we've<00:02:42.160> got<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.340> Linux<00:02:42.989> program

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
in this case we've got a Linux program

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.580 
in this case we've got a Linux program
running<00:02:44.290> as<00:02:45.299> learning<00:02:46.299> in<00:02:46.480> Windows<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.049> here

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
running as learning in Windows and here

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.240 
running as learning in Windows and here
we<00:02:47.799> can<00:02:47.950> still<00:02:49.380> using<00:02:50.380> what's<00:02:50.980> known<00:02:51.040> as

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
we can still using what's known as

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.729 
we can still using what's known as
vmware<00:02:51.519> tools<00:02:51.880> which<00:02:52.600> are<00:02:52.870> likely<00:02:53.320> installs

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
vmware tools which are likely installs

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:01.199 
vmware tools which are likely installs
we're<00:02:54.549> going<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:54.730> copy<00:02:54.940> this<00:02:55.090> image<00:02:59.040> and<00:03:00.209> paste

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
we're going to copy this image and paste

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.210 
we're going to copy this image and paste
it<00:03:01.359> in<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.980> now<00:03:03.100> to<00:03:03.160> briefly<00:03:03.910> mention<00:03:05.220> vmware

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
it in and now to briefly mention vmware

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.319 
it in and now to briefly mention vmware
tools<00:03:06.400> again<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:07.870> basically<00:03:09.329> automatically

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
tools again it basically automatically

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.810 
tools again it basically automatically
installs<00:03:11.070> when<00:03:12.070> you're<00:03:12.190> installing<00:03:12.400> the

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
installs when you're installing the

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.520 
installs when you're installing the
operating<00:03:13.269> system<00:03:13.570> it'll<00:03:13.750> it'll<00:03:14.109> prompt<00:03:14.470> you

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
operating system it'll it'll prompt you

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.860 
operating system it'll it'll prompt you
do<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:15.609> install<00:03:15.970> so<00:03:16.859> there's<00:03:17.859> nothing

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
do the install so there's nothing

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.250 
do the install so there's nothing
nothing<00:03:20.370> complex<00:03:21.370> that<00:03:21.549> you<00:03:21.609> have<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:21.820> do<00:03:22.260> and

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
nothing complex that you have to do and

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.620 
nothing complex that you have to do and
we're<00:03:23.410> just<00:03:23.470> going<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:23.709> get<00:03:23.890> rid<00:03:23.980> of<00:03:24.100> that<00:03:24.630> go

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
we're just going to get rid of that go

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.430 
we're just going to get rid of that go
out<00:03:25.720> of<00:03:25.989> unity<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:27.840> yeah<00:03:28.840> I<00:03:28.870> guess<00:03:29.170> that's

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
out of unity and yeah I guess that's

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.699 
out of unity and yeah I guess that's
about<00:03:29.709> all<00:03:30.069> we're<00:03:30.519> going<00:03:30.640> to<00:03:30.700> do<00:03:30.910> with<00:03:31.540> that<00:03:31.709> so

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
about all we're going to do with that so

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.080 
about all we're going to do with that so
