00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.329 

let's<00:00:01.439> see<00:00:01.589> the<00:00:01.709> reactions<00:00:02.280> of<00:00:02.520> aldehydes<00:00:03.240> and

00:00:04.329 --> 00:00:04.339 
let's see the reactions of aldehydes and

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:06.499 
let's see the reactions of aldehydes and
we're<00:00:05.339> going<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.580> start<00:00:05.819> with<00:00:06.000> a<00:00:06.029> reaction

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
we're going to start with a reaction

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.690 
we're going to start with a reaction
that<00:00:06.540> I<00:00:06.720> need<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.109> remind<00:00:07.259> you<00:00:07.680> of<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:08.490> it's

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
that I need to remind you of and it's

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.299 
that I need to remind you of and it's
that<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.120> aldehyde<00:00:09.660> can<00:00:10.050> still<00:00:10.440> be<00:00:10.679> oxidized

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
that the aldehyde can still be oxidized

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.480 
that the aldehyde can still be oxidized
to<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.240> carboxylic<00:00:12.840> acid<00:00:13.440> so<00:00:14.160> you<00:00:14.219> need<00:00:14.460> a

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
to the carboxylic acid so you need a

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.200 
to the carboxylic acid so you need a
chromium<00:00:15.089> 6<00:00:15.389> reagent<00:00:16.789> whenever<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:18.029> use

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
chromium 6 reagent whenever you use

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.769 
chromium 6 reagent whenever you use
chromium<00:00:19.160> you<00:00:20.160> have<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.580> in<00:00:20.730> sulfuric<00:00:21.150> acid

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
chromium you have it in sulfuric acid

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.660 
chromium you have it in sulfuric acid
and<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:23.960> aldehyde<00:00:24.960> will<00:00:25.289> get<00:00:25.710> oxidized<00:00:26.310> all

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
and the aldehyde will get oxidized all

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.140 
and the aldehyde will get oxidized all
the<00:00:27.090> way<00:00:27.240> up<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.260> carboxylic<00:00:28.980> acid<00:00:29.609> we

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
the way up to the carboxylic acid we

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.179 
the way up to the carboxylic acid we
learn<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.539> reaction<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.380> last<00:00:31.590> semester

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
learn this reaction in the last semester

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.160 
learn this reaction in the last semester
but<00:00:32.369> i<00:00:32.430> need<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.730> actually<00:00:33.000> remind<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:34.020> it

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
but i need to actually remind you of it

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.380 
but i need to actually remind you of it
because<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.040> next<00:00:35.250> couple<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.760> chapters<00:00:36.030> are

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
because the next couple of chapters are

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.110 
because the next couple of chapters are
going<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.630> be<00:00:36.719> about<00:00:36.870> carboxylic<00:00:37.590> acids<00:00:38.160> now

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
going to be about carboxylic acids now

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.970 
going to be about carboxylic acids now
in<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:39.450> react<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.500> chapter<00:00:40.829> we

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
in this react and in this chapter we

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.880 
in this react and in this chapter we
also<00:00:41.309> learn<00:00:41.730> how<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:42.059> reduce<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:43.590> carbon

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
also learn how to reduce the carbon

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.760 
also learn how to reduce the carbon
oxygen<00:00:44.399> double<00:00:44.550> bond<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.300> we<00:00:45.930> need<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> hydride

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
oxygen double bond and we need a hydride

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.880 
oxygen double bond and we need a hydride
reagent<00:00:47.370> for<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.820> we<00:00:48.750> have<00:00:49.050> lithium

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
reagent for that we have lithium

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.790 
reagent for that we have lithium
aluminum<00:00:50.610> hydride<00:00:51.379> lithium<00:00:52.379> aluminum

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
aluminum hydride lithium aluminum

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.939 
aluminum hydride lithium aluminum
hydride<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.610> very<00:00:54.180> strong<00:00:54.690> reducing<00:00:55.199> agent

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
hydride is a very strong reducing agent

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.430 
hydride is a very strong reducing agent
when<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.940> use<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.420> use<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:57.930> an<00:00:58.050> ether

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
when you use it you use it in an ether

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.420 
when you use it you use it in an ether
solvent<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.840> thf<00:01:00.840> would<00:01:01.649> be<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.829> good<00:01:02.100> solvent

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
solvent so thf would be a good solvent

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
solvent so thf would be a good solvent
for<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.530> it's<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:05.070> two-step<00:01:05.580> process<00:01:05.909> after

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
for it and it's a two-step process after

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.300 
for it and it's a two-step process after
you<00:01:06.780> finish<00:01:07.200> with<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.470> lithium<00:01:07.890> aluminum

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
you finish with the lithium aluminum

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.520 
you finish with the lithium aluminum
hydride<00:01:08.570> you<00:01:09.570> need<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.930> quench<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.500> reaction

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
hydride you need to quench the reaction

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.840 
hydride you need to quench the reaction
and<00:01:11.220> we<00:01:11.310> use<00:01:11.490> distilled<00:01:11.700> water<00:01:12.299> for<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:13.470> and

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
and we use distilled water for that and

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.010 
and we use distilled water for that and
what<00:01:14.850> we're<00:01:15.090> going<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.390> do<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.840> we're

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
what we're going to do is that we're

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.560 
what we're going to do is that we're
going<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.229> add<00:01:16.380> hydrogen<00:01:17.000> across<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.210> double

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
going to add hydrogen across the double

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.300 
going to add hydrogen across the double
bond<00:01:19.310> we<00:01:20.310> discuss<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.970> mechanism<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.750> it

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
bond we discuss the mechanism of it

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.749 
bond we discuss the mechanism of it
during<00:01:23.310> class<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:24.030> go<00:01:24.780> ahead<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.200> review<00:01:25.560> it

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
during class so go ahead and review it

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.810 
during class so go ahead and review it
but<00:01:26.759> we<00:01:27.240> go<00:01:27.420> from<00:01:27.659> an<00:01:27.810> aldehyde<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:29.070> primary

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
but we go from an aldehyde to a primary

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.050 
but we go from an aldehyde to a primary
alcohol<00:01:33.500> we<00:01:34.500> could<00:01:34.829> go<00:01:35.070> ahead<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.549> use<00:01:35.700> sodium

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
alcohol we could go ahead and use sodium

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.289 
alcohol we could go ahead and use sodium
borohydride<00:01:37.009> sodium<00:01:38.009> borohydride<00:01:38.189> will<00:01:39.030> give

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
borohydride sodium borohydride will give

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.069 
borohydride sodium borohydride will give
you<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.689> exact<00:01:40.200> same<00:01:40.700> primary<00:01:41.700> alcohol<00:01:42.540> but

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
you the exact same primary alcohol but

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.660 
you the exact same primary alcohol but
it's<00:01:43.259> easier<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.950> work<00:01:44.100> with<00:01:44.159> sodium

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
it's easier to work with sodium

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.490 
it's easier to work with sodium
borohydride<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.689> don't<00:01:45.840> have<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.110> be<00:01:46.259> so

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
borohydride you don't have to be so

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.219 
borohydride you don't have to be so
worried<00:01:46.860> about<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.250> moisture<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> air

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
worried about the moisture in the air

it and there's still a hydrogen there
and<00:03:06.460> that<00:03:07.460> would<00:03:07.610> be<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:07.880> first<00:03:08.150> step<00:03:08.360> of<00:03:08.720> the

so<00:04:32.150> I<00:04:32.180> can<00:04:32.509> go<00:04:32.659> back<00:04:32.930> to<00:04:32.990> my<00:04:33.349> own<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.740> hide<00:04:33.919> by

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:34.159 
so I can go back to my own the hide by

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:36.399 
so I can go back to my own the hide by
just<00:04:34.430> adding<00:04:34.610> water<00:04:34.939> and<00:04:35.330> a<00:04:35.780> little<00:04:35.810> bit<00:04:36.139> of<00:04:36.199> a

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:36.409 
just adding water and a little bit of a

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:40.149 
just adding water and a little bit of a
sin<00:04:36.710> and<00:04:37.030> we<00:04:38.030> use<00:04:38.210> it<00:04:38.389> as<00:04:38.479> a<00:04:38.569> protection<00:04:38.990> so<00:04:39.830> we

00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:40.159 
sin and we use it as a protection so we

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:44.080 
sin and we use it as a protection so we
protect<00:04:40.669> carbonyls<00:04:41.449> this<00:04:41.840> way<00:04:42.400> but<00:04:43.400> it's<00:04:43.819> much

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
protect carbonyls this way but it's much

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.629 
protect carbonyls this way but it's much
better<00:04:44.300> if<00:04:44.479> we<00:04:44.689> try<00:04:44.960> to<00:04:45.020> make<00:04:45.500> a<00:04:45.639> five-member

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 
better if we try to make a five-member

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.209 
better if we try to make a five-member
ring<00:04:46.879> out<00:04:47.240> of<00:04:47.449> the<00:04:47.900> acetyl<00:04:48.590> and<00:04:48.830> that's<00:04:49.009> where

00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:49.219 
ring out of the acetyl and that's where

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:52.390 
ring out of the acetyl and that's where
ethylene<00:04:49.699> glycol<00:04:50.240> comes<00:04:50.990> in<00:04:51.229> so<00:04:51.949> you<00:04:52.009> use<00:04:52.370> that

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
ethylene glycol comes in so you use that

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.219 
ethylene glycol comes in so you use that
link<00:04:52.909> like<00:04:53.180> all<00:04:53.449> and<00:04:54.879> instead<00:04:55.879> of<00:04:56.180> using<00:04:56.449> HCL

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
link like all and instead of using HCL

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.179 
link like all and instead of using HCL
gas<00:04:57.500> we<00:04:58.189> could<00:04:58.400> also<00:04:58.550> use<00:04:58.789> toxic<00:04:59.330> acid<00:05:00.080> or<00:05:00.710> para

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:01.189 
gas we could also use toxic acid or para

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:03.429 
gas we could also use toxic acid or para
toledo<00:05:01.639> sulphonic<00:05:02.270> acid<00:05:02.270> it's<00:05:02.930> an<00:05:03.289> organic

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:03.439 
toledo sulphonic acid it's an organic

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:07.179 
toledo sulphonic acid it's an organic
acid<00:05:04.189> and<00:05:05.229> the<00:05:06.229> good<00:05:06.529> thing<00:05:06.560> about<00:05:06.860> this

00:05:07.179 --> 00:05:07.189 
acid and the good thing about this

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:09.839 
acid and the good thing about this
reaction<00:05:07.849> is<00:05:07.939> that<00:05:08.150> we're<00:05:08.330> forming<00:05:08.900> a

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:09.849 
reaction is that we're forming a

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:15.820 
reaction is that we're forming a
five-member<00:05:10.849> ring<00:05:12.310> and<00:05:14.080> the<00:05:15.080> five-member

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
five-member ring and the five-member

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.700 
five-member ring and the five-member
ring<00:05:16.069> again<00:05:16.490> it's<00:05:16.699> an<00:05:16.879> asset<00:05:17.180> Alice<00:05:17.599> well<00:05:17.870> but

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
ring again it's an asset Alice well but

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.059 
ring again it's an asset Alice well but
five-member<00:05:19.400> ring<00:05:19.610> formations<00:05:20.330> are<00:05:20.479> favored

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:21.069 
five-member ring formations are favored

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:23.529 
five-member ring formations are favored
so<00:05:22.069> this<00:05:22.340> is<00:05:22.370> the<00:05:22.729> way<00:05:22.909> that<00:05:23.150> we<00:05:23.330> protect

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:23.539 
so this is the way that we protect

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:26.529 
so this is the way that we protect
carbonyls<00:05:24.409> in<00:05:24.710> lab<00:05:24.919> if<00:05:25.250> you<00:05:25.909> want<00:05:26.120> to<00:05:26.210> take<00:05:26.389> the

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 
carbonyls in lab if you want to take the

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:28.570 
carbonyls in lab if you want to take the
protecting<00:05:27.110> group<00:05:27.379> than<00:05:27.590> you<00:05:27.740> and<00:05:27.919> water<00:05:28.250> a

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
protecting group than you and water a

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.779 
protecting group than you and water a
little<00:05:29.210> bit<00:05:29.449> of<00:05:29.539> acid<00:05:29.719> so<00:05:30.259> you<00:05:30.370> hydrolyze<00:05:31.370> the

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
little bit of acid so you hydrolyze the

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:36.219 
little bit of acid so you hydrolyze the
apatow<00:05:32.300> and<00:05:32.599> get<00:05:33.169> back<00:05:33.469> your<00:05:33.710> aldehyde
