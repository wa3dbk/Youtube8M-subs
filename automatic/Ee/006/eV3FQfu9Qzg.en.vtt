00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.679
 hello to all and welcome to the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.259
 route ag2r the world to the summary of 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.940
 this show the backstage how the 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.379
 runners manage their sleep during 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.920
 the tour is hubert dupont who we 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.699
 explain 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.189
 finally the debrief and finally know 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.750
 you're in laser tail it's john 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:33.239
 gadret and sébastien minard who we 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:35.940
 explain it's gone yet and 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.800
 it is conductive with respect to that 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.450
 the stages end around 5:30 in 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.309
 mean and crazy we have long 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.120
 transfers whose contract this art the hotel 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.239
 and we have to do the massage 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.980
 after care like osteo baths 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.379
 cold water so it takes a lot of 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.690
 time and we go to the meal quite late and 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.039
 it's true that will fall asleep all 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.180
 following on digestion it's not easy 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.090
 so we still do layers 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.449
 and rather late on average it's between 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.850
 11:30 midnight when we go to bed and it's 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.100
 true to find the sleep voice 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.660
 I must admit that I am rather rather 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.060
 late his hands it's unfortunate but 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.170
 so that we can sleep well what 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.400
 do not worry 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.460
 the human body is quite 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.490
 able to withstand this lack of 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.590
 deep sleep sleep since in 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.479
 does it's the body that is shot 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.660
 towards the competition the rules on monal 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.490
 are we in a state of stress and this 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.680
 state of stress is quite beneficial 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.820
 to succeed in his competition and the 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.380
 most of the time those who succeed 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.910
 successful performances they have 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.770
 makes a very bad night before a 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.369
 useful I use holds that I put 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.350
 under the bed for a little tilted bed 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.710
 so that allows the return a return 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.869
 venous easier what so these kinds 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.649
 of things I do every night 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:57.280
 before going to bed and afterwards it's more 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.840
 to prolong month sleep or if I 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.660
 am with a colleague who goes to bed 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.850
 a little later is to put a mask 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:08.380
 under the eyes like that one is 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.330
 the colleague he can continue to do that 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.720
 night to business are either the computer 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.860
 to tinker with something and not like 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.450
 that we are in the dark and we can 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.930
 fall asleep what is it you the body 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.400
 stay a little inactive and after that 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:37.570
 goes down a little bit in pressure and a 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:39.130
 little all these tests for the team at 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.860
 crazy match still proven today and 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.010
 thank you all for having worked well for 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.090
 I must do as much as I lean 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:52.630
 around tenth place 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:55.060
 it's cool we're going the best month we 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.670
 had chosen a morning briefing 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.220
 to send someone before actually 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.390
 the first good breakaway party with 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.840
 blel kadri 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.710
 blel was the strongest of this 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.870
 morning breakaway unfortunately 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.380
 the tactics of the peloton we decided 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.590
 otherwise since some teams have 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.270
 did their game applied their tactics 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.090
 and suddenly this break did not take 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:25.150
 a lot of time so blesle despite 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.470
 everything managed to pass a collar in mind and 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.050
 finish second 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.580
 of the last pass it was not enough for him 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.600
 to take the polka dot jersey it was one of 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.550
 goals of the day 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.750
 he finished tied on points with 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.610
 rolland stone but hey it's stone 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.570
 rolland canes jersey and then behind 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.460
 we knew there was some 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.960
 difficult technique when arriving on 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.440
 ajaccio with a wall a descent 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.140
 dangerous 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.340
 so the goal was on the one hand to 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.660
 to protect the best possible jeans 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.410
 christophe péraud keynote leader at 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.540
 General classification 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.790
 and then also to be able to make a place 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.470
 in sprint so we had envisioned that 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.760
 or samuel dumoulin facing the sprint 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.680
 today but like all the others 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.870
 sprinters jumped him he jumped 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.560
 also so we reported on christophe 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.640
 riblon in the race 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.310
 this opportunity to go do the 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.959
 sprinter christophe sprinted 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.400
 we will say without having a result 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.930
 extraordinary but fought well and 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.820
 the team worked well so we 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:19.340
 has a dynamic day where the team has 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:20.540
 weighed on the race anyway to titi 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.760
 done this year do not do it 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.440
 everywhere I like not settle down I 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.780
 often have a fight I'm all 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.280
 time that laser makes it so vincent 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.010
 the beloved not too much john goes back in time 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.750
 laser that I hear nothing and 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.830
 half and you take all the wind you see 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.200
 what's going on in front of you but you can not 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.970
 back up the table I can not t 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.620
 last of the most concrete so you wait 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.060
 that it regroups a little for 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.330
 just to be the last 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.550
 finally be that of the drc the shame of being 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.650
 clear no there we do not know that you get 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.530
 especially it is especially and that already it is 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.940
 no good it is so in front of his arm there is 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.330
 that two beaten lasers takes a rubber band 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.330
 in the mouth
