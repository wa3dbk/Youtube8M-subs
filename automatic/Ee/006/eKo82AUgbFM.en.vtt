once the progress bar filled up it shut
completely<00:01:33.329> off<00:01:33.479> again<00:01:33.840> then<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.829> eject<00:01:35.430> the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.240 
completely off again then you eject the
microSD<00:01:35.869> card<00:01:36.869> because<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.530> don't<00:01:37.860> want<00:01:38.130> it

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
microSD card because you don't want it

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.240 
microSD card because you don't want it
continually<00:01:39.030> booting<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.100> after<00:01:41.100> you've

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
continually booting to that after you've

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.639 
continually booting to that after you've
done<00:01:41.399> that<00:01:41.460> it'll<00:01:42.210> boot<00:01:42.509> up<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.840> it'll<00:01:43.439> be<00:01:43.619> a

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
done that it'll boot up and it'll be a

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.950 
done that it'll boot up and it'll be a
lot<00:01:43.829> slower<00:01:44.130> because<00:01:44.850> Android<00:01:45.509> takes<00:01:45.840> a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
lot slower because Android takes a

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.840 
lot slower because Android takes a
couple<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.290> minutes<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.770> load<00:01:47.009> up<00:01:47.189> every<00:01:47.610> time

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
couple of minutes to load up every time

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.870 
couple of minutes to load up every time
it's<00:01:48.090> working<00:01:48.600> from<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.869> fresh<00:01:49.110> image<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.880> then

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
it's working from a fresh image and then

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.569 
it's working from a fresh image and then
your<00:01:51.299> tablet<00:01:51.840> will<00:01:52.020> be<00:01:52.049> working<00:01:52.500> normally<00:01:52.740> now

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
your tablet will be working normally now

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.539 
your tablet will be working normally now
