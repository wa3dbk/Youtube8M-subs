00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
from bottom blue and then we have

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.740 
from bottom blue and then we have
control<00:01:54.039> again<00:01:54.399> we're<00:01:55.000> kind<00:01:55.240> of<00:01:55.330> using<00:01:55.569> an

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
control again we're kind of using an

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.080 
control again we're kind of using an
export<00:01:56.229> here<00:01:56.470> on<00:01:56.619> instant<00:01:57.069> respawn<00:01:57.610> and<00:01:57.909> the

passing mechanic to get an edge over our
opponents<00:02:01.090> and<00:02:01.210> there's<00:02:01.270> really<00:02:01.810> not<00:02:02.049> much

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
opponents and there's really not much

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.610 
opponents and there's really not much
they<00:02:02.590> can<00:02:02.649> do<00:02:02.860> about<00:02:02.890> it

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
they can do about it

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.260 
they can do about it
well<00:02:04.800> now<00:02:05.130> if<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.370> throw<00:02:05.580> the<00:02:05.760> ball<00:02:05.970> away

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
well now if you throw the ball away

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.000 
well now if you throw the ball away
though<00:02:06.720> which<00:02:06.990> I'm<00:02:07.170> going<00:02:07.260> to<00:02:07.410> do<00:02:07.500> here<00:02:07.530> in<00:02:07.920> a

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
though which I'm going to do here in a

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.370 
though which I'm going to do here in a
second<00:02:08.630> that's<00:02:09.630> one<00:02:09.900> way<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.290> can

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
second that's one way that you can

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.710 
second that's one way that you can
actually<00:02:10.680> give<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:11.220> other<00:02:11.370> team<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.970> pretty

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
actually give the other team a pretty

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.140 
actually give the other team a pretty
big<00:02:12.900> advantage<00:02:13.380> before<00:02:13.880> you<00:02:14.880> see<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.090> just

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
big advantage before you see I just

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.880 
big advantage before you see I just
throw<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.660> ball<00:02:15.810> away<00:02:16.020> that<00:02:16.320> way<00:02:16.500> because<00:02:16.740> I

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
throw the ball away that way because I

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.680 
throw the ball away that way because I
thought<00:02:17.070> somebody<00:02:17.400> was<00:02:17.520> down<00:02:17.730> there<00:02:18.000> now<00:02:18.630> the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
thought somebody was down there now the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.450 
thought somebody was down there now the
enemy<00:02:19.020> team<00:02:19.200> gets<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.500> ball<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:19.980> if<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.340> was

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
enemy team gets the ball and if it was

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.820 
enemy team gets the ball and if it was
good<00:02:20.670> at<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.850> passing<00:02:21.450> thank<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.500> probably

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
good at the passing thank the probably

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.170 
good at the passing thank the probably
maintain<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.310> ball<00:02:23.490> for<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.730> little<00:02:23.850> while<00:02:24.030> and

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
maintain the ball for a little while and

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.410 
maintain the ball for a little while and
potentially<00:02:24.720> win<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.020> game<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:26.060> think<00:02:27.060> that<00:02:27.240> be

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
potentially win the game I think that be

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.480 
potentially win the game I think that be
an<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:28.140> passing<00:02:28.530> mechanic<00:02:28.950> actually<00:02:29.310> makes

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
an the passing mechanic actually makes

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.490 
an the passing mechanic actually makes
this<00:02:29.610> game<00:02:29.820> a<00:02:29.880> little<00:02:30.120> hard<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.870> take<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.320> ball

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
this game a little hard to take the ball

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.890 
this game a little hard to take the ball
away<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.830> little<00:02:32.130> too<00:02:32.400> hard<00:02:32.670> I'm<00:02:33.480> well<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.720> think

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
away a little too hard I'm well I think

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.860 
away a little too hard I'm well I think
it's<00:02:34.170> fun<00:02:34.350> as<00:02:34.500> hell<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:34.980> hilarious<00:02:35.870> throwing

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
it's fun as hell and hilarious throwing

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.670 
it's fun as hell and hilarious throwing
a<00:02:36.930> giant<00:02:37.290> stole<00:02:37.590> around<00:02:37.770> I<00:02:38.280> just<00:02:39.530> you're<00:02:40.530> going

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
a giant stole around I just you're going

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.870 
a giant stole around I just you're going
to<00:02:40.770> see<00:02:40.890> in<00:02:40.980> this<00:02:41.070> video<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.460> think<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.850> only

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
to see in this video I think the only

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.810 
to see in this video I think the only
enemy<00:02:42.540> team<00:02:42.870> only<00:02:43.050> gets<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.530> know<00:02:43.890> double

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
enemy team only gets you know double

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.550 
enemy team only gets you know double
digit<00:02:45.120> points<00:02:45.150> like<00:02:45.690> low<00:02:45.930> double-digit

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
digit points like low double-digit

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.830 
digit points like low double-digit
points<00:02:46.740> and<00:02:47.100> we<00:02:47.610> often<00:02:47.790> win<00:02:48.150> these<00:02:48.270> games<00:02:48.330> we

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
points and we often win these games we

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.420 
points and we often win these games we
often<00:02:49.140> skunk<00:02:49.410> these<00:02:49.590> games<00:02:49.860> if<00:02:50.070> we<00:02:50.190> get<00:02:50.310> the

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
often skunk these games if we get the

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.390 
often skunk these games if we get the
ball<00:02:50.580> right<00:02:50.730> away<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:52.170> like<00:02:52.680> me<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:52.950> think<00:02:53.310> I

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
ball right away and like me I think I

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.250 
ball right away and like me I think I
know<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.060> reason<00:02:54.330> why<00:02:54.360> is<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.810> enemy<00:02:55.080> team

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
know the reason why is the enemy team

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.540 
know the reason why is the enemy team
gets<00:02:55.470> points<00:02:55.830> in<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:55.980> game<00:02:56.070> is<00:02:56.310> because<00:02:56.460> I

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
gets points in this game is because I

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.640 
gets points in this game is because I
threw<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.850> ball<00:02:57.000> away<00:02:57.150> now<00:02:58.020> remember<00:02:58.350> with

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
threw the ball away now remember with

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.680 
threw the ball away now remember with

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
this strat you want to space out use the

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.160 
this strat you want to space out use the
bottom<00:03:01.110> of<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.320> map<00:03:01.560> get<00:03:02.130> a<00:03:02.160> lot<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.430> space<00:03:02.880> and

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
bottom of the map get a lot of space and

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.300 
bottom of the map get a lot of space and
pack<00:03:04.170> us<00:03:04.380> on<00:03:04.560> throwing<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:04.920> ball<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.130> little
