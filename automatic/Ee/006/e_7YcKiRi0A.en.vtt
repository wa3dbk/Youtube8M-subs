00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.740
 to take the magnifying glass you need two 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.720
 fabrics that are 45 cm wide and so on 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.990
 about 1 meter 70 long 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.689
 I am as a material times a Us 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.359
 jersey fabric is the beautiful theme and 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.399
 a niki fabric he is nice and soft 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.710
 but you can also flow, for example 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.170
 use or jersey twice or 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.030
 twice nicky that's up to you 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.540
 In any case , you put the fabrics now 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.180
 to each other that the side after 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.350
 should be outside that the inside 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.879
 clash and the pages the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.190
 should not be seen afterwards 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.719
 they are now outside and then stuck 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.520
 you all together on a long side 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.590
 so looks now from quite ready 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.559
 was plugged 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:05.159
 So the inside pages are after 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.110
 be outside and here on the long side 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.750
 I've put everything together now 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.700
 still as a small tip if your fabric 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.369
 here also so world and you that 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.380
 disturbing you can wash the fabric before 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.780
 in the washing machine quite normal 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.049
 and then it starts a bit 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.850
 better to process and maybe 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.680
 I still staple with thread but I am 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.299
 honestly always too lazy for that 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.880
 that's why I just have it all right now 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.000
 stuck as usual and now 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.340
 is action sewing machines sewing machine 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.650
 I use the random number seven to her 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.009
 see here can be so I so 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.500
 wobbles so that is mixture of tens 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.210
 but just you and yours 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.180
 Sewing machine can not have the stitch 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.290
 her also in the normal zigzag stitch 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.390
 use it here 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.060
 then he just puts the fabric under it 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.700
 as usual and nice here 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.799
 unique along the beginning and the end 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.479
 should not forget to provide so 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.290
 take it back again and again 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.960
 again before 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.369
 that is no longer up and 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.590
 otherwise, not much can really be done 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.670
 Just go straight there 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.289
 lines 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.450
 we can see you now as 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.360
 next step again exactly the same 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.150
 do everything again so that too 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.610
 the pages that should be outside 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.250
 are inside again and then again 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.200
 stuck in the mud and then completely again 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.640
 Just take it as a friend already done 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.340
 now you have the second one coming too 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.650
 finished and as you can see, I have 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.360
 turned the material that is here are 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.060
 the outsides that you see afterwards 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.600
 should also be from the inside only 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.860
 here for the last and in the most difficult 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.280
 to move on 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.290
 Now you iron at the short ends 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.049
 once the track side so the side 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.769
 loads once ironed and on the other 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:59.040
 side as well where the opening is 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.769
 page here is also ironed so now 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.630
 Both sides are ironed and stuck 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:08.069
 just the ugly ending with me 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:11.100
 that I'm stuck because of the writing now 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:14.100
 Just go to the other end, then 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.250
 all end here is to come now 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.540
 between 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.880
 so it looks when it all now 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.579
 was plugged so if you are infected 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.530
 quite a bit further up to here and 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:29.790
 now it works, we can already see 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.650
 here on both sides the edges after 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.980
 inside and stuck 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.560
 So just living here will be like this 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.840
 now it's normal from the back city 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.810
 inside and on the other side 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.060
 the back side as well and is once 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.230
 straight along if it's yours 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.970
 it's a bit difficult then you can 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.489
 also just first the pages around here 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.319
 that they already painted so smooth 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.030
 are like me now then it works 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.290
 after that much easier to cities and it 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.329
 I would like you on the other side 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.829
 I also recommend here 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.750
 not done yet and you can do it 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.430
 Now I have to do it all extra 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.230
 fold again and there it is easy 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.130
 Much easier if I ever ironed 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.769
 before that and just how many around 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:16.799
 Plug yourself decide family 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:19.620
 It looks like this now so I have 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.750
 completed once the broad 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.330
 side along as you can see so 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.159
 look on the other side and 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.250
 now I do not talk to anyone 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:30.659
 along so that it almost both fabrics 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.440
 that it holds well and nothing more 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:35.190
 slips out 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.740
 At the beginning I think everything else 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.900
 good seal it is not anymore 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.030
 So hold on to call back 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.610
 keeps everything fine 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.830
 and otherwise use thread of it 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.720
 fits that he is not so noticeable 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.909
 So in a case of light blue that can 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.440
 you then see what suits your fabric 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:56.789
 and it just once along straight 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.669
 that's the end result for me now 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.659
 so here you can see the nazis and 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.090
 as you can see i have here 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:05.280
 sewn twice but it does not have to be 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.220
 I have made such an air as 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.440
 you can see here in gray and gray 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.210
 white striped and there I am with only 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.919
 made a night so you can 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.820
 because decide for yourself or maybe 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:19.640
 you see what works better 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:23.190
 and now I have a go in thailand 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.720
 so now the loop looks at me and 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.970
 I am really satisfied 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.370
 it's all really nice and soft 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.760
 warm and I feel totally well and 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.140
 I hope you liked the video 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.659
 and I would be glad if you have one 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.250
 leave a comment or 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:40.229
 just a thumbs up 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.430
 but I'm also happy about criticism 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.560
 then I know what I'll do next time 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.909
 can do better or maybe you have 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.979
 also ideas you I still take 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:48.300
 could in any case many thanks for 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:52.909
 watch and I hope it has you 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.909
