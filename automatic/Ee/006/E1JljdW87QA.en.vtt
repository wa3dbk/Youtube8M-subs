00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
also heart rate monitor just pull the

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:44.680 
also heart rate monitor just pull the
plastic<00:03:36.890> off<00:03:37.280> it<00:03:38.440> there<00:03:39.440> we<00:03:39.530> go<00:03:43.540> similarly<00:03:44.540> Z

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
plastic off it there we go similarly Z

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.960 
plastic off it there we go similarly Z
is<00:03:45.080> -<00:03:45.610> so<00:03:46.610> we<00:03:46.700> go<00:03:46.850> the<00:03:46.970> cell<00:03:47.210> it<00:03:47.810> pops<00:03:48.080> off<00:03:48.970> you

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
is - so we go the cell it pops off you

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.730 
is - so we go the cell it pops off you
can<00:03:50.180> take<00:03:50.300> the<00:03:50.420> Apple<00:03:50.600> watch<00:03:50.690> off<00:03:50.960> and<00:03:51.140> put<00:03:51.710> it

can take the Apple watch off and put it

00:03:51.740 --> 00:04:01.270 
can take the Apple watch off and put it
on<00:03:55.720> so<00:03:56.720> easy<00:03:56.990> is<00:03:57.200> to<00:03:57.320> do<00:03:57.500> up<00:03:57.650> there<00:03:59.890> we<00:04:00.890> go<00:04:01.040> very

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
on so easy is to do up there we go very

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.140 
on so easy is to do up there we go very
easy<00:04:01.400> to<00:04:01.610> do<00:04:01.760> up<00:04:02.560> quite<00:04:03.560> loose<00:04:03.800> so<00:04:04.550> let's<00:04:04.730> take

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
easy to do up quite loose so let's take

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.440 
easy to do up quite loose so let's take
a<00:04:05.180> few<00:04:05.420> links<00:04:05.630> out<00:04:06.730> so<00:04:07.730> we<00:04:07.850> see<00:04:08.030> how<00:04:08.090> easy<00:04:08.330> that

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
a few links out so we see how easy that

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.180 
a few links out so we see how easy that
is<00:04:08.630> to<00:04:08.780> do<00:04:10.990> so<00:04:11.990> yeah<00:04:12.170> just<00:04:12.590> push<00:04:12.800> that<00:04:12.830> one

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
is to do so yeah just push that one

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.539 
is to do so yeah just push that one
there<00:04:14.200> and<00:04:15.200> imagine<00:04:15.650> it<00:04:15.770> just<00:04:15.800> pops<00:04:16.250> out<00:04:16.489> like

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
there and imagine it just pops out like

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.740 
there and imagine it just pops out like
that<00:04:18.609> and<00:04:19.609> then<00:04:19.760> obviously<00:04:19.970> to<00:04:20.270> take<00:04:20.419> a<00:04:20.450> link

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
that and then obviously to take a link

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.830 
that and then obviously to take a link
out<00:04:21.669> just<00:04:22.669> do<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:22.880> same<00:04:23.060> thing<00:04:23.120> hold<00:04:23.690> that

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
out just do the same thing hold that

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.810 
out just do the same thing hold that
