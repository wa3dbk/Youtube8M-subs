00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.709
 these discs that are coming from 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:15.410
 drivers and hardware software programs do not 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.890
 they are software ok here we have some papers 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.170

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.340
 all these papers that they spend dude not 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.650
 no no no 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.989
 it was worth it to buy pure paper seriously 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.710
 and well let's see here we have more 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:33.490
 dry ice closed 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.790
 but we are not going to open the text well 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.790
 outside 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.239
 and good removing plastic as always 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.800
 nothing else 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.630
 good here in for example here is what 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.000
 that making the connections and we 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.580
 give two cartridges a good color one 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.080
 color a color cartridge and one in 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.750
 black and white tape a black and white 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.319
 obviously do not think that the cartridge 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.600
 colors because good to like this is going to say 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.690
 I do not know why wrapped in this way 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.970
 the printers that for example look 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.790
 all the tapes all the papers that 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.720
 they put the truth that is very very 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.600
 cagan is here 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.269
 and we are removing the first plastics 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.000
 from the top that they see 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.920
 example here I have to open the lid and 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.709
 I have to remove that tape is a 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.290
 Desmadre what these printers have 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.000
 but not at the end of all the fucking paper 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.750
 what has remained 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 printer and the truth is already using 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.069
 a while and it's very very 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.200
 printer for example here they have these 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.080
 little buttons and what I liked about 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.780
 this printer is that good is not 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.400
 it came out economically we are talking about 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.489
 about 70 dollars 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.079
 and what I liked about this is that not the 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.599
 I have to simply connect the 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:53.390
 connected to the network via wifi and good since 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.790
 anyone who connects to the network only 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.450
 makes a few small configurations and 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.040
 it simply pricks to print and 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.750
 automatically the printer detects that 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.939
 they sent him to print and there I do 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.849
 print ok does not need any cable 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:10.040
 etcetera ok and good because that would be all 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.230
 there is no more to show I am 93 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.849
 and see you up to a new video people or
