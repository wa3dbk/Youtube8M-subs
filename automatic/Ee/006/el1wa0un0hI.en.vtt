huge testament to the grace of God in
this<00:02:08.470> story<00:02:08.800> and<00:02:09.039> then<00:02:09.369> when<00:02:09.970> it<00:02:10.060> ends<00:02:10.330> with

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
this story and then when it ends with

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.690 
this story and then when it ends with
the<00:02:10.509> genealogy<00:02:11.080> I<00:02:11.110> love<00:02:11.440> that<00:02:11.650> because<00:02:11.860> it

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
the genealogy I love that because it

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.510 
the genealogy I love that because it
explains<00:02:13.240> not<00:02:14.020> just<00:02:14.380> why<00:02:14.500> Ruth<00:02:14.890> Boaz<00:02:15.130> and

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520

Naomi story was so important in and of

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.410 
Naomi story was so important in and of
themselves<00:02:17.170> but<00:02:17.710> it<00:02:17.830> shows<00:02:18.090> who<00:02:19.090> came<00:02:19.300> before

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
themselves but it shows who came before

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.870 
themselves but it shows who came before
them<00:02:19.600> and<00:02:19.900> what<00:02:20.230> their<00:02:20.770> legacy<00:02:21.190> meant<00:02:21.430> for

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
them and what their legacy meant for

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.640 
them and what their legacy meant for
everybody<00:02:22.060> who<00:02:22.240> came<00:02:22.390> after<00:02:22.540> him<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:23.020> how<00:02:23.530> it

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
everybody who came after him and how it

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.949 
everybody who came after him and how it
affected<00:02:23.980> all<00:02:24.160> of<00:02:24.220> history<00:02:24.490> so<00:02:25.360> it's<00:02:25.660> gonna<00:02:25.810> be

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
absolutely everybody's that same way

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.300

what's<00:03:21.320> been<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.530> most<00:03:21.620> meaningful<00:03:22.040> thing

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
what's been the most meaningful thing

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.620 
what's been the most meaningful thing
about<00:03:22.520> the<00:03:22.970> study<00:03:23.150> of<00:03:23.300> brief<00:03:23.600> about<00:03:24.170> this<00:03:25.630> I

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
about the study of brief about this I

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.890 
about the study of brief about this I
think<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.440> biggest<00:03:27.680> I<00:03:28.690> don't<00:03:29.690> know<00:03:29.750> if<00:03:29.810> I'd

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
think the biggest I don't know if I'd

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.130 
think the biggest I don't know if I'd
say<00:03:29.930> a<00:03:30.080> revelation<00:03:30.700> but<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:32.660> connection

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
say a revelation but the connection

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.090 
say a revelation but the connection
between<00:03:33.880> boas<00:03:34.880> is<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.650> kinsman<00:03:36.650> redeemer<00:03:36.739> and

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
between boas is the kinsman redeemer and

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.410 
between boas is the kinsman redeemer and
our<00:03:37.910> God<00:03:38.209> being<00:03:39.130> able<00:03:40.130> to<00:03:40.370> redeem<00:03:40.730> us<00:03:40.790> and<00:03:41.180> I

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
our God being able to redeem us and I

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.590 
our God being able to redeem us and I
just<00:03:41.630> think<00:03:41.810> that<00:03:42.019> I<00:03:42.260> never<00:03:43.420> thought<00:03:44.420> of<00:03:44.480> that

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
just think that I never thought of that

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.520 
just think that I never thought of that
and<00:03:45.200> I<00:03:45.320> think<00:03:45.380> that<00:03:46.300> it's<00:03:47.300> kind<00:03:47.540> of<00:03:47.690> made<00:03:48.350> me

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
and I think that it's kind of made me

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.670 
and I think that it's kind of made me
see<00:03:48.800> Boaz<00:03:49.310> in<00:03:49.519> a<00:03:49.610> new<00:03:49.730> light<00:03:49.970> but<00:03:50.450> also<00:03:50.690> you

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
see Boaz in a new light but also you

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.420 
see Boaz in a new light but also you
know<00:03:51.800> God<00:03:52.070> just<00:03:52.100> kind<00:03:52.760> of<00:03:53.920> walking<00:03:54.920> with<00:03:55.280> us

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
know God just kind of walking with us

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.000 
know God just kind of walking with us

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
Boas is really kind of a picture a

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.550 
Boas is really kind of a picture a
foreshadowing<00:04:16.390> of<00:04:16.570> Christ<00:04:16.870> right<00:04:17.350> and

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
foreshadowing of Christ right and

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.900 
foreshadowing of Christ right and
sometimes<00:04:17.859> I<00:04:18.100> don't<00:04:18.220> know<00:04:18.400> but<00:04:18.640> for<00:04:18.790> me<00:04:18.880> that

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
sometimes I don't know but for me that

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.810 
sometimes I don't know but for me that
growing<00:04:19.299> up<00:04:19.420> we<00:04:19.570> hear<00:04:19.810> about<00:04:20.530> Christ<00:04:21.459> and<00:04:21.670> when

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
growing up we hear about Christ and when

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.040 
growing up we hear about Christ and when
he<00:04:21.910> did<00:04:22.060> for<00:04:22.240> us<00:04:22.270> and<00:04:22.510> all<00:04:22.570> that<00:04:22.690> stuff<00:04:22.930> but

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
he did for us and all that stuff but

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.840 
he did for us and all that stuff but
then<00:04:23.260> when<00:04:23.380> you<00:04:23.470> actually<00:04:23.620> see<00:04:24.070> someone<00:04:24.760> like

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
then when you actually see someone like

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.120 
then when you actually see someone like
Boaz<00:04:25.210> you<00:04:25.390> can<00:04:25.510> kind<00:04:25.690> of<00:04:25.720> you<00:04:26.500> get<00:04:26.770> it<00:04:26.920> a<00:04:26.980> little

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
Boaz you can kind of you get it a little

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.860 
Boaz you can kind of you get it a little
bit<00:04:27.250> more<00:04:27.370> so<00:04:27.550> it's<00:04:27.670> a<00:04:27.730> it's<00:04:27.910> a<00:04:27.970> real<00:04:28.150> picture

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
bit more so it's a it's a real picture

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.090 
bit more so it's a it's a real picture
of<00:04:29.290> human<00:04:30.100> human<00:04:30.490> and<00:04:30.700> and<00:04:30.990> so<00:04:31.990> I<00:04:32.290> think<00:04:32.860> that's

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
of human human and and so I think that's

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.350 
of human human and and so I think that's
great<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:33.520> just<00:04:33.670> the<00:04:33.820> little<00:04:33.940> bits<00:04:34.240> and

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
great and just the little bits and

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.690 
great and just the little bits and
pieces<00:04:34.420> that<00:04:35.310> have<00:04:36.310> come<00:04:36.550> along<00:04:36.790> the<00:04:36.940> way<00:04:37.230> from

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
pieces that have come along the way from

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.659 
pieces that have come along the way from
how<00:04:39.700> God<00:04:40.200> provides<00:04:41.200> work<00:04:41.620> for<00:04:41.950> us<00:04:42.130> provides

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
how God provides work for us provides

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.200 
how God provides work for us provides
things<00:04:43.270> for<00:04:43.480> us<00:04:43.630> to<00:04:43.840> do<00:04:44.080> but<00:04:44.500> we<00:04:44.669> sometimes<00:04:45.669> we

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
things for us to do but we sometimes we

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.720 
things for us to do but we sometimes we
see<00:04:46.390> they<00:04:46.650> work<00:04:47.650> but<00:04:47.950> really<00:04:48.280> it's<00:04:48.460> his
