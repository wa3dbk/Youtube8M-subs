00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.710
 hello dear calm today there is something 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.960
 For the treats we'll have a look 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.599
 It is very delicate with port wine 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.989
 flauem and a wall in the end cream 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:28.630
 We need about half a glass for this 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:31.210
 plums keep fruits ten grams 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.980
 food starch 50 milliliters of one 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.489
 red port wine 100 grams 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.859
 marzipan paste 125 g quark with 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.710
 20 percent 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:45.309
 half a minute and 50 milliliters 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.519
 Whipped cream in a bowl we give 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.539
 something of the juice of the plums and 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:55.690
 Mix this with the reason 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:58.329
 food starch then we give the 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.109
 plums in a pot this den 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:10.409
 port wine then let everything go 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:10.409
 do not freeze up any more 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.730
 and then take the pot from 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.860
 stove and let the plums cool 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.660
 so that the marzipan raw mass is better 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.370
 process is we give it in shortly 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.870
 the microwave and there they are easy 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.520
 Now the food comes in a degree 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:29.680
 bowl the marzipan is crushed 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.210
 and mixed in the quark and whether he 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.550
 most creamy with each other 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.110
 mulled or rather a little coarser load 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.760
 you still decide your taste 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.670
 I like that we have a few small ones 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.409
 maxi two pieces are to be felt 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.430
 Now put the saale in a bowl and 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.020
 beat stiff and first set aside 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.310
 put 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.330
 because we need the likes for now 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:55.439
 a half vanilla pod this so 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.439
 cut open and scratch out the mark 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.080
 that was the market with the beaten 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.080
 mix cream 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.769
 the cream now carefully cushioned me 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:14.700
 the cvag marzipan water and stir 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.700
 gently with each other 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.430
 only under the very decorative 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.980
 cause 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.170
 For this we first place in suitable glasses 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.850
 a layer of quark cream now the 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.850
 cooled blue water on it 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.560
 Conclude back with a cream 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.910
 layer off the top layer decorate 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.250
 We do and we offer ourselves 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.940
 almonds or nuts that have their biggest 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.670
 or not 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.080
 or coconut I've got myself 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.390
 decided here for large forest breakfast 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.500
 the taste fit well with it and 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.810
 also look good 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.640
 I think this dessert is great 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.890
 and I like it too 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.110
 I hope you have fun with the 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.370
 preparation that taste until the 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.370
 next time 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.420
