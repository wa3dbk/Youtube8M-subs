00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.880
 Hi, how about I like to be with you 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.400
 again, I owe you this time 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.230
 video and then here it is already time that 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.940
 we have another opportunity to contact us 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.919
 to talk and exchange a 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.389
 little bit of ideas I'm your friend eduardo 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:19.740
 lopez navarro and this time I want to talk 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:23.160
 you about the crisis clown 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.890
 means the crisis of the clown the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.300
 men we usually go through three 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.099
 identity crisis in our lives 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.710
 normally the first one is at 30 the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.250
 second at 40 and the third is at 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.000
 50 depending how severe or how 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.770
 strong are the crises the initial or the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.840
 second or third depends on how it goes 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.270
 to be the one that follows for example if 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.490
 we have the crisis of the 30 very severe and 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.290
 we went through many difficulties because 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.990
 then that of the 40 should not be so 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.900
 intense in about 50 either that of the 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:01.220
 30 as that 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:03.710
 calm gentle fly then we have 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.580
 have to be afraid that it can happen to the 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.730
 of the 40 good of the 50 if the 230 and the 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.260
 of the 40 smoother and quieter there 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.060
 put on your seatbelt because 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.630
 that means that nothing 50 well is 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.490
 hard and when it comes hard it comes from the 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.440
 what I call the crisis of the 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.630
 clown what does the crisis of the 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.390
 clown simply and simply that is a 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.900
 stage where men come to 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.729
 question where we are at 50 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:35.060
 we look back we see what we have 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.830
 achieved and what we have not achieved we see 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.930
 where are we in terms of the plans 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.530
 that we set out to achieve when 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.869
 we were 20 30 years old and we see so many or 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.260
 how many of those plans have we been able to 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.440
 achieve if we do not achieve many and if you have not 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.930
 been much the achievement what we have been able 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.690
 monopolize or what we could find 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.100
 or acquire then we feel bad 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.960
 our low self-esteem 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.930
 we feel little thing we feel that 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.180
 we are incompetent 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.340
 in the same way we do not see anything else 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.560
 where are we in terms of where 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.690
 We wanted to be if we do not see 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.810
 time is running out what does it mean 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.240
 that means that already 50 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.620
 we generally believe that we are in the 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.200
 point of the mountain and from then on 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.820
 everything is down and honestly not 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.190
 we are at the tip of the mountain and 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.840
 we started to descend that mountain but 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.580
 well that's just going to make you 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.400
 feel worse when you hear this video 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.340
 we are in a position where we say no 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.590
 I have a lot of time left for everything that 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.600
 I had fun very little now when I 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.570
 I have fun when I have a good time 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.959
 when it's my turn to feel young, I'm 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.530
 young I'm attractive I'm attractive 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.940
 I still have the ability to conquer 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.950
 I can conquer a woman much more 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.920
 young that I or that security 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.530
 comes into question comes into question so 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.260
 we both make decisions that are good 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.049
 silly 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.909
 what we do we start to change the way 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.090
 in which we dress where before we 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:10.470
 we dressed in a way 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:13.020
 re caught of traditional 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.210
 quiet suddenly we started using 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.270
 clothes that nobody imagined we were going to 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.130
 typically use a few years ago 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.960
 He used the idea of ​​opening his shirt 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.780
 down here teach everything you have or 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.990
 you do not have in the chest and put a 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.740
 bunch of gold chains to give us 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:33.180
 that macho value if you want to see it 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:36.240
 We also started to see that there are gray hairs 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.280
 that we do not like the idea of having gray hair 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.290
 because gray hair means old age old age 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.030
 it implies that no one is going to talk to anyone 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.970
 he's going to pay attention then 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.320
 We decided to paint us that hair 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.050
 normally we do not do it in one color 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.959
 normal we do it in a color that is so 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.150
 obvious that it is false that color dye 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.020
 of black shoe for a person of 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:02.420
 fifty-something years looks very bad 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:04.850
 reddish blond mahogany 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.330
 whoever looks at us says this is from 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.500
 lies this is not real or we are not 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.160
 gentle are those who do things 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:17.100
 what we do we exaggerate the clothes 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.650
 change the hair color changes 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.350
 the amount of perfume that we use 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.050
 change suddenly you enter a room and 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.660
 there is no one who can stand the smell of what 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.490
 has exposed is penetrating is you 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.560
 penetrates through the nose for the ears 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.420
 the eyes through the pores you lock your 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.660
 breathing you lock your breath 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.610
 because we are trying to impress 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.640
 the worst of all is that we started 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.770
 spend a lot of money normally we already see 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.360
 that old cart that we have as not the 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.670
 cart that we should have but now 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.250
 we like a sports convertibles 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.870
 because because that draws attention and 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.450
 We are in a period of time where 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.000
 we want to draw attention also the 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.980
 clothes change the perfume changed the color 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.840
 of the hair 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.640
 change the car that we drive and from there 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.830
 change the couple we have 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.190
 We usually start looking for 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:11.640
 women much younger in their 20 20 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.630
 21 22 to pay attention to us if we do not 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.520
 They pay attention 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.110
 we open that portfolio we teach that 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.730
 little green bill that belongs to 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.710
 our family but now we want 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.650
 use it on this person to leave him 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.289
 know what we are 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.879
 able 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:30.009
 and no, we do not fall into the idea that 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:32.229
 they are making us not so handsome 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.330
 what are we but for the perfume that 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:37.300
 we have not for the convertibles of certain 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:40.809
 way not by clothes not by the chest not 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.360
 by the chain not by the dye but by 

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:45.599
 those little bills that we have come together 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.710
 with us we leave our wives 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:50.229
 We believe that we are the happiest man 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.539
 from the world they take us out to the last drop 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:55.959
 they throw us in the trash and from there 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:06:00.279
 sadly we knock on the door of our 

00:05:55.959 --> 00:06:03.749
 wife with watery eyes on her face 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:07.180
 confused and we ask for another opportunity 

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:09.669
 that's the crisis of the clown we 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.969
 we become the biggest clowns 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:15.249
 that exist because of insecurity 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:18.009
 lack of believing in ourselves by 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:20.860
 failure to appreciate that with age we 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:23.740
 we do better not worse than old age is not 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:28.060
 it implies negativity disappointment and death 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:30.100
 it simply implies knowledge maturity 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.380
 and many other positive things that you the 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.940
 I leave here that you discover it with your partner 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.889
 then if you are going through the crisis 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.960
 of the clown you are starting to enter the 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:39.730
 clown crisis please talk to 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.680

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.720
 my feet on the ground so I do not have 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:47.440
 a shoe dye test on the head of the 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:52.090

 for any slapstick you're going through 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:03.460
 now it's going to reverberate and eventually you 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:08.680
 you do not want to stay alone with your dye 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:11.830
 with your car without money with weird clothes 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:14.350
 nobody holding on to what you smell and nobody 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:17.169
 by your side that's the sad part of old age 

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:18.729
 getting to a point where you do not have to 

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:21.010
 nobody by your side you have to be alone 

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:23.260

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.410
 your partner tells you that he is not looking for 

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:34.270
 because you are going to need it is difficult 

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.830
 see the big change 

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.660
 a man can become when passing 

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.460
 for an identity crisis but 

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.620
