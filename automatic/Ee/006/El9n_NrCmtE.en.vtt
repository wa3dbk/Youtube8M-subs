00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
definitely worth the money it's one of

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.830 
definitely worth the money it's one of
the<00:02:01.409> things<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.920> might<00:02:02.070> hold<00:02:02.369> off<00:02:02.549> on

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
the things that you might hold off on

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.959 
the things that you might hold off on
for<00:02:03.840> financial<00:02:04.409> reasons<00:02:04.590> or<00:02:04.979> whatever<00:02:05.490> reason

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
for financial reasons or whatever reason

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.700 
for financial reasons or whatever reason
you<00:02:06.240> might<00:02:06.479> not<00:02:06.630> purchase<00:02:07.020> one<00:02:07.170> up<00:02:07.259> front<00:02:07.530> but

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
you might not purchase one up front but

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.020 
you might not purchase one up front but
i<00:02:07.770> think<00:02:08.039> this<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.459> something<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.940> would

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
i think this is something you would

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.550 
i think this is something you would
definitely<00:02:09.209> want<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.629> purchase<00:02:09.810> up<00:02:10.200> front

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
definitely want to purchase up front

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.980 
definitely want to purchase up front
