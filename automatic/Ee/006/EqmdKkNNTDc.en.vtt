 About 2012-04-01 Moss 

00:00:13.491 --> 00:00:17.491
 In-game events 

00:00:18.432 --> 00:00:23.432
 Thank you for using "Monster Hunter Frontier Online (MHF)". 

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:28.458
 Currently, MHF, the most poor in MHF history, has appeared in the new stadium. 

00:00:28.516 --> 00:00:32.516
 Even the weak Moss gets even worse! 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.430
 All the mourning hunters saying, "We can not beat Moss ..."! If you defeat it, now is your chance! 

00:00:38.714 --> 00:00:42.714
 In addition, because it is really really poor, you will have to defeat with "one piece" and "without armor"! 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.590
 There is no need for "long-distance weapons" or "items" at all, so we have been banned in advance! 

00:00:47.745 --> 00:00:51.745
 As it is limited delivery for one day, please try by all means! 

00:00:53.076 --> 00:00:56.076
