initially<00:01:00.869> put<00:01:01.229> up<00:01:01.350> here<00:01:01.530> because<00:01:01.799> the<00:01:01.949> sides

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:02.369 
initially put up here because the sides

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:04.130 
initially put up here because the sides

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
a bunch of holes in the riser board from

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.550 
a bunch of holes in the riser board from
from<00:03:01.000> nails<00:03:01.269> and<00:03:01.690> from<00:03:02.349> and<00:03:02.739> from<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:04.560> from

the stables here that that they went on

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.820 
the stables here that that they went on
when<00:03:09.190> they<00:03:09.340> staple<00:03:09.849> the<00:03:09.970> up<00:03:10.150> rug<00:03:10.630> in<00:03:11.349> here

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
so I circle all the holes that I'm going

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.470 
so I circle all the holes that I'm going
to<00:03:14.890> have<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.190> fix<00:03:15.430> here<00:03:15.760> and<00:03:15.940> when<00:03:16.180> you<00:03:16.299> run

to have to fix here and when you run
your<00:03:16.629> finger<00:03:17.049> across<00:03:18.010> them<00:03:18.610> when<00:03:19.209> they<00:03:19.390> pull

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
your finger across them when they pull

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.900 
your finger across them when they pull
it<00:03:19.900> out<00:03:20.049> sometimes<00:03:20.739> it<00:03:20.950> tears<00:03:21.280> out<00:03:21.549> the<00:03:21.730> wood

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
it out sometimes it tears out the wood

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.699 
it out sometimes it tears out the wood
so<00:03:22.599> what<00:03:22.780> I'm<00:03:22.870> going<00:03:23.019> to<00:03:23.049> do<00:03:23.200> is<00:03:23.380> I'm<00:03:23.530> going<00:03:23.650> to

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.610 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
use<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:24.190> tip<00:03:24.519> of<00:03:24.790> this<00:03:25.450> 1<00:03:25.840> inch<00:03:25.989> blade<00:03:26.319> right

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
use the tip of this 1 inch blade right

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.680 
use the tip of this 1 inch blade right
here<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:28.450> I'm<00:03:28.690> just<00:03:28.750> going<00:03:29.079> to<00:03:29.610> put<00:03:30.610> couch<00:03:31.239> in

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
here and I'm just going to put couch in

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.559 
here and I'm just going to put couch in
areas<00:03:32.880> that<00:03:34.079> are<00:03:35.079> not<00:03:35.440> flush<00:03:35.980> or<00:03:36.340> concave<00:03:36.880> to

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
areas that are not flush or concave to

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.800 
areas that are not flush or concave to
the<00:03:37.840> surface<00:03:38.349> so<00:03:39.069> once<00:03:39.310> I<00:03:39.430> got<00:03:39.640> those<00:03:40.120> in<00:03:40.150> then

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
the surface so once I got those in then

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.530 
the surface so once I got those in then
what<00:03:41.110> I'll<00:03:41.200> do<00:03:41.380> Lee<00:03:41.620> later<00:03:42.160> on<00:03:42.459> is<00:03:42.790> use<00:03:43.390> this

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
what I'll do Lee later on is use this

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.750 
what I'll do Lee later on is use this
blade<00:03:43.810> and<00:03:44.140> just<00:03:44.680> skim<00:03:45.040> right<00:03:45.250> over<00:03:47.310> so<00:03:48.310> I'm

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
blade and just skim right over so I'm

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.960 
blade and just skim right over so I'm
going<00:03:49.480> to<00:03:49.540> put<00:03:49.810> this<00:03:49.989> down<00:03:50.260> here<00:03:50.739> now<00:03:51.370> before

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
going to put this down here now before

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.559 
going to put this down here now before
we<00:03:52.859> before<00:03:53.859> we<00:03:54.370> get<00:03:54.519> to<00:03:54.700> that<00:03:54.850> I'm<00:03:55.299> going<00:03:55.540> to

we before we get to that I'm going to

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.800 
we before we get to that I'm going to
take<00:03:55.780> my<00:03:55.989> Fanning<00:03:56.590> pad<00:03:56.799> here<00:03:57.130> and<00:03:57.540> this<00:03:58.540> is

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
take my Fanning pad here and this is

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.039 
take my Fanning pad here and this is
made<00:03:59.019> by<00:03:59.200> 3m<00:03:59.650> it's<00:04:00.130> a<00:04:00.340> medium<00:04:00.910> type<00:04:01.239> so<00:04:01.720> it's

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
made by 3m it's a medium type so it's

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.190 
made by 3m it's a medium type so it's
not<00:04:02.260> so<00:04:02.650> it's<00:04:03.220> a<00:04:03.370> kind<00:04:03.760> of<00:04:03.940> rough<00:04:04.150> and<00:04:04.389> what<00:04:05.079> I'm

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
not so it's a kind of rough and what I'm

going<00:04:05.290> to<00:04:05.350> do<00:04:05.530> here<00:04:05.859> is<00:04:06.100> just<00:04:06.450> let<00:04:07.450> just<00:04:07.720> stand

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
going to do here is just let just stand

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.150 
going to do here is just let just stand
down<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:08.889> up<00:04:08.980> surface<00:04:10.620> and<00:04:11.620> this<00:04:11.799> is<00:04:11.980> going<00:04:12.100> to

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
down the up surface and this is going to

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.610 
down the up surface and this is going to
make<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:12.549> surface<00:04:12.910> smooth<00:04:13.450> now<00:04:13.690> so<00:04:14.280> what<00:04:15.280> if

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
make the surface smooth now so what if

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.870 
make the surface smooth now so what if
so<00:04:17.620> so<00:04:17.950> now<00:04:18.130> we<00:04:18.190> have<00:04:18.430> a<00:04:18.669> smooth<00:04:19.150> surface<00:04:19.389> okay

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
so so now we have a smooth surface okay

guarantees a tight bond for all finishes

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.710 
guarantees a tight bond for all finishes
did<00:04:45.120> this<00:04:46.120> stuff<00:04:46.389> is<00:04:46.690> a<00:04:46.750> very<00:04:47.680> strong<00:04:48.070> the
