00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.160
 do not 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.750
 a dry blow at the exact point and almost 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.730
 ready the cocoa opens and inside 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.039
 as in the other fruits are found 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.910
 about 50 seeds covered with a pulp 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:30.429
 white its flavor between sweet and acid is 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.680
 a recognized source of energy know 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.290
 of this the animals that consumed it and 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.390
 they helped without realizing to extend the 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.710
 crops like monkeys like monkeys 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.710
 the animal comes and eats it 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.719
 then he spits it out because the seed is 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.089
 bitter and in that way the cocoa plant 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.949
 he found a dispenser of his seeds 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.199
 throughout the heat in a 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.550
 container that the animal can take 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.710
 and take the donor 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.409
 so savoring this delicacy 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.299
 we started our journey looking 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:05.009
 backwards the cocoa is known originating 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:06.899
 of the Amazon but they were the 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.299
 Central Americans who industrialized it 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.700
 the chocolate from which the 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.610
 chocolate name was the drink of the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.100
 Mayan gods bitter drink is the 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.909
 translation based on the cocoa seeds 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.190
 and a spicy touch on a royal certificate at 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.100
 Ecuador did not have to produce 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.530
 cocoa but textiles but he started it 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.380
 cultivate clandestinely all over 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.149

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.770
 river guayas to that the name of cocoa 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.020
 real top of the national cocoa 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.490
 obviously it was the cocoa that had the best 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.350
 impact on the palate of people 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.850
 that not only delicious to taste like 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.770
 the one from Central America but this one 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.200
 it also had a fineness of aroma in the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.600
 same texture of chocolate is much more 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.920
 delicate 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.350
 between 1880 1920 ecuador became 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.960
 the first cocoa producer in the world 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.000
 the great cocoa was a small group of 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.090
 about 20 families that controlled more than 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.700
 70% of the productive land towards its

 is the tens of hundreds of children and 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.120
 young people worked in this industry they 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.700
 beam aroma intoxicated and with a tablet 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.430
 I kept putting the waste of some 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.130
 mental sticks for four reais 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.080
 then the pound was not for nothing 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.959
 called cocoa as the gold pepa 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.300
 but that by the middle of the 20th century he left 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.890

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.360
 farmers have resumed these crops 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.549
 especially for orangery and vinces and not 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.410
 only that is also about developing 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.090
 a tourist industry around him 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.940
 because the average consumer of 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.489
 chocolate does not know where really 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.050
 this delicacy came out on this occasion was a 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.690
 group of French 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.060
 by the process the seeds are roasted 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.220
 sun and when grinding you get the pasta 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.370
 of chocolate it takes strength me 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.990
 I imagine if it smells very clear 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.990
 besides, it's not flying 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.100

 we see the chocolates but we do not know 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.670
