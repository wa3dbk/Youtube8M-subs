00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
down your bottom bracket let's get in

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.470 
down your bottom bracket let's get in
tight<00:02:21.550> now<00:02:22.550> you<00:02:22.610> want<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.820> come<00:02:22.970> over<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.360> your

dry side your non Drive side cup and

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.060 
dry side your non Drive side cup and
there's<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:26.930> little<00:02:27.170> bit<00:02:27.260> of<00:02:27.290> step<00:02:27.560> changes<00:02:27.950> in

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
there's a little bit of step changes in

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.940 
there's a little bit of step changes in
this<00:02:28.220> but<00:02:28.459> not<00:02:28.640> too<00:02:28.880> many<00:02:29.000> so<00:02:29.480> you<00:02:29.920> bought<00:02:30.920> a

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
this but not too many so you bought a

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.280 
this but not too many so you bought a
bracket<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.550> non<00:02:32.150> Drive<00:02:32.360> side<00:02:32.420> cup<00:02:32.930> looks<00:02:33.140> like

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
bracket a non Drive side cup looks like

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.940 
bracket a non Drive side cup looks like
this<00:02:34.930> you<00:02:35.930> want<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.140> take<00:02:36.260> some<00:02:36.440> grease<00:02:36.650> and

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
this you want to take some grease and

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:44.500 
this you want to take some grease and
get<00:02:37.160> it<00:02:37.250> on<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.459> inside<00:02:37.820> ring<00:02:38.090> of<00:02:38.209> that<00:02:43.510> just

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
get it on the inside ring of that just

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.350 
get it on the inside ring of that just
kind<00:02:44.690> of<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:44.840> thin<00:02:45.050> film<00:02:45.320> in<00:02:45.560> there<00:02:46.120> like<00:02:47.120> I<00:02:47.209> said

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
kind of a thin film in there like I said

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.490 
kind of a thin film in there like I said
earlier<00:02:47.630> a<00:02:47.660> lot<00:02:47.750> of<00:02:47.870> guys<00:02:48.080> in<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.320> bike<00:02:48.470> shop

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
earlier a lot of guys in the bike shop

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.260 
earlier a lot of guys in the bike shop
so<00:02:48.860> I'll<00:02:48.950> put<00:02:49.100> a<00:02:49.130> thread<00:02:49.430> locking<00:02:49.640> compound<00:02:50.180> on

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
so I'll put a thread locking compound on

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.180 
so I'll put a thread locking compound on
this<00:02:50.480> you<00:02:51.050> don't<00:02:51.230> have<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.650> but<00:02:51.890> it<00:02:52.010> definitely

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
this you don't have to but it definitely

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.180 
this you don't have to but it definitely
helps<00:02:52.550> secure<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.180> bike<00:02:53.300> if<00:02:53.480> you're<00:02:53.630> going<00:02:53.780> to

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
helps secure the bike if you're going to

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.030 
helps secure the bike if you're going to
be<00:02:55.190> in<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:55.459> more<00:02:56.090> like<00:02:56.450> a<00:02:56.920> environment<00:02:57.920> like

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
be in a more like a environment like

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.460 
be in a more like a environment like
Boston<00:02:58.640> or<00:02:58.910> you<00:02:59.510> know<00:02:59.600> up<00:02:59.750> north<00:03:00.230> somewhere

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
Boston or you know up north somewhere

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.770 
Boston or you know up north somewhere
close<00:03:00.770> to<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:00.950> coastline<00:03:01.340> it<00:03:02.270> just<00:03:02.510> helps<00:03:02.720> to

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
close to the coastline it just helps to

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.180 
close to the coastline it just helps to
secure<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.410> threads<00:03:05.410> for<00:03:06.410> our<00:03:06.709> purposes

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
secure the threads for our purposes

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.490 
secure the threads for our purposes
which<00:03:07.400> are<00:03:07.519> just<00:03:07.640> inside<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:08.600> you<00:03:09.019> know<00:03:09.140> light

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
which are just inside and you know light

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.340 
which are just inside and you know light
outside<00:03:09.980> stuff<00:03:10.870> we're<00:03:11.870> just<00:03:11.989> going<00:03:12.110> to<00:03:12.140> put<00:03:12.320> a

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
outside stuff we're just going to put a

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.300 
outside stuff we're just going to put a
thin<00:03:12.950> film<00:03:13.220> on<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:14.630> threads<00:03:14.930> but<00:03:15.860> if<00:03:16.010> you<00:03:16.130> feel

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
thin film on the threads but if you feel

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.890 
thin film on the threads but if you feel
safer<00:03:16.670> with<00:03:16.790> thread<00:03:17.060> locking<00:03:17.239> compound<00:03:17.510> on

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
safer with thread locking compound on

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.810 
safer with thread locking compound on
this<00:03:18.140> non<00:03:18.590> Drive<00:03:18.769> side<00:03:18.830> cup<00:03:19.190> that's<00:03:19.400> fine<00:03:19.610> to

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
this non Drive side cup that's fine to

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.120 
this non Drive side cup that's fine to
do<00:03:20.630> what<00:03:20.780> you<00:03:20.870> do<00:03:21.730> again<00:03:23.200> with<00:03:24.200> this<00:03:24.440> you<00:03:25.010> want

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
do what you do again with this you want

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.090 
do what you do again with this you want
to<00:03:25.280> try<00:03:25.459> and<00:03:25.580> find<00:03:26.500> where<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.650> threads<00:03:27.950> will

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
to try and find where the threads will

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.819 
to try and find where the threads will
fit<00:03:28.250> in<00:03:28.370> nice<00:03:28.579> and<00:03:28.910> with<00:03:29.030> this<00:03:29.150> one<00:03:29.390> they<00:03:29.870> turn

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
fit in nice and with this one they turn

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.110 
fit in nice and with this one they turn
clockwise<00:03:32.530> so<00:03:33.530> again<00:03:33.799> do<00:03:34.579> it<00:03:34.610> with<00:03:34.820> finger

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
clockwise so again do it with finger

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.160 
clockwise so again do it with finger
strength<00:03:35.329> you<00:03:35.540> don't<00:03:35.690> want<00:03:35.810> to<00:03:35.870> strip<00:03:35.989> off

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
strength you don't want to strip off

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.770 
strength you don't want to strip off
those<00:03:36.320> threads

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.020 

you<00:03:41.780> get<00:03:41.900> a<00:03:41.930> finger<00:03:42.260> tight<00:03:42.760> come<00:03:43.760> back<00:03:43.879> with
