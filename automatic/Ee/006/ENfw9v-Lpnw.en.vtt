secure<00:00:55.640> but<00:00:56.180> it<00:00:56.239> still<00:00:56.479> moves<00:00:56.659> out<00:00:56.930> easily<00:00:57.350> if

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
secure but it still moves out easily if

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.759 
secure but it still moves out easily if
you<00:00:58.430> need<00:00:58.699> to<00:00:58.879> charge<00:00:59.269> your<00:00:59.510> iPad<00:00:59.960> certain
