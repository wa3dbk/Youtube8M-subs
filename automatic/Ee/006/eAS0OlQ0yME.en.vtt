it's<00:03:39.360> pretty<00:03:39.630> quick<00:03:39.900> but<00:03:40.170> moderators<00:03:40.709> kind<00:03:40.950> of

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
it's pretty quick but moderators kind of

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.290 
it's pretty quick but moderators kind of
have<00:03:41.100> to<00:03:41.190> make<00:03:41.340> sure<00:03:41.550> that<00:03:41.820> you<00:03:41.940> are<00:03:42.060> uploading

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
have to make sure that you are uploading

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.390 
have to make sure that you are uploading
like<00:03:42.630> a<00:03:42.660> piece<00:03:42.930> of<00:03:42.959> crap<00:03:43.290> map<00:03:43.590> or<00:03:43.800> a<00:03:43.830> joke<00:03:44.070> map

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
like a piece of crap map or a joke map

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.800 
like a piece of crap map or a joke map
and<00:03:44.610> stuff<00:03:44.790> like<00:03:44.940> that<00:03:45.000> while<00:03:45.480> you're<00:03:45.690> waiting

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
and stuff like that while you're waiting

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.480 
and stuff like that while you're waiting
for<00:03:46.020> it<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:46.320> be<00:03:46.410> approved<00:03:46.740> i'd<00:03:46.950> recommend<00:03:47.370> like

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
for it to be approved i'd recommend like

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.030 
for it to be approved i'd recommend like
taking<00:03:48.030> snapshots<00:03:48.330> of<00:03:48.840> of<00:03:49.200> your<00:03:49.500> world<00:03:49.740> and

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
taking snapshots of of your world and

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.340 
taking snapshots of of your world and
uploading<00:03:50.940> images<00:03:51.090> so<00:03:51.540> like<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.840> main<00:03:52.080> would

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
uploading images so like the main would

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.320 
uploading images so like the main would
be<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.890> front<00:03:53.160> thing<00:03:53.610> that<00:03:53.820> people<00:03:54.150> see

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
be the the front thing that people see

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.970 
be the the front thing that people see
when<00:03:54.540> they<00:03:54.600> click<00:03:54.870> on<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:55.200> levels<00:03:55.530> thing<00:03:55.770> and

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
when they click on the levels thing and

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.800 
when they click on the levels thing and
then<00:03:56.400> all<00:03:56.490> these<00:03:56.670> extra<00:03:56.910> thumbnails<00:03:57.420> would<00:03:57.660> be

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
then all these extra thumbnails would be

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.840 
then all these extra thumbnails would be
for<00:03:58.050> like<00:03:58.200> extra<00:03:58.770> detail<00:03:59.130> and<00:03:59.370> stuff<00:03:59.580> so<00:03:59.760> if

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850
