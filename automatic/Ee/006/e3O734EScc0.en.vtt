it's fairly snowy there's a lot of snow
around<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.400> beehives<00:00:29.820> themselves<00:00:30.750> which<00:00:30.929> is

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
around the beehives themselves which is

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.790 
around the beehives themselves which is
which<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.679> good<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.780> I<00:00:33.780> can<00:00:33.899> see<00:00:34.290> some<00:00:34.559> dead

which is good and I can see some dead

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.819 
which is good and I can see some dead
bees<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.790> snow<00:00:36.230> which<00:00:37.230> shows<00:00:37.500> that

bees in the snow which shows that

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.170 
bees in the snow which shows that
there's<00:00:38.040> activity<00:00:38.370> end<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.940> bees<00:00:39.149> are

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
there's activity end of the bees are

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.260 
there's activity end of the bees are
they<00:00:40.020> behaved<00:00:40.500> themselves<00:00:40.500> are<00:00:41.340> still<00:00:42.000> alive

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
they behaved themselves are still alive

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.900

I'm going to go check the bees and have
a<00:00:56.520> look<00:00:56.699> around<00:00:56.840> see<00:00:57.840> what<00:00:58.020> they<00:00:58.109> look<00:00:58.140> like

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
a look around see what they look like

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.439 
a look around see what they look like
what<00:00:58.649> everything<00:00:59.010> looks<00:00:59.280> looks<00:01:00.000> pretty<00:01:00.270> good

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
you can see we've got the black plastic

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.560 
you can see we've got the black plastic
sleeves<00:01:04.379> over<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.129> beehives<00:01:05.519> with<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> bit<00:01:06.420> of

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
sleeves over the beehives with a bit of

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.250 
sleeves over the beehives with a bit of
insulation<00:01:07.580> on<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.640> top<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.720> form<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.110> a

insulation on the top in the form of a

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.390 
insulation on the top in the form of a
styrofoam

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
styrofoam

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.820 
styrofoam
layer<00:01:12.400> which<00:01:12.940> provides<00:01:13.390> a<00:01:13.570> bit<00:01:13.750> of<00:01:13.830> insulation

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
layer which provides a bit of insulation

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.400 
layer which provides a bit of insulation
to<00:01:15.220> keep<00:01:15.400> the<00:01:15.580> heat<00:01:15.790> in<00:01:15.970> event<00:01:16.320> ventilation<00:01:17.320> is

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
to keep the heat in event ventilation is

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.810 
to keep the heat in event ventilation is
a<00:01:17.440> big<00:01:17.680> issue<00:01:17.860> with<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:19.140> wintering<00:01:20.140> beehives

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
a big issue with the wintering beehives

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.390 
a big issue with the wintering beehives
you<00:01:21.820> have<00:01:22.090> to<00:01:22.270> make<00:01:22.420> sure<00:01:22.450> that<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.770> hot<00:01:24.100> air

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
you have to make sure that the hot air

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.080 
you have to make sure that the hot air
that<00:01:24.430> is<00:01:24.910> produced<00:01:25.540> by<00:01:25.690> the<00:01:25.810> bees<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:27.400> able<00:01:27.910> to

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
that is produced by the bees is able to

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.880 
that is produced by the bees is able to
be<00:01:28.120> expelled<00:01:28.720> from<00:01:28.870> behind<00:01:29.320> because<00:01:29.680> that

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
be expelled from behind because that

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.660 
be expelled from behind because that
will<00:01:30.040> hit<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.550> cold<00:01:31.500> inner<00:01:32.500> cover<00:01:33.010> or<00:01:33.310> the<00:01:33.460> top

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
will hit the cold inner cover or the top

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.000 
will hit the cold inner cover or the top
cover<00:01:33.970> and<00:01:34.390> it<00:01:34.780> will<00:01:34.960> condense<00:01:35.320> and<00:01:35.590> will<00:01:35.710> form

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
cover and it will condense and will form

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.360 
cover and it will condense and will form
into<00:01:36.810> essentially<00:01:37.810> a<00:01:37.960> block<00:01:38.229> of<00:01:38.440> ice<00:01:38.620> which

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
into essentially a block of ice which

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.210 
into essentially a block of ice which
will<00:01:39.670> slowly<00:01:40.479> kill<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.350> bees<00:01:41.530> so<00:01:41.770> you<00:01:41.860> have<00:01:42.070> to

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
will slowly kill the bees so you have to

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.100 
will slowly kill the bees so you have to
have<00:01:42.370> ventilation<00:01:42.850> is<00:01:43.210> absolutely<00:01:43.900> critical

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
have ventilation is absolutely critical

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.410 
have ventilation is absolutely critical
a<00:01:44.590> lot<00:01:45.310> of<00:01:45.340> people<00:01:45.520> when<00:01:45.880> they<00:01:46.000> first<00:01:46.240> start

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
a lot of people when they first start

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.620 
a lot of people when they first start
off<00:01:46.540> they<00:01:46.810> tend<00:01:47.080> to<00:01:47.310> over<00:01:48.310> wrap<00:01:48.670> their<00:01:49.360> hives

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
off they tend to over wrap their hives

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.200 
off they tend to over wrap their hives
and<00:01:50.280> there<00:01:51.280> is<00:01:51.369> no<00:01:51.550> they<00:01:51.790> don't<00:01:51.970> put<00:01:52.060> any

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
and there is no they don't put any

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.670 
and there is no they don't put any
ventilation<00:01:52.540> they<00:01:52.960> come<00:01:53.140> back<00:01:53.320> in<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.560> spring

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
ventilation they come back in the spring

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.150 
ventilation they come back in the spring
and<00:01:53.979> it's<00:01:54.160> just<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.520> moldy<00:01:55.270> wet<00:01:55.810> damp<00:01:56.290> mess<00:01:56.860> of

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
and it's just the moldy wet damp mess of

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.460 
and it's just the moldy wet damp mess of
dead<00:01:57.430> be<00:01:57.700> so<00:01:58.150> you<00:01:58.210> don't<00:01:58.509> want<00:01:58.660> that<00:01:58.810> so

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
dead be so you don't want that so

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.870 
dead be so you don't want that so
everything<00:01:59.800> looks<00:01:59.830> pretty<00:02:00.130> good<00:02:00.400> I<00:02:00.460> don't<00:02:00.700> see

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
everything looks pretty good I don't see

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.730 
everything looks pretty good I don't see
any<00:02:01.030> bear<00:02:01.300> activity<00:02:01.690> sometimes<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.530> Bears

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740
