00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:07.770
 so after we planted a new one 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:13.600
 belt 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:21.760
 check the marks again, this is our 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:27.820
 label and here is the factory here, too, here is Masha 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:29.550

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.790
 factory 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:40.890
 while I have not twisted the bolt 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:44.860
 we have a camshaft fixed down 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:52.360
 so here we have our tags below 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:54.540
 all matched all means now take out 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.540
 retainer 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.140
 here we take out the retainer is the usual bolt 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:35.079
 Now we grab so as not to hang out 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.079
 this is a piece of iron 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:50.210
 but the panel and scroll several times 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.440
 motor do two times two full 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:58.280
 engine speed 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:02:03.530
 engine manually and then go 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:06.790
 watch the tensioner tag here it is visible 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.790
 now I will consecrate 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:25.670
 obviously block and he won he he he 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.620
 arrow and arrow 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.130
 between here this stick should be by 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.950
 the bottom of this stick is on the bottom 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.120
 ledge 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:41.900
 I will twist the hour and again the sphere 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:47.620
 after that we clamp everything and collect here 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.620
 something like this is all done
