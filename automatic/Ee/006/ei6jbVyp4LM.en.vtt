00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
the game in terms of recoil patterns so

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.700 
the game in terms of recoil patterns so
using<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.940> six<00:00:57.660> times<00:00:57.870> rifle<00:00:58.289> scope<00:00:58.530> is

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.760 
won't have a summa 300 sin obviously
this<00:01:53.070> excited<00:01:53.610> rifle<00:01:53.909> scope<00:01:54.149> isn't<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.770> so

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
this excited rifle scope isn't that so

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.010 
this excited rifle scope isn't that so
the<00:01:56.009> second<00:01:56.430> attachment<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.509> recommended

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
the second attachment you recommended

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.469 
the second attachment you recommended
for<00:01:58.229> me<00:01:58.380> was<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.829> foregrip<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.820> foregrip<00:02:00.299> is

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
for me was the foregrip the foregrip is

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.420 
for me was the foregrip the foregrip is
actually<00:02:00.990> really<00:02:01.259> good<00:02:01.439> obviously<00:02:02.219> with<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
actually really good obviously with the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.490 
actually really good obviously with the
high<00:02:02.610> mountain<00:02:02.909> side-to-side<00:02:03.210> recoil<00:02:03.600> the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
high mountain side-to-side recoil the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.039 
high mountain side-to-side recoil the
four<00:02:04.799> group<00:02:05.009> produces<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.659> wouldn't

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
four group produces that and I wouldn't

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.869 
four group produces that and I wouldn't
disagree<00:02:07.380> with<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.799> on<00:02:07.829> on<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.550> second

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
disagree with you on on the second

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.969 
disagree with you on on the second
attachment<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.479> mean<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.899> bipod<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.649> pretty<00:02:10.860> much

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
attachment I mean a bipod is pretty much

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.619 
attachment I mean a bipod is pretty much
useless<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.760> that's<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.150> only<00:02:12.180> two<00:02:12.390> choices

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
useless and that's the only two choices

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.420 
useless and that's the only two choices
you<00:02:12.930> have

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
you have

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.059 
you have
as<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:14.030> second<00:02:14.420> attachment<00:02:14.659> as<00:02:15.439> we<00:02:15.799> third

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
as the second attachment as we third

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.309 
as the second attachment as we third
attachment<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.790> suppressor<00:02:17.209> I've<00:02:17.719> normally

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
attachment the suppressor I've normally

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.020 
attachment the suppressor I've normally
disagree<00:02:18.769> with<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:18.980> suppressor<00:02:19.280> due<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.849> its

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
disagree with the suppressor due to its

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.080 
disagree with the suppressor due to its
it<00:02:20.569> reduces<00:02:21.290> damage<00:02:21.469> at<00:02:21.829> longer<00:02:22.159> ranges<00:02:22.549> but

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
it reduces damage at longer ranges but

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.030 
it reduces damage at longer ranges but
an<00:02:23.209> all<00:02:23.329> reality<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.140> will<00:02:24.170> never<00:02:24.530> use<00:02:24.799> the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
an all reality you will never use the

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
an all reality you will never use the
famas<00:02:25.400> at<00:02:25.700> long<00:02:26.239> range<00:02:26.659> so<00:02:27.319> i<00:02:27.799> would<00:02:28.700> actually

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
famas at long range so i would actually

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.929 
famas at long range so i would actually
go<00:02:29.299> with<00:02:29.480> this<00:02:29.719> because<00:02:30.409> obviously<00:02:31.099> reduces

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:31.939 
go with this because obviously reduces

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.119 
go with this because obviously reduces
the<00:02:32.060> vertical<00:02:32.450> recoil<00:02:32.629> not<00:02:33.409> only<00:02:33.799> that<00:02:33.980> it

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
the vertical recoil not only that it

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:35.949 
the vertical recoil not only that it
hides<00:02:34.310> itself<00:02:34.670> off<00:02:34.939> the<00:02:35.120> mini<00:02:35.329> map<00:02:35.540> which<00:02:35.780> is

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
hides itself off the mini map which is

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.470 
hides itself off the mini map which is
great<00:02:36.379> for<00:02:36.620> flanking<00:02:37.069> routes<00:02:37.430> so<00:02:37.969> before<00:02:38.450> i

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
great for flanking routes so before i

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.089 
great for flanking routes so before i
tried<00:02:38.780> this<00:02:38.959> loadout<00:02:39.319> I<00:02:39.620> thought<00:02:39.889> it<00:02:39.950> was

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
tried this loadout I thought it was

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.190 
tried this loadout I thought it was
going<00:02:40.370> to<00:02:40.609> be<00:02:40.730> a<00:02:40.760> troll<00:02:41.090> loadout<00:02:41.659> and<00:02:41.930> it

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
going to be a troll loadout and it

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.199 
going to be a troll loadout and it
pretty<00:02:42.500> much<00:02:42.650> was<00:02:43.099> but<00:02:43.579> there<00:02:43.849> was<00:02:43.969> something

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
pretty much was but there was something

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.229 
pretty much was but there was something
that<00:02:44.540> surprised<00:02:45.019> me<00:02:45.319> and<00:02:45.790> when<00:02:46.790> I<00:02:46.819> looked<00:02:47.030> over

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
that surprised me and when I looked over

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.909 
that surprised me and when I looked over
the<00:02:47.510> stats<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:47.989> everything<00:02:48.079> I<00:02:48.439> didn't<00:02:48.739> think

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:48.919 
the stats and everything I didn't think

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:50.979 
the stats and everything I didn't think
this<00:02:49.040> would<00:02:49.220> be<00:02:49.280> a<00:02:49.430> possibility<00:02:49.939> but<00:02:50.209> what<00:02:50.959> i

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
this would be a possibility but what i

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.069 
this would be a possibility but what i
did<00:02:51.260> was<00:02:51.439> i<00:02:51.590> changed<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.510> motor<00:02:53.510> fire<00:02:53.810> to

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
did was i changed the motor fire to

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.780 
did was i changed the motor fire to
single<00:02:54.439> shot<00:02:54.650> so<00:02:54.829> it<00:02:54.919> was<00:02:55.010> like<00:02:55.129> single<00:02:55.549> shot

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
single shot so it was like single shot

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.539 
single shot so it was like single shot
fire<00:02:56.030> and<00:02:56.299> i<00:02:57.079> seem<00:02:57.409> to<00:02:57.439> pick<00:02:57.799> people<00:02:58.010> off<00:02:58.340> at

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
fire and i seem to pick people off at

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.240 
fire and i seem to pick people off at
really<00:02:59.030> long<00:02:59.299> ranges<00:02:59.870> zooming<00:03:00.739> in<00:03:00.889> with<00:03:01.099> this

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
really long ranges zooming in with this

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.429 
really long ranges zooming in with this
excellent<00:03:01.790> rifle<00:03:02.180> scope<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:02.629> just<00:03:02.959> tap<00:03:03.200> fire

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:03.439 
excellent rifle scope I just tap fire

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:05.740 
excellent rifle scope I just tap fire
over<00:03:03.829> and<00:03:03.980> over<00:03:04.069> again<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:04.609> it<00:03:05.030> actually<00:03:05.359> get

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
over and over again and it actually get

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.599 
over and over again and it actually get
me<00:03:05.870> a<00:03:05.900> lot<00:03:06.079> of<00:03:06.200> kills<00:03:06.439> I'm<00:03:06.739> not<00:03:07.219> sure<00:03:07.370> if<00:03:07.519> you

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
can really see it in this game play

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.740 
can really see it in this game play
because<00:03:09.200> I<00:03:09.319> did<00:03:09.590> only<00:03:09.739> put<00:03:10.099> like<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.280> few<00:03:10.750> little
