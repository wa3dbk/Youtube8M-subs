00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
pitch

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.480 
pitch
very<00:02:11.770> loud<00:02:12.130> and<00:02:12.630> I<00:02:13.630> located<00:02:14.200> I<00:02:14.440> was<00:02:15.220> pretty

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
very loud and I located I was pretty

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.580 
very loud and I located I was pretty
sure<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:16.170> was<00:02:17.170> down<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:18.010> creek<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.340> bit<00:02:18.520> and

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
sure it was down the creek a bit and

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.410 
sure it was down the creek a bit and
just<00:02:20.590> judging<00:02:20.800> from<00:02:21.070> the<00:02:21.220> echoes<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:21.550> the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
just judging from the echoes and the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.210 
just judging from the echoes and the
distance<00:02:22.810> that's<00:02:23.560> what<00:02:23.770> I<00:02:23.800> thought<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.130> must

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
distance that's what I thought it must

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.950 
distance that's what I thought it must
be<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.730> it<00:02:24.820> went<00:02:24.970> on<00:02:25.120> for<00:02:25.360> almost<00:02:25.420> three

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
be and it went on for almost three

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.980 
be and it went on for almost three
seconds<00:02:26.350> I<00:02:26.440> think<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:26.940> then<00:02:27.940> followed<00:02:28.300> maybe

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
seconds I think and then followed maybe

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.090 
seconds I think and then followed maybe
a<00:02:29.080> second<00:02:29.500> after<00:02:29.800> by<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:29.980> huge<00:02:30.460> crash<00:02:31.030> as<00:02:31.360> if<00:02:31.810> a

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
a second after by a huge crash as if a

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.990 
a second after by a huge crash as if a
huge<00:02:33.100> rock<00:02:33.400> had<00:02:33.580> been<00:02:33.730> dropped<00:02:33.970> on<00:02:34.150> lock<00:02:34.390> and

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
huge rock had been dropped on lock and

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.320 
huge rock had been dropped on lock and
and<00:02:37.000> so<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.690> next<00:02:37.870> day<00:02:38.700> my<00:02:39.700> son<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.120> I<00:02:40.150> went

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
and so the next day my son and I went

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.100 
and so the next day my son and I went
down<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:41.860> where<00:02:42.040> we<00:02:42.070> thought<00:02:42.460> it<00:02:42.520> was<00:02:43.110> the

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
down to where we thought it was the

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.260 
down to where we thought it was the
waterfall<00:02:44.590> just<00:02:44.860> beyond<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.520> baths<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:46.150> old

and they were it was some young bright
yellow<00:03:08.830> sandstone<00:03:09.390> crumbly<00:03:10.390> rock<00:03:10.600> underneath

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
yellow sandstone crumbly rock underneath

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.970 
yellow sandstone crumbly rock underneath
so<00:03:12.760> that<00:03:12.790> is<00:03:13.090> two<00:03:13.390> or<00:03:13.420> three<00:03:13.510> years<00:03:13.780> ago<00:03:13.980> but

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
comes out at the same time well that's

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.600

how it sounded but not like Irish of
course<00:04:13.530> just<00:04:14.530> very<00:04:15.750> very<00:04:16.750> deep<00:04:17.700> very<00:04:18.700> short

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
course just very very deep very short

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.770 
course just very very deep very short
mono<00:04:19.299> syllables<00:04:19.840> and<00:04:21.480> they<00:04:22.480> were<00:04:22.540> all

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
mono syllables and they were all

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.950 
mono syllables and they were all
different

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
different

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.170 
different
and<00:04:24.919> then<00:04:25.009> the<00:04:25.100> light<00:04:25.310> camera<00:04:25.669> wasn't<00:04:26.000> there's

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
and then the light camera wasn't there's

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.469 
and then the light camera wasn't there's
a<00:04:26.270> sentence<00:04:26.690> well<00:04:27.590> then<00:04:27.880> my<00:04:28.880> husband<00:04:29.240> came<00:04:29.270> in

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
a sentence well then my husband came in

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.900 
a sentence well then my husband came in
and<00:04:29.990> alight<00:04:30.530> from<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.800> bathroom<00:04:31.190> Sean<00:04:31.460> in<00:04:31.639> and

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
and alight from the bathroom Sean in and

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.029 
and alight from the bathroom Sean in and
I<00:04:32.690> think<00:04:32.900> that<00:04:33.289> I<00:04:33.500> would<00:04:33.770> have<00:04:33.889> been

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
I think that I would have been

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.540 
I think that I would have been
silhouetted<00:04:34.699> and<00:04:35.830> John<00:04:36.830> has<00:04:36.949> said<00:04:37.130> it<00:04:37.250> word<00:04:37.430> or

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
silhouetted and John has said it word or

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.310 
silhouetted and John has said it word or
two<00:04:37.759> so<00:04:38.620> after<00:04:39.620> that<00:04:40.330> it<00:04:41.330> was<00:04:41.479> much<00:04:41.660> quieter<00:04:41.930> I

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
two so after that it was much quieter I

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.370 
two so after that it was much quieter I
heard<00:04:42.889> about<00:04:43.009> three<00:04:43.660> noises<00:04:44.660> after<00:04:44.990> that<00:04:45.139> but

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
heard about three noises after that but

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.879 
heard about three noises after that but
I'm<00:04:45.639> very<00:04:46.639> much<00:04:46.820> quieter<00:04:47.360> as<00:04:47.509> if<00:04:47.720> they<00:04:48.620> had

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
I'm very much quieter as if they had

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.430 
I'm very much quieter as if they had
spotted<00:04:49.220> us<00:04:49.550> he<00:04:50.270> or<00:04:50.449> they<00:04:50.600> he<00:04:50.990> or<00:04:51.110> she<00:04:51.289> he'll

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
spotted us he or they he or she he'll

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.500 
spotted us he or they he or she he'll
they<00:04:51.620> and<00:04:52.240> and<00:04:53.410> there<00:04:54.410> were<00:04:54.530> a<00:04:54.560> few<00:04:54.650> little

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
they and and there were a few little

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:01.510 
they and and there were a few little
grunts<00:04:56.510> and<00:04:56.979> a<00:04:57.979> few<00:04:58.190> crackles<00:04:58.750> as<00:04:59.750> if<00:05:00.520> someone

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
grunts and a few crackles as if someone

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.330 
grunts and a few crackles as if someone
was<00:05:01.610> walking<00:05:01.789> on<00:05:02.120> the<00:05:03.110> dead<00:05:03.740> branches<00:05:04.160> or

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
was walking on the dead branches or

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.640 
was walking on the dead branches or
something<00:05:04.550> like<00:05:04.669> that<00:05:05.050> so<00:05:06.050> then<00:05:06.199> we<00:05:06.320> put<00:05:06.500> the

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
something like that so then we put the

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.040 
something like that so then we put the
light<00:05:07.190> on<00:05:07.220> on<00:05:07.550> the<00:05:07.639> balcony<00:05:08.060> which<00:05:08.510> faces<00:05:08.930> that

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
light on on the balcony which faces that

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.810 
light on on the balcony which faces that
direction<00:05:09.320> and<00:05:09.650> that<00:05:10.250> was<00:05:10.370> no<00:05:10.490> good<00:05:10.669> because

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
direction and that was no good because

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.670 
direction and that was no good because
it<00:05:11.000> just<00:05:11.120> lit<00:05:11.330> up<00:05:11.360> the<00:05:11.510> tea<00:05:11.750> trees<00:05:12.050> just<00:05:12.440> behind

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
it just lit up the tea trees just behind

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.279 
it just lit up the tea trees just behind
the<00:05:12.860> fence<00:05:13.180> so<00:05:14.180> we<00:05:14.270> turned<00:05:14.479> that<00:05:14.600> off<00:05:14.810> and<00:05:15.080> we

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
the fence so we turned that off and we

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:17.890 
the fence so we turned that off and we
got<00:05:15.410> a<00:05:15.470> spotlight<00:05:15.860> it's<00:05:16.610> a<00:05:16.729> torch<00:05:17.030> really<00:05:17.449> but

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
got a spotlight it's a torch really but

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.800 
got a spotlight it's a torch really but
it's<00:05:18.020> a<00:05:18.139> sort<00:05:18.349> of<00:05:18.380> a<00:05:18.550> has<00:05:19.550> its<00:05:19.760> pot<00:05:20.000> capability

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
it's a sort of a has its pot capability

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.330 
it's a sort of a has its pot capability
somewhat<00:05:21.710> and<00:05:21.979> we<00:05:22.910> saw<00:05:23.180> two<00:05:23.690> sets<00:05:24.560> of<00:05:24.800> eyes<00:05:25.039> we

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
somewhat and we saw two sets of eyes we

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.950 
somewhat and we saw two sets of eyes we
think<00:05:25.580> it's<00:05:25.789> either<00:05:25.910> one<00:05:26.180> set<00:05:26.419> of<00:05:26.509> eyes<00:05:26.630> that

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
think it's either one set of eyes that

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.330 
think it's either one set of eyes that
moved<00:05:27.229> about<00:05:27.650> a<00:05:27.680> metre<00:05:27.949> away<00:05:28.130> or<00:05:29.770> go<00:05:30.770> to<00:05:31.039> sets

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
moved about a metre away or go to sets

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.939 
moved about a metre away or go to sets
and<00:05:32.260> they<00:05:33.260> were<00:05:33.699> sort<00:05:34.699> of<00:05:34.729> very<00:05:34.789> iridescent

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:35.949 
and they were sort of very iridescent

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:40.839 
and they were sort of very iridescent
bright<00:05:37.660> greenish<00:05:38.660> blue<00:05:39.310> and<00:05:40.310> the<00:05:40.430> eyes<00:05:40.550> were

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:40.849 
bright greenish blue and the eyes were

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:42.189 
bright greenish blue and the eyes were
actually<00:05:41.090> looking<00:05:41.180> at<00:05:41.479> you're<00:05:41.690> looking<00:05:41.840> at

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.199 
actually looking at you're looking at

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:43.659 
actually looking at you're looking at
the<00:05:42.500> direction<00:05:42.680> straight<00:05:43.130> into<00:05:43.340> the<00:05:43.430> actual

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
the direction straight into the actual

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.490 
the direction straight into the actual
light<00:05:43.849> yes<00:05:44.599> straight<00:05:44.840> into<00:05:45.080> the<00:05:45.169> torchlight

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
light yes straight into the torchlight

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.540 
light yes straight into the torchlight
yeah<00:05:46.010> now<00:05:46.849> you<00:05:46.909> see<00:05:47.270> the<00:05:47.389> missing<00:05:47.630> plank<00:05:47.960> there

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
yeah now you see the missing plank there

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.000 
yeah now you see the missing plank there
yep<00:05:49.580> well<00:05:50.090> next<00:05:50.960> one<00:05:51.139> to<00:05:51.289> it<00:05:51.409> if<00:05:51.590> we<00:05:51.620> call<00:05:51.889> it

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
yep well next one to it if we call it

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:57.580 
yep well next one to it if we call it
number<00:05:52.280> one<00:05:53.020> for<00:05:54.220> planks<00:05:55.220> to<00:05:55.699> the<00:05:55.820> right<00:05:56.590> if

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
number one for planks to the right if

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.670 
number one for planks to the right if
you<00:05:57.770> draw<00:05:57.979> a<00:05:58.010> line<00:05:58.099> from<00:05:58.460> here<00:05:58.909> to<00:05:59.630> there<00:05:59.840> to

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
you draw a line from here to there to

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.830 
you draw a line from here to there to
the<00:06:00.800> country<00:06:02.020> particularly<00:06:03.020> the<00:06:03.260> second

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
the country particularly the second

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.779 
the country particularly the second
distance<00:06:05.860> we<00:06:06.860> are<00:06:06.889> the<00:06:07.070> dumpee<00:06:07.370> that's<00:06:07.550> about

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:07.789 
distance we are the dumpee that's about

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:11.890 
distance we are the dumpee that's about
ten<00:06:08.659> meters<00:06:09.500> away<00:06:09.620> that<00:06:09.979> yep<00:06:10.520> if<00:06:11.210> you<00:06:11.270> drew<00:06:11.570> a

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
ten meters away that yep if you drew a

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.920 
ten meters away that yep if you drew a
line<00:06:12.370> then<00:06:13.900> the<00:06:14.900> eyes<00:06:15.110> were<00:06:15.880> behind<00:06:16.880> the<00:06:17.720> tea

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
line then the eyes were behind the tea

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.760 
line then the eyes were behind the tea
trees<00:06:18.199> but<00:06:18.710> in<00:06:18.830> front<00:06:19.070> of<00:06:19.310> the<00:06:19.940> gum<00:06:20.150> tree<00:06:20.419> and

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
trees but in front of the gum tree and

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.620 
trees but in front of the gum tree and
possibly<00:06:21.770> were<00:06:21.919> beside<00:06:22.280> that<00:06:22.360> bright<00:06:23.360> green

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.630 
possibly were beside that bright green

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.659 
possibly were beside that bright green
bush<00:06:24.139> you're<00:06:24.650> not<00:06:25.039> the<00:06:25.159> brain<00:06:25.340> bush<00:06:25.520> that's

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:25.669 
bush you're not the brain bush that's

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:28.450 
bush you're not the brain bush that's
directly<00:06:26.360> behind<00:06:26.539> the<00:06:27.110> fence<00:06:27.320> but<00:06:28.159> the<00:06:28.280> one

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
directly behind the fence but the one

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.100 
directly behind the fence but the one
yep<00:06:28.760> the<00:06:28.909> one<00:06:28.940> behind<00:06:29.150> at<00:06:29.419> yonder<00:06:29.780> Deadwood

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
yep the one behind at yonder Deadwood

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.990 
yep the one behind at yonder Deadwood
which<00:06:30.470> would<00:06:30.710> be<00:06:30.860> I<00:06:30.889> suppose<00:06:31.310> about<00:06:31.430> nine<00:06:31.969> feet

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
which would be I suppose about nine feet

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.530 
which would be I suppose about nine feet
tall<00:06:32.950> I<00:06:33.950> guess

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:35.540 
tall I guess

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.820 
tall I guess
so<00:06:36.540> they<00:06:36.750> could<00:06:36.930> have<00:06:37.020> been<00:06:37.139> beside<00:06:37.440> that<00:06:37.680> or

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
so they could have been beside that or

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.730 
so they could have been beside that or
just<00:06:38.220> a<00:06:38.340> bit<00:06:38.490> in<00:06:38.610> front<00:06:38.790> of<00:06:39.000> that<00:06:39.120> and<00:06:39.750> slightly

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
just a bit in front of that and slightly

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.000 
just a bit in front of that and slightly
to<00:06:40.889> the<00:06:40.919> left<00:06:41.160> of<00:06:41.490> it

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.010 
to the left of it

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.560 
to the left of it
hmm<00:06:44.010> and<00:06:44.190> this<00:06:44.760> morning<00:06:45.090> when<00:06:45.180> I<00:06:45.210> went<00:06:45.330> down

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:45.570 
hmm and this morning when I went down

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.469 
hmm and this morning when I went down
there<00:06:45.720> I<00:06:45.780> realized<00:06:46.560> just<00:06:46.680> how<00:06:46.889> many<00:06:47.479> trees

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 
there I realized just how many trees

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:51.620 
there I realized just how many trees
branches<00:06:49.199> you<00:06:49.620> sticks<00:06:49.949> have<00:06:50.850> been<00:06:51.090> crushed

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:51.630 
branches you sticks have been crushed

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.199 
branches you sticks have been crushed
down<00:06:51.870> there
