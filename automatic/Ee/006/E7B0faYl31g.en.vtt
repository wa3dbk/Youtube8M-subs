00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.060 
envision shooting the movie I think
after<00:01:57.150> we<00:01:57.300> saw<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.810> shots<00:01:58.110> as<00:01:58.560> compared<00:01:59.010> to

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
after we saw the shots as compared to

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.890 
after we saw the shots as compared to
what<00:01:59.250> we'd<00:01:59.430> prep<00:01:59.790> you<00:02:00.120> know<00:02:00.210> was<00:02:00.360> surprisingly

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
what we'd prep you know was surprisingly

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.450 
what we'd prep you know was surprisingly
very<00:02:01.320> similar<00:02:03.230> we<00:02:04.230> described<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.100> book<00:02:05.310> of

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
very similar we described the book of

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.930 
very similar we described the book of
Elias<00:02:05.820> ripe<00:02:06.510> with<00:02:06.750> decay<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.790> think<00:02:08.790> that

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
Elias ripe with decay I think that

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.070 
Elias ripe with decay I think that
everything<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.509> broken<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.229> world<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:11.040> roads

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
everything is broken the world the roads

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.070 
everything is broken the world the roads
the<00:02:13.080> atmosphere<00:02:14.300> everything<00:02:15.300> is<00:02:15.750> falling

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
the atmosphere everything is falling

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.930 
the atmosphere everything is falling
down<00:02:16.410> or<00:02:16.770> crumbling<00:02:19.310> look<00:02:20.310> at<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.520> world<00:02:20.760> in
