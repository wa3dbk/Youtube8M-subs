00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
doing toxics here for our SB productions

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.260 
doing toxics here for our SB productions
with<00:00:16.420> a<00:00:16.630> really<00:00:17.230> cool<00:00:17.529> funny<00:00:18.010> glitch<00:00:18.430> and<00:00:18.699> it's

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
with a really cool funny glitch and it's

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.820 
with a really cool funny glitch and it's
actually<00:00:19.570> pretty<00:00:19.840> useful<00:00:19.960> if<00:00:20.529> you<00:00:20.680> can

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
actually pretty useful if you can

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.700 
actually pretty useful if you can
utilize<00:00:21.070> it<00:00:21.400> correctly<00:00:21.849> because<00:00:22.720> it<00:00:23.320> can

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
utilize it correctly because it can

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.170 
utilize it correctly because it can
really<00:00:23.919> help<00:00:24.099> you<00:00:24.250> freeze<00:00:24.700> around

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
really help you freeze around

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.939 
really help you freeze around
essentially<00:00:25.840> and<00:00:25.990> you<00:00:26.110> basically<00:00:26.259> just<00:00:26.590> sit

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:26.949 
essentially and you basically just sit

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.179 
essentially and you basically just sit
there<00:00:27.189> and<00:00:27.869> chill<00:00:28.869> forever<00:00:29.529> pretty<00:00:30.009> much

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
there and chill forever pretty much

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.370 
there and chill forever pretty much
because<00:00:30.460> it<00:00:30.610> mobilizes<00:00:31.390> your<00:00:31.719> final<00:00:32.079> crawler

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.380 
because it mobilizes your final crawler

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.500 
because it mobilizes your final crawler
and<00:00:32.710> he<00:00:33.219> can't<00:00:33.460> follow<00:00:33.700> you<00:00:34.000> so<00:00:34.149> you<00:00:34.239> can<00:00:34.329> kind

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
and he can't follow you so you can kind

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.970 
and he can't follow you so you can kind
of<00:00:34.540> do<00:00:34.690> whatever<00:00:34.840> you<00:00:35.050> want<00:00:35.260> or<00:00:35.500> you<00:00:35.530> know<00:00:35.890> it

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
of do whatever you want or you know it

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.709 
of do whatever you want or you know it
can<00:00:36.100> mobilize<00:00:36.489> multiple<00:00:37.120> cross<00:00:37.239> as<00:00:37.510> you<00:00:37.600> can

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
can mobilize multiple cross as you can

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:39.450 
can mobilize multiple cross as you can
see<00:00:37.899> their<00:00:38.320> heads<00:00:38.680> will<00:00:38.920> be<00:00:39.010> sticking<00:00:39.250> above

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
see their heads will be sticking above

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.670 
see their heads will be sticking above
the<00:00:39.820> surface<00:00:40.030> that<00:00:40.329> they're<00:00:40.510> just<00:00:40.809> in<00:00:41.020> and<00:00:41.230> the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
the surface that they're just in and the

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.650 
the surface that they're just in and the
rest<00:00:41.860> will<00:00:41.980> be<00:00:42.100> hanging<00:00:42.340> down<00:00:42.610> so<00:00:43.030> you<00:00:43.510> can

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
rest will be hanging down so you can

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.500 
rest will be hanging down so you can
like<00:00:43.870> lock<00:00:44.440> them<00:00:44.680> up<00:00:44.829> on<00:00:45.040> the<00:00:45.160> top<00:00:45.370> of<00:00:45.400> on<00:00:46.360> the

like lock them up on the top of on the

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.270 
like lock them up on the top of on the
top<00:00:46.690> of<00:00:46.720> stairs<00:00:47.440> or<00:00:47.740> whatever<00:00:47.950> and<00:00:48.130> they're

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
top of stairs or whatever and they're

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.800 
top of stairs or whatever and they're
just<00:00:48.460> hanging<00:00:48.579> down<00:00:48.850> it's<00:00:49.060> really<00:00:49.360> goofy<00:00:49.660> it's

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
just hanging down it's really goofy it's

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.240 
just hanging down it's really goofy it's
it's<00:00:50.290> really<00:00:50.470> straightforward<00:00:50.680> to<00:00:50.980> do<00:00:51.100> it's

putting<00:00:58.420> this<00:00:58.570> together<00:00:58.660> Andrew<00:00:59.200> basically

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
putting this together Andrew basically

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.680 
putting this together Andrew basically
what<00:01:00.310> you<00:01:00.399> need<00:01:00.520> to<00:01:00.579> do<00:01:00.730> is<00:01:00.940> get<00:01:01.329> a<00:01:01.390> crawler

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
what you need to do is get a crawler

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.330 
what you need to do is get a crawler
with<00:01:01.870> a<00:01:01.930> grenade<00:01:02.050> preferably<00:01:02.860> on<00:01:02.950> the<00:01:03.040> last

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
with a grenade preferably on the last

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.399 
with a grenade preferably on the last
zombie<00:01:03.730> so<00:01:04.390> then<00:01:04.540> you<00:01:04.629> kind<00:01:04.869> of<00:01:04.899> have<00:01:05.079> a<00:01:05.110> little

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
zombie so then you kind of have a little

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.590 
zombie so then you kind of have a little
bit<00:01:05.560> of<00:01:05.590> a<00:01:06.250> little<00:01:06.790> bit<00:01:06.909> of<00:01:07.030> you<00:01:07.240> know<00:01:07.329> working

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
bit of a little bit of you know working

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.630 
bit of a little bit of you know working
space<00:01:08.049> you're<00:01:08.290> not<00:01:08.409> being<00:01:09.009> chased<00:01:09.250> by<00:01:09.340> a<00:01:09.430> bunch

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
space you're not being chased by a bunch

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.580 
space you're not being chased by a bunch
of<00:01:09.700> other<00:01:09.880> ones<00:01:10.119> and<00:01:10.390> I<00:01:10.780> mean<00:01:11.020> you<00:01:11.140> can<00:01:11.290> do<00:01:11.469> it

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
of other ones and I mean you can do it

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.410 
of other ones and I mean you can do it
earlier<00:01:11.890> but<00:01:12.399> this<00:01:12.729> is<00:01:12.820> probably<00:01:13.000> the<00:01:13.119> easiest

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
earlier but this is probably the easiest

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.749 
earlier but this is probably the easiest
method<00:01:13.829> then<00:01:14.829> you<00:01:15.040> want<00:01:15.189> to<00:01:15.280> have<00:01:15.369> some<00:01:15.490> candy

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
method then you want to have some candy

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.360 
method then you want to have some candy
for<00:01:15.880> you<00:01:16.120> so<00:01:16.600> walk<00:01:17.229> over<00:01:17.560> and<00:01:17.740> give<00:01:17.979> the<00:01:18.100> candy

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
for you so walk over and give the candy

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.760 
for you so walk over and give the candy
to<00:01:18.490> Leroy<00:01:18.850> and<00:01:19.090> when<00:01:19.659> he's<00:01:19.840> about<00:01:20.049> to<00:01:20.560> grip

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
to Leroy and when he's about to grip

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.050 
to Leroy and when he's about to grip
pick<00:01:20.950> up<00:01:21.070> the<00:01:21.159> crawler<00:01:21.400> just<00:01:21.820> when<00:01:21.970> he<00:01:22.030> was

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
pick up the crawler just when he was

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.660 
pick up the crawler just when he was
about<00:01:22.180> to<00:01:22.330> grab<00:01:22.600> it<00:01:22.630> shoot<00:01:23.350> Leroy<00:01:23.770> um<00:01:24.010> the

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
about to grab it shoot Leroy um the

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.399 
about to grab it shoot Leroy um the
animation<00:01:25.270> should<00:01:25.540> still<00:01:25.750> happen<00:01:26.080> he'll<00:01:26.229> run

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
animation should still happen he'll run

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.080 
animation should still happen he'll run
off<00:01:26.530> as<00:01:26.770> you've<00:01:26.950> seen<00:01:27.159> multiple<00:01:27.430> times<00:01:27.760> kind

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
off as you've seen multiple times kind

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.550 
off as you've seen multiple times kind
of<00:01:28.119> its<00:01:28.479> shown<00:01:28.840> multiple<00:01:29.200> times<00:01:29.350> in<00:01:29.470> this

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
of its shown multiple times in this

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.469 
of its shown multiple times in this
video<00:01:29.770> after<00:01:30.430> you<00:01:30.490> shoot<00:01:30.670> him<00:01:30.729> the<00:01:31.030> animation

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
video after you shoot him the animation

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.330 
video after you shoot him the animation
happens<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.590> crawler<00:01:32.860> will<00:01:33.070> essentially

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
happens and the crawler will essentially

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.250 
happens and the crawler will essentially
fall<00:01:33.670> down<00:01:33.850> into<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:34.270> ground<00:01:34.299> and<00:01:34.840> then<00:01:34.990> all

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
fall down into the ground and then all

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.810 
fall down into the ground and then all
you'll<00:01:35.409> see<00:01:35.440> is<00:01:35.650> his<00:01:36.010> head<00:01:36.220> and<00:01:36.400> if<00:01:36.520> you<00:01:36.610> walk

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
you'll see is his head and if you walk

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.430 
you'll see is his head and if you walk
underneath<00:01:37.150> him<00:01:37.390> like<00:01:37.570> on<00:01:37.690> a<00:01:37.750> stairway<00:01:38.170> as<00:01:38.320> you

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
underneath him like on a stairway as you
