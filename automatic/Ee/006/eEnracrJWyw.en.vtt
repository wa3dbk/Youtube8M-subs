 Fava water or boiling water 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.029
 any legumes and in this case 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.680
 we have the chickpea liquid or the 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.199
 boiled chickpea but it can be 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.090

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.389
 things are going to use the juice forgiveness 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.219
 grated orange or a lemon or the 

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:44.079

 a white flower or any flour that 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.420
 already have the bicarbonate incorporated and 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:56.139
 all that incorporated today I'm with the 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.049
 tongue when flour 675 grams then 

00:00:56.139 --> 00:01:03.360
 We have normal sunflower oil or 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:06.520
 corn that is neutral and 210 milliliters 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.979
 750 grams of ordinary sugar 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.930
 all life 600 grams of drink 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.810
 soy or soy milk whatever you want the 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.930
 Saman can also be cashew nuts or 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.520
 of almonds or rice yes and good are 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.470
 those the ingredients basically we're going 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.910
 to beat first 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.960
 to put the camera yes to make it look 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:30.290
 better let's beat the liquid 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.290
 chickpea 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:39.320
 it would be two cups and a spoonful two 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.320
 cups and a little more beat by hand 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.159
 let's beat the chickpea water but 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.909
 Always remember to have the oven 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.640
 turned on at 175 degrees and a mold on 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.710
 butter with margarine of course with 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.159
 better a baking paper so that it does not 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.159
 hit us 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.659
 how to tell it about snow 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.680
 I do not have a snow point I 'm almost going 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.680
 to add the oil 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.930
 the sugar 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.530
 in the previous recipe of the meringue I said 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.290
 he had sung for icing sugar 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.280
 but with the normal sugar goes you ride 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.280
 super good meringue 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.840
 let's put the lemon zest or 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.170
 the orange in this case 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.430
 and essence of vanilla also or essence 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.430
 bathrooms alone if they want 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.819
 I'm going down 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.180
 work more slowly no more 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.379
 a soy drink 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:32.140
 this recipe can be divided into three and 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.610
 they are going to make a normal cake for a lot 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.930
 people 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.500
 and now the leavening flour 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.500
 how is it 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.800
 does not know the speed to be little to 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.800
 little flour 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.849
 a little touch of yellow coloring 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.849
 turmeric 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.970
 we incorporate all life 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.710
 life must be incorporated slowly not 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.100
 let's lose all these bubbles that 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.510
 we have in the mass 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.140
 and it is what is important for our 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.140
 sponge cake 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.080
 Always a pinch of salt 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:43.530
 well we have our incredible mass 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:46.770
 super fluffy for summer sponge cake 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:50.669
 This mass can also be used to 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.560
 make vanilla if I give the last 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.289
 touch with a manual shake to 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.539
 make sure that I do not have any group left 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:59.970
 but never very aggressively because I 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:04.210
 I'm going to load the bubbles 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:07.270
 the mold we throw the cream remember 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:10.150
 to have the oven hot I told you that 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:14.700
 this was a lot of mass because to be a 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:17.460
 grade in - great grand cake 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.610
 can do a third part nothing more 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.180
 of all this for a normal mold of 20 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.180
 centimeters 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.449
 by your side 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:39.180
 and the oven to brown 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.860
 as you will see I also read I did not have to 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.389
 do it twice to the cake because the 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.400
 the first time I opened the oven before 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:46.320
 time I eat out because 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.780
 It was very hot 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.760
 the march all good things that happen to 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:54.300
 times in the bakery do not learn from 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:56.460
 this here again came in and they say and good 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.950
 it did not go perfect because it started to 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.760
 dripping all the mold but it was 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.760
 fairly good 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:20.910
 I can not let it cool with the paper 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.980
 and there we have our cake 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:26.430
 the cut to the middle but I have to leave 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:29.370
 still cool these things and here it is 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:32.310
 the failure and the frustration that I have 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:35.640
 published in group b won frustrated 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:38.070
 in the kitchen you must leave all the tricks 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:41.380
 on the blog in vegan dimension dotcom 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:44.850
 in the post of the sponge cake this summer 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.850
