00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
Copic ciao range and so I'm fairly new

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.010 
Copic ciao range and so I'm fairly new
to<00:00:41.000> Akaka<00:00:42.000> markers<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:42.450> I've<00:00:42.540> played<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.989> lot

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
to Akaka markers but I've played a lot

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.709 
to Akaka markers but I've played a lot
with<00:00:43.379> these<00:00:43.469> apply<00:00:43.920> adhesive<00:00:44.070> ease<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.879> me

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
with these apply adhesive ease and me

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.420 
with these apply adhesive ease and me
I'd<00:00:45.809> like<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.110> think<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.500> know<00:00:46.559> quite<00:00:46.950> about<00:00:47.219> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
I'd like to think I know quite about the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.790 
I'd like to think I know quite about the
ones<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.870> moving<00:00:49.260> onto<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.620> big

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
ones I have so moving onto the big

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.529 
ones I have so moving onto the big
market<00:00:50.399> range<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.879> think<00:00:50.969> there's<00:00:51.270> quite<00:00:51.420> a

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
market range I think there's quite a

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.540 
market range I think there's quite a
good<00:00:51.780> selection<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.320> color<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.070> micro<00:00:53.340> set

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
good selection of color so the micro set

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.000 
good selection of color so the micro set
comes<00:00:53.730> like<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.090> in<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.570> plastic<00:00:55.010> container

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
comes like this in a plastic container

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.920 
comes like this in a plastic container
it's<00:00:56.670> quite<00:00:56.940> convenient<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.510> quite<00:00:57.719> like<00:00:57.840> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
it's quite convenient I quite like the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.779 
it's quite convenient I quite like the
container<00:00:58.260> but<00:00:58.890> it's<00:00:59.100> just<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> front

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
container but it's just that the front

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.150 
container but it's just that the front
ones<00:00:59.969> keep<00:01:00.210> falling<00:01:00.570> out<00:01:00.660> for<00:01:00.899> me<00:01:01.020> when<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.469> open

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
ones keep falling out for me when I open

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.280 
ones keep falling out for me when I open
and<00:01:02.280> close<00:01:02.340> them<00:01:02.670> each<00:01:03.390> marker<00:01:03.899> looks<00:01:04.080> like

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
and close them each marker looks like

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.289 
and close them each marker looks like
this<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:04.890> very<00:01:05.189> similar<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.850> Sharpie<00:01:07.220> but

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
this it's very similar to a Sharpie but

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.060 
this it's very similar to a Sharpie but
this<00:01:09.299> one<00:01:09.479> has<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.900> rubber<00:01:10.260> grip<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.830> that's

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
this one has a rubber grip and that's

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.340 
this one has a rubber grip and that's
actually<00:01:11.490> quite<00:01:11.580> convenient<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.360> got<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> fine

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
ones I'm actually going to show you how

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.080 
ones I'm actually going to show you how
these<00:01:30.780> are<00:01:31.110> markers<00:01:31.740> behave<00:01:32.280> by<00:01:32.610> just<00:01:32.820> doing

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
these are markers behave by just doing

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.899 
these are markers behave by just doing
like<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.299> little<00:01:33.479> blend<00:01:33.840> here<00:01:34.579> so<00:01:35.579> I'm<00:01:35.700> using

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
like a little blend here so I'm using

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.969 
like a little blend here so I'm using
the<00:01:36.150> lightest<00:01:36.540> color<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.140> Blues<00:01:37.350> which<00:01:37.650> is

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
the lightest color of the Blues which is

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.899 
the lightest color of the Blues which is
ocean<00:01:38.970> V<00:01:39.150> blue<00:01:39.390> with<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.380> color<00:01:40.770> blue<00:01:41.610> skies

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
ocean V blue with the color blue skies

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.789 
ocean V blue with the color blue skies
blue<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:44.329> found<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.450> best<00:01:45.600> method<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.320> doing

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
blue I found the best method to doing

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.910 
blue I found the best method to doing
this<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.509> coloring<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.540> whole<00:01:48.960> surface<00:01:49.530> with

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
this is coloring the whole surface with

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.690 
this is coloring the whole surface with
a<00:01:50.159> lighter<00:01:51.090> color<00:01:51.470> using<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.680> darker<00:01:53.520> color

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
a lighter color using the darker color

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.050 
a lighter color using the darker color
and<00:01:54.030> going<00:01:54.420> over<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.549> then<00:01:56.549> blending<00:01:57.000> it

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
and going over it and then blending it

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.020 
and going over it and then blending it
through<00:01:57.299> again<00:01:57.600> with<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.200> lighter<00:01:58.469> color<00:02:02.030> as

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
through again with the lighter color as

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.850 
through again with the lighter color as
you<00:02:03.540> can<00:02:03.689> see<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.020> really<00:02:04.290> kind<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.560> have<00:02:04.710> to

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
you can see you really kind of have to

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.700 
you can see you really kind of have to
work<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.340> in<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.869> get<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.079> blend<00:02:07.229> and

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
work it in to get it to blend and

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.639 
work it in to get it to blend and
there's<00:02:08.399> still<00:02:08.580> some<00:02:09.300> hard<00:02:09.750> edges<00:02:10.080> but<00:02:10.410> it's

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
there's still some hard edges but it's

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.150 
there's still some hard edges but it's
not<00:02:10.830> as<00:02:10.979> noticeable<00:02:11.129> as

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
not as noticeable as

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.220 
not as noticeable as
just<00:02:13.160> using<00:02:13.520> a<00:02:13.670> normal<00:02:13.910> marker<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.720> reason<00:02:15.080> I

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
just using a normal marker the reason I

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.140 
just using a normal marker the reason I
think<00:02:16.010> this<00:02:16.160> is<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.370> best<00:02:16.580> way<00:02:16.700> to<00:02:16.730> do<00:02:16.970> it<00:02:17.060> is

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
think this is the best way to do it is

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.000 
think this is the best way to do it is
because<00:02:17.300> when<00:02:18.110> you<00:02:18.260> use<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.560> ladder<00:02:18.710> color

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
because when you use the ladder color

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.820 
because when you use the ladder color
underneath<00:02:19.370> it<00:02:19.700> gets<00:02:19.910> really<00:02:20.270> moist<00:02:20.680> so<00:02:21.680> then

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
underneath it gets really moist so then

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.920 
underneath it gets really moist so then
you<00:02:22.250> can<00:02:22.760> go<00:02:22.940> over<00:02:22.970> with<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.450> darker<00:02:23.720> color

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
you can go over with the darker color

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.200 
you can go over with the darker color
and<00:02:24.140> it<00:02:24.350> doesn't<00:02:24.620> really<00:02:24.710> set<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.670> hardline

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
and it doesn't really set the hardline

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.860 
and it doesn't really set the hardline
the<00:02:27.140> best<00:02:27.560> colors<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.370> blend<00:02:28.550> in<00:02:28.850> this<00:02:29.030> set<00:02:29.630> by

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
the best colors to blend in this set by

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.500 
the best colors to blend in this set by
far<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.440> Blues<00:02:30.730> if<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:31.790> can<00:02:31.910> see<00:02:32.030> my<00:02:32.180> testers

far the Blues if you can see my testers
here<00:02:32.660> I<00:02:32.750> used<00:02:33.310> most<00:02:34.310> of<00:02:34.460> this<00:02:34.550> release

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
here I used most of this release

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.060 
here I used most of this release
interchangeably<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:35.990> they<00:02:36.080> blended<00:02:36.530> fairly

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
interchangeably and they blended fairly

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.270 
interchangeably and they blended fairly
well<00:02:37.750> for<00:02:38.750> example<00:02:38.840> this<00:02:39.410> one<00:02:39.680> deep<00:02:39.950> sea<00:02:40.160> blue

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
well for example this one deep sea blue

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.650 
well for example this one deep sea blue
blend<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:40.760> quite<00:02:41.000> well<00:02:41.090> with<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.270> ocean<00:02:41.540> view

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
blend and quite well with the ocean view

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.000 
blend and quite well with the ocean view
blue<00:02:41.870> even<00:02:42.260> though<00:02:42.440> they're<00:02:42.620> quite<00:02:42.860> different

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
blue even though they're quite different

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.180 
blue even though they're quite different
in<00:02:43.570> valleys<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:45.170> Browns<00:02:45.440> also<00:02:45.830> blended

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
in valleys the Browns also blended

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.580 
in valleys the Browns also blended
really<00:02:46.340> well<00:02:46.520> I<00:02:46.940> went<00:02:47.870> from<00:02:48.020> the<00:02:48.290> lightest

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
really well I went from the lightest

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.610 
really well I went from the lightest
Brown<00:02:48.770> which<00:02:49.010> is<00:02:49.040> this<00:02:49.340> tiki<00:02:49.850> hut<00:02:50.120> tan<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:51.500> the

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
Brown which is this tiki hut tan to the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.229 
Brown which is this tiki hut tan to the
darkest<00:02:51.950> one<00:02:52.130> using<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:52.610> honey<00:02:52.760> brand<00:02:53.060> in<00:02:53.180> the

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
darkest one using the honey brand in the

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.380 
darkest one using the honey brand in the
middle<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:54.950> yeah<00:02:55.250> I<00:02:55.280> think<00:02:55.520> these<00:02:55.730> colors<00:02:56.120> on

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
middle and yeah I think these colors on

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.949 
middle and yeah I think these colors on
this<00:02:56.540> page

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
this page

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.390 
this page
overall<00:02:57.380> blended<00:02:57.709> a<00:02:57.770> lot<00:02:57.920> well<00:02:58.100> than<00:02:58.280> the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
overall blended a lot well than the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.210 
overall blended a lot well than the
other<00:02:58.580> ones<00:02:58.790> on<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.510> front<00:02:59.660> page<00:02:59.959> so<00:03:00.220> I'll

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
other ones on the front page so I'll

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.440 
other ones on the front page so I'll
show<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:01.489> what<00:03:01.640> I<00:03:01.670> did<00:03:01.820> on<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.030> front<00:03:02.150> page

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
show you what I did on the front page

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.380 
show you what I did on the front page
which<00:03:03.290> is<00:03:03.470> these<00:03:03.650> really<00:03:03.980> saturated<00:03:04.700> light

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
which is these really saturated light

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.090 
which is these really saturated light
colors<00:03:05.780> what<00:03:06.770> I<00:03:06.800> found

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
colors what I found

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.400 
colors what I found
overall<00:03:07.340> in<00:03:07.520> these<00:03:07.700> Pink's<00:03:08.170> actually<00:03:09.170> blend

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
overall in these Pink's actually blend

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.250 
overall in these Pink's actually blend
as<00:03:09.560> well<00:03:09.920> but<00:03:10.160> it's<00:03:10.370> quite<00:03:10.700> good<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.989> greens

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
as well but it's quite good the greens

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.720 
as well but it's quite good the greens
are<00:03:12.470> pretty<00:03:12.620> good<00:03:12.800> too<00:03:13.010> and<00:03:13.340> I<00:03:13.520> don't<00:03:13.580> think

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
are pretty good too and I don't think

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.220 
are pretty good too and I don't think
the<00:03:13.910> yellow<00:03:14.000> blends<00:03:14.450> well<00:03:14.660> at<00:03:14.780> all<00:03:14.930> because<00:03:15.050> it

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
the yellow blends well at all because it

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.289 
the yellow blends well at all because it
was<00:03:15.290> especially<00:03:15.530> stiff<00:03:16.130> the<00:03:16.340> nib<00:03:16.549> the<00:03:17.150> way

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
was especially stiff the nib the way

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.330 
was especially stiff the nib the way
that<00:03:17.510> these<00:03:17.630> actually<00:03:18.140> blend<00:03:18.470> I'll<00:03:18.920> show<00:03:19.280> you

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
that these actually blend I'll show you

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.030 
that these actually blend I'll show you
with<00:03:19.670> some<00:03:19.700> Pink's<00:03:20.330> as<00:03:20.450> well<00:03:20.660> is<00:03:21.019> that<00:03:21.410> they

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
with some Pink's as well is that they

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.130 
with some Pink's as well is that they
don't<00:03:22.340> really<00:03:22.580> smudge<00:03:23.120> like<00:03:23.450> the<00:03:23.630> ACOG

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
don't really smudge like the ACOG

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.740 
don't really smudge like the ACOG
markers<00:03:24.530> do<00:03:24.709> but<00:03:24.980> they<00:03:25.250> do<00:03:25.310> more<00:03:25.700> of<00:03:25.760> a<00:03:26.239> overlay

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
markers do but they do more of a overlay

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.500 
markers do but they do more of a overlay
so<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.530> first<00:03:27.769> layer<00:03:28.220> you<00:03:28.580> put<00:03:28.610> on<00:03:28.940> it's<00:03:29.330> quite

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
so the first layer you put on it's quite

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.470 
so the first layer you put on it's quite
light<00:03:29.810> and<00:03:30.019> not<00:03:30.440> that<00:03:30.890> opaque<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:31.519> then<00:03:32.150> the

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
light and not that opaque and then the

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.840 
light and not that opaque and then the
more<00:03:32.660> you<00:03:32.690> rub<00:03:33.530> into<00:03:33.650> it<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.459> more<00:03:34.640> it<00:03:34.730> goes

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
more you rub into it the more it goes

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.250 
more you rub into it the more it goes
over<00:03:35.060> so<00:03:35.330> you<00:03:35.390> can<00:03:35.480> see<00:03:35.660> it<00:03:35.750> in<00:03:35.840> kind<00:03:35.989> of<00:03:36.080> these

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
over so you can see it in kind of these

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.259 
over so you can see it in kind of these
cars<00:03:36.530> way<00:03:36.799> more<00:03:37.040> than<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.280> other<00:03:37.310> ones<00:03:37.610> like

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
cars way more than the other ones like

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.240 
cars way more than the other ones like
these<00:03:38.450> Pink's<00:03:38.900> here<00:03:39.049> you<00:03:39.709> really<00:03:39.890> have<00:03:40.010> to

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
these Pink's here you really have to

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.220 
these Pink's here you really have to
work<00:03:40.430> into<00:03:40.640> it<00:03:40.760> to<00:03:40.850> get<00:03:41.060> to<00:03:41.150> blend<00:03:41.390> but<00:03:41.660> they

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
work into it to get to blend but they

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.870 
work into it to get to blend but they
don't<00:03:42.410> actually<00:03:42.650> really<00:03:42.980> blend<00:03:43.370> so<00:03:43.640> can<00:03:43.790> you

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
don't actually really blend so can you

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.550 
don't actually really blend so can you
see<00:03:44.000> how<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.150> middle<00:03:44.360> is<00:03:44.750> darker<00:03:45.380> than<00:03:45.410> the

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
see how the middle is darker than the

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.530 
see how the middle is darker than the
rest<00:03:45.680> that<00:03:46.459> is<00:03:46.549> because<00:03:46.790> of<00:03:46.820> colored<00:03:47.239> in<00:03:47.390> it<00:03:47.510> a

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
rest that is because of colored in it a

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.360 
rest that is because of colored in it a
lot<00:03:47.810> more<00:03:48.019> and<00:03:48.080> it's<00:03:48.320> a<00:03:48.470> lot<00:03:48.620> more<00:03:48.739> opaque<00:03:49.070> than

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
lot more and it's a lot more opaque than

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.390 
lot more and it's a lot more opaque than
the<00:03:49.580> other<00:03:49.760> colors<00:03:50.000> like<00:03:50.420> here<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:50.959> here<00:03:51.400> so

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
the other colors like here and here so

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.560 
the other colors like here and here so
that<00:03:52.549> shows<00:03:52.760> you<00:03:52.940> that<00:03:52.970> it<00:03:53.239> doesn't<00:03:53.480> actually

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
that shows you that it doesn't actually

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.350 
that shows you that it doesn't actually
really<00:03:53.900> blend<00:03:54.410> colors<00:03:54.739> per<00:03:54.950> se<00:03:55.130> but<00:03:55.190> I'm<00:03:55.670> more

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
really blend colors per se but I'm more

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.180 
really blend colors per se but I'm more
yeah<00:03:56.600> it's<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:57.170> overlaying<00:03:57.620> effect<00:03:58.010> that

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
yeah it's the overlaying effect that

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.370 
yeah it's the overlaying effect that
looks<00:03:58.430> like<00:03:58.610> it's<00:03:58.820> blended<00:03:59.209> in<00:03:59.870> that<00:04:00.080> aspect

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
looks like it's blended in that aspect

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.840 
looks like it's blended in that aspect
it's<00:04:00.560> quite<00:04:00.860> different<00:04:01.100> to<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:01.370> Copic

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
it's quite different to the Copic

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.580 
it's quite different to the Copic
markers<00:04:02.239> I'll<00:04:02.600> just<00:04:02.840> show<00:04:03.019> you<00:04:03.049> how<00:04:03.290> some<00:04:03.530> of

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
markers I'll just show you how some of

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.410 
markers I'll just show you how some of
these<00:04:03.739> um<00:04:04.070> warmer<00:04:05.230> shades<00:04:06.230> blend<00:04:06.680> I

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
these um warmer shades blend I

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.400 
these um warmer shades blend I
personally<00:04:08.420> like<00:04:08.630> I<00:04:08.750> said<00:04:08.930> like<00:04:09.110> the<00:04:09.230> blue

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
personally like I said like the blue

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.240 
personally like I said like the blue
ones<00:04:09.620> a<00:04:09.739> lot<00:04:09.920> better<00:04:11.470> but<00:04:12.470> these<00:04:12.709> aren't<00:04:13.010> bad

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
ones a lot better but these aren't bad

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.170 
ones a lot better but these aren't bad
either<00:04:13.519> I<00:04:13.910> mean

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.940 

what<00:04:19.180> I<00:04:19.209> found<00:04:19.390> with<00:04:19.660> these<00:04:19.840> Pink's<00:04:20.680> is<00:04:20.799> that

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
what I found with these Pink's is that

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.890 
what I found with these Pink's is that
you<00:04:21.070> can't<00:04:21.310> really<00:04:21.519> blend<00:04:21.790> two<00:04:22.630> different

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
you can't really blend two different

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.590 
you can't really blend two different
ones<00:04:22.990> from<00:04:23.320> drastically<00:04:23.920> different<00:04:24.600> families

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
ones from drastically different families

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.680 
ones from drastically different families
so<00:04:26.350> this<00:04:26.770> one<00:04:26.980> see<00:04:27.910> how<00:04:27.940> I've<00:04:28.180> tried<00:04:28.390> to<00:04:28.510> blend

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
so this one see how I've tried to blend

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.060 
so this one see how I've tried to blend
the<00:04:28.780> petal<00:04:29.020> pink<00:04:29.230> with<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.500> red<00:04:29.680> there<00:04:29.890> and<00:04:30.010> it

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
the petal pink with the red there and it

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.070 
the petal pink with the red there and it
doesn't<00:04:30.310> really<00:04:30.640> look<00:04:30.880> that<00:04:31.030> good<00:04:31.240> you<00:04:31.930> can

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
doesn't really look that good you can

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.900 
doesn't really look that good you can
only<00:04:32.230> really<00:04:32.500> blend<00:04:32.890> them<00:04:33.100> with<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.490> colors

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
only really blend them with the colors

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.370 
only really blend them with the colors
that<00:04:34.060> are<00:04:34.180> next<00:04:34.450> to<00:04:34.540> it<00:04:34.690> so<00:04:34.870> basically<00:04:35.200> the

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
that are next to it so basically the

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.200 
that are next to it so basically the
ones<00:04:35.560> that<00:04:35.680> are<00:04:35.770> closer<00:04:36.010> to<00:04:36.250> it<00:04:36.340> in<00:04:36.460> value<00:04:36.910> and

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
ones that are closer to it in value and

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.960 
ones that are closer to it in value and
I'm<00:04:38.140> here<00:04:38.470> as<00:04:38.650> well<00:04:38.830> these<00:04:39.280> colors<00:04:39.700> aren't

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
I'm here as well these colors aren't

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.700 
I'm here as well these colors aren't
really<00:04:40.150> as<00:04:40.300> great<00:04:40.510> as<00:04:40.690> these<00:04:40.900> ones<00:04:41.140> in<00:04:41.440> terms

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
really as great as these ones in terms

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.650 
really as great as these ones in terms
of<00:04:41.860> blending<00:04:42.340> and<00:04:42.910> I<00:04:43.060> think<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.300> reason<00:04:43.570> is

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
of blending and I think the reason is

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.300 
of blending and I think the reason is
you<00:04:44.200> obviously<00:04:44.590> use<00:04:44.830> different<00:04:45.130> chemicals

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
you obviously use different chemicals

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.670 
you obviously use different chemicals
for<00:04:45.880> each<00:04:46.240> color<00:04:46.600> you<00:04:46.840> want<00:04:46.990> to<00:04:47.080> produce<00:04:47.230> in<00:04:47.560> an

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
for each color you want to produce in an

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.920 
for each color you want to produce in an
arts<00:04:47.890> play<00:04:48.100> so<00:04:48.820> they<00:04:49.270> obviously<00:04:49.420> don't<00:04:49.840> have

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
arts play so they obviously don't have

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.540 
arts play so they obviously don't have
the<00:04:50.050> same<00:04:50.320> chemicals<00:04:50.770> or<00:04:50.920> properties<00:04:51.280> and

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
the same chemicals or properties and

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.220 
the same chemicals or properties and
that<00:04:51.970> might<00:04:52.180> actually<00:04:52.210> affect<00:04:52.570> the<00:04:52.870> blending

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
that might actually affect the blending

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.810 
that might actually affect the blending
and<00:04:53.410> I<00:04:53.470> think<00:04:53.650> that's<00:04:53.770> probably<00:04:54.010> why<00:04:54.250> you

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
and I think that's probably why you

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.340 
and I think that's probably why you
can't<00:04:55.030> really<00:04:55.210> expect<00:04:55.840> something<00:04:56.170> very

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
can't really expect something very

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.560 
can't really expect something very
consistent<00:04:56.800> like<00:04:57.490> me<00:04:57.640> Copic<00:04:57.940> markers<00:04:58.270> because

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
consistent like me Copic markers because

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.720 
consistent like me Copic markers because
obviously<00:04:58.780> these<00:04:59.170> are<00:04:59.470> a<00:04:59.800> lot<00:05:00.070> cheaper<00:05:00.340> and

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
obviously these are a lot cheaper and

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.000 
obviously these are a lot cheaper and
yeah<00:05:01.120> more<00:05:01.480> for<00:05:01.630> a<00:05:01.660> mass-market<00:05:02.080> than<00:05:02.470> an<00:05:02.710> art

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
yeah more for a mass-market than an art

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.340 
yeah more for a mass-market than an art
market<00:05:03.490> over<00:05:04.360> I<00:05:04.480> think<00:05:04.810> these<00:05:04.930> markers<00:05:05.320> are

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
market over I think these markers are

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.130 
market over I think these markers are
really<00:05:05.620> good<00:05:06.190> for<00:05:06.520> the<00:05:06.580> price<00:05:06.820> I<00:05:07.150> think<00:05:07.990> that

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
really good for the price I think that

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.700 
really good for the price I think that
if<00:05:08.290> you're<00:05:08.440> not<00:05:09.160> a<00:05:09.190> really<00:05:09.610> hardcore<00:05:10.710> marking

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
if you're not a really hardcore marking

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.200 
if you're not a really hardcore marking
user<00:05:11.890> you<00:05:12.130> could<00:05:12.280> really<00:05:12.430> get<00:05:12.640> these<00:05:12.790> and<00:05:13.060> just

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
user you could really get these and just

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.960 
user you could really get these and just
maybe<00:05:13.660> focus<00:05:14.110> on<00:05:14.260> getting<00:05:14.980> kopecks<00:05:15.490> for<00:05:15.669> skin

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
maybe focus on getting kopecks for skin

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.370 
maybe focus on getting kopecks for skin
tones<00:05:16.210> and<00:05:16.419> etcetera<00:05:16.840> where<00:05:16.990> you<00:05:17.080> really<00:05:17.350> need

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
tones and etcetera where you really need

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.350 
tones and etcetera where you really need
a<00:05:17.500> blend<00:05:17.800> and<00:05:17.980> then<00:05:18.550> you<00:05:18.700> could<00:05:18.820> use<00:05:18.940> these<00:05:19.090> for

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
a blend and then you could use these for

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.060 
a blend and then you could use these for
clothes<00:05:19.630> if<00:05:19.870> you're<00:05:19.990> an<00:05:20.080> occasional<00:05:20.620> user<00:05:20.800> if

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
clothes if you're an occasional user if

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.190 
clothes if you're an occasional user if
you<00:05:21.310> want<00:05:21.520> to<00:05:21.610> color<00:05:21.820> a<00:05:22.060> lot<00:05:22.300> I<00:05:22.600> don't<00:05:23.050> think

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
you want to color a lot I don't think

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.290 
you want to color a lot I don't think
these<00:05:23.320> are<00:05:23.380> really<00:05:23.890> good<00:05:24.610> for<00:05:24.669> it<00:05:24.940> because

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
these are really good for it because

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.000 
these are really good for it because
firstly<00:05:25.990> they<00:05:26.169> don't<00:05:26.320> really<00:05:26.500> blend<00:05:26.800> as<00:05:26.980> well

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
firstly they don't really blend as well

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.550 
firstly they don't really blend as well
as<00:05:27.280> Copic<00:05:27.610> so<00:05:27.790> you<00:05:27.850> may<00:05:27.970> as<00:05:28.030> well<00:05:28.090> invest

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
as Copic so you may as well invest

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.659 
as Copic so you may as well invest
because<00:05:29.560> you<00:05:29.710> can<00:05:29.860> use<00:05:29.980> copics<00:05:30.310> again<00:05:30.520> and

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
because you can use copics again and

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:31.890 
because you can use copics again and
again<00:05:30.850> and<00:05:31.030> I'm<00:05:31.120> pretty<00:05:31.330> sure<00:05:31.540> you<00:05:31.660> can't

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
again and I'm pretty sure you can't

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.370 
again and I'm pretty sure you can't
actually<00:05:32.080> refill<00:05:32.740> these<00:05:33.150> and<00:05:34.150> secondly<00:05:34.570> the

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
actually refill these and secondly the

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.200 
actually refill these and secondly the
colors<00:05:35.770> aren't<00:05:36.310> really<00:05:36.490> that<00:05:36.640> diverse<00:05:37.030> they

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
colors aren't really that diverse they

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.520 
colors aren't really that diverse they
have<00:05:37.330> quite<00:05:37.540> a<00:05:37.570> lot<00:05:37.750> of<00:05:37.840> bright<00:05:38.110> colors<00:05:38.140> in

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
have quite a lot of bright colors in

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.469 
have quite a lot of bright colors in
your<00:05:38.919> face<00:05:39.130> colors<00:05:39.520> except<00:05:40.120> for<00:05:40.240> the<00:05:40.300> Blues

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
your face colors except for the Blues

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.630 
your face colors except for the Blues
are<00:05:40.720> good<00:05:40.900> but<00:05:41.770> yeah<00:05:41.890> these<00:05:42.100> cars<00:05:42.400> aren't

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
are good but yeah these cars aren't

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.740 
are good but yeah these cars aren't
really<00:05:42.820> diverse<00:05:43.180> so<00:05:43.330> you<00:05:43.390> can't<00:05:43.600> really

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
really diverse so you can't really

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.900 
really diverse so you can't really
achieve<00:05:43.870> a<00:05:44.440> realistic<00:05:44.919> effect<00:05:45.430> it's<00:05:45.580> very

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
achieve a realistic effect it's very

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.760 
achieve a realistic effect it's very
bright<00:05:46.210> I<00:05:46.450> think<00:05:47.050> they're<00:05:47.169> really<00:05:47.380> good<00:05:47.560> and

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
bright I think they're really good and

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.500 
bright I think they're really good and
I'm<00:05:47.830> gonna<00:05:47.950> be<00:05:48.100> using<00:05:48.460> them<00:05:48.580> obviously<00:05:48.760> but<00:05:49.330> I

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
I'm gonna be using them obviously but I

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.420 
I'm gonna be using them obviously but I
mean<00:05:50.169> clearly<00:05:50.530> they<00:05:50.800> can't<00:05:51.040> be<00:05:51.130> really

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
mean clearly they can't be really

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.370 
mean clearly they can't be really
compared<00:05:51.790> to<00:05:51.910> alcoholic<00:05:52.240> markers<00:05:52.630> I<00:05:52.840> don't

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
compared to alcoholic markers I don't

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.659 
compared to alcoholic markers I don't
think<00:05:53.590> people<00:05:53.740> should<00:05:53.919> really<00:05:54.250> believe<00:05:54.490> the

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
think people should really believe the

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:56.700 
think people should really believe the
hype<00:05:54.880> of<00:05:55.120> certain<00:05:56.020> reviews<00:05:56.320> on<00:05:56.560> YouTube

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
hype of certain reviews on YouTube

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.070 
hype of certain reviews on YouTube
because<00:05:57.220> they<00:05:58.180> were<00:05:58.360> using<00:05:58.660> these<00:05:58.810> colors

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
because they were using these colors

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.900 
because they were using these colors
which<00:05:59.410> are<00:05:59.620> really<00:05:59.860> easy<00:06:00.010> to<00:06:00.340> blend<00:06:00.520> but<00:06:00.790> they

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
which are really easy to blend but they

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.909 
which are really easy to blend but they
don't<00:06:01.060> really<00:06:01.240> showcase<00:06:01.750> these<00:06:02.050> colors<00:06:02.440> which

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 
don't really showcase these colors which

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:04.200 
don't really showcase these colors which
are<00:06:03.070> a<00:06:03.160> little<00:06:03.310> bit<00:06:03.490> more<00:06:03.610> difficult<00:06:04.000> to<00:06:04.060> blend

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
are a little bit more difficult to blend

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.540 
are a little bit more difficult to blend
um<00:06:04.990> you<00:06:05.290> really<00:06:05.440> have<00:06:05.680> to<00:06:05.800> work<00:06:06.010> it<00:06:06.190> in<00:06:06.340> as<00:06:06.520> well

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
um you really have to work it in as well

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.960 
um you really have to work it in as well
and<00:06:07.350> for<00:06:08.350> example<00:06:08.860> you<00:06:09.310> really<00:06:09.610> can't<00:06:09.790> get

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970 
and for example you really can't get

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.820 
and for example you really can't get
these<00:06:10.090> two<00:06:10.300> to<00:06:10.419> blend<00:06:10.630> even<00:06:11.500> though<00:06:11.620> they're

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
these two to blend even though they're

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.600 
these two to blend even though they're
the<00:06:11.919> same<00:06:12.250> exact<00:06:13.110> neutral<00:06:14.110> I<00:06:14.370> had<00:06:15.370> to<00:06:15.490> keep

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
the same exact neutral I had to keep

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.760 
the same exact neutral I had to keep
going<00:06:15.820> over<00:06:16.090> and<00:06:16.300> over<00:06:16.510> it<00:06:16.750> to<00:06:16.870> get<00:06:17.050> the<00:06:17.500> hard

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
going over and over it to get the hard

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.250 
going over and over it to get the hard
lines<00:06:17.979> to<00:06:18.390> disappear<00:06:19.390> and<00:06:19.600> it's<00:06:19.900> actually

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.260 
lines to disappear and it's actually

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.900 
lines to disappear and it's actually
peeled<00:06:20.620> and<00:06:20.890> pulled<00:06:21.190> some<00:06:21.280> of<00:06:21.550> this<00:06:21.640> paper

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
peeled and pulled some of this paper

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.320 
peeled and pulled some of this paper
I'll<00:06:22.210> show<00:06:22.360> you<00:06:22.450> that<00:06:22.570> closely<00:06:23.580> then<00:06:24.580> if<00:06:25.090> you

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
I'll show you that closely then if you

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.790 
I'll show you that closely then if you
want<00:06:25.690> to<00:06:25.780> use<00:06:25.900> these<00:06:26.080> I<00:06:26.110> think<00:06:26.349> you<00:06:26.620> should

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
want to use these I think you should

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.190 
want to use these I think you should
really<00:06:27.070> get<00:06:27.430> some<00:06:27.729> really<00:06:28.419> thick<00:06:28.750> paper<00:06:28.990> as

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:29.200 
really get some really thick paper as

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.119 
really get some really thick paper as
well<00:06:29.349> that<00:06:29.560> can<00:06:29.680> really<00:06:29.890> absorb<00:06:30.280> so<00:06:30.910> you

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:31.129 
well that can really absorb so you

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:33.100 
well that can really absorb so you
learned<00:06:31.339> a<00:06:31.489> lot<00:06:31.610> easier<00:06:31.969> the<00:06:32.719> paper<00:06:32.929> I'm<00:06:33.080> using

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
learned a lot easier the paper I'm using

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.290 
learned a lot easier the paper I'm using
right<00:06:33.499> now<00:06:33.529> is<00:06:33.709> not<00:06:34.129> artist<00:06:34.489> grade<00:06:34.699> it's<00:06:34.969> just

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
right now is not artist grade it's just

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.929 
right now is not artist grade it's just
standard<00:06:36.199> card<00:06:36.529> stocks<00:06:36.919> it's<00:06:37.159> quite<00:06:37.669> thick

00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:37.939 
standard card stocks it's quite thick

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:40.389 
standard card stocks it's quite thick
but<00:06:37.969> not<00:06:38.360> as<00:06:38.989> thick<00:06:39.229> as<00:06:39.409> I<00:06:39.469> would<00:06:39.800> use<00:06:40.009> for<00:06:40.039> real

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:40.399 
but not as thick as I would use for real

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:41.709 
but not as thick as I would use for real
watercolors<00:06:40.909> as<00:06:41.089> you<00:06:41.269> can<00:06:41.389> see<00:06:41.509> there's

00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:41.719 
watercolors as you can see there's

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:43.779 
watercolors as you can see there's
bleeding<00:06:41.989> I<00:06:42.319> would<00:06:43.309> actually<00:06:43.519> recommend

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:43.789 
bleeding I would actually recommend

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:45.609 
bleeding I would actually recommend
these<00:06:44.209> just<00:06:44.659> try<00:06:44.929> them<00:06:45.080> out<00:06:45.199> I<00:06:45.229> mean<00:06:45.439> they're

00:06:45.609 --> 00:06:45.619 
these just try them out I mean they're

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:47.859 
these just try them out I mean they're
not<00:06:45.800> that<00:06:46.219> expensive<00:06:46.399> so<00:06:46.879> they're<00:06:47.689> really

00:06:47.859 --> 00:06:47.869 
not that expensive so they're really

00:06:47.869 --> 00:06:50.499 
not that expensive so they're really
good<00:06:48.110> if<00:06:48.199> you're<00:06:48.319> starting<00:06:48.559> out<00:06:48.769> but<00:06:49.580> I'm

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:50.509 
good if you're starting out but I'm

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:52.269 
good if you're starting out but I'm
definitely<00:06:50.899> going<00:06:51.319> to<00:06:51.409> be<00:06:51.469> investing<00:06:51.979> in<00:06:52.039> some

00:06:52.269 --> 00:06:52.279 
definitely going to be investing in some

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:54.549 
definitely going to be investing in some
Copic<00:06:52.550> markers<00:06:52.849> in<00:06:52.969> the<00:06:53.059> future<00:06:53.419> but<00:06:54.259> I<00:06:54.289> want
