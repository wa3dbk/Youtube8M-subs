00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.060
 hello people the hint right now 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.790
 tax refers to itcd tax 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.920
 on transmission causes mortis and donation 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.349
 which had a recent trial of the 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.830
 supreme federal court on the matter 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.449
 itcd was considered as real tax 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.180
 always historically considered 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:37.989
 as real tax therefore a tax 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.239
 real it could only be progressive if 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.000
 expressly defined and 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.800
 authorized the federal commission which 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.970
 taxes we have to 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.390
 authorization in the federal constitution to 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.360
 progressivity 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.670
 we have iptu is a tax example 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.519
 typically real that focuses on the 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.850
 immovable property is urban property and 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:03.250
 therefore it may be progressive since 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.290
 the federal constitution allows us 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.720
 We have the property tax itr 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.030
 rural areas which can also be 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.490
 progressive because the constitution 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.299
 allows the big problem that 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.240
 existed is itcd itcd to real tax 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.579
 and a great southern state for example 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.649
 before it had progressive rates for 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:25.359
 o itcd 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.759
 initially the courts of justice in 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:29.380
 special court of the river 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.679
 great southern thought 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.960
 itcd unconditionality why why 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:37.810
 he had progressive rates were 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.090
 tax and this real tax with 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.340
 progressive rates was not 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.630
 expressly authorized in the constitution 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.899
 federal 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.840
 recently in February 2013 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:52.899
 the stf when judging the extraordinary appeal 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.479
 56 20 45 and understood by 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.569
 constitutionality of rates 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.670
 progressive itcd this issue in 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:03.240
 tender north now to 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.810
 begin to be asked 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.740
 conditionality of the 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.970
 progress of itcd etcd does not stop 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.530
 be a real tax 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.770
 however the federal supreme court 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.050
 understood in specific judgment of the law 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.850
 Gaucho who had previously been 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.209
 declared unconditional 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.489
 now itcd conditionality and 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.799
 progressivity was recognized by the 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.190
 supreme federal court then opening the 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.140
 yum 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.480
 is that of other matters that also 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.990
 could be judged by the supreme 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.240
 in federal court is declining and that 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.970
 old extinguishing tax 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.920
 real personal tax here attention
