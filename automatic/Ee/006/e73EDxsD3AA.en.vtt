00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
normally would leave it in for several

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.510

wash<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.700> out<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.090> honestly<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.979> solves

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
wash it out and honestly this solves

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.460 
wash it out and honestly this solves
like<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.880> flaky<00:01:54.600> scalp<00:01:54.840> like<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.110> wouldn't

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
like a flaky scalp like you wouldn't

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.260 
like a flaky scalp like you wouldn't
even<00:01:55.590> believe<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.369> obviously<00:01:57.000> there<00:01:57.180> are<00:01:57.240> a

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
even believe and obviously there are a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.580 
even believe and obviously there are a
lot<00:01:57.390> things<00:01:57.630> like<00:01:57.780> head<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.110> shoulders<00:01:58.469> where

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
lot things like head and shoulders where

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.830 
lot things like head and shoulders where
you<00:01:58.649> can<00:01:58.770> use<00:01:58.860> all<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.159> time<00:01:59.369> but<00:01:59.430> I<00:02:00.090> think<00:02:00.630> if

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
you can use all the time but I think if

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.749 
you can use all the time but I think if
you<00:02:00.960> want<00:02:01.170> like<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.530> one-off<00:02:01.860> treatment<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.700> I

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
you want like a one-off treatment and I

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.310 
you want like a one-off treatment and I
think<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.060> says<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.360> can<00:02:03.509> use<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.810> like<00:02:03.990> two

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
think it says you can use this like two

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.859 
think it says you can use this like two
or<00:02:04.439> three<00:02:04.500> times<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:05.100> week<00:02:05.250> if<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:06.360> have<00:02:06.540> really

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
or three times a week if you have really

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.650 
or three times a week if you have really
bad<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.469> kind<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.819> like<00:02:08.819> place<00:02:09.030> out<00:02:09.239> but<00:02:09.390> if<00:02:09.509> you

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
bad to kind of like place out but if you

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.999 
bad to kind of like place out but if you
tend<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.020> get<00:02:10.140> like<00:02:10.349> now<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.560> again<00:02:10.739> if<00:02:10.890> your

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
tend to get like now and again if your

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.110 
tend to get like now and again if your
skin<00:02:11.039> gets<00:02:11.310> dry

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
skin gets dry

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.460 
skin gets dry
this<00:02:12.239> is<00:02:12.360> like<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.629> best<00:02:12.840> thing<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.200> have

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
this is like the best thing to have

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.500 
this is like the best thing to have
because<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:14.069> can<00:02:14.370> just<00:02:14.580> buy<00:02:14.730> in<00:02:14.970> boots<00:02:15.209> or

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
solves it I use this for like once maybe

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.839 
solves it I use this for like once maybe
every<00:02:24.560> three<00:02:25.560> or<00:02:25.590> four<00:02:25.739> months<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.519> takes

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
every three or four months and it takes

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.119 
every three or four months and it takes
away<00:02:27.150> just<00:02:27.390> after<00:02:27.480> using<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:27.900> at<00:02:28.019> one<00:02:28.260> time<00:02:28.620> and

away just after using it at one time and

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.710 
away just after using it at one time and
it's<00:02:29.280> kind<00:02:29.430> of<00:02:29.459> like<00:02:29.579> an<00:02:29.700> underrated<00:02:30.120> product

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
it's kind of like an underrated product

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.020 
it's kind of like an underrated product
and<00:02:30.989> people<00:02:31.799> are<00:02:31.920> going<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.099> order<00:02:32.220> kind<00:02:32.879> of<00:02:32.940> a

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
and people are going to order kind of a

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.360 
and people are going to order kind of a
mitt<00:02:33.360> that<00:02:33.599> they've<00:02:33.780> they're<00:02:34.739> using<00:02:35.099> it<00:02:35.220> but<00:02:35.340> I

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
mitt that they've they're using it but I

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.069 
mitt that they've they're using it but I
thought<00:02:35.549> why<00:02:35.730> not<00:02:35.760> because<00:02:36.390> it's<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.870> product

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
thought why not because it's a product

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.350 
thought why not because it's a product
that<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.409> kind<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.739> can<00:02:37.920> rely<00:02:38.220> on<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.760> rather

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
that I kind of can rely on and rather

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.059 
that I kind of can rely on and rather

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
think we're all right and kind of make

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.729 
think we're all right and kind of make
my<00:02:42.450> hair<00:02:42.629> smell<00:02:42.780> nice<00:02:43.079> or<00:02:43.319> whatever<00:02:43.440> this
