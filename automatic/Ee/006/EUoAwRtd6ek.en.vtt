00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
you make it left home so that if you

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.580 
you make it left home so that if you
have<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.180> staging<00:02:30.570> that<00:02:31.050> would<00:02:31.230> be<00:02:31.350> lower

have a staging that would be lower

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.130 
have a staging that would be lower
because<00:02:32.190> it<00:02:32.460> has<00:02:32.610> legs<00:02:32.880> in<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.210> front<00:02:33.270> that<00:02:33.990> go

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
because it has legs in the front that go

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.550
