00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.410 
this one more time this game kinda
reminds<00:02:37.590> me<00:02:37.709> of<00:02:37.800> Frogger<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.880> game<00:02:39.150> plays

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
reminds me of Frogger the game plays

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.479 
reminds me of Frogger the game plays
nothing<00:02:39.780> like<00:02:39.989> Frogger<00:02:40.590> but<00:02:40.950> just<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.340> way

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
nothing like Frogger but just the way

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.670 
nothing like Frogger but just the way
that<00:02:41.670> it's<00:02:41.850> formatted<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.930> really<00:02:43.230> reminds<00:02:43.530> me

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680

of<00:02:43.770> Frogger<00:02:44.780> just<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.870> way<00:02:45.989> that's<00:02:46.140> one

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
of Frogger just the way that's one

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.460
