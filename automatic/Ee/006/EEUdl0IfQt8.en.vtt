00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.220
 Madara for the chains a wreath will be killed well and don't care 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.340
 she is now just a minus attack yet 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.689
 weighed spartan feed got no dose 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:37.800
 just over the rock 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:39.930
 horror movie oh my god that everyone sailed 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.390

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.090

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.100
 bite all nipped whether the turtles 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.530
 passed and begin to stomp on her back 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.690
 on back do not care then there is no violet 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.859
 not back 110 seconds respectively 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.559
 these two minutes can be completely calm 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.990
 by miduam now go straight to the base 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.960
 the line is very well released by the brude already 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.049
 flies here from teleport trunks if you 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.939
 accurate and now starts to fall 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.979
 probably all the same upper side 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.259
 that the bearing shooting gallery-2 is either immediately 4 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.640
 either the throne can be broken at once 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.280
 because one and a half more minutes won't be 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.920
 bristle bike a minute no wiper so 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.070
 that the broken throne can in principle 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.920
 the norm 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.409
 work in this match will reach 5 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.540
 sentries 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.750
 an hour with peaks and pauses for an hour me too 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.409
 say on went could fortifications 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.720
 the troll piles on lina 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:51.200
 welding you magnus ulta on magnus 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.200
 alive is it possible to forget how 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.490
 look what happens just gnaw 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.520
 rondo would go to pyshechki three bye bye 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:05.020
 you did not click it hide deezer discuss a 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:08.709
 but then just developing gvp writes n sedan 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:12.880
 It was worth an hour to endure themselves to blame here 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:16.120
 what's the matter here they are just completely and 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.890
 entirely to blame for the loss here in 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.420
 what's up 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.220
 because it seemed to them there 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.459
 that war is now there somewhere 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.930
 well, so take up and what are we then 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.600
 generally for yourself to see and play and 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.170
 then suck just one troll but 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.870
 This, too, does not matter sadly all 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.690
 Dansy turned out to hope that it 2 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.700
 Cards Routine But we surely 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.220
 stitches if we watch my 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.780
 much truth to him for 80 minutes to 80 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.320
 minutes prior to the course if not now second 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.860
 quick comeback for 15 3 decisive 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.640
 then everything is fine and if the swing is at 5 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.400
 on frequent 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.980
 Well, I think there should still somehow get 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.739
 and q guys figure it out anyway 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.079
 we even have friends 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.260
 statistics for this match elsi 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:07.019
 now appears defeat on the picture 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.760
 so far only on the map 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.489
 the moment they have 50 percent when it becomes 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.769
 maybe they bo3 there dragged 20 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.980
 then one match do they have one game so 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:21.400
 here are the games they are matches the shorter the essence is not in 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:24.010
 the bottom line is that we will now 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.150
 quietly join the game under 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.739
 number 2 so you are far from 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.540
 scatter us a five minute break 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.540
 see you very soon
