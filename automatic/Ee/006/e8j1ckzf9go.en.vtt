00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
it's weakened to that washer and and

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.090 
it's weakened to that washer and and
cause<00:01:26.909> part<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.570> rip<00:01:27.720> off<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.829> we'll<00:01:28.950> put

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
cause part of it to rip off so we'll put

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.490 
cause part of it to rip off so we'll put
a<00:01:29.130> new<00:01:29.280> one<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.600> old<00:01:30.990> stem<00:01:31.320> and

a new one in in the the old stem and
that<00:01:32.340> should<00:01:32.579> stop<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.030> drip<00:01:34.340> there's<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.400> cup

that should stop the drip there's a cup

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.630 
that should stop the drip there's a cup
on<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> stem<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> washer<00:01:38.070> just<00:01:38.220> fits<00:01:38.490> in

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
on the stem that the washer just fits in

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.280 
on the stem that the washer just fits in
these<00:01:38.880> come<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.210> different<00:01:39.299> sizes<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:40.259> you

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
these come in different sizes so you

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.719 
these come in different sizes so you
need<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.650> make<00:01:40.799> sure<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.040> get<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.310> right<00:01:41.340> one
