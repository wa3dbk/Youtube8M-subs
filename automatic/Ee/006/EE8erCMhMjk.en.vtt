00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.390
 ok staff show you today as 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:10.469
 people can do to render our 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:13.860
 our images without that gray coming 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:18.090
 coming from our horizon color in this 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.480
 people exchange than any other color 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.550
 and pf 12 also appears horizon agreement 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.510
 wants to appear completely 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.510
 transparent 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.090
 Okay, that 's why there are two commands that 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.329
 are extremely important and one 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.430
 will work without the other until the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.670
 first of them we find here in the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.989
 icon render agent deactivates sky 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.050
 doing this 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.530
 This color here will not work in 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.430
 new address appears a black tatá 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:55.190
 But if we save this, save it. 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:01:08.760
 'but I'll put it here in temp folder 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:18.020
 document with black background and if the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:20.159
 People open here in photoshop.com 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.250
 image with black background 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.320
 there it is completely black tatá 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.479
 how I said what we want it to 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.630
 this background does not exist then we 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.820
 returns here in the render icon and 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.180
 having disabled or before deactivating 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:40.740
 It also works, we come down here. 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.880
 and active rgb and if there is alpha né and for 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.310
 that we have to work too 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.570
 with files in the case here our png 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.479
 which support transparency and 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.680
 press f2 again here visually 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.439
 he is black 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.899
 Only when I just go here our 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:07.039
 image I'll put here background 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:11.580
 transparent and now open again 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:13.920
