00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.859 
dishonest and he sat out of this game it
looks<00:02:04.110> like<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.439> analyze<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:05.310> opponents<00:02:05.939> to

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
looks like to analyze the opponents to

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.650 
looks like to analyze the opponents to
ensure<00:02:07.500> their<00:02:08.069> victory<00:02:08.640> for<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.300> next<00:02:09.509> two

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
ensure their victory for the next two

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.480 
ensure their victory for the next two
games<00:02:09.840> pretty<00:02:10.200> much<00:02:10.440> so

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
games pretty much so

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.090 
games pretty much so
huh<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.660> his<00:02:12.990> dishonesty<00:02:13.380> probably<00:02:13.950> goes

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
huh and his dishonesty probably goes

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.560 
huh and his dishonesty probably goes
beyond<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.640> maybe<00:02:15.000> we'll<00:02:15.120> see<00:02:15.330> them

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
beyond that maybe we'll see them

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.040 
beyond that maybe we'll see them
cheating<00:02:16.050> in<00:02:16.460> a<00:02:17.460> game<00:02:18.270> when<00:02:18.510> we<00:02:18.600> actually<00:02:18.870> see

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
cheating in a game when we actually see

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.040 
cheating in a game when we actually see
them<00:02:19.170> in<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.350> game<00:02:19.530> because<00:02:20.540> so<00:02:21.540> far<00:02:21.720> we<00:02:21.870> haven't

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
them in a game because so far we haven't

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.990 
them in a game because so far we haven't
really<00:02:22.260> encountered<00:02:23.160> that<00:02:23.310> usually<00:02:23.880> in

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
really encountered that usually in

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.240 
really encountered that usually in
series<00:02:24.360> like<00:02:24.540> this<00:02:24.750> there<00:02:25.680> seems<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.040> be<00:02:26.220> a

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
series like this there seems to be a

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.970 
series like this there seems to be a
character<00:02:26.550> that<00:02:26.700> does<00:02:27.150> something<00:02:27.590> pretty<00:02:28.590> I

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
character that does something pretty I

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.740 
character that does something pretty I
mean<00:02:29.430> we've<00:02:29.550> seen<00:02:29.730> some<00:02:29.880> crazy<00:02:30.000> powers<00:02:30.570> but

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
mean we've seen some crazy powers but

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.060 
mean we've seen some crazy powers but
none<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:30.960> them<00:02:31.080> have<00:02:31.260> been<00:02:31.410> like<00:02:31.680> completely

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
none of them have been like completely

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.040 
none of them have been like completely
breaking<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.760> rules<00:02:33.030> unless<00:02:33.480> I'm<00:02:33.690> forgetting

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
breaking the rules unless I'm forgetting

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.780 
breaking the rules unless I'm forgetting
something<00:02:34.080> but<00:02:34.380> I<00:02:34.410> don't<00:02:34.740> think<00:02:34.860> so<00:02:34.950> but<00:02:35.670> we

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
something but I don't think so but we

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.270 
something but I don't think so but we
haven't<00:02:36.000> seen<00:02:36.300> anyone<00:02:36.540> really<00:02:37.080> just<00:02:37.350> cheat<00:02:37.800> to

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
haven't seen anyone really just cheat to

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.860 
haven't seen anyone really just cheat to
win<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.730> like<00:02:38.820> get<00:02:39.030> away<00:02:39.120> with<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:39.690> stuff

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
win and like get away with it and stuff

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.470 
win and like get away with it and stuff
like<00:02:39.990> that<00:02:40.050> sounds<00:02:40.800> pretty<00:02:40.920> interesting<00:02:41.480> kind

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
like that sounds pretty interesting kind

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.320 
like that sounds pretty interesting kind
of<00:02:42.630> like<00:02:42.890> moshav<00:02:43.890> on<00:02:44.010> hajime<00:02:44.310> no<00:02:44.340> ippo<00:02:44.460> how<00:02:44.940> the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
of like moshav on hajime no ippo how the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.480 
of like moshav on hajime no ippo how the
elbow<00:02:45.600> block<00:02:45.900> isn't<00:02:46.410> really<00:02:46.650> cheating<00:02:47.070> but

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
elbow block isn't really cheating but

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.160 
elbow block isn't really cheating but
it's<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:48.000> most<00:02:48.180> it's<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.690> dirtiest

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
it's the most it's the dirtiest

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.540 
it's the most it's the dirtiest
technique<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.710> could<00:02:49.830> do<00:02:49.920> in<00:02:50.010> boxing<00:02:50.220> because

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
technique you could do in boxing because

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.130 
technique you could do in boxing because
you<00:02:50.700> can<00:02:50.820> crush<00:02:51.150> your<00:02:51.390> opponents<00:02:51.420> knuckles

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
you can crush your opponents knuckles

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.560 
you can crush your opponents knuckles
when<00:02:52.290> we<00:02:52.350> punch<00:02:52.590> your<00:02:52.800> elbow<00:02:53.100> but<00:02:53.760> also<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.390> is

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
when we punch your elbow but also it is

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.150 
when we punch your elbow but also it is
a<00:02:54.600> fair<00:02:54.870> technique<00:02:55.230> it's<00:02:55.410> legitimate<00:02:55.920> and

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
a fair technique it's legitimate and

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.620 
a fair technique it's legitimate and
actually<00:02:56.520> is<00:02:56.610> pretty<00:02:56.640> hard<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.210> pull<00:02:57.450> off

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
actually is pretty hard to pull off

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.780 
actually is pretty hard to pull off
because<00:02:57.960> you<00:02:58.080> need<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.410> nail<00:02:59.070> your<00:02:59.310> opponent's

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
because you need to nail your opponent's

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.870 
because you need to nail your opponent's
glove<00:03:00.120> right<00:03:01.080> on<00:03:01.260> your<00:03:01.380> elbow<00:03:01.740> so<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.280> is<00:03:02.640> kind

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
glove right on your elbow so it is kind

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.250 
glove right on your elbow so it is kind
of<00:03:02.910> hard<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.150> do<00:03:03.300> by<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.570> same<00:03:03.780> time<00:03:03.990> it<00:03:04.140> is

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
of hard to do by the same time it is

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.610 
of hard to do by the same time it is
fucking<00:03:05.070> dirty<00:03:05.990> so<00:03:06.990> that's<00:03:07.320> not<00:03:07.470> really

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
fucking dirty so that's not really

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.070 
fucking dirty so that's not really
illegal<00:03:08.040> but<00:03:08.820> that<00:03:09.810> is<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.230> very<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:11.670> know

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
illegal but that is a very you know

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.060 
illegal but that is a very you know
cheap<00:03:13.080> technique<00:03:13.500> well<00:03:13.650> we<00:03:13.740> see<00:03:13.890> something

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
cheap technique well we see something

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.620 
cheap technique well we see something
like<00:03:14.190> that<00:03:14.310> from<00:03:14.640> this<00:03:14.730> guy<00:03:14.940> will<00:03:15.240> it<00:03:15.330> still<00:03:15.600> be

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
like that from this guy will it still be

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.810 
like that from this guy will it still be
