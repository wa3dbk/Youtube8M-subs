which<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.369> what's<00:01:05.580> unique<00:01:05.790> about<00:01:06.000> manual

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
which is what's unique about manual

which is what's unique about manual
transmission<00:01:06.960> cars<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.409> what<00:01:07.500> makes<00:01:07.710> them

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
transmission cars and what makes them

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
what they are now the gas in the brake

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.320 
what they are now the gas in the brake
are<00:01:10.310> exactly<00:01:11.310> where<00:01:11.460> they<00:01:11.580> would<00:01:11.790> be<00:01:11.939> on<00:01:12.180> an

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
are exactly where they would be on an

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.050 
are exactly where they would be on an
automatic<00:01:12.780> car<00:01:12.990> or<00:01:13.110> any<00:01:13.229> other<00:01:13.350> vehicle<00:01:14.060> and

automatic car or any other vehicle and
the<00:01:15.270> closer<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.630> what<00:01:15.720> we're<00:01:15.840> gonna<00:01:15.930> use<00:01:16.049> to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
the closer is what we're gonna use to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.929 
the closer is what we're gonna use to
turn<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.530> car<00:01:16.710> on<00:01:16.740> most<00:01:17.159> cars<00:01:17.400> have<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> safety

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
turn the car on most cars have a safety

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.020 
turn the car on most cars have a safety
mechanism<00:01:18.540> where<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.950> car<00:01:20.189> will<00:01:20.369> not<00:01:20.400> turn<00:01:20.700> on

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
mechanism where the car will not turn on

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.249 
mechanism where the car will not turn on
unless<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.270> have<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.600> clutch<00:01:21.810> depressed

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
unless you have the clutch depressed

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.950 
unless you have the clutch depressed
kind<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.070> like<00:01:23.570> automatic<00:01:24.570> cars<00:01:24.780> where<00:01:24.930> you

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
kind of like automatic cars where you

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.780 
kind of like automatic cars where you
have<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.200> have<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.439> brake<00:01:25.619> depressed<00:01:25.979> now

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
have to have the brake depressed now

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.740 
have to have the brake depressed now
when<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.000> turn<00:01:27.150> on<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.360> car<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.659> don't

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
when you turn on the car you don't

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.789 
when you turn on the car you don't
necessarily<00:01:27.930> have<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.439> have<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.650> brake

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
necessarily have to have the brake

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.100 
necessarily have to have the brake
depressed<00:01:29.159> but<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.520> good<00:01:29.670> idea<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:30.110> okay

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
depressed but it's a good idea to okay

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.870 
depressed but it's a good idea to okay
so<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.350> first<00:01:31.560> thing<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.770> do<00:01:31.950> before<00:01:32.310> we<00:01:32.729> turn

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
so the first thing I do before we turn

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.840 
so the first thing I do before we turn
the<00:01:32.970> car<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.420> make<00:01:33.600> sure<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.020> car<00:01:34.259> is

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
the car on is make sure that the car is

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.190 
the car on is make sure that the car is
properly<00:01:35.850> set<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.150> be<00:01:36.240> turned<00:01:36.420> on<00:01:36.630> no<00:01:37.049> would

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
properly set to be turned on no would

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.980 
properly set to be turned on no would
you<00:01:37.320> look<00:01:37.530> for<00:01:37.770> first<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.689> you<00:01:39.689> want<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.900> make

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
you look for first is you want to make

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.450 
you look for first is you want to make
sure<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.200> emergency<00:01:40.590> brakes<00:01:40.860> are<00:01:41.009> down<00:01:41.189> and

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
sure the emergency brakes are down and

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
let's get so hard is part about manual

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.520 
let's get so hard is part about manual
transmission<00:02:41.640> driving<00:02:41.850> period<00:02:42.300> is<00:02:42.530> pulling

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
transmission driving period is pulling

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.320 
transmission driving period is pulling
off<00:02:43.650> from<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:43.890> dead<00:02:44.040> stop<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.000> reason<00:02:45.239> this

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
off from a dead stop and the reason this

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.170 
off from a dead stop and the reason this
part<00:02:45.690> is<00:02:45.780> hard<00:02:46.019> is<00:02:46.140> because<00:02:46.730> you<00:02:47.730> have<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:48.060> have

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
part is hard is because you have to have

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.670 
part is hard is because you have to have
the<00:02:48.300> right<00:02:48.450> balance<00:02:48.480> between<00:02:48.840> gas<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.319> clutch

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
the right balance between gas and clutch

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.009 
the right balance between gas and clutch
as<00:02:49.920> you're<00:02:50.130> pulling<00:02:50.280> off<00:02:50.519> in<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.660> beginning

as you're pulling off in the beginning

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.240 
as you're pulling off in the beginning
we<00:02:52.200> have<00:02:52.319> to<00:02:52.410> learn<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.650> crawl<00:02:52.830> before<00:02:52.980> we<00:02:53.160> walk

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250

getting out of first gear is the hardest

get<00:03:48.840> away<00:03:49.019> we<00:03:49.140> did<00:03:49.290> but<00:03:50.010> it's<00:03:50.310> not<00:03:50.579> going<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:50.790> be

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
time you start the car so now we're

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.090 
time you start the car so now we're
gonna<00:03:57.660> refine<00:03:58.019> that<00:03:58.200> skill<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:58.709> make<00:03:58.859> it<00:03:59.010> more

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
gonna refine that skill and make it more

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.199 
gonna refine that skill and make it more
practical<00:04:00.560> clutch<00:04:01.560> in<00:04:01.769> first<00:04:02.730> gear

practical clutch in first gear

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.479 
practical clutch in first gear
now<00:04:04.810> give<00:04:04.989> it<00:04:05.079> a<00:04:05.109> tiny<00:04:05.290> bit<00:04:05.379> of<00:04:05.560> gas<00:04:05.680> very

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
now give it a tiny bit of gas very

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:07.649 
now give it a tiny bit of gas very
little<00:04:06.670> the<00:04:06.760> less<00:04:06.939> gas<00:04:07.150> you<00:04:07.299> can<00:04:07.420> give<00:04:07.540> it<00:04:07.629> the

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:07.659 
little the less gas you can give it the

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.170 
little the less gas you can give it the
better<00:04:07.870> and<00:04:08.620> start<00:04:09.519> easing<00:04:09.730> off<00:04:09.849> the<00:04:09.939> clutch

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
better and start easing off the clutch

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.360 
better and start easing off the clutch
slowly<00:04:10.840> until<00:04:11.469> you<00:04:11.560> filled<00:04:11.769> the<00:04:11.859> correspond

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
slowly until you filled the correspond

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.679 
slowly until you filled the correspond
so<00:04:12.489> you<00:04:12.579> know<00:04:12.670> when<00:04:12.790> it<00:04:12.879> responds<00:04:13.269> to<00:04:13.299> you<00:04:13.480> is

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:13.689 
so you know when it responds to you is

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:15.479 
so you know when it responds to you is
gonna<00:04:14.230> move<00:04:14.349> a<00:04:14.469> lot<00:04:14.680> more<00:04:14.950> efficient<00:04:15.340> than<00:04:15.370> you

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
gonna move a lot more efficient than you

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:16.710 
gonna move a lot more efficient than you
did<00:04:15.609> last<00:04:15.760> time<00:04:15.939> so<00:04:16.000> don't<00:04:16.209> move<00:04:16.269> quicker<00:04:16.539> and

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
did last time so don't move quicker and

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.560 
did last time so don't move quicker and
pick<00:04:16.840> up<00:04:16.959> fast<00:04:17.199> as<00:04:17.709> it<00:04:17.949> does<00:04:18.070> so<00:04:18.269> hold<00:04:19.269> off<00:04:19.449> for

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
pick up fast as it does so hold off for

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.900 
pick up fast as it does so hold off for
a<00:04:19.630> little<00:04:19.840> bit<00:04:19.930> increase<00:04:20.289> the<00:04:20.410> gas<00:04:20.820> but<00:04:21.820> the

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
a little bit increase the gas but the

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.100 
a little bit increase the gas but the
core<00:04:22.060> pick<00:04:22.210> up<00:04:22.300> a<00:04:22.330> little<00:04:22.479> more<00:04:22.660> speed<00:04:22.900> and

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
core pick up a little more speed and

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.580 
core pick up a little more speed and
start<00:04:23.380> eating<00:04:23.440> off<00:04:23.680> the<00:04:23.770> clutch<00:04:23.949> slowly<00:04:25.590> we're

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
start eating off the clutch slowly we're

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.379 
start eating off the clutch slowly we're
gonna<00:04:26.680> go<00:04:26.830> into<00:04:26.949> switching<00:04:27.190> gears<00:04:27.610> this<00:04:28.210> is<00:04:28.360> a

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
gonna go into switching gears this is a

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.659 
gonna go into switching gears this is a
really<00:04:28.780> easy<00:04:28.810> task<00:04:29.350> but<00:04:30.039> people<00:04:30.340> often<00:04:30.610> get

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
really easy task but people often get

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:31.950 
really easy task but people often get
confused<00:04:30.729> because<00:04:31.210> they<00:04:31.449> don't<00:04:31.600> know<00:04:31.690> what<00:04:31.840> to

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
confused because they don't know what to

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.320 
confused because they don't know what to
go<00:04:32.080> into<00:04:32.259> the<00:04:32.350> next<00:04:32.590> gear<00:04:32.800> many<00:04:33.729> times<00:04:34.060> they'll

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
go into the next gear many times they'll

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.379 
go into the next gear many times they'll
hear<00:04:34.720> from<00:04:35.320> experienced<00:04:35.800> people<00:04:35.949> to<00:04:36.370> hear<00:04:37.150> the

what you want to really do in the

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.140 
what you want to really do in the
beginning<00:04:46.860> use<00:04:47.860> the<00:04:48.039> RPM<00:04:48.430> meter<00:04:48.610> as<00:04:48.729> reference

beginning use the RPM meter as reference
you'll<00:04:49.389> see<00:04:49.599> it<00:04:49.690> over<00:04:49.870> here<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:52.240> RPM<00:04:52.690> meter<00:04:52.900> is

you'll see it over here the RPM meter is

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.499 
you'll see it over here the RPM meter is
right<00:04:53.889> here<00:04:54.190> it<00:04:54.550> should<00:04:54.759> be<00:04:54.820> the<00:04:55.000> one<00:04:55.180> that

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:55.509 
right here it should be the one that

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:57.990
