00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:49.149 
too overly full I think it has just a

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:51.749 
too overly full I think it has just a
nice<00:04:49.409> fullness<00:04:50.409> to<00:04:50.619> it<00:04:50.770> that<00:04:50.949> looks<00:04:51.279> very

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 
nice fullness to it that looks very

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.450 
nice fullness to it that looks very
realistic<00:04:52.710> like<00:04:53.710> I<00:04:53.800> said<00:04:54.009> it's<00:04:54.129> worth<00:04:54.279> the

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
realistic like I said it's worth the

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.010 
realistic like I said it's worth the
partying<00:04:54.849> you<00:04:54.939> got<00:04:55.089> to<00:04:55.210> work<00:04:55.360> with<00:04:55.539> the<00:04:55.659> party

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
partying you got to work with the party

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.920 
partying you got to work with the party
because<00:04:56.439> it's<00:04:56.680> a<00:04:56.770> little<00:04:56.949> on<00:04:57.159> the<00:04:57.189> slim<00:04:57.580> side

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
because it's a little on the slim side

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.389 
because it's a little on the slim side
so<00:04:58.930> you're<00:04:59.080> gonna<00:04:59.199> have<00:04:59.439> to<00:04:59.529> either<00:04:59.680> tweeze<00:05:00.369> it

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:02.790 
so you're gonna have to either tweeze it
or<00:05:00.819> just<00:05:01.149> pull<00:05:02.020> a<00:05:02.050> little<00:05:02.139> bit<00:05:02.379> of<00:05:02.559> the<00:05:02.619> hair

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
or just pull a little bit of the hair

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.679 
or just pull a little bit of the hair
out<00:05:02.979> of<00:05:03.009> the<00:05:03.129> parting<00:05:03.550> and<00:05:03.729> add<00:05:04.180> your<00:05:04.419> powder
