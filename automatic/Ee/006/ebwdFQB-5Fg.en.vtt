00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.070 

well<00:00:09.730> what<00:00:09.940> is<00:00:10.120> Bruce<00:00:10.389> Shane<00:00:10.570> today<00:00:10.840> I'd<00:00:10.960> like

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.080 
well what is Bruce Shane today I'd like

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.780 
well what is Bruce Shane today I'd like
to<00:00:11.170> take<00:00:11.320> a<00:00:11.379> look<00:00:11.590> at<00:00:11.680> points<00:00:12.190> how<00:00:12.490> they<00:00:12.639> make

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:12.790 
to take a look at points how they make

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.299 
to take a look at points how they make
work<00:00:12.969> easier<00:00:13.180> for<00:00:13.629> us<00:00:13.780> they<00:00:14.709> could<00:00:14.889> change<00:00:15.070> the

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
work easier for us they could change the

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.130 
work easier for us they could change the
direction<00:00:15.459> of<00:00:15.730> force<00:00:15.969> and<00:00:16.360> if<00:00:16.810> we<00:00:16.930> put<00:00:17.110> a

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
direction of force and if we put a

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.210 
direction of force and if we put a
couple<00:00:17.200> of<00:00:17.500> them<00:00:17.619> together<00:00:17.770> they<00:00:18.070> can

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
couple of them together they can

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.920 
couple of them together they can
actually<00:00:18.550> change<00:00:19.119> the<00:00:19.300> amount<00:00:19.540> of<00:00:19.630> force<00:00:19.840> that

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
actually change the amount of force that

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:27.960 
actually change the amount of force that
we<00:00:20.140> apply<00:00:20.169> so<00:00:21.160> let's<00:00:21.730> take<00:00:21.939> a<00:00:21.970> closer<00:00:22.300> look<00:00:26.970> my

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
we apply so let's take a closer look my

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.339 
we apply so let's take a closer look my
students<00:00:28.329> start<00:00:28.509> the<00:00:28.630> investigation<00:00:28.840> by

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
students start the investigation by

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.260 
students start the investigation by
looking<00:00:29.649> at<00:00:29.770> a<00:00:29.800> single<00:00:30.189> pulley<00:00:30.430> we<00:00:31.059> put<00:00:31.239> a

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
looking at a single pulley we put a

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.180 
looking at a single pulley we put a
weight<00:00:31.480> on<00:00:31.509> here<00:00:31.989> I<00:00:32.140> pull<00:00:32.619> it<00:00:32.739> down<00:00:32.920> and<00:00:33.130> the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
weight on here I pull it down and the

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.160 
weight on here I pull it down and the
weight<00:00:33.340> goes<00:00:33.550> up<00:00:33.760> if<00:00:34.239> I<00:00:34.390> put<00:00:34.600> the<00:00:34.719> same<00:00:34.930> size

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
weight goes up if I put the same size

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.560 
weight goes up if I put the same size
weight<00:00:35.469> on<00:00:35.620> the<00:00:35.710> opposite<00:00:36.070> side<00:00:36.370> they<00:00:37.030> balance

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
weight on the opposite side they balance

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.060 
weight on the opposite side they balance
there's<00:00:37.809> no<00:00:37.989> change<00:00:38.320> in<00:00:38.500> force

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
there's no change in force

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.190 
there's no change in force
it's<00:00:39.670> simply<00:00:39.969> changing<00:00:40.450> the<00:00:40.570> direction<00:00:40.750> that

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
it's simply changing the direction that

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.260 
it's simply changing the direction that
is<00:00:41.290> applied<00:00:41.650> now<00:00:42.460> let's<00:00:42.670> try<00:00:42.940> this<00:00:43.000> on<00:00:43.240> a

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
is applied now let's try this on a

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.650 
is applied now let's try this on a
larger<00:00:43.750> scale<00:00:44.080> to<00:00:45.150> give<00:00:46.150> my<00:00:46.270> students<00:00:46.600> a

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
larger scale to give my students a

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.940 
larger scale to give my students a
better<00:00:46.780> feel<00:00:47.050> for<00:00:47.079> how<00:00:47.290> pulleys<00:00:47.710> employee

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
better feel for how pulleys employee

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.800 
better feel for how pulleys employee
systems<00:00:48.340> work<00:00:48.550> and<00:00:49.060> I<00:00:49.180> would<00:00:49.300> live<00:00:49.480> something

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
systems work and I would live something

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.090 
systems work and I would live something
a<00:00:49.870> little<00:00:50.020> bit<00:00:50.110> heavier<00:00:50.230> we<00:00:50.829> have<00:00:50.980> this

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
a little bit heavier we have this

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.380 
a little bit heavier we have this
homemade<00:00:51.430> seat<00:00:51.760> that's<00:00:51.940> been<00:00:52.090> attached<00:00:52.360> to

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
homemade seat that's been attached to

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.180 
homemade seat that's been attached to
the<00:00:52.600> pulleys<00:00:53.020> and<00:00:53.140> the<00:00:53.230> pulley<00:00:53.440> systems<00:00:53.860> and

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
the pulleys and the pulley systems and

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.650 
the pulleys and the pulley systems and
that<00:00:54.460> students<00:00:54.850> can<00:00:54.970> lift<00:00:55.180> each<00:00:55.300> other<00:00:55.450> and

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
that students can lift each other and

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.360 
that students can lift each other and
actually<00:00:55.780> feel<00:00:56.230> the<00:00:56.380> difference<00:00:56.739> as<00:00:56.890> we

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
actually feel the difference as we

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.180 
actually feel the difference as we
change<00:00:57.579> its<00:00:57.760> mechanical<00:00:58.270> advantage<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:59.920> start

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
change its mechanical advantage we start

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.860 
change its mechanical advantage we start
this<00:01:00.280> demonstration<00:01:00.460> by<00:01:01.030> tying<00:01:01.360> a<00:01:01.480> rope<00:01:01.630> to

attaching the pulleys employee
combinations<00:01:05.799> to<00:01:06.070> that<00:01:06.250> rope<00:01:06.490> and<00:01:07.030> I<00:01:07.090> allow

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
combinations to that rope and I allow

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.639 
combinations to that rope and I allow
the<00:01:07.329> students<00:01:07.780> to<00:01:07.810> lift<00:01:08.110> each<00:01:08.200> other<00:01:08.380> for

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
the students to lift each other for

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:10.679 
the students to lift each other for
short<00:01:08.829> distances<00:01:09.399> so<00:01:09.909> they<00:01:10.000> can<00:01:10.180> feel<00:01:10.450> how

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 
short distances so they can feel how

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:13.379 
short distances so they can feel how
that<00:01:10.899> force<00:01:11.290> and<00:01:11.530> distance<00:01:11.950> change<00:01:12.549> from<00:01:13.210> one

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:13.389 
that force and distance change from one

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:15.779 
that force and distance change from one
system<00:01:13.659> to<00:01:13.840> another<00:01:14.159> now<00:01:15.159> as<00:01:15.280> our<00:01:15.399> final

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:15.789 
system to another now as our final

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:17.910 
system to another now as our final
investigation<00:01:16.509> we<00:01:16.929> decided<00:01:17.200> to<00:01:17.439> see<00:01:17.649> how<00:01:17.859> many

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
investigation we decided to see how many

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.440 
investigation we decided to see how many
students<00:01:18.429> would<00:01:18.579> be<00:01:18.670> needed<00:01:18.969> to<00:01:18.999> lift<00:01:19.270> our

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
students would be needed to lift our

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.870 
students would be needed to lift our
principal<00:01:19.929> mr.<00:01:19.960> right<00:01:20.409> using<00:01:21.310> a<00:01:21.369> pulley<00:01:21.639> and

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
principal mr. right using a pulley and

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.230 
principal mr. right using a pulley and
each<00:01:22.389> of<00:01:22.569> the<00:01:22.689> toy<00:01:22.899> combinations<00:01:23.999> will<00:01:24.999> start

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
each of the toy combinations will start

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:41.190 
each of the toy combinations will start
with<00:01:25.359> a<00:01:25.389> single<00:01:25.630> PO<00:01:25.899> and<00:01:26.109> see<00:01:26.319> what<00:01:26.499> happens

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.480 

okay<00:01:42.200> so<00:01:42.260> how<00:01:42.530> many<00:01:42.680> students<00:01:43.040> does<00:01:43.190> it<00:01:43.340> take

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
okay so how many students does it take

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.460 
okay so how many students does it take
to<00:01:43.610> lift<00:01:43.790> mr.<00:01:44.090> right<00:01:44.240> for<00:01:44.510> this<00:01:44.600> one<00:01:47.320> okay<00:01:48.320> we

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
to lift mr. right for this one okay we

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.060 
to lift mr. right for this one okay we
have<00:01:48.590> six<00:01:49.270> so<00:01:50.270> what<00:01:50.630> what's<00:01:51.380> our<00:01:51.560> mechanical

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
have six so what what's our mechanical

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.420 
have six so what what's our mechanical
advantage<00:01:52.430> here<00:01:52.870> one<00:01:53.870> okay<00:01:54.380> so<00:01:54.590> whatever<00:01:55.070> he

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
advantage here one okay so whatever he

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.430 
advantage here one okay so whatever he
weighs<00:01:55.670> that's<00:01:56.510> how<00:01:56.690> much<00:01:56.870> force<00:01:57.140> you<00:01:57.200> guys

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
weighs that's how much force you guys

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.940 
weighs that's how much force you guys
have<00:01:57.680> to<00:01:57.830> apply<00:01:59.230> now<00:02:00.230> let's<00:02:00.440> take<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.620> look<00:02:00.800> at<00:02:00.890> a

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
have to apply now let's take a look at a

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.070 
have to apply now let's take a look at a
pulley<00:02:01.220> system<00:02:01.430> I<00:02:01.850> have<00:02:01.970> a<00:02:02.000> fixed<00:02:02.390> boy<00:02:02.510> here<00:02:02.960> in

a movable pulley here once again when I
pull<00:02:05.420> down<00:02:05.660> on<00:02:05.840> this<00:02:05.990> rope<00:02:06.260> the<00:02:06.830> weight<00:02:07.010> goes

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
pull down on this rope the weight goes

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.639 
pull down on this rope the weight goes
up<00:02:07.250> but<00:02:07.940> I<00:02:08.000> have<00:02:08.210> to<00:02:08.330> pull<00:02:08.510> twice<00:02:08.840> as<00:02:09.050> far<00:02:09.350> to

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
up but I have to pull twice as far to

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.460 
up but I have to pull twice as far to
get<00:02:10.070> this<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.430> go<00:02:10.550> up<00:02:10.730> half<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.330> distance<00:02:11.720> but

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
get this to go up half the distance but

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.440 
get this to go up half the distance but
the<00:02:12.590> advantage<00:02:13.010> is<00:02:13.190> I<00:02:13.400> don't<00:02:13.760> have<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.150> pull<00:02:14.330> as

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
the advantage is I don't have to pull as

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.600 
the advantage is I don't have to pull as
hard<00:02:14.480> this<00:02:15.320> has<00:02:15.530> a<00:02:15.560> mechanical<00:02:16.160> advantage<00:02:16.220> of

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
hard this has a mechanical advantage of

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.940 
hard this has a mechanical advantage of
two<00:02:16.850> so<00:02:17.480> I<00:02:17.510> only<00:02:17.720> have<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:18.020> pull<00:02:18.230> half<00:02:18.590> as<00:02:18.770> much

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
two so I only have to pull half as much

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.160 
two so I only have to pull half as much
as<00:02:19.190> what<00:02:19.610> these<00:02:19.760> weigh<00:02:20.030> fact<00:02:20.900> I<00:02:21.020> can

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
as what these weigh fact I can

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.780 
as what these weigh fact I can
demonstrate<00:02:21.350> that<00:02:21.650> by<00:02:21.980> putting<00:02:22.340> one<00:02:22.550> weight

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
demonstrate that by putting one weight

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.180 
demonstrate that by putting one weight
on<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.600> rope<00:02:23.690> that<00:02:23.870> I<00:02:23.900> pull<00:02:24.140> down<00:02:24.170> and<00:02:24.650> it

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
on the rope that I pull down and it

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.550 
on the rope that I pull down and it
balances<00:02:25.670> now<00:02:25.910> let's<00:02:26.690> go<00:02:26.810> try<00:02:27.050> this<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.440> see

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
balances now let's go try this and see

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.860 
balances now let's go try this and see
if<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:27.830> makes<00:02:28.010> any<00:02:28.130> improvement<00:02:29.060> in<00:02:29.180> a

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
if that makes any improvement in a

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.670 
if that makes any improvement in a
larger<00:02:30.440> system<00:02:31.930> here's<00:02:32.930> our<00:02:33.110> set<00:02:33.350> up<00:02:33.440> for<00:02:33.620> the

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
larger system here's our set up for the

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.240 
larger system here's our set up for the
first<00:02:33.830> pulley<00:02:34.160> system<00:02:34.610> so<00:02:35.920> tape<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.010> can<00:02:37.100> lift

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
first pulley system so tape you can lift

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:45.699 
first pulley system so tape you can lift
them<00:02:42.700> okay<00:02:43.930> how<00:02:44.930> many<00:02:45.080> students<00:02:45.410> are<00:02:45.470> we<00:02:45.500> using

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
them okay how many students are we using

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:54.160 
them okay how many students are we using
this<00:02:45.920> time<00:02:46.989> we<00:02:47.989> have<00:02:48.110> four<00:02:51.730> okay<00:02:52.730> now<00:02:52.959> if<00:02:53.959> he

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
this time we have four okay now if he

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.100 
this time we have four okay now if he
goes<00:02:54.200> up<00:02:54.380> one<00:02:55.030> if<00:02:56.030> mr.<00:02:56.420> wrights<00:02:56.570> going<00:02:56.810> up<00:02:56.930> one

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
goes up one if mr. wrights going up one

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.360 
goes up one if mr. wrights going up one
meter<00:02:57.320> how<00:02:57.500> far<00:02:57.709> do<00:02:57.770> you<00:02:57.830> guys<00:02:58.070> have<00:02:58.280> to

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
meter how far do you guys have to

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.790 
meter how far do you guys have to
forward<00:03:00.580> two<00:03:01.580> times<00:03:01.850> as<00:03:02.000> far<00:03:02.209> okay<00:03:02.570> good<00:03:02.840> no<00:03:03.770> I

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
forward two times as far okay good no I

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.640 
forward two times as far okay good no I
jump<00:03:04.160> down<00:03:05.020> now<00:03:07.930> let's<00:03:08.930> see<00:03:09.230> if<00:03:09.290> we<00:03:09.380> can<00:03:09.530> make

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
jump down now let's see if we can make

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.229 
jump down now let's see if we can make
it<00:03:09.770> even<00:03:10.040> easier<00:03:10.160> in<00:03:10.580> this<00:03:10.730> case<00:03:10.970> I<00:03:11.000> have<00:03:11.209> a

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
it even easier in this case I have a

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.430 
it even easier in this case I have a
double<00:03:11.540> pulley<00:03:11.750> up<00:03:11.930> here<00:03:12.140> and<00:03:12.260> a<00:03:12.320> double

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
double pulley up here and a double

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.650 
double pulley up here and a double
pulley<00:03:12.770> down<00:03:12.950> here<00:03:13.280> this<00:03:13.850> is<00:03:14.030> a<00:03:14.060> string<00:03:14.360> I<00:03:14.420> pull

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
pulley down here this is a string I pull

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.870 
pulley down here this is a string I pull
down<00:03:14.870> on<00:03:15.110> it<00:03:15.590> goes<00:03:15.800> up<00:03:16.040> it<00:03:16.250> comes<00:03:16.340> down<00:03:16.610> it<00:03:16.760> goes

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
down on it goes up it comes down it goes

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.090 
down on it goes up it comes down it goes
up<00:03:16.910> it<00:03:17.270> comes<00:03:17.420> down<00:03:17.630> it<00:03:17.840> goes<00:03:17.959> up<00:03:17.989> attaches<00:03:18.980> to

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
up it comes down it goes up attaches to

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.130 
up it comes down it goes up attaches to
the<00:03:19.190> fixed<00:03:19.459> pulley<00:03:19.640> whatever<00:03:20.420> force<00:03:20.690> I<00:03:20.870> apply

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
the fixed pulley whatever force I apply

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.280 
the fixed pulley whatever force I apply
here<00:03:21.170> is<00:03:21.739> increased<00:03:22.430> four<00:03:22.760> times<00:03:23.120> here<00:03:23.510> but<00:03:23.750> I

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
here is increased four times here but I

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.620 
here is increased four times here but I
have<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.500> pull<00:03:24.770> this<00:03:24.890> out<00:03:25.070> four<00:03:25.459> times<00:03:25.760> further

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
have to pull this out four times further

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.990 
have to pull this out four times further
so<00:03:27.530> let's<00:03:27.709> see<00:03:27.920> how<00:03:28.070> much<00:03:28.190> easier<00:03:28.400> it<00:03:28.610> makes<00:03:28.640> it

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
so let's see how much easier it makes it

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.170 
so let's see how much easier it makes it
to<00:03:29.390> lift<00:03:29.540> the<00:03:29.660> principal<00:03:30.080> Mouse<00:03:30.910> so<00:03:31.910> here's<00:03:32.120> a

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
to lift the principal Mouse so here's a

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.220 
to lift the principal Mouse so here's a
set<00:03:32.420> up<00:03:32.510> for<00:03:32.540> this<00:03:32.780> next<00:03:33.170> system<00:03:34.959> out<00:03:35.959> of<00:03:35.989> all

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
set up for this next system out of all

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.739 
set up for this next system out of all
what<00:03:36.620> do<00:03:36.709> we<00:03:36.739> got<00:03:36.890> oh

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:39.749 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:43.739 

yeah<00:03:40.749> poor<00:03:41.709> okay<00:03:42.120> three<00:03:43.120> girls<00:03:43.420> let's<00:03:43.599> see<00:03:43.689> if

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:43.749 
yeah poor okay three girls let's see if

00:03:43.749 --> 00:04:04.170 
yeah poor okay three girls let's see if
we<00:03:43.810> can<00:03:43.930> do<00:03:44.019> it<00:03:59.250> let's<00:04:00.250> top<00:04:00.579> okay<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:03.400> don't<00:04:04.000> know

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
we can do it let's top okay I don't know

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.259 
we can do it let's top okay I don't know
what<00:04:04.359> I<00:04:04.420> thought<00:04:04.599> I<00:04:04.629> go<00:04:05.819> now<00:04:06.819> let's<00:04:07.030> try<00:04:07.209> this

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
what I thought I go now let's try this

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.119 
what I thought I go now let's try this
one<00:04:07.569> last<00:04:07.599> time<00:04:07.900> I<00:04:08.049> have<00:04:08.319> a<00:04:08.349> triple<00:04:08.620> pulley<00:04:08.950> in

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129 
one last time I have a triple pulley in

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:10.860 
one last time I have a triple pulley in
a<00:04:09.189> triple<00:04:09.430> pulley<00:04:09.760> for<00:04:10.030> mechanical<00:04:10.480> advantage

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
a triple pulley for mechanical advantage

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.959 
a triple pulley for mechanical advantage
of<00:04:10.959> six<00:04:11.260> it<00:04:11.859> means<00:04:12.040> whatever<00:04:12.250> force<00:04:12.579> I<00:04:12.730> apply

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:12.969 
of six it means whatever force I apply

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:15.990 
of six it means whatever force I apply
here<00:04:13.000> is<00:04:13.719> increased<00:04:14.200> six<00:04:14.469> times<00:04:14.769> here<00:04:15.099> it<00:04:15.849> also

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
here is increased six times here it also

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.490 
here is increased six times here it also
means<00:04:16.209> am<00:04:16.389> I<00:04:16.449> going<00:04:16.599> to<00:04:16.690> pull<00:04:16.840> this<00:04:16.930> out<00:04:17.109> six

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
means am I going to pull this out six

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.949 
means am I going to pull this out six
times<00:04:17.680> further<00:04:18.180> so<00:04:19.180> let's<00:04:19.359> see<00:04:19.479> if<00:04:19.570> we<00:04:19.660> can<00:04:19.810> use

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
times further so let's see if we can use

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.629 
times further so let's see if we can use
this<00:04:20.079> mechanical<00:04:20.620> advantage<00:04:21.009> and<00:04:21.220> get<00:04:21.609> a

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
this mechanical advantage and get a

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.900 
this mechanical advantage and get a
single<00:04:22.120> student<00:04:22.330> to<00:04:22.599> lift<00:04:22.780> our<00:04:22.930> principals

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
single student to lift our principals

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.159 
single student to lift our principals
okay<00:04:24.940> Cal<00:04:25.180> keeping<00:04:25.539> a<00:04:25.599> little<00:04:25.840> right<00:04:25.960> about

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
okay Cal keeping a little right about

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:51.469 
okay Cal keeping a little right about
there<00:04:26.349> yeah<00:04:27.009> now<00:04:27.880> we're<00:04:28.060> good

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:57.089 

oh<00:04:54.240> he's<00:04:55.240> put<00:04:55.990> off<00:04:56.139> the<00:04:56.320> ground

00:04:57.089 --> 00:04:57.099 
oh he's put off the ground

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:59.159 
oh he's put off the ground
all<00:04:57.970> right<00:04:58.120> let's<00:04:58.300> take<00:04:58.449> the<00:04:58.570> brake<00:04:58.750> works<00:04:58.960> let

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
all right let's take the brake works let

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:11.010 
all right let's take the brake works let
go<00:05:01.710> hey<00:05:08.849> now<00:05:09.849> the<00:05:09.909> reason<00:05:10.240> why<00:05:10.360> this<00:05:10.419> poisonous

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
go hey now the reason why this poisonous

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.870 
go hey now the reason why this poisonous
and<00:05:11.229> non-poisonous<00:05:11.310> makes<00:05:12.310> it<00:05:12.490> easier<00:05:12.759> to

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
and non-poisonous makes it easier to

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.120 
and non-poisonous makes it easier to
lift<00:05:13.060> is<00:05:13.300> that<00:05:13.870> you're<00:05:13.990> trading<00:05:14.289> fours<00:05:14.860> for

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
lift is that you're trading fours for

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.999 
lift is that you're trading fours for
distance<00:05:15.610> in<00:05:15.849> this<00:05:16.750> case<00:05:17.050> each<00:05:17.530> one<00:05:17.830> of<00:05:17.919> those

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:18.009 
distance in this case each one of those

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:20.249 
distance in this case each one of those
ropes<00:05:18.310> between<00:05:18.759> the<00:05:18.880> poise<00:05:19.090> is<00:05:19.449> lifting<00:05:20.169> up

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:20.259 
ropes between the poise is lifting up

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:21.990 
ropes between the poise is lifting up
with<00:05:20.320> the<00:05:20.650> same<00:05:20.919> amount<00:05:21.190> of<00:05:21.280> force<00:05:21.460> it's<00:05:21.759> being

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
with the same amount of force it's being

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.810 
with the same amount of force it's being
pulled<00:05:22.330> down<00:05:22.419> on<00:05:22.780> that<00:05:23.320> single<00:05:23.620> strand<00:05:23.919> so<00:05:24.669> the

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
pulled down on that single strand so the

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.589 
pulled down on that single strand so the
force<00:05:25.060> is<00:05:25.240> increased<00:05:25.440> six<00:05:26.440> times<00:05:27.419> now<00:05:28.419> this

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:28.599 
force is increased six times now this

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:30.270 
force is increased six times now this
also<00:05:28.780> means<00:05:29.110> however<00:05:29.259> many<00:05:29.680> strands<00:05:30.039> there

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
also means however many strands there

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.860 
also means however many strands there
are<00:05:30.400> that's<00:05:30.669> how<00:05:30.880> many<00:05:31.030> times<00:05:31.270> further<00:05:31.630> you

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
are that's how many times further you

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.209 
are that's how many times further you
must<00:05:31.990> pull<00:05:32.259> the<00:05:32.380> rope<00:05:32.560> that<00:05:32.889> you're<00:05:33.039> applying

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:33.219 
must pull the rope that you're applying

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:38.760 
must pull the rope that you're applying
the<00:05:33.370> force<00:05:33.639> to<00:05:36.930> this<00:05:37.930> ride<00:05:38.199> had<00:05:38.380> one<00:05:38.560> last

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
the force to this ride had one last

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.469 
the force to this ride had one last
question<00:05:39.039> would<00:05:39.759> he<00:05:39.880> be<00:05:40.000> able<00:05:40.090> to<00:05:40.330> lift

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
question would he be able to lift

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:49.739 
question would he be able to lift
himself

00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:49.749 

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:52.629 

this<00:05:50.749> method<00:05:51.110> even<00:05:51.229> makes<00:05:51.499> it<00:05:51.619> easier<00:05:51.979> since

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 
this method even makes it easier since

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:54.669 
this method even makes it easier since
he's<00:05:52.819> pulling<00:05:53.149> on<00:05:53.269> that<00:05:53.360> rope<00:05:53.419> himself<00:05:54.049> he<00:05:54.559> now

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:54.679 
he's pulling on that rope himself he now

00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:56.979 
he's pulling on that rope himself he now
has<00:05:54.919> seven<00:05:55.369> rope<00:05:55.519> setters<00:05:55.819> and<00:05:56.449> the<00:05:56.509> break<00:05:56.719> so

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:56.989 
has seven rope setters and the break so

00:05:56.989 --> 00:05:58.689 
has seven rope setters and the break so
he<00:05:57.019> only<00:05:57.289> has<00:05:57.379> to<00:05:57.589> apply<00:05:57.709> about<00:05:58.009> one-seventh

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699 
he only has to apply about one-seventh

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.329 
he only has to apply about one-seventh
of<00:05:58.789> his<00:05:58.909> body<00:05:59.119> weight
