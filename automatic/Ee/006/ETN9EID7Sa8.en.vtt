00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 fear is the oldest and strongest 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.420
 physical senses and the most ancient and 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.300
 the strongest fear is the fear of the unknown 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:15.330
 H. P. Lovecraft all hide 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.170
 yourself woody and welcome to 10 facts 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.500
 about the trailer square five nights at freddys 3 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.750
 drove the first fact for sure many 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.609
 tormented by the question inside the star animatronics 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.349
 scare us new parts of the game 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.900
 judging by the teaser on the official website 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.009
 scott shows toy masks 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.200
 versions of animatronics 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.059
 and also a foxy hook can be assumed 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.370
 that at least these animatronics will 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.500
 again with us besides the beginning of the trailer 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.840
 we see a lot of children's drawings and 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.140
 poster from old beckons animatronics 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.539
 including something like a puppet 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.980
 most likely this is a hint that they all also 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.360
 will be present in the next part 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.879
 Game 2 on during the scene from the hallway 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.820
 camera we can watch surround 3d 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.670
 premises that hints at use 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.660
 new 3d engine for the game it stirs 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.180
 not sold 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.970
 since previous games were performed 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.760
 on 2d engine with added effects from 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.820
 cameras it created the illusion of volume 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:19.439
 pictures 3 during scene with old 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.570
 animatronics can see that the eyes 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:27.210
 about him slowly turning to the player 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.909
 fourth fact well, all the jokes are over 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.979
 guys waiting for us a new animatronic with mind 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.900
 it resembles a green carnage and 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.880
 numerous bare wires and 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.220
 torn fabric is most likely his 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.409
 you get tired and costume at a show price 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.720
 where the green bonnie convulsively twitches with 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.030
 side to side maybe this 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.140
 animatronic someone mastered but who 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.119
 5 it looks like our office is strong 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.140
 changed from old things left 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.939
 Stuffed Toys 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.340
 table fan and glass of cola 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.590
 wide glass appeared in front of you 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.869
 you through which maybe we can 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.060
 observe how animatronics steals up to 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.820
 us also in the upper right corner 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.490
 you can see a lamp maybe we can 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.370
 drive and 6 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.260
 and when the green battle does not come to us in 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.110
 office to his right we can notice 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.230
 the same box with animatronic masks 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.790
 which is depicted in the scott teaser 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.130
 maybe we can even wear these 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.760
 masks who knows 7 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.820
 and in the same scene to the left of the green 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.790
 the bathhouse seems to be a Freddie costume only 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.250
 without ears and the endoskeleton itself is difficult 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.920
 say whether this suit will scare us 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.730
 or is it so posted simply as 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.540
 Scenery 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.150
 8 and judging by the screenshots on steam 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.280
 greenlight now foxy or rather head 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.830
 foxy will act as nickname 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.990
 the scenery hanging on the wall to the same 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.350
 to the right of the foxy we see the blue button 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:03:00.000
 which will probably switch the light 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:02.190
 Foxy head 9 one of the screenshots 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.950
 shows us a new control panel 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.230
 most likely now besides the camera we 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.110
 We can control the volume of some 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:15.030
 appliances and ventilation system 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:17.550
 why in this 10 during the trailer we 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.280
 see three phrases he will return he always 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.240
 comes back and they have a place for it 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.610
 who is this 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.010
 is he a phone guy player or 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.640
 maybe sophia then you guy seems to me 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.530
 that the answer lies in the color of the phrase at all 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.050
 recently if you went to the official 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.970
 Scott's site , and he would have seen the phrase there 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.050
 always returns done in 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.330
 purple color 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.520
 which is clearly hinting at the ferrite guy 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.220
 now of raise we have a place for 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.890
 he was probably told on behalf of 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.870
 animatronics that is in this guy 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.910
 needed a vessel for rebirth he 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.980
 mastered in the old bones in the bath and now 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.560
 the product is walked animatronic killer 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.170
