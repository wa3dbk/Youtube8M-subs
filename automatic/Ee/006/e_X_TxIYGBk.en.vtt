00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
pack now a natural texture pack is like

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.760 
pack now a natural texture pack is like
realistic<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:05.700> going<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.909> look<00:01:06.170> real<00:01:07.170> it's

like<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> realism<00:01:08.490> photo<00:01:09.119> realism<00:01:09.689> i<00:01:09.900> guess<00:01:10.110> and

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
like a realism photo realism i guess and

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.039 
like a realism photo realism i guess and
that's<00:01:10.979> what<00:01:11.280> it's<00:01:11.400> going<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.820> be<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.390> it's

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
that's what it's going to be and it's

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.450 
that's what it's going to be and it's
