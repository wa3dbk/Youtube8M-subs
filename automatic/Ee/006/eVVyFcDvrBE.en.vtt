00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
easier to do it in single play and

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.460 
easier to do it in single play and
that's<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.209> we're<00:02:12.750> going<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:12.959> do<00:02:13.080> with<00:02:13.290> the

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
that's it we're going to do with the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.910 
that's it we're going to do with the
first

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
first

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.980 
first

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
to make it what you want to put is a

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.800 
to make it what you want to put is a
nautical<00:02:19.800> blue<00:02:20.160> metallic<00:02:20.790> with<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.150> diamond

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
nautical blue metallic with a diamond

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.130 
nautical blue metallic with a diamond
blue<00:02:22.170> pearlescent<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.160> it's<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.330> nice<00:02:24.569> light

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
blue pearlescent and it's a nice light

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.860 
blue pearlescent and it's a nice light
blue<00:02:25.470> color<00:02:25.830> I<00:02:26.130> like<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.120> way<00:02:27.240> it<00:02:27.390> stands<00:02:27.660> out

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
blue color I like the way it stands out

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:28.850 
blue color I like the way it stands out
in<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.050> Sun<00:02:28.290> as<00:02:28.470> well

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
in the Sun as well

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.280 
in the Sun as well
and<00:02:28.950> although<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.180> looks<00:02:30.240> pretty<00:02:30.780> good<00:02:30.959> on<00:02:31.110> the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
and although it looks pretty good on the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.630 
and although it looks pretty good on the
zentorno<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.830> think<00:02:32.070> this<00:02:32.190> color<00:02:32.370> actually

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
zentorno I think this color actually

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.030 
zentorno I think this color actually
looks<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.209> best<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.570> saw<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.900> on<00:02:34.020> a<00:02:34.050> Z<00:02:34.380> type<00:02:34.650> like

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
looks the best I saw it on a Z type like

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.610 
looks the best I saw it on a Z type like
cars<00:02:35.430> like<00:02:35.550> that<00:02:35.850> sort<00:02:36.240> of<00:02:36.330> like<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.660> classic

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
cars like that sort of like the classic

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.320 
cars like that sort of like the classic
looking<00:02:38.160> cars<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.520> think<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.850> looks<00:02:39.000> really

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
looking cars I think it looks really

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.630 
looking cars I think it looks really
good<00:02:39.510> but<00:02:40.290> either<00:02:40.560> way<00:02:40.800> I<00:02:41.010> think<00:02:41.070> it's<00:02:41.520> a

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
good but either way I think it's a

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.400 
good but either way I think it's a
really<00:02:42.150> cool<00:02:42.300> color<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.780> it's<00:02:42.900> really<00:02:43.140> cheap

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
really cool color and it's really cheap

00:02:43.410 --> 00:03:09.380 
really cool color and it's really cheap

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
of a reddish orange and I really do like

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.739

the<00:05:38.219> way<00:05:38.339> the<00:05:38.490> orange<00:05:38.669> complements<00:05:39.360> the<00:05:39.479> matte

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:39.749 
the way the orange complements the matte

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:41.299 
the way the orange complements the matte
red<00:05:40.110> and<00:05:40.439> you're<00:05:40.589> gonna<00:05:40.680> see<00:05:40.889> here<00:05:41.129> in<00:05:41.189> my

red and you're gonna see here in my

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:43.189 
red and you're gonna see here in my
opinion<00:05:41.580> it<00:05:41.789> looks<00:05:41.939> the<00:05:42.059> best<00:05:42.240> sort<00:05:42.569> of<00:05:42.689> when

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
opinion it looks the best sort of when

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.109 
opinion it looks the best sort of when
the<00:05:43.319> Sun<00:05:43.559> is<00:05:43.770> setting<00:05:44.129> because<00:05:44.610> it<00:05:44.879> does<00:05:45.089> look

00:05:45.109 --> 00:05:45.119 
the Sun is setting because it does look

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:47.540 
the Sun is setting because it does look
a<00:05:45.449> little<00:05:45.599> bit<00:05:45.719> darker<00:05:46.199> and<00:05:46.229> the<00:05:47.219> pearlescent

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
a little bit darker and the pearlescent

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.519 
a little bit darker and the pearlescent
does<00:05:47.939> shine<00:05:48.300> a<00:05:48.330> little<00:05:48.599> bit<00:05:48.809> more<00:05:49.050> but<00:05:49.319> again

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:49.529 
does shine a little bit more but again

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:50.959

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:20.219 
series will last though like again like

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:22.279 
series will last though like again like
we<00:06:20.610> might<00:06:20.819> have<00:06:21.059> to<00:06:21.180> put<00:06:21.389> a<00:06:21.419> little<00:06:21.689> stop<00:06:21.930> to<00:06:22.139> it

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.289 
we might have to put a little stop to it

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:24.949 
we might have to put a little stop to it
until<00:06:22.709> modded<00:06:23.669> colors<00:06:23.939> come<00:06:24.089> back<00:06:24.209> or<00:06:24.419> until

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:24.959 
until modded colors come back or until

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:27.799 
until modded colors come back or until
we<00:06:25.139> can<00:06:25.319> find<00:06:25.529> a<00:06:25.680> way<00:06:25.800> on<00:06:25.949> PC<00:06:26.430> to<00:06:27.059> sort<00:06:27.389> of<00:06:27.449> mod

00:06:27.799 --> 00:06:27.809 
we can find a way on PC to sort of mod

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:30.469 
we can find a way on PC to sort of mod
modded<00:06:28.680> colors<00:06:29.039> in<00:06:29.279> that<00:06:29.669> makes<00:06:29.849> any<00:06:30.029> sense<00:06:30.089> so

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 
modded colors in that makes any sense so

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:33.019 
modded colors in that makes any sense so
just<00:06:30.959> know<00:06:31.139> that<00:06:31.169> like<00:06:31.649> obviously<00:06:32.249> it<00:06:32.669> is<00:06:32.819> back

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:33.029 
just know that like obviously it is back

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:35.449 
just know that like obviously it is back
for<00:06:33.269> a<00:06:33.330> little<00:06:33.509> time<00:06:33.749> this<00:06:34.259> series<00:06:34.649> but<00:06:34.919> think

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:35.459 
for a little time this series but think

00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:36.909 
for a little time this series but think
of<00:06:35.580> it<00:06:35.669> sort<00:06:35.819> of<00:06:35.939> as<00:06:36.059> like<00:06:36.180> a<00:06:36.240> mini<00:06:36.539> series

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:36.919 
of it sort of as like a mini series

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:39.799 
of it sort of as like a mini series
rather<00:06:37.919> than<00:06:38.099> it<00:06:38.430> being<00:06:38.610> back<00:06:38.909> forever<00:06:39.479> so

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:39.809 
rather than it being back forever so

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:41.239 
rather than it being back forever so
maybe<00:06:39.990> we'll<00:06:40.229> have<00:06:40.379> to<00:06:40.499> do<00:06:40.589> is<00:06:40.769> make<00:06:41.009> like<00:06:41.219> a

00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:41.249 
maybe we'll have to do is make like a

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:43.249 
maybe we'll have to do is make like a
support<00:06:41.729> page<00:06:41.879> or<00:06:42.059> something<00:06:42.269> on<00:06:42.599> the

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:43.259 
support page or something on the

support page or something on the
Rockstar<00:06:43.800> forums<00:06:44.219> and<00:06:44.509> say<00:06:45.509> that<00:06:45.719> we<00:06:45.839> want<00:06:46.110> the

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 
Rockstar forums and say that we want the

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:48.320 
Rockstar forums and say that we want the
modded<00:06:46.709> colors<00:06:47.009> back<00:06:47.189> because<00:06:47.550> I<00:06:47.580> don't<00:06:47.999> know

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
modded colors back because I don't know

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.420 
modded colors back because I don't know
what<00:06:48.539> other<00:06:48.659> way<00:06:48.869> we<00:06:49.589> can<00:06:49.800> really<00:06:50.069> get<00:06:50.279> in

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:50.430 
what other way we can really get in

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.439
