 track 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.240
 preparation for which we talk about it and 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.710
 much different 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.330
 he was special effects where did he captain 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.310
 Pittsburgh is our moment 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.350

 6 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.350
 much better 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.350
 6 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.350
 Further 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.330
 square 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.730

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.730
 as a gift it is right 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:10.929
 project documentation 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.929
