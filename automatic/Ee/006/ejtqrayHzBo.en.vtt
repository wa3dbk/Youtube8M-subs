00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.309
 welcome to 1000 ps tv i 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.660
 am with the driver today with me 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:15.000
 david freyer hello very much what i am quite 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.869
 happy that i have this new and bautz 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.689
 from the moto guzzi v7 I think there 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.369
 there are four different worlds or 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.949
 really accurate moto guzzi has four 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.859
 redefined different worlds 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.470
 namely for the razer that the conversion 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.450
 kidnapper then there is a scrambler 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.760
 then there is another legendary one 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.890
 built a bit in military look 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.440
 the grempler is relatively similar 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.460
 with raised exhaust and then there 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.899
 it's still a day rider fantastic it 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.360
 is so I believe that, of course 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.329
 combine with each other as known 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.190
 but with radically luca really sleep the 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.350
 expansion is created moto guzzi has 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.809
 no fixed sets defined but has 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.180
 the world of these constructions is defined with 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.070
 the items but each part can 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.260
 individually ordered and installed 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.119
 that is it is possible of 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.770
 all four worlds items too 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.170
 combine and really a whole 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.510
 to build individual moto guzzi v7 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.150
 I'm really excited about it 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.860
 Of course it has this this 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.439
 relatively slim fenders in the 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.290
 brushed aluminum are the's think 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.750
 at frost want this seat or something 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:30.630
 are the essential parts of this seat 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:34.049
 is also some self defined so 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.869
 that this year up to the 60 new 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.990
 Attachments are delivered and come 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.530
 all now mainly on the v7 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:47.790
 are related and therefore there are parts 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:52.409
 Of these are just the fenders front 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:59.490
 these numbers reflect holders 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:02:01.530
 handlebars strive thanks to saddle and 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.700
 also behind the recording there 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.799
 of the label 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.140
 license plate holder up to 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:11.100
 Milled parts of circuits 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:15.300
 brake levers and also new footpegs us 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.520
 the changed exhaust systems in the 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.530
 special for the grander it is 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.209
 really great because someone like that 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.030
 always have the problems on 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.260
 motorcycle and the next year has in 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.120
 Reality like something again 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.670
 new but that is of course not enough 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.319
 But with this remodeled neighborhood can always 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.170
 more or less every year which one 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.239
 Motorcycle do it right that's it 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.030
 actually a very nice one 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.940
 world right now around his moto guzzi v7 whole 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.440
 individual as we prepare then 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.230
 also be seen by the individual 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.200
 share whether it is in a year, the 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:53.100
 to change back or simply 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.010
 reaches because of the steering wheel seekers to 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.590
 give or another page to it 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.600
 build or maybe even the 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.519
 footpegs to change or the sides 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.380
 i cant change so anyone can 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.079
 individually and according to his budget 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.049

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:13.040
 what new to buy and his moto 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:16.470
 Change and update guzzi v7 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.269
 great and different in their moto guzzi 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.870
 today there are no bright under typical no 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.959
 problem 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.110

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.450
 parts that can be installed here 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:34.200

 Now you want to catch the fire 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.450
 Of course like to look at home there 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.900
 there in the cockpit, it was considered View 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.220

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:07.470
 guzzi point come together 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:09.930
 garage moto guzzi super the last question 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.180
 just because she believes that will happen 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.849
 really urgent that something ort 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.280
 it is the deliverability from now on 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.049
 Of course , it was difficult for us 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.570
 are now in the beginning that is like us 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.389

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.680
 is so easy that week after week 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.180
 disadvantages will be met 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.889
