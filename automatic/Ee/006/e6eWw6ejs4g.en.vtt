just want to put together a quick video
to<00:00:12.269> show<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.840> differences<00:00:13.230> between<00:00:13.410> the

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
to show the differences between the

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.160 
to show the differences between the
switches<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.460> sounds<00:00:15.000> between<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.929> DX

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.859 
DX 8
so<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.580> lot<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.820> people<00:00:24.000> on<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.390> on<00:00:24.720> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
so a lot of people on the on the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.269 
so a lot of people on the on the
internet<00:00:25.199> we're<00:00:25.350> wondering<00:00:25.710> about<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
internet we're wondering about the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.120 
internet we're wondering about the
quality<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.820> switches<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:28.130> sounds

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
quality of the switches and the sounds

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.650 
quality of the switches and the sounds
that<00:00:29.279> come<00:00:29.429> out<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.939> devices<00:00:30.510> themselves

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
that come out of the devices themselves

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.020 
that come out of the devices themselves
so<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.230> figured<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.619> short<00:00:31.859> video<00:00:32.070> would<00:00:32.579> would

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
so I figured a short video would would

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.630 
so I figured a short video would would
help<00:00:33.239> people<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.750> see<00:00:34.559> what's<00:00:34.860> what's<00:00:35.309> really

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
help people to see what's what's really

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.330 
help people to see what's what's really
going<00:00:35.880> on<00:00:36.030> there<00:00:36.710> so<00:00:37.710> what<00:00:37.950> I'm<00:00:38.040> going<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.219> do

going on there so what I'm going to do
is<00:00:38.460> just<00:00:38.670> run<00:00:38.850> through<00:00:39.030> very<00:00:40.020> quickly<00:00:40.200> and

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
is just run through very quickly and

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.619 
is just run through very quickly and
show<00:00:40.739> what<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.219> startup<00:00:41.579> sound<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.030> like<00:00:42.239> what

show what the startup sound is like what
the<00:00:42.840> what<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.770> switch<00:00:44.100> sounds<00:00:44.489> are<00:00:44.640> like<00:00:44.789> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
the what the switch sounds are like the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.970 
the what the switch sounds are like the
beeps<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.840> come<00:00:46.020> from<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> transmitters

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.000 
etc and also just give you a close-up of
of<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.510> switches<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.140> gimbals<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.710> action

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010

first<00:00:57.420> I'll<00:00:57.570> start<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.960> dx8<00:00:58.430> and<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.940> either

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
first I'll start the dx8 and you either

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:17.140 
first I'll start the dx8 and you either
start<00:01:00.449> up<00:01:00.629> sound<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.289> switch<00:01:07.729> now<00:01:08.729> VDX<00:01:09.210> 18

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:30.050 

and<00:01:18.150> kick<00:01:19.140> you

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.060 

okay<00:01:31.060> now<00:01:31.210> if<00:01:31.359> I<00:01:31.479> go<00:01:31.719> into<00:01:31.869> the<00:01:32.140> menu<00:01:32.350> on<00:01:32.799> the<00:01:32.920> D

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
okay now if I go into the menu on the D

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:45.380 
okay now if I go into the menu on the D
site<00:01:33.340> and<00:01:35.130> scroll<00:01:36.130> between<00:01:42.359> and<00:01:43.679> now<00:01:44.679> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
site and scroll between and now the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:02:19.199 
site and scroll between and now the
Dukes<00:01:46.390> 18<00:02:00.179> and<00:02:01.179> now<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.509> key<00:02:01.750> here<00:02:17.910> so<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:18.970> me

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
Dukes 18 and now the key here so to me

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.520 
Dukes 18 and now the key here so to me
the<00:02:19.420> difference<00:02:19.810> between<00:02:20.170> these<00:02:20.470> three

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
the difference between these three

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.479 
the difference between these three
radios

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
radios

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.770 
radios
I<00:02:21.519> think<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.470> dx8<00:02:23.470> has<00:02:24.329> about<00:02:25.329> a<00:02:25.360> medium

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
I think the dx8 has about a medium

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.150 
I think the dx8 has about a medium
volume<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:27.670> deeps<00:02:27.879> 18<00:02:28.410> quite<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.440> loud<00:02:29.769> and

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
volume the deeps 18 quite a loud and

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.740 
volume the deeps 18 quite a loud and
very<00:02:30.819> acute<00:02:31.420> volume<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:33.310> QQ<00:02:33.790> is<00:02:34.239> softer

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
very acute volume and the QQ is softer

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.349 
very acute volume and the QQ is softer
than<00:02:34.780> both<00:02:35.109> and<00:02:36.299> it<00:02:37.299> has<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.480> different<00:02:37.840> pitch

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
than both and it has a different pitch

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.729 
than both and it has a different pitch
so<00:02:40.359> you<00:02:40.450> can<00:02:40.600> hear<00:02:40.750> that<00:02:40.870> as<00:02:41.019> as<00:02:41.530> you're

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
so you can hear that as as you're

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.530 
so you can hear that as as you're
scrolling<00:02:41.920> up<00:02:42.310> in<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.579> menu<00:02:42.880> it<00:02:43.090> sounds

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
scrolling up in the menu it sounds

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.860 
scrolling up in the menu it sounds
different<00:02:43.750> as<00:02:44.109> you<00:02:44.260> scroll<00:02:44.500> down<00:02:48.810> now<00:02:49.810> the

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
different as you scroll down now the

00:02:49.870 --> 00:03:02.870 
different as you scroll down now the
main<00:02:50.109> switch<00:02:50.380> itself

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.470 

and<00:03:02.970> pretty<00:03:03.960> much<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.500> main<00:03:05.310> switch<00:03:05.670> for<00:03:06.210> the

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
and pretty much the main switch for the

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.890 
and pretty much the main switch for the
18<00:03:07.020> QQ<00:03:07.590> in<00:03:07.740> the<00:03:07.830> 18<00:03:08.220> as<00:03:08.850> far<00:03:09.030> as<00:03:09.120> I<00:03:09.270> can<00:03:09.330> tell<00:03:09.570> is

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
18 QQ in the 18 as far as I can tell is

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.600 
18 QQ in the 18 as far as I can tell is
exactly<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.830> same<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:12.530> switch<00:03:13.530> on<00:03:13.890> the

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
exactly the same the switch on the

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.490 
exactly the same the switch on the
eighth<00:03:14.730> is<00:03:14.970> obviously<00:03:15.360> different<00:03:15.750> one

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
eighth is obviously different one

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.770 
eighth is obviously different one
disadvantage<00:03:16.860> I<00:03:17.370> think<00:03:17.580> of<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.790> 18<00:03:18.120> is<00:03:18.360> a<00:03:18.390> when

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
disadvantage I think of the 18 is a when

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.990 
disadvantage I think of the 18 is a when
you<00:03:18.900> turn<00:03:19.080> it<00:03:19.230> off<00:03:19.350> it<00:03:19.650> leaves<00:03:20.460> up<00:03:20.700> a<00:03:20.790> message

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
you turn it off it leaves up a message

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.790 
you turn it off it leaves up a message

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
of hard to describe and the the feel of

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.280 
of hard to describe and the the feel of
the<00:04:00.120> gimbal<00:04:01.640> for<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:02.760> video<00:04:03.030> I<00:04:03.360> definitely

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
the gimbal for the video I definitely

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.850 
the gimbal for the video I definitely
prefer<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.800> 18<00:04:05.220> over<00:04:05.550> the<00:04:05.640> 8<00:04:07.130> the<00:04:08.130> 18<00:04:08.520> QQ<00:04:09.860> feels

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
prefer the 18 over the 8 the 18 QQ feels

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.270 
prefer the 18 over the 8 the 18 QQ feels
very<00:04:11.190> similar<00:04:11.520> to<00:04:11.820> the<00:04:11.940> to<00:04:12.330> the<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:12.810> 18<00:04:14.600> maybe

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
very similar to the to the the 18 maybe

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.990 
very similar to the to the the 18 maybe
just<00:04:17.280> slightly<00:04:17.610> more<00:04:17.790> tension<00:04:18.450> on<00:04:18.600> the<00:04:18.780> spring

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
just slightly more tension on the spring

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.980 
just slightly more tension on the spring
apart<00:04:21.000> from<00:04:21.150> that<00:04:21.330> you<00:04:23.120> really<00:04:24.120> can't<00:04:24.330> feel<00:04:24.570> an

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
apart from that you really can't feel an

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.420 
apart from that you really can't feel an
awful<00:04:25.350> lot<00:04:27.260> we<00:04:28.260> take<00:04:28.470> if<00:04:28.740> we<00:04:28.890> take<00:04:29.070> a<00:04:29.130> look<00:04:29.310> at

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
awful lot we take if we take a look at

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.960 
awful lot we take if we take a look at
the<00:04:29.520> stick<00:04:29.730> length<00:04:31.430> you'll<00:04:32.430> notice<00:04:32.760> that<00:04:32.880> I

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
the stick length you'll notice that I

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:39.860 
the stick length you'll notice that I
actually<00:04:37.100> as<00:04:38.100> expected<00:04:38.640> two<00:04:39.030> sticks<00:04:39.300> on<00:04:39.630> the

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
actually as expected two sticks on the

actually as expected two sticks on the
18<00:04:40.380> very<00:04:41.010> very<00:04:41.250> similar

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.200 

the<00:04:53.310> slide<00:04:53.580> is<00:04:53.610> pretty<00:04:54.030> much<00:04:54.240> the<00:04:54.420> same<00:04:56.210> no

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
the slide is pretty much the same no

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.350

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
button definitely a different button on

the<00:05:07.890> QQ<00:05:11.660> of<00:05:12.660> those<00:05:13.230> three<00:05:13.500> buttons<00:05:13.830> the<00:05:14.370> one

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
the QQ of those three buttons the one

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.130 
the QQ of those three buttons the one
that<00:05:14.700> I'd<00:05:14.790> prefer<00:05:15.000> the<00:05:15.180> best<00:05:15.480> would<00:05:15.840> be<00:05:15.870> the

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
one on the QQ it's a bit more committed

one on the QQ it's a bit more committed
I<00:05:20.400> guess<00:05:20.610> you<00:05:20.760> could<00:05:20.940> say<00:05:20.970> to<00:05:21.360> solid<00:05:22.340> click

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750

I guess you could say to solid click

QQ an interesting thing I've just seen
on<00:07:05.999> my<00:07:06.120> radio<00:07:06.330> is<00:07:06.659> that<00:07:06.689> apparently<00:07:07.649> I<00:07:07.919> seem<00:07:08.099> to

on my radio is that apparently I seem to
have<00:07:08.279> some<00:07:08.520> kind<00:07:08.669> of<00:07:08.789> production<00:07:09.089> fault

00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:09.509 
have some kind of production fault

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:11.749 
have some kind of production fault
because<00:07:09.719> you<00:07:09.930> can<00:07:10.229> see<00:07:10.439> here<00:07:10.649> that<00:07:10.889> the<00:07:11.129> Zed<00:07:11.430> is
