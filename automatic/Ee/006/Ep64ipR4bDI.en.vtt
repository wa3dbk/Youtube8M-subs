00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello my name is victoria in this 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.259
 video i want to show you my version 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.630
 making cottage cheese for kids is simple 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.519
 why suddenly it is cottage cheese and how else 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.170
 prepare the matter is that since we 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.179
 eat country cottage cheese and he is 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.609
 dryish crumbly remember my 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.070
 any such childhood memories 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.840
 when mom bought exactly village 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.670
 This cottage cheese was just watering it. 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.800
 sour cream before pouring sugar coma and 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.910
 forced and that is I really is 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.429
 could not eat 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.040
 and children naturally now also 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.450
 especially want him to just sit like that 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.880
 chew on them 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.290
 different here are these cottage cheese shirts 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.690
 which with a lot of creamy 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.180
 oils go here and for them to eat 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.110
 more natural I kind of do 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.020
 I have this option here 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.379
 director of sour milk a little 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.480
 jam 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.030
 here if there are the same berries the same to me 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.660
 need bananas and you just need 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.340
 blender i will put some part but i 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.010
 I am guided by how many children 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.129
 I eat so I look in principle 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.280
 one child somewhere 200 250 grams 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.220
 curd eats another approximately gram 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.939
 100 150 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:17.100
 we get the principle delicious if it is 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.909
 cottage cheese not too lazy and miss more 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.340
 through a sieve 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.189
 although such a thing I would not wish the enemy 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.150
 just cooking cottage cheese paska 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:30.470
 when half an hour blink rubbed this heap 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:33.470
 but the effect is of course just gorgeous 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.470
 it turns out 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:45.509
 we take banana bananas gives a pleasant 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.450
 tenderness is he in the heart of the aroma and 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:57.920
 sweetness to the same ship 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:57.920
 and probably another one or half 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.149
 to close further I go there a little bit 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.149
 methane and add 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:26.230

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:38.830
 more who more you are worth less 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:42.440

 closer tender lips tender substances 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.170
 if any slices of banana are not 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.820
 milled it is not scary, they 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.300
