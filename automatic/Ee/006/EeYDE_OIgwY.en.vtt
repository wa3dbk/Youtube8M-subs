I'm<00:00:01.230> going<00:00:01.770> to<00:00:01.860> show<00:00:02.370> you<00:00:02.429> how<00:00:02.700> to<00:00:02.810> dig<00:00:03.810> a<00:00:03.840> hole

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
I'm going to show you how to dig a hole

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.160 
I'm going to show you how to dig a hole
here<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:05.520> hole<00:00:06.000> that<00:00:06.390> I'm<00:00:06.480> going<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.660> dig<00:00:06.899> I

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
here the hole that I'm going to dig I

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.910 
here the hole that I'm going to dig I
need<00:00:07.980> it<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.250> be<00:00:08.400> at<00:00:08.730> least<00:00:09.410> four<00:00:10.410> feet<00:00:10.650> down

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
need it to be at least four feet down

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.419 
need it to be at least four feet down
below<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.820> frost<00:00:12.000> level<00:00:12.950> the<00:00:13.950> trick<00:00:14.219> of<00:00:14.370> doing

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
below the frost level the trick of doing

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.050 
below the frost level the trick of doing
this<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:15.120> if<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.529> don't<00:00:16.680> want<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.949> go<00:00:17.039> out<00:00:17.160> if

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
this is if you don't want to go out if

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.220 
this is if you don't want to go out if
you<00:00:18.119> don't<00:00:18.359> want<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.539> go<00:00:18.660> out<00:00:18.750> on<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.900> raft<00:00:19.109> a

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
you don't want to go out on a raft a

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.950 
you don't want to go out on a raft a
machine<00:00:19.560> for<00:00:19.859> $50<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.510> just<00:00:21.720> need<00:00:21.930> a

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
machine for $50 and you just need a

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.470 
machine for $50 and you just need a
one-time-only<00:00:22.470> hole<00:00:23.100> here<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:24.210> don't<00:00:24.359> have

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
one-time-only hole here you don't have

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.470 
one-time-only hole here you don't have
the<00:00:24.689> time<00:00:24.869> or<00:00:25.289> or<00:00:25.890> anything<00:00:26.130> like<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.480> where

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
the time or or anything like that where

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
the time or or anything like that where
your<00:00:27.630> first<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:28.080> what<00:00:28.230> you're<00:00:28.380> going<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.560> need

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
your first is what you're going to need

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.979 
your first is what you're going to need
you<00:00:31.500> need<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.009> make<00:00:32.160> yourself<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:33.149> jug<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.719> water

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
you need to make yourself a jug of water

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.840 
you need to make yourself a jug of water
because<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:35.040> like<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.460> hot<00:00:35.640> day<00:00:35.820> like

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
because it's like on a hot day like

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.790 
because it's like on a hot day like
today<00:00:36.210> it's<00:00:36.540> like<00:00:37.070> 32<00:00:38.070> degrees<00:00:38.460> out<00:00:42.290> so<00:00:43.290> anyway

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
today it's like 32 degrees out so anyway

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.170 
today it's like 32 degrees out so anyway
so<00:00:44.160> what<00:00:44.340> I'm<00:00:44.430> doing<00:00:44.700> here<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:44.910> I'm<00:00:45.000> going<00:00:45.120> to

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
so what I'm doing here is I'm going to

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.970 
so what I'm doing here is I'm going to
put<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.360> lamppost<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.079> here<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.500> I'm<00:00:46.559> putting<00:00:46.920> a

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
put a lamppost in here so I'm putting a

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.010 
put a lamppost in here so I'm putting a
footing<00:00:47.340> into<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.360> ground<00:00:48.629> here<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:48.899> I

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
footing into the the ground here and I

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.319 
footing into the the ground here and I
want<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.230> go<00:00:49.379> at<00:00:49.500> least<00:00:49.530> four<00:00:49.950> feet<00:00:50.160> down<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:50.399> at

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
want to go at least four feet down so at

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.660 
want to go at least four feet down so at
least<00:00:51.510> down<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> frost<00:00:52.170> line<00:00:52.430> so<00:00:53.430> what<00:00:53.520> I'm

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
least down to the frost line so what I'm

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.950 
least down to the frost line so what I'm
end<00:00:54.030> up<00:00:54.149> going<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.390> do<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.629> I'm<00:00:54.690> going<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.870> run

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
end up going to do is I'm going to run

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.900 
end up going to do is I'm going to run
this<00:00:55.110> wire<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.770> got<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.190> dig<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.460> out<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.579> little

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
this wire I got to dig it out a little

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.209 
this wire I got to dig it out a little
bit<00:00:57.000> lower<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:58.410> got<00:00:58.590> some<00:00:58.770> conduit

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
bit lower and I got some conduit

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.860 
bit lower and I got some conduit
electrical<00:00:59.850> conduit<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.420> it'll<00:01:00.570> come<00:01:00.690> up

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
electrical conduit and it'll come up

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.479 
electrical conduit and it'll come up
here<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.320> they'll<00:01:01.500> be<00:01:01.620> axed<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.100> wire<00:01:02.340> will

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
here and they'll be axed this wire will

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.380 
here and they'll be axed this wire will
be<00:01:02.520> accessible<00:01:03.329> through<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.040> lamp<00:01:05.360> so<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
be accessible through the lamp so the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.480 
be accessible through the lamp so the
trick<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.900> do<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.470> I'm<00:01:07.830> putting<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.189> 12

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
trick is to do this I'm putting a 12

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.200 
trick is to do this I'm putting a 12
inch<00:01:09.170> sonic<00:01:10.170> tube<00:01:10.380> here<00:01:10.880> or<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.030> can<00:01:12.150> just

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
inch sonic tube here or you can just

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.000 
inch sonic tube here or you can just
pour<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.659> concrete<00:01:12.810> into<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.350> hole<00:01:13.590> which<00:01:13.979> is

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
pour the concrete into the hole which is

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.260 
pour the concrete into the hole which is
sometimes<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.549> little<00:01:14.580> better<00:01:14.880> because<00:01:15.060> it

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
sometimes a little better because it

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.840 
sometimes a little better because it
forms<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:15.960> hole<00:01:16.259> but<00:01:17.189> then<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.549> might<00:01:17.670> use

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
forms to the hole but then you might use

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.450 
forms to the hole but then you might use
up<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.090> little<00:01:18.270> extra<00:01:18.450> concrete<00:01:19.100> so<00:01:20.100> anyway<00:01:20.400> so

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
up a little extra concrete so anyway so

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.190 
up a little extra concrete so anyway so
what<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.729> want<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.030> do<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.270> I'm<00:01:21.390> going<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.570> add<00:01:21.990> up

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
what I want to do is I'm going to add up

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.980 
what I want to do is I'm going to add up
down<00:01:22.409> as<00:01:22.619> far<00:01:22.860> as<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.100> can<00:01:23.509> and<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.570> scrape

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
down as far as I can and you scrape

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.440 
down as far as I can and you scrape
scrape<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.650> edges<00:01:25.799> here<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:27.060> make<00:01:27.270> your

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
scrape the edges here just make your

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.569 
scrape the edges here just make your
diameter

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
diameter

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:30.770 
diameter
and<00:01:29.579> then<00:01:29.820> when<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.030> get<00:01:30.119> as<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.479> get<00:01:30.600> down

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
and then when you get as you get down

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.069 
and then when you get as you get down
deeper<00:01:31.290> it's<00:01:31.560> hard<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:33.240> bring<00:01:33.780> out<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
deeper it's hard to to bring out the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.190 
deeper it's hard to to bring out the
dirt<00:01:34.430> so<00:01:35.430> what<00:01:35.610> I'm<00:01:35.729> doing<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:36.210> when<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.079> get

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
dirt so what I'm doing is when you get

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.530 
dirt so what I'm doing is when you get
lower<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.909> chop<00:01:38.909> up<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.180> dirt<00:01:39.540> into<00:01:41.540> just

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
lower I chop up the dirt into just

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.920 
lower I chop up the dirt into just
loosen<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:42.960> up<00:01:43.079> down<00:01:43.649> there<00:01:44.689> because<00:01:45.689> it's

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
loosen it up down there because it's

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.569 
loosen it up down there because it's
quite<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> ways<00:01:46.320> down<00:01:46.350> there<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.310> then<00:01:47.399> what<00:01:47.549> I

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
quite a ways down there and then what I

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.380 
quite a ways down there and then what I
did<00:01:47.700> was<00:01:48.649> instead<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.710> renting<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.640> machine

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.679
