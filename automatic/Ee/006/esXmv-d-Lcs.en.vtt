00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.699 
analyze a film but there is no point you
know<00:02:27.300> those<00:02:27.510> Easter<00:02:27.990> eggs<00:02:28.080> didn't<00:02:28.410> mean

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
know those Easter eggs didn't mean

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.160 
know those Easter eggs didn't mean
anything<00:02:29.100> I<00:02:29.520> guess<00:02:30.330> that's<00:02:30.570> what<00:02:30.810> he

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
anything I guess that's what he

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.930 
anything I guess that's what he
technically<00:02:31.470> says<00:02:31.770> then<00:02:32.070> right<00:02:32.280> he<00:02:32.459> is<00:02:32.520> famous

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
technically says then right he is famous

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.420 
technically says then right he is famous
quote<00:02:33.360> which<00:02:33.570> is<00:02:33.720> very<00:02:33.990> very<00:02:34.170> interesting<00:02:34.709> it

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
quote which is very very interesting it

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.910 
quote which is very very interesting it
says<00:02:35.580> he<00:02:35.910> then<00:02:36.090> added<00:02:36.330> he<00:02:36.810> is<00:02:37.110> Max<00:02:37.650> Borenstein

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
says he then added he is Max Borenstein

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.150 
says he then added he is Max Borenstein
he<00:02:38.700> says<00:02:38.940> if<00:02:39.780> we're<00:02:40.440> fortunate<00:02:40.680> enough<00:02:40.950> to

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
he says if we're fortunate enough to

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.180 
he says if we're fortunate enough to
make<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.400> seagull<00:02:41.850> which<00:02:42.060> yes<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:43.500> dancers

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
make a seagull which yes that dancers

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.190 
make a seagull which yes that dancers
yes<00:02:44.430> then<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.180> think<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.480> choice<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:46.020> what

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
yes then I think the choice of what

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.020 
yes then I think the choice of what
character<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:46.800> might<00:02:47.010> be<00:02:47.250> whether<00:02:47.760> it's<00:02:47.850> a

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
character that might be whether it's a

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.630 
character that might be whether it's a
total<00:02:48.540> character<00:02:48.870> or<00:02:49.200> new<00:02:49.530> one<00:02:49.739> it's<00:02:50.370> always

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
total character or new one it's always

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.470 
total character or new one it's always
going<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.290> going<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.320> have<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:53.130> be<00:02:53.450> dictated<00:02:54.450> by

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
going to going to have to be dictated by

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.810 
going to going to have to be dictated by
finding<00:02:54.959> way<00:02:55.200> into<00:02:56.070> that<00:02:56.220> character<00:02:56.430> that

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
finding way into that character that

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.640 
finding way into that character that
feels<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.300> piece<00:02:57.570> with<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.810> tone<00:02:58.140> we're

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
feels of a piece with the tone we're

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.680 
feels of a piece with the tone we're
establishing<00:02:58.890> which<00:02:59.430> is<00:02:59.610> very<00:02:59.940> serious<00:03:00.420> tone

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
establishing which is very serious tone

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.130 
establishing which is very serious tone
very<00:03:01.050> dark<00:03:01.850> realistic<00:03:02.850> time<00:03:03.060> so<00:03:03.690> you<00:03:03.750> asked

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
very dark realistic time so you asked

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.380 
very dark realistic time so you asked
earlier<00:03:04.440> picking<00:03:05.070> a<00:03:05.130> granite<00:03:05.489> stone<00:03:05.700> is<00:03:05.910> why

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
earlier picking a granite stone is why

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.050 
earlier picking a granite stone is why
we<00:03:06.570> didn't<00:03:06.870> have<00:03:07.110> either<00:03:07.410> oh<00:03:07.590> whatever<00:03:08.060> not

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
we didn't have either oh whatever not

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.490 
we didn't have either oh whatever not
really<00:03:09.450> because<00:03:09.570> I<00:03:09.720> think<00:03:10.050> there's<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.320> way<00:03:10.470> to

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
really because I think there's a way to

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.530 
really because I think there's a way to
take<00:03:11.370> any<00:03:11.580> of<00:03:11.730> those<00:03:11.820> characters<00:03:12.239> and<00:03:12.390> put<00:03:12.510> a

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
take any of those characters and put a

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.570 
take any of those characters and put a
fresh<00:03:12.900> spin<00:03:13.200> on<00:03:13.380> them<00:03:13.530> that<00:03:14.040> might<00:03:14.310> feel<00:03:14.550> more

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
fresh spin on them that might feel more

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.120 
fresh spin on them that might feel more
of<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:15.000> peacefully<00:03:15.750> with<00:03:15.900> our<00:03:16.050> film<00:03:16.350> they<00:03:16.920> don't

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
of a peacefully with our film they don't

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.210 
of a peacefully with our film they don't
would<00:03:17.340> with<00:03:17.820> maybe<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.510> cambiar<00:03:19.260> light-hearted

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
would with maybe a cambiar light-hearted

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.360 
would with maybe a cambiar light-hearted
version<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:21.360> if<00:03:21.570> there<00:03:21.930> is<00:03:22.110> total<00:03:22.890> monsters

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
version so if there is total monsters

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.610 
version so if there is total monsters
that<00:03:23.640> are<00:03:25.100> not<00:03:26.100> realistic<00:03:26.400> such<00:03:26.850> as<00:03:27.620> King

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
that are not realistic such as King

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.120 
that are not realistic such as King
adoro<00:03:29.660> I<00:03:30.660> don't<00:03:31.110> think<00:03:31.140> Megalon<00:03:31.800> is<00:03:31.980> it

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
adoro I don't think Megalon is it

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.620 
adoro I don't think Megalon is it
realistic<00:03:32.370> character<00:03:33.030> my<00:03:33.150> opinion<00:03:33.450> either

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
realistic character my opinion either

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.430 
realistic character my opinion either
won't<00:03:34.590> even<00:03:34.830> Martha<00:03:35.810> what<00:03:36.810> they<00:03:36.930> can<00:03:37.110> do<00:03:37.290> is

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
won't even Martha what they can do is

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.610 
won't even Martha what they can do is
that<00:03:37.590> they<00:03:37.620> can<00:03:37.800> just<00:03:38.100> add<00:03:38.220> a<00:03:38.610> twist<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.570> it

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
that they can just add a twist to it

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.770 
that they can just add a twist to it
Meagan<00:03:40.620> had<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:41.280> fresh<00:03:41.940> new<00:03:42.239> or

Meagan had a fresh new or
so<00:03:42.930> many<00:03:43.110> mothers<00:03:43.560> origin<00:03:44.010> is<00:03:44.370> maybe<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.360> know

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
so many mothers origin is maybe you know

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.260 
so many mothers origin is maybe you know
just<00:03:45.480> a<00:03:45.780> prehistoric<00:03:46.709> creature<00:03:47.069> that<00:03:47.819> you

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
just a prehistoric creature that you

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.900 
just a prehistoric creature that you
know<00:03:48.450> means<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:49.260> that<00:03:49.340> she<00:03:50.340> doesn't<00:03:50.520> have<00:03:50.700> any

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
have the fairies doesn't have to be the

guardians you can just be around the
monster<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:54.990> I<00:03:55.860> guess<00:03:56.069> in<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.910> city<00:03:57.150> is<00:03:57.330> a

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
monster and I guess in the city is a

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.550 
monster and I guess in the city is a
ginormous<00:03:57.930> mouth<00:03:58.560> or<00:03:59.060> met<00:04:00.060> on<00:04:00.510> omegle<00:04:01.050> on<00:04:01.380> how

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
to do that move it just a giant beetle

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.080 
to do that move it just a giant beetle
