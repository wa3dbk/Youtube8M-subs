that<00:00:21.740> still<00:00:22.010> remain<00:00:22.310> the<00:00:22.430> same<00:00:23.020> we<00:00:24.020> started

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:24.440 
that still remain the same we started

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.439 
that still remain the same we started
with<00:00:24.590> a<00:00:24.619> very<00:00:25.070> white<00:00:25.609> and<00:00:25.850> black<00:00:26.150> palette

with a very white and black palette

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.840 
with a very white and black palette
which<00:00:26.869> I<00:00:26.990> thought<00:00:27.199> was<00:00:27.350> great<00:00:27.590> but<00:00:28.279> as<00:00:28.400> I<00:00:28.550> lived

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:28.850 
which I thought was great but as I lived

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.460 
which I thought was great but as I lived
in<00:00:29.000> it<00:00:29.119> a<00:00:29.180> little<00:00:29.300> bit<00:00:29.449> longer<00:00:29.720> I<00:00:29.960> found<00:00:30.350> that

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
in it a little bit longer I found that

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.259 
in it a little bit longer I found that
there<00:00:30.619> were<00:00:30.740> things<00:00:31.279> about<00:00:31.490> it<00:00:31.760> that<00:00:31.789> I<00:00:31.910> wanted

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:32.269 
there were things about it that I wanted

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:34.270 
there were things about it that I wanted
more<00:00:32.419> warmth<00:00:32.840> so<00:00:33.320> I<00:00:33.530> added<00:00:33.920> some<00:00:34.190> different

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
more warmth so I added some different

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.799 
more warmth so I added some different
elements<00:00:34.880> and<00:00:34.940> I've<00:00:35.030> been<00:00:35.180> building<00:00:35.570> on<00:00:35.690> it

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
elements and I've been building on it

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.780 
elements and I've been building on it
since<00:00:36.050> then<00:00:36.260> actually<00:00:36.739> adding<00:00:37.040> more<00:00:37.220> color<00:00:37.520> to

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
since then actually adding more color to

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.110 
since then actually adding more color to
it

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120

the<00:00:55.250> fireplace<00:00:55.520> and<00:00:56.120> you<00:00:56.960> know<00:00:57.050> what<00:00:57.200> I

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
the fireplace and you know what I

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.869 
the fireplace and you know what I
changed<00:00:57.500> up<00:00:57.710> a<00:00:57.829> little<00:00:58.010> bit<00:00:58.219> I<00:00:58.250> changed<00:00:58.730> the

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
changed up a little bit I changed the

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.209 
changed up a little bit I changed the
lamps<00:00:59.420> originally<00:01:00.350> that<00:01:00.559> were<00:01:00.680> just<00:01:00.890> a<00:01:01.010> white

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
lamps originally that were just a white

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.100 
lamps originally that were just a white
pair<00:01:01.460> of<00:01:01.579> lamps<00:01:01.789> but<00:01:02.059> I<00:01:02.090> decided<00:01:02.449> I<00:01:02.690> wanted<00:01:02.840> the

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
pair of lamps but I decided I wanted the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.509 
pair of lamps but I decided I wanted the
strength<00:01:03.410> and<00:01:03.559> power<00:01:03.770> that<00:01:03.920> was<00:01:04.129> in<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.369> wood

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
strength and power that was in the wood

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.639 
strength and power that was in the wood
and<00:01:04.699> more<00:01:05.209> height<00:01:05.449> because<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:05.990> ceiling<00:01:06.499> is

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
and more height because the ceiling is

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:08.949 
and more height because the ceiling is
so<00:01:06.799> high<00:01:07.009> that<00:01:07.369> I<00:01:07.729> really<00:01:08.060> wanted<00:01:08.359> it<00:01:08.479> to<00:01:08.509> draw

00:01:08.949 --> 00:01:08.959 
so high that I really wanted it to draw

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:11.050 
so high that I really wanted it to draw
your<00:01:09.229> eye<00:01:09.289> up<00:01:09.679> and<00:01:09.889> pull<00:01:10.069> it<00:01:10.100> up<00:01:10.340> in<00:01:10.490> in<00:01:10.819> line

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
your eye up and pull it up in in line

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.529 
your eye up and pull it up in in line
with<00:01:11.299> the<00:01:11.389> curtains<00:01:11.810> actually<00:01:12.380> I<00:01:13.359> love<00:01:14.359> the

about it it works really well I changed

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.200

out<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:57.290> curtains<00:02:57.710> and<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.460> they<00:02:58.850> were<00:02:58.910> white

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
out the curtains and and they were white

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.910 
out the curtains and and they were white
as<00:02:59.360> well<00:02:59.510> but<00:02:59.720> these<00:02:59.810> ones<00:02:59.990> are<00:03:00.200> a<00:03:00.260> little<00:03:00.590> bit

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
lighter in weight I think that it

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.140 
lighter in weight I think that it
