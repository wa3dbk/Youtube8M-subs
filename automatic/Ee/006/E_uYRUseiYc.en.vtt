at I guess the wire broke when it was
bent<00:03:26.830> so<00:03:27.670> it<00:03:27.940> doesn't<00:03:28.240> do<00:03:28.360> anything<00:03:29.130> so<00:03:30.130> that's

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
bent so it doesn't do anything so that's

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.880 
bent so it doesn't do anything so that's
a<00:03:30.550> garbage<00:03:33.660> so<00:03:34.660> it's<00:03:34.990> a<00:03:35.050> warmer<00:03:35.380> day<00:03:35.410> today's
