the<00:00:02.129> basics<00:00:02.639> of<00:00:02.790> evolution<00:00:03.419> are<00:00:03.720> really<00:00:04.410> quite

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
the basics of evolution are really quite

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.140 
the basics of evolution are really quite
simple<00:00:04.890> although<00:00:05.100> their<00:00:05.310> resistance<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:06.029> them

simple although their resistance to them
is<00:00:06.299> enormous<00:00:06.569> it's<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.500> idea<00:00:07.980> that<00:00:08.040> humans

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
is enormous it's the idea that humans

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.480 
is enormous it's the idea that humans
didn't<00:00:09.480> fall<00:00:09.690> from<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.110> sky

the spelling now the somebody might say
okay<00:00:42.540> that's<00:00:42.660> science<00:00:43.410> but<00:00:43.739> what<00:00:43.860> does<00:00:44.010> that

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
okay that's science but what does that

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.860 
okay that's science but what does that
to<00:00:44.340> do<00:00:44.460> with<00:00:44.610> politics<00:00:45.270> what<00:00:45.570> does<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:45.719> have

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
to do with politics what does that have

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.990 
to do with politics what does that have
to<00:00:45.960> do<00:00:46.140> with<00:00:46.170> law<00:00:46.559> what<00:00:47.340> does<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.460> have<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.730> do

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
to do with law what does that have to do

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.180 
to do with law what does that have to do
with<00:00:48.680> epistemology<00:00:49.680> or<00:00:50.600> or<00:00:51.600> human<00:00:52.170> rights<00:00:52.469> or

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
the meaning of life it has and it's just

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.290 
the meaning of life it has and it's just
unbelievable<00:00:58.649> how<00:00:59.219> much<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.699> has<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.090> do<00:01:00.270> with

the whole book explores the implications

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.679 
the whole book explores the implications
of<00:01:07.890> evolution<00:01:08.890> for<00:01:09.580> traditional<00:01:10.150> questions

and philosophy the purpose of the book
is<00:01:13.330> first<00:01:13.630> to<00:01:13.960> to<00:01:14.320> get<00:01:14.710> students<00:01:15.130> thinking

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
is first to to get students thinking

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.249 
is first to to get students thinking
from<00:01:15.790> an<00:01:15.939> evolutionary<00:01:16.149> perspective<00:01:16.659> and

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
from an evolutionary perspective and

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.800 
from an evolutionary perspective and
seeing<00:01:17.530> that<00:01:18.340> this<00:01:18.490> is<00:01:18.549> not<00:01:18.850> irrelevant<00:01:19.360> but

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
seeing that this is not irrelevant but

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.840 
seeing that this is not irrelevant but
this<00:01:19.960> is<00:01:20.140> highly<00:01:20.649> relevant<00:01:20.950> to<00:01:21.250> topic<00:01:21.700> after

interdisciplinary the scholarship out
there<00:01:39.610> is<00:01:39.880> enormous<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.920> so<00:01:42.759> I<00:01:42.819> try<00:01:43.060> to

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
there is enormous and so I try to

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.779 
there is enormous and so I try to
introduce<00:01:43.390> them<00:01:43.810> to<00:01:43.840> that<00:01:44.759> along<00:01:45.759> with

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
introduce them to that along with

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.359 
introduce them to that along with
working<00:01:46.539> in<00:01:46.690> some<00:01:47.020> of<00:01:47.049> my<00:01:47.229> own<00:01:47.380> arguments<00:01:48.130> here

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
working in some of my own arguments here

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.180 
working in some of my own arguments here
and<00:01:48.520> there<00:01:48.750> for<00:01:49.750> example<00:01:50.380> in<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:50.560> chapter<00:01:50.590> on

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
and there for example in the chapter on

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.660 
and there for example in the chapter on
evolution<00:01:51.789> and<00:01:51.850> ethics<00:01:52.270> I<00:01:52.450> have<00:01:52.890> maybe<00:01:53.890> two

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
evolution and ethics I have maybe two

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.160 
evolution and ethics I have maybe two
pages<00:01:55.060> on<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.929> implications<00:01:56.350> of<00:01:57.159> evolution

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
pages on the implications of evolution

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.520 
pages on the implications of evolution
for<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.590> topic<00:02:00.369> of<00:02:00.549> human<00:02:00.909> rights<00:02:01.470> but<00:02:02.470> that

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
for the topic of human rights but that

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.600 
for the topic of human rights but that
in<00:02:03.100> itself<00:02:04.020> my<00:02:05.020> next<00:02:05.289> book<00:02:05.440> I<00:02:05.770> took<00:02:06.100> those<00:02:06.399> two

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
in itself my next book I took those two

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.309 
in itself my next book I took those two
pages<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:07.179> developed<00:02:07.630> it<00:02:07.750> into<00:02:07.869> a<00:02:08.019> paper

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
pages and developed it into a paper

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.960 
pages and developed it into a paper
which<00:02:08.619> I<00:02:08.709> realized<00:02:09.070> could<00:02:09.280> not<00:02:09.429> be<00:02:09.640> a<00:02:09.670> paper

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
which I realized could not be a paper

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.330 
which I realized could not be a paper
had<00:02:10.570> to<00:02:10.690> be<00:02:10.780> a<00:02:10.810> book<00:02:11.109> and<00:02:11.440> so<00:02:11.709> now<00:02:11.859> it's<00:02:12.070> a<00:02:12.130> book

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
had to be a book and so now it's a book

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.250

want in the jury I want people who

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.120 
want in the jury I want people who
proportion<00:03:09.840> their<00:03:10.080> belief<00:03:10.440> according<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:11.010> the

reasonable doubt that's what I want

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.370 
reasonable doubt that's what I want
that's<00:03:17.880> what<00:03:18.030> everybody<00:03:18.600> should<00:03:18.660> want<00:03:19.050> that's

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
that's what everybody should want that's

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.590 
that's what everybody should want that's
what<00:03:19.680> our<00:03:19.830> legal<00:03:20.040> system<00:03:20.610> is<00:03:20.760> based<00:03:21.060> on<00:03:21.330> and

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
what our legal system is based on and

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.860 
what our legal system is based on and
that's<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.500> way<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.800> should<00:03:22.860> be<00:03:23.160> based<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:24.660> so

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
that's the way it should be based and so

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.560 
that's the way it should be based and so
when<00:03:24.989> I<00:03:25.020> get<00:03:25.290> somebody<00:03:25.620> who<00:03:25.980> says<00:03:26.340> oh<00:03:26.670> the

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
when I get somebody who says oh the

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.330 
when I get somebody who says oh the
evidence<00:03:28.050> for<00:03:28.170> evolution<00:03:28.290> on<00:03:28.950> earth

evidence for evolution on earth

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.570 
evidence for evolution on earth
my<00:03:29.790> question<00:03:30.180> is<00:03:30.270> do<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:30.930> value<00:03:31.230> evidence<00:03:31.980> yes

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
my question is do you value evidence yes

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.449 
my question is do you value evidence yes
I<00:03:32.730> do<00:03:32.790> okay<00:03:33.330> then<00:03:33.720> why<00:03:34.410> don't<00:03:34.440> you<00:03:34.800> examine<00:03:35.370> the

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
I do okay then why don't you examine the

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.790 
I do okay then why don't you examine the
evidence<00:03:35.580> and<00:03:35.910> if<00:03:36.150> somebody<00:03:36.420> says<00:03:36.690> I<00:03:36.959> don't

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
evidence and if somebody says I don't

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.930 
evidence and if somebody says I don't
know<00:03:37.950> I<00:03:37.980> don't<00:03:38.190> care<00:03:38.340> what<00:03:38.489> evidence

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
know I don't care what evidence

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.670 
know I don't care what evidence
what's<00:03:39.390> evidence<00:03:39.780> everything's<00:03:40.380> a<00:03:40.440> matter<00:03:40.590> of

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
what's evidence everything's a matter of

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.610 
what's evidence everything's a matter of
opinion<00:03:40.950> I<00:03:41.340> just<00:03:42.330> walk<00:03:42.510> away<00:03:42.720> because<00:03:43.110> you

opinion I just walk away because you

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.380 
opinion I just walk away because you
