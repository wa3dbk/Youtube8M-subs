actually<00:01:47.000> make<00:01:47.500> and<00:01:48.640> this<00:01:49.640> Yaris<00:01:50.330> has<00:01:50.480> come

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
actually make and this Yaris has come

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.100 
actually make and this Yaris has come
out<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.020> base<00:01:51.170> it<00:01:51.350> at<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.590> same<00:01:51.770> time<00:01:51.830> and<00:01:53.110> you

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
out and base it at the same time and you

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.980 
out and base it at the same time and you
can<00:01:54.140> see<00:01:54.500> by<00:01:54.800> it<00:01:54.860> then<00:01:55.160> it's<00:01:55.310> a<00:01:55.370> bit<00:01:55.520> more

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
can see by it then it's a bit more

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.010 
can see by it then it's a bit more
focused<00:01:56.990> in<00:01:57.320> a<00:01:58.160> way<00:01:58.310> because<00:01:58.820> it's<00:01:59.150> lower<00:01:59.630> it's

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
focused in a way because it's lower it's

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.810 
focused in a way because it's lower it's
lost<00:02:00.320> that<00:02:00.560> kind<00:02:00.830> of<00:02:00.890> bubble<00:02:01.430> look<00:02:01.610> to<00:02:01.730> the

lost that kind of bubble look to the

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.030 
lost that kind of bubble look to the
whole<00:02:01.970> thing<00:02:02.210> it's<00:02:02.810> got<00:02:02.930> a<00:02:02.960> bit<00:02:03.110> more<00:02:03.260> top<00:02:03.650> look

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040
