plate auto opening piston door is the
the<00:00:16.710> smallest<00:00:17.160> one<00:00:17.369> I've<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:18.240> most<00:00:18.420> compact

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
the smallest one I've the most compact

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.859 
the smallest one I've the most compact
way<00:00:19.590> I've<00:00:19.949> found<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.340> build<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.029> there's

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
way I've found to build it and there's

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.349 
way I've found to build it and there's
no<00:00:22.080> delay<00:00:22.529> on<00:00:22.740> when<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.130> door<00:00:23.310> opens<00:00:23.730> see<00:00:24.150> you

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
no delay on when the door opens see you

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.939 
no delay on when the door opens see you
can<00:00:24.510> walk<00:00:24.750> right<00:00:25.019> through<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.500> not<00:00:25.710> have<00:00:25.830> to

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
can walk right through and not have to

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.290 
can walk right through and not have to
wait<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.400> can<00:00:26.550> even<00:00:26.670> sprint<00:00:27.119> right

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
wait and you can even sprint right

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.320 
wait and you can even sprint right
through<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.840> not<00:00:27.990> even<00:00:28.230> have<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.500> wait<00:00:28.670> so<00:00:29.670> now

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
through and not even have to wait so now

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.269 
through and not even have to wait so now
I'm<00:00:30.599> going<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.960> try<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.260> show<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:31.710> how

I'm going to try and show you this how

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.940 
I'm going to try and show you this how
to<00:00:32.340> make<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:32.940> less<00:00:33.180> than<00:00:33.360> 2mm<00:00:34.140> less<00:00:34.710> than

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
to make this in less than 2mm less than

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.770 
to make this in less than 2mm less than
10<00:00:35.280> minutes<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:35.760> pretty<00:00:36.090> much<00:00:36.210> first<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.660> all

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
10 minutes so pretty much first of all

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.869 
10 minutes so pretty much first of all
you<00:00:37.500> start<00:00:37.829> out<00:00:37.980> with<00:00:38.059> the<00:00:39.059> door<00:00:39.270> frame<00:00:39.600> and

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
you start out with the door frame and

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.119 
you start out with the door frame and
then<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.290> once<00:00:43.290> you're<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.739> door<00:00:43.950> frame

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
then you once you're in the door frame

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.410 
then you once you're in the door frame
like<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.520> place<00:00:44.789> two<00:00:45.000> pissed

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
like this place two pissed

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.229 
like this place two pissed

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
sticky pistons on the outsides place

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.250 
sticky pistons on the outsides place
stone<00:00:49.250> and<00:00:50.250> from<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.670> fifty<00:00:50.969> sticky<00:00:51.870> pistons

another<00:00:54.629> door<00:00:54.960> frame<00:00:55.289> around<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:56.210> fill<00:00:57.210> in

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
another door frame around this fill in

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.619 
another door frame around this fill in
the<00:00:57.480> roof<00:00:58.190> place<00:00:59.190> one<00:00:59.489> on<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.699> ground<00:01:00.059> next<00:01:00.449> to

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
the roof place one on the ground next to

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.049 
the roof place one on the ground next to
the<00:01:00.750> sticky<00:01:01.109> piston<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.710> one<00:01:02.550> right<00:01:02.789> on<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
the sticky piston and one right on the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.490 
the sticky piston and one right on the
backside<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.719> have<00:01:03.899> like<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.110> triangle

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
backside so you have like a triangle

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.899 
backside so you have like a triangle
shape<00:01:05.000> to<00:01:06.000> repeat<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.479> both<00:01:06.659> sides<00:01:06.930> now<00:01:07.909> here

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
shape to repeat on both sides now here

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.260 
shape to repeat on both sides now here
is<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.570> most<00:01:10.409> hard<00:01:11.280> part<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.790> think<00:01:11.850> would<00:01:12.240> be

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
is the most hard part I think would be

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.109 
is the most hard part I think would be
able<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.020> understand<00:01:13.500> first<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.610> dig<00:01:14.850> down

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
able to understand first you dig down

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.010 
able to understand first you dig down
two<00:01:16.049> blocks<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.970> here<00:01:18.320> wire<00:01:19.320> all<00:01:20.130> there<00:01:21.020> cover

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
two blocks in here wire all there cover

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.120 
two blocks in here wire all there cover
it<00:01:22.229> up<00:01:22.880> put<00:01:23.880> pressure<00:01:24.420> plate<00:01:24.780> here<00:01:25.140> here<00:01:25.590> here

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
it up put pressure plate here here here

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.749 
it up put pressure plate here here here
and<00:01:26.369> here<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.960> then<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.200> bring<00:01:29.040> wires<00:01:29.310> all

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
and here and then you bring wires all

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.569 
and here and then you bring wires all
the<00:01:30.060> way<00:01:30.180> around<00:01:30.540> up<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.890> hits<00:01:32.070> both<00:01:32.340> of

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
the way around up so it hits both of

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.749 
the way around up so it hits both of
Pistons<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.720> also<00:01:34.680> put<00:01:35.189> one<00:01:35.220> right<00:01:35.520> here

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
Pistons and also put one right here

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.210 
Pistons and also put one right here
that's<00:01:35.970> just<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.299> glitch<00:01:36.570> fixer<00:01:37.049> sometimes<00:01:37.680> it

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
that's just a glitch fixer sometimes it

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.859 
that's just a glitch fixer sometimes it
will<00:01:38.369> glitch<00:01:38.610> out<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.210> pretty<00:01:39.780> much

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
will glitch out and that pretty much

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.810 
will glitch out and that pretty much
fixes<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.950> then<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.079> dig<00:01:43.290> down

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
fixes it and then you have to dig down

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.630 
fixes it and then you have to dig down
two<00:01:44.820> or<00:01:44.850> three<00:01:45.090> blocks<00:01:45.380> till<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.590> find<00:01:47.159> where

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
two or three blocks till you find where

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.490 
two or three blocks till you find where
your<00:01:49.790> find<00:01:50.790> all<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.119> your<00:01:51.299> wires<00:01:51.780> just<00:01:52.170> like

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
your find all of your wires just like

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.980 
your find all of your wires just like
this<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.860> take<00:01:53.009> out<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.220> little<00:01:53.750> they<00:01:54.750> got<00:01:54.960> a

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
this and take out a little they got a

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.959 
this and take out a little they got a
little<00:01:55.259> room<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:56.509> then<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.750> have<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.439> find

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
little room and then you have to find

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:04.820 
little room and then you have to find
right<00:01:59.969> underneath<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.899> block<00:02:01.259> right<00:02:01.649> here

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.370 

and<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.250> think<00:02:05.820> it's<00:02:06.090> right<00:02:06.270> here<00:02:06.300> they<00:02:06.780> got<00:02:06.960> to

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
and I think it's right here they got to

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.969 
and I think it's right here they got to
like<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.030> put<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.060> piece<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.720> any<00:02:10.470> block<00:02:10.830> right

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
like that put a piece of any block right

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.220 
like that put a piece of any block right
there<00:02:11.040> a<00:02:11.370> torch<00:02:12.090> on<00:02:12.210> top<00:02:12.360> make<00:02:12.570> sure<00:02:12.600> you<00:02:12.900> hear

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
there a torch on top make sure you hear

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.130 
there a torch on top make sure you hear
the<00:02:13.860> piston<00:02:14.520> noise<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:15.180> then<00:02:15.360> wire<00:02:15.630> this<00:02:15.900> up

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
the piston noise and then wire this up

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.260 
the piston noise and then wire this up
into<00:02:16.560> there<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:16.890> this<00:02:17.160> should<00:02:17.430> be<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.880> exact

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
into there and this should be the exact

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.080 
into there and this should be the exact
same<00:02:18.390> spot<00:02:18.930> on<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.170> other<00:02:19.440> side<00:02:20.010> of<00:02:20.250> the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
same spot on the other side of the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.980 
same spot on the other side of the
piston<00:02:21.300> door<00:02:21.750> so<00:02:22.290> 1<00:02:22.830> 2<00:02:23.220> 3<00:02:23.580> take<00:02:24.510> out<00:02:24.630> that<00:02:24.780> spot

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
piston door so 1 2 3 take out that spot

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.220 
piston door so 1 2 3 take out that spot
and<00:02:25.410> put<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.430> torch<00:02:26.640> there<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:27.600> should

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
and put the torch there and this should

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.930 
and put the torch there and this should
work<00:02:28.530> completely<00:02:29.130> well<00:02:29.460> I<00:02:29.760> see<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:32.010> there<00:02:32.790> you

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
work completely well I see and there you

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.230 
work completely well I see and there you
go<00:02:33.150> there's<00:02:34.050> your<00:02:34.260> piston<00:02:35.040> door<00:02:35.490> that<00:02:35.970> works

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
go there's your piston door that works

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.580 
go there's your piston door that works
perfectly<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:37.430> will<00:02:38.430> do<00:02:38.580> one<00:02:38.820> more<00:02:38.850> look<00:02:39.120> around

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
perfectly I will do one more look around

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.140 
perfectly I will do one more look around
to<00:02:40.590> show<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:40.920> guys<00:02:41.070> one<00:02:41.220> more<00:02:41.280> time<00:02:41.370> so<00:02:41.790> sticky

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
to show you guys one more time so sticky

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.870 
to show you guys one more time so sticky
pistons<00:02:42.620> blocks<00:02:43.620> these<00:02:43.980> can<00:02:44.220> be<00:02:44.340> any<00:02:44.520> block

pistons blocks these can be any block
that<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.540> want<00:02:45.810> if<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:46.650> want<00:02:46.830> like<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.100> door

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
that you want if you want like the door

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.770 
that you want if you want like the door
colored<00:02:47.670> you<00:02:47.910> can<00:02:48.060> make<00:02:48.209> it<00:02:48.330> pink<00:02:48.570> or

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
colored you can make it pink or

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.520 
colored you can make it pink or
something<00:02:50.330> this<00:02:51.330> should<00:02:51.540> all<00:02:51.660> be<00:02:51.690> powered<00:02:52.320> now

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
something this should all be powered now

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.740 
something this should all be powered now
now<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.160> you<00:02:53.340> put<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.820> blocks<00:02:54.240> there<00:02:54.510> and

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
now that you put that blocks there and

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.480 
now that you put that blocks there and
it's<00:02:54.840> raining<00:02:57.020> there's<00:02:58.020> no<00:02:58.200> delay<00:02:58.500> because<00:02:59.370> I

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
it's raining there's no delay because I

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.740 
it's raining there's no delay because I
use<00:02:59.670> no<00:02:59.820> repeaters<00:03:00.390> in<00:03:00.660> this<00:03:01.320> design<00:03:02.750> come

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
use no repeaters in this design come

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.300 
use no repeaters in this design come
down<00:03:03.930> here<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.470> see<00:03:04.610> this<00:03:05.610> should<00:03:05.940> be<00:03:06.120> your

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
down here you see this should be your

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.979 
down here you see this should be your
what<00:03:08.310> this<00:03:08.490> is<00:03:08.730> your<00:03:09.269> pressure<00:03:09.540> plate<00:03:09.840> is

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
what this is your pressure plate is

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.259 
what this is your pressure plate is
under<00:03:10.230> this<00:03:10.380> block<00:03:10.709> this<00:03:11.040> block<00:03:11.430> this<00:03:12.209> block

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
under this block this block this block

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.479 
under this block this block this block
and<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:12.989> block<00:03:13.050> and<00:03:13.530> all<00:03:13.739> it<00:03:13.920> does<00:03:14.100> is<00:03:14.220> power

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
and this block and all it does is power

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.360 
and this block and all it does is power
this<00:03:14.700> strip<00:03:15.150> right<00:03:15.330> here<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:15.989> then<00:03:16.890> it<00:03:17.040> comes

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
this strip right here and then it comes

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.220 
this strip right here and then it comes
in<00:03:17.610> to<00:03:18.150> this<00:03:18.330> which<00:03:18.660> will<00:03:18.810> power

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
in to this which will power

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.620 
in to this which will power
actually<00:03:20.130> this<00:03:20.220> is<00:03:20.430> inverter<00:03:20.820> so<00:03:21.180> right<00:03:21.420> now

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
actually this is inverter so right now

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.380 
actually this is inverter so right now
those<00:03:22.440> blocks<00:03:22.830> above<00:03:23.220> this<00:03:23.489> will<00:03:23.760> be<00:03:23.910> powered

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
those blocks above this will be powered

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.560 
those blocks above this will be powered
but<00:03:25.050> when<00:03:25.290> this<00:03:25.560> gets<00:03:25.890> powered<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.940> will<00:03:27.150> turn

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
but when this gets powered it will turn

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.620 
but when this gets powered it will turn
all<00:03:27.840> those<00:03:27.959> blocks<00:03:28.350> off<00:03:28.650> up<00:03:29.190> there<00:03:29.630> resulting

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
all those blocks off up there resulting

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.410 
all those blocks off up there resulting
in<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.959> door<00:03:31.170> opening<00:03:31.769> that<00:03:32.640> is<00:03:32.820> pretty<00:03:33.269> much

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
in the door opening that is pretty much

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.130 
in the door opening that is pretty much
what<00:03:33.660> it<00:03:33.690> does<00:03:33.959> and<00:03:35.480> later<00:03:36.480> I<00:03:36.600> might<00:03:36.870> show<00:03:37.080> you

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
what it does and later I might show you

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.090 
what it does and later I might show you
how<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.470> make<00:03:37.769> a<00:03:38.930> switch<00:03:39.930> that<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:40.590> can<00:03:40.739> put

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
how to make a switch that you can put

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.790 
how to make a switch that you can put
anywhere<00:03:41.580> that<00:03:42.209> will<00:03:42.420> result<00:03:42.840> in<00:03:43.200> this<00:03:43.560> door

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
anywhere that will result in this door

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.250 
anywhere that will result in this door
being<00:03:43.980> able<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.370> get<00:03:44.519> locked<00:03:44.820> which<00:03:45.750> won't

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
being able to get locked which won't

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.550 
being able to get locked which won't
allow<00:03:46.769> like<00:03:47.190> cows<00:03:47.610> and<00:03:47.880> stuff<00:03:48.150> into<00:03:48.690> your<00:03:49.320> door

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
allow like cows and stuff into your door

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.140 
allow like cows and stuff into your door
but<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:49.860> only<00:03:50.010> problem<00:03:50.430> in<00:03:50.489> doing<00:03:50.610> that<00:03:50.880> is<00:03:51.000> it

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
but the only problem in doing that is it

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.270 
but the only problem in doing that is it
puts<00:03:51.450> a<00:03:51.540> delay<00:03:51.900> in<00:03:52.080> the<00:03:52.110> door<00:03:52.380> so<00:03:52.739> you<00:03:52.769> have<00:03:53.100> to

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
puts a delay in the door so you have to

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.729 
puts a delay in the door so you have to
walk<00:03:53.970> sit<00:03:54.390> wait<00:03:55.050> for<00:03:55.230> it<00:03:55.290> to<00:03:55.350> open<00:03:55.410> walk

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
walk sit wait for it to open walk

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.050 
walk sit wait for it to open walk
through<00:03:56.120> so<00:03:57.739> that<00:03:58.739> is<00:03:58.920> all<00:03:59.100> that<00:03:59.310> does<00:03:59.519> if<00:03:59.850> you

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
through so that is all that does if you

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.620 
through so that is all that does if you
think<00:04:00.360> I<00:04:00.450> talk<00:04:00.720> too<00:04:00.870> fast<00:04:01.110> I'm<00:04:01.350> sorry<00:04:01.709> I'm<00:04:02.010> I

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
think I talk too fast I'm sorry I'm I

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.470 
think I talk too fast I'm sorry I'm I
don't<00:04:03.630> know<00:04:04.100> so<00:04:05.100> let's<00:04:05.130> all<00:04:06.060> you<00:04:06.180> have<00:04:06.269> to<00:04:06.360> do

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
don't know so let's all you have to do

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.290 
don't know so let's all you have to do
to<00:04:06.630> cover<00:04:06.840> this<00:04:06.989> up<00:04:07.170> is<00:04:07.380> gold

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
to cover this up is gold

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:16.720 
to cover this up is gold
around<00:04:10.360> around<00:04:11.360> and<00:04:12.880> it<00:04:13.880> should<00:04:14.360> look<00:04:14.690> a<00:04:15.730> 159

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
around around and it should look a 159

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.650 
around around and it should look a 159
percent<00:04:17.209> exactly<00:04:17.390> the<00:04:17.840> same<00:04:18.140> as<00:04:18.350> that<00:04:18.380> other

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
percent exactly the same as that other

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:39.889 
percent exactly the same as that other
portion<00:04:20.660> over<00:04:21.260> there

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:39.899 

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:50.629 

okay<00:04:45.209> so<00:04:46.209> pretty<00:04:46.449> much<00:04:46.599> this<00:04:46.869> is<00:04:46.929> all<00:04:47.349> I<00:04:48.029> did

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
okay so pretty much this is all I did

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:55.139 
okay so pretty much this is all I did
except<00:04:51.639> this<00:04:51.789> said<00:04:51.999> looks<00:04:52.179> I<00:04:52.300> would<00:04:53.819> so<00:04:54.819> pretty

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:55.149 
except this said looks I would so pretty

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:56.639 
except this said looks I would so pretty
