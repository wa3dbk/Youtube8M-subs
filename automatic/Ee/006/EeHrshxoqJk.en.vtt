00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.870
 the cyclist 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:13.420
 manara home 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.420
 a good race yesterday 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:22.930
 everyone in this video can see 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:26.619
 how to fasten celli boots 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.300
 dottor martens 8 out with strings 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.850
 parallel 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.559
 here is that they have also returned a lot 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:37.059
 fashionable 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:42.400
 I take this opportunity to show how I can 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:46.239
 tie up Dr. Martens both so 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:49.059
 classic in a slightly more original way 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.250
 then this is so classic string 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.280
 parallels in a classic way I think 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.320
 all more or less know it is held 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.129
 string about this height that 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.800
 the right height 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:05.100
 according to me then we proceed in the way 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.100
 that 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.430
 all more or less know 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:22.040
 and this is the classic way 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:25.390
 to put private parallel strings 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:29.560
 fast because i think everyone pretty much 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.560
 they know how to do it 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.789
 I wanted 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:56.430
 that's when they will be tightened 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:02:01.039
 they will be more or less the same 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:05.549
 length and this is the first way to 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:09.300
 put the parallel strings we see the 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:14.310
 second way always using the lace 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:19.319
 yellow that contrasts well with color 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:28.860
 the red of the boot here is yes 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:35.370
 proceed in this way holding the 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:40.590
 strings at the usual usual length 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:44.010
 length then just start in 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.660
 right way then it's easy to jump 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.660
 a hole and put the next one 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.209
 this one instead puts on 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:10.910
 normally so to the hole simply 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.910
 next here instead one skips one 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:31.160
 then continue by putting the string in 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:31.160
 parallel way this other one 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.419
 the important thing is to start in the right way 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:38.470
 then we say the thing is enough 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:38.470
 automatic and here 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:03.770
 this is the second way to put the 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.770
 strings and in parallel 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.930
 this is the classic way this a while 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:16.250
 more original definitely nicer from 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:16.250
 see but perhaps more uncomfortable to tighten 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.830
 thanks to everyone at the next video
