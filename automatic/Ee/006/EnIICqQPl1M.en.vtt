00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.270 
filmmaker was able to do with silent
film<00:02:30.480> language<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.290> whole<00:02:31.500> era<00:02:31.769> of

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
film language and the whole era of

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
silent cinema we want to see what Miguel

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.690 
silent cinema we want to see what Miguel
Gomez<00:02:34.319> does<00:02:34.709> with<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:35.160> think<00:02:35.400> it's<00:02:35.489> actually

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
Gomez does with it I think it's actually

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.490 
Gomez does with it I think it's actually
a<00:02:35.879> completely<00:02:36.629> different<00:02:37.049> take<00:02:37.260> very

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
a completely different take very

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.229 
a completely different take very
interesting<00:02:38.010> take<00:02:38.220> on<00:02:38.340> bringing<00:02:39.090> the

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
interesting take on bringing the

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.000 
interesting take on bringing the
language<00:02:39.629> of<00:02:39.720> silent<00:02:40.140> movies<00:02:40.410> back<00:02:40.650> into<00:02:40.920> the

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
language of silent movies back into the

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.619 
language of silent movies back into the
present<00:02:41.489> but<00:02:41.700> it's<00:02:41.849> also<00:02:42.030> got<00:02:42.239> a<00:02:42.299> very<00:02:42.540> strong

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
present but it's also got a very strong

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.930 
present but it's also got a very strong
political<00:02:43.290> core<00:02:43.920> which<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.430> think<00:02:44.640> makes<00:02:44.790> it

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
political core which I think makes it

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.970 
political core which I think makes it
even<00:02:45.060> more<00:02:45.180> interesting<00:02:45.599> that's<00:02:45.989> taboo<00:02:46.290> by

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
even more interesting that's taboo by

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:58.650 
even more interesting that's taboo by
Miguel<00:02:47.310> Gomez

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.720
