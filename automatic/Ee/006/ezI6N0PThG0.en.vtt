bit after about 4 or 5 hours but nothing

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.740 
bit after about 4 or 5 hours but nothing
like<00:01:18.430> it<00:01:18.610> did<00:01:18.640> when<00:01:18.850> I<00:01:18.909> had<00:01:18.970> a<00:01:19.119> foundation<00:01:19.299> on

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.260 
like it did when I had a foundation on
underneath<00:01:20.080> it<00:01:20.439> is<00:01:20.650> they<00:01:21.100> cost<00:01:21.400> about<00:01:21.490> 1295

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270

of a tendency to crease I did buy this

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.220 
of a tendency to crease I did buy this
in<00:02:35.770> a<00:02:35.830> cool<00:02:36.070> month<00:02:36.370> side<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:36.880> try<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.180> then<00:02:37.360> so

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
in a cool month side to try it then so

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.470 
in a cool month side to try it then so
do<00:02:38.380> keep<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.620> in<00:02:38.770> there<00:02:39.550> don't<00:02:39.760> blast<00:02:40.060> 24

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
do keep that in there don't blast 24

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.430 
do keep that in there don't blast 24
hours<00:02:40.690> that's<00:02:40.810> for<00:02:40.990> sure<00:02:41.110> they're<00:02:41.320> not

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
hours that's for sure they're not

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.690 
hours that's for sure they're not
water-resistant<00:02:42.160> because<00:02:42.310> they<00:02:42.370> they<00:02:42.520> do

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
water-resistant because they they do

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.310 
water-resistant because they they do
sort<00:02:42.850> of<00:02:42.940> crease<00:02:43.450> off<00:02:43.630> your<00:02:43.810> face<00:02:43.960> I've<00:02:44.140> got<00:02:44.290> a

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
sort of crease off your face I've got a

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.230 
sort of crease off your face I've got a
few<00:02:44.530> colors<00:02:44.830> of<00:02:44.980> them<00:02:45.160> would<00:02:45.730> I<00:02:45.760> buy<00:02:46.060> them

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
few colors of them would I buy them

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.940 
few colors of them would I buy them
again<00:02:46.570> I<00:02:46.780> don't<00:02:46.900> know<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.260> kind<00:02:47.590> of<00:02:47.650> think<00:02:47.800> that

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
again I don't know I kind of think that

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.230 
again I don't know I kind of think that
there<00:02:48.100> are<00:02:48.190> better<00:02:48.370> products<00:02:48.790> out<00:02:48.940> there<00:02:49.120> that

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
there are better products out there that

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.390 
there are better products out there that
do<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.510> same<00:02:49.540> thing<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:50.320> so<00:02:51.070> for<00:02:51.250> that<00:02:51.340> reason

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
do the same thing and so for that reason

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.970 
do the same thing and so for that reason
I<00:02:51.670> probably<00:02:51.880> wouldn't<00:02:52.290> turn<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:53.650> one<00:02:53.770> as

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
I probably wouldn't turn to that one as

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.160 
I probably wouldn't turn to that one as
much<00:02:54.280> but<00:02:54.820> if<00:02:54.910> you<00:02:55.030> are<00:02:55.210> looking<00:02:55.690> for<00:02:55.900> like<00:02:56.140> a

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
much but if you are looking for like a

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.620 
much but if you are looking for like a
cheaper<00:02:56.590> version<00:02:57.010> of<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.790> I<00:02:58.210> should<00:02:58.540> have

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
cheaper version of a I should have

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.300 
cheaper version of a I should have
crayon<00:02:59.080> or<00:02:59.200> an<00:02:59.260> eyeshadow<00:02:59.500> base<00:02:59.830> instead<00:03:00.250> of

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
crayon or an eyeshadow base instead of

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.950 
crayon or an eyeshadow base instead of
using<00:03:00.550> like<00:03:00.670> a<00:03:00.700> Paint<00:03:01.030> Pot<00:03:01.240> all<00:03:01.450> I<00:03:01.480> make<00:03:01.810> up

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
using like a Paint Pot all I make up

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.230 
using like a Paint Pot all I make up
forever<00:03:02.320> aqua<00:03:02.650> cream<00:03:02.890> they<00:03:03.730> would<00:03:03.910> be<00:03:04.030> a<00:03:04.060> good

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
forever aqua cream they would be a good

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.700 
forever aqua cream they would be a good
alternative<00:03:04.360> if<00:03:04.930> that's<00:03:05.200> more<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.560> your

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
alternative if that's more of your

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.530 
alternative if that's more of your
budget<00:03:05.890> yeah<00:03:06.370> that's<00:03:06.790> my<00:03:06.970> thoughts<00:03:07.210> on<00:03:07.390> these

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
budget yeah that's my thoughts on these
