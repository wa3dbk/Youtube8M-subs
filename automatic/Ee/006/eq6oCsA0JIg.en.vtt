00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:07.190
 hi friends, what's up here, there's 503 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:11.059
 This is a video after 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:14.630
 in the continuation of another video that 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:18.470
 come up from a cross be we went to see 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:22.279
 the idea and I wanted to teach them more or 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.490
 less what is the perspective of how what 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.620
 I see one as a driver to this car 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:32.419
 this is how you can see there is the 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:35.840
 capo see that it looks super super nice 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:41.390
 with that picket as highlighted in the middle 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:44.829
 you can see there is the board 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:49.100
 and the helm of this car standing 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:52.950
 practically as simple as you 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:57.150
 you can see it is not 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:59.810
 the big thing true since this is a 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.810
 car of 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:08.280
 is the style of the cross being ancient 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:11.119
 pieces what can 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.860
 then it has not changed much 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.070
 when the board if it looks super super 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.490
 nice because it has a little more of 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.409
 accessory is true how it is 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.939
 like this radio that you can also 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.960
 costumes and player 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:34.310
 bring to be able to introduce the memories 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:37.850
 sd for usb to help even for 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:41.120
 can answer our phone to 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:45.250
 answer and hang 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.250
 I already use it 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.510
 a very nice experience because 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.650
 willy - nilly as we say 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.510
 let's say as well as my family as well as I 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.240
 that we live here in el salvador and so 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:05.730
 like many more people and not even 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.730
 only here in any country where you can 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.590
 the streets are very small the blocks 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.720
 they are very short the traffic is quite 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.440
 abundant 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:26.250
 and despite that the sea â€‹â€‹is crazy 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:29.640
 crazy but also worth verga then 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.980
 is a very very useful tool already 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.500
 despite that in my country it is 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.180
 forbidden to walk talking on the phone 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.070
 I imagine that in the country of you 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.860
 as well 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:44.350
 then it is a good way to 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.170
 save yourself a couple of chips really not 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.410
 they fine him as they can see the roof of 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:55.000
 this car is also pretty pretty 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:58.910
 pretty simple, see the part here 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.240
 from behind the seats 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.390
 it's very simple too and this 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:10.340
 Character is also very simple 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:13.450
 true then the doors the doors 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.910
 of the peculiar good because they have nothing 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:24.490
 nothing nothing nothing only the only thing they have 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:27.940
 of bonito, it is this, nothing more 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:32.920
 and what to open the door as you can see 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:36.400
 this the board when you give it there you can 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:40.480
 observe a little illuminated pity 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:43.900
 It's not night right now but today 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:47.970
 you can observe it a little better truth 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.610
 only the battery marks the temperature 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:56.060
 I hate the gas tank 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.060
 revolutions the how is it called this 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:04.370
 I do not remember but the mileage and this 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:08.060
 which measures the temperature of the oil but 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:11.890
 I do not know from which part nothing 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:15.760
 Remind yourself that this pickup brings 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:19.949
 engine brings the engine coster 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:24.810
 brings the engine to the 4000 engine 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:27.520
 I think of six out of six 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:31.780
 valvular 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:34.229
 six-piston online forgiveness true 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.229
 so 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:45.639
 well compared to a hi lux that 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:49.430
 I usually handle the in 2003 or 2004 is 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:52.040
 the latest model of those hi lux 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:56.180
 truth is there that model ends that 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:58.920
 is the old model 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.560
 old 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:08.490
 seeing it from the point of view that the hi 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:13.320
 lux 2013 now came out I think that of 2004 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:15.870
 or 2005 something like that then he is the model 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.590
 new now the recent in the previous 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:22.500
 a is true then you could say that 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:25.730
 the previous model is still because 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:29.640
 the new one has only changed but nonsense 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:34.970
 that is the new the previous one of that 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.970
 then less bad than what and then 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.690
 A) Yes 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:45.310
 I'm going to upload another peculiar video of 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:47.230
 as to synchronize the screen 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:51.330
 screen how can you synchronize the 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:53.789
 phone to the radio true what 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.669
 for someone who does not come because 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:58.830
 someone who does not want to read the manual 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:02.219
 truth you know that people who 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.770
 it is not and that it does not know then then only 

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:07.020
 that's why we're not going to see it either 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.689
 will discriminate us but even if 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.980
 simple how it's done but you can 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:14.430
 teach 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:17.610
 true then it's like that 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.890
 we do not have until next time and I hope they 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.950
 have liked the video do not forget to give 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.110
 like 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.960
