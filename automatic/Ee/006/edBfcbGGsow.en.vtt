00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.540
 what 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.820
 in the quiet university city of 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.950
 ohio a giant abandoned building 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.930
 It disturbs students who pass through 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.420
 there from the old hospital 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.860
 Psychiatry of rich media history 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.510
 hides horrendous crimes and their 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.789
 corridors to say be inhabited by 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.470
 strange presences that once the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.550
 they lived in search of a cure their 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.550
 tormented minds 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.250
 i 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.620
 it opened its doors in 1874 as a 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.410
 gentle mental hospital surrounded by 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.850
 gardens ponds and fountains had like 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.340
 theory that the health of patients 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.620
 could improve if they just hated from a 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.140
 beautiful stage but this changed with the 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.449
 time at the beginning of 1900 the place 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.129
 began to be assigned had to be distributed 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.809
 about 2,000 people among the 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.809
 about 500 rooms 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.570
 but that is not the only change to 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.940
 the mid - 40s the treatment of 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.280
 patients and the healing methods are 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.020
 they came back choroidal and ends are 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.360
 I used to dip in frozen water 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.850
 long periods were administered 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.290
 electric shocks or electro shocks and 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.720
 they practiced lobotomies 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.450
 in the 60 the freelan doctor instituted 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.670
 the lobotomy after hospital that consisted 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.800
 in drilling the brain through the canal 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.420
 tear with a kind of punch 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.180
 metal to destroy the receivers 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.340
 neuron in the brain often 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.250
 the patients were left with delay in 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.240
 Catholic states or die they say that 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.280
 today many of these people 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.140
 tormented wander these corridors 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.140
 prey of suffering 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.659
 but the strange phenomena cases 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.360
 paranormal began when in 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.880
 December of 78 a patient called to 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.829
 margaret chilling that used to get away and 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.810
 roam all areas of the building 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.450
 one day disappeared and all the 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.860
 Staff searched for several weeks 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.149
 when they thought he had fled it was 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.159
 found death in a pavilion that 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.110
 formerly it had been used to 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.659
 patients with infectious diseases and 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.310
 it had been closed for several years 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.010
 margaret had died of a strike 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.629
 cardiac but the curious thing about this case 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.090
 was that in the place where his 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:19.000
 body was a stain on his figure that 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.650
 nobody but never erase though some 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.989
 scholars and I think it was about 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.790
 certain fluids that the body eliminates 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.459
 when it breaks down in a sunny place 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.880
 the rumor spread that the soul of 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.880
 the young 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.900
 this belief gained strength when three 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.760
 years later a student thought she saw 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.240
 a figure in the famous room where 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.350
 Margarito died and I went to see what happened 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.090
 although he saw nothing 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.790
 days later he ran into the silhouette of 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.700
 ghost and I saw so terrified that it 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.150
 he was speechless a week later he 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.150
 he committed suicide 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.030
 many students and curious people 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.250
 They have dared to investigate this place 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.260
 with video cameras and have managed to see 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.870
 shadows and silhouettes that observe us 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.880
 from various points they think we are 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.430
 tormented patients who refuse to 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.600
 leave the place where they spent their last 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:15.260
 days you've seen that Haitian hand that you've 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.260
 seen this hand
