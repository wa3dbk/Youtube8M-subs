00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:04.770
 The winter sports are still a shock that the ice rink in Tilburg is the backdrop for it 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.810
 world championship for country teams in the highest division 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.810
 the first match played against japan 

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:14.709
 let it become more than 50 the image on the 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.470
 the pool has been there a 9 extended 2 weeks when tommie hartogs as a player 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:19.380
 is that chance 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.580
 So those Marco Postma in the first period get the penalty for two minutes 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.640
 full they think the Japanese have a man more on the ice 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.660
 last year the Japanese were third drivers in the world championship too 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.809
 in the first division but then another group than where the netherlands was 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.510
 and the score can make itself through a goal to this money earned in the German 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.750
 bundesliga at the album 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.300
 he passes oilfield Groeneveldt 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.430
 being the first of six out of ten afterwards it makes the Japanese wonder about 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.760
 matches start to predict 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.980
 the uncle of the netherlands with a little more on the ice and a good chance for that 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.070
 Stanislav Nazarov 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.600
 but the shot of calm a bit back for tilburg and with the entrepreneurs 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.269
 passport it does not go there 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.499
 it remains a lot for those Japanese than the second period not the youngest 

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:03.360
 two minutes for boarding 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.110
 the ball and Japan are in place against the boarding and so the Japanese are back 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.450
 a man more on the ice and the last but one place 3 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.480
 that is not possible if you look for it, yes, it will not be put in the way 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.240
 Find your picks from the player to the nico wise dollars 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.250
 but makes 2 0 out of the second period 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.159
 Dutch 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.150
 After all, the defender of Orange was the ex of the few opportunities that three 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.590
 but you get 3, but nothing has been scored yet 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.470
 and already at the end of the second period those Japanese are coming again 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.410
 Ajax 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.140
 they search in a scotch 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.150
 is also blocked and then they search again and there is full text every day 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.650
 through it with that 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.880
 a goal and two assists this match before she is looking for ipendo you can see here with the 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.530
 third goal for japan that falls for the Netherlands at a very unfortunate moment 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.130
 at the end of the second period 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.689
 yes the team of tommie hartogs rebellion had to have the match 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.530
 against and Lithuania in this group 5 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.150
 the duel against sweden 4 that is where the opportunities for the netherlands are found 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.150
 the match was pretty 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.170
 pretty valley houses 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.340
 well resolved 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.279
 in America 

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:11.849
 In the last part of the match the club finally goes to in a very nice 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.199
 viewing the images and the state council 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:17.059
 mh noticed that gives 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:20.249
 in the match against the strong 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:23.379
 and that was the signal for this moment at a quarter past 8 and quietly
