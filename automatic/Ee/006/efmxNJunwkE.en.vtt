00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.870
 seawater for health and life and the 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.780
 community of sea water promoters 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:10.420
 of the world in an interview more than 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.400
 special I am says the dona tucci and in 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.070
 this moment I am in communication with 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.150
 our activity doctor Maria Teresa 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.350
 hillary from nicaragua a 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.270
 recommendation that you could give to people 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.270
 that will be watching you listening 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.550
 I still drink sea water and it's someone 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.640
 that has for example many problems 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.460
 health 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.649
 Well I tell them that if they vibrate 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.260
 energetically with this information 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.570
 well for and have a little bit of fear 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.220
 so they start without telling any 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.840
 doctor because it is that if they say it to a 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.540
 doctor who is not informed of this 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.519
 issue say no no no no no poison them 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.710
 is going to paralyze the kidney and that is not 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.769
 true because I have patients with 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.890
 chronic renal failure with 14 and 15 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:02.250
 19 of creatinine when normal is 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.870
 less than 11.2 who are taking medium 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.420
 liter of seawater a day and they are 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.789
 urinating more than two liters and some of 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.070
 they no longer enter dialysis or 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:13.430
 hemodialysis or kidney transplant or 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.899
 nothing of that thanks to the sea water 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.880
 then it is not true or paralyze the 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.070
 kidney and is contraindicated for 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.440
 hypertension and for diabetes or for 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.600
 heart disease is not true because my 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.119
 internist medical practice is 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.000
 proven and I have endless 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.500
 Cured testimonials that no longer take 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.900
 drugs that show that it is not true 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.580
 then I would tell them then if you 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.080
 they vibrate with this information and they want 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.260
 do the test then start with 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.870
 sips see what happens the next day 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.520
 one more sip and little by little go 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.370
 experiencing your body and seeing the 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.650
 result yes that if they see that there is a 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.810
 positive effect because they themselves are going 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.720
 to ask and they will expand the quantities 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.410
 consumed if they are very afraid from 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.550
 quantum physics are going to bring 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:06.100
 circumstances that assure your fear 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.929
 then any reaction will fall 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.170
 product of fear truth because 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.170
 we attract what we fear we attract 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.959
 that those energies with which 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.450
 we vibrate true that's why I tell you to do 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.670
 a more subtle vibration network 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.790
 fraternal more sister speak and everything is 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.070
 will come in addition then there is no 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.810
 that force the patient look I have 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.510
 learned mostly from the new 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.370
 Germanic medicine that there are patients who 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.430
 they enter that they have consulted in some 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.460
 moment and they are told that the one that 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.070
 chemotherapy has 2% of survive 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.440
 according to the meta-analysis and studies of 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.260
 three Australian oncologists oncologists 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.960
 true 2% survival at 5 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.600
 years after taking chemotherapy and 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.340
 when it is a patient that he has 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.530
 been in contact with the information of 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.230
 the new Germanic medicine is decided to 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.980
 entering chemotherapy gives you a regret 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.290
 because you think it has 98% of 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.790
 possibilities of dying because the same 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:13.040
 scientists say from oncology 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.710
 and comparing results in australia and 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.650
 in the USA, this is survival 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:23.660
 only 2% then you have to accept 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:27.080
 you have to think that everyone his soul 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.510
 has a destiny to disincarnate 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.690
 truth and that one when he touches 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.420
 discarnate then look without realizing 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.580
 in an unconscious situations 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.470
 that are going to lead him to die true and a 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.750
 of them is chemotherapy the 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.270
 radiotherapy and many surgeries 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.240
 unnecessary for cancers that are not 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:51.490
 necessary for example the mastectomy 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.490
 eight of the cases is not necessary
