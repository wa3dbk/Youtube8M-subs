different spots are very bad they're
going<00:04:00.329> to<00:04:00.389> feel<00:04:00.540> it<00:04:00.659> running<00:04:01.049> down<00:04:01.200> their<00:04:01.469> arms

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
going to feel it running down their arms

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.970 
going to feel it running down their arms
you<00:04:03.420> simply<00:04:03.840> hold<00:04:04.310> sit<00:04:05.310> wait<00:04:06.299> take<00:04:07.230> very<00:04:07.620> deep

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
us to do the golf ball when you feel

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.289 
us to do the golf ball when you feel
this<00:04:19.799> trigger<00:04:20.099> points<00:04:20.489> release<00:04:20.820> you<00:04:21.120> can

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
this trigger points release you can

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.320 
this trigger points release you can
slowly<00:04:21.690> begin<00:04:22.049> to<00:04:22.289> lift<00:04:22.740> that<00:04:23.070> arm<00:04:23.250> which<00:04:24.180> is

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
slowly begin to lift that arm which is

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.180 
slowly begin to lift that arm which is
going<00:04:24.479> to<00:04:24.539> gently<00:04:24.810> contract<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.830> muscle

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
going to gently contract the muscle

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.939 
going to gently contract the muscle
change<00:04:26.639> the<00:04:27.060> position<00:04:27.539> this<00:04:28.470> becomes

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
change the position this becomes

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:38.680 
change the position this becomes
gradually<00:04:29.280> more<00:04:30.090> intense<00:04:31.070> and<00:04:32.070> then<00:04:32.280> slowly

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.260 

if<00:04:39.690> this<00:04:40.229> is<00:04:40.650> too<00:04:40.919> much<00:04:40.949> pressure<00:04:41.490> you<00:04:41.849> can<00:04:42.030> put

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
if this is too much pressure you can put

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.409 
if this is too much pressure you can put
a<00:04:42.300> pillow<00:04:42.630> underneath<00:04:43.320> the<00:04:43.710> arm<00:04:43.949> to<00:04:44.849> support

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
a pillow underneath the arm to support

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.629 
a pillow underneath the arm to support
it<00:04:45.539> to<00:04:46.190> be<00:04:47.190> able<00:04:47.280> to<00:04:47.460> work<00:04:47.820> on<00:04:48.090> this<00:04:49.340> you<00:04:50.340> see

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
it to be able to work on this you see

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:55.879 
it to be able to work on this you see
the<00:04:50.849> tennis<00:04:51.120> ball<00:04:51.419> a<00:04:51.750> golf<00:04:52.199> ball<00:04:52.500> or<00:04:54.889> baseball

the tennis ball a golf ball or baseball

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.629 
the tennis ball a golf ball or baseball
you<00:04:56.639> can<00:04:56.880> modify<00:04:57.409> the<00:04:58.409> pressure<00:04:58.740> that<00:04:59.430> is

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
you can modify the pressure that is

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.810 
you can modify the pressure that is
placed<00:05:00.030> here<00:05:00.300> this<00:05:01.259> area<00:05:01.620> can<00:05:02.099> become<00:05:02.460> in

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
placed here this area can become in

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:09.890 
placed here this area can become in
order<00:05:03.210> to<00:05:03.270> disorder<00:05:03.830> this<00:05:04.830> work

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:41.659 

when<00:05:10.900> I<00:05:10.949> do<00:05:11.949> all<00:05:12.310> the<00:05:12.520> time<00:05:12.729> because<00:05:30.780> my

on top of the shoulder blade lots of
people<00:06:56.220> because<00:06:57.220> there<00:07:09.389> is<00:07:10.389> much<00:07:10.750> easier<00:07:11.199> to

00:07:11.249 --> 00:07:11.259 
people because there is much easier to
