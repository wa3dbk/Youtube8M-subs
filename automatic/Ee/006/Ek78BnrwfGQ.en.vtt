00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.649 
that looks like it's going to have an
erupting<00:01:26.189> volcano<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.450> cool<00:01:27.630> thing

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.810 
erupting volcano in it the cool thing
about<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.170> map<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.439> supposed<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.340> have<00:01:29.490> lava

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
about this map is supposed to have lava

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.060 
about this map is supposed to have lava
flowing<00:01:30.360> actually<00:01:30.930> through<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.439> streets<00:01:31.799> and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
flowing actually through the streets and

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.950 
flowing actually through the streets and
that<00:01:32.369> lava<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.970> actually<00:01:33.299> kill<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.720> so

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
that lava can actually kill you so

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.780 
that lava can actually kill you so
looking<00:01:34.590> forward<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.220> looks<00:01:35.430> kind<00:01:35.759> of

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
looking forward to that it looks kind of

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.399 
looking forward to that it looks kind of
like<00:01:35.850> an<00:01:36.060> urban<00:01:36.420> setting<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.020> think<00:01:37.140> that's

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
like an urban setting so I think that's

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.990 
like an urban setting so I think that's
going<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.590> be<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> lot<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.920> fun<00:01:38.250> there's<00:01:38.729> another

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
going to be a lot of fun there's another

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.789 
going to be a lot of fun there's another
one<00:01:39.180> called<00:01:39.390> encore<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.350> looks<00:01:40.500> like<00:01:40.619> an

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
one called encore and that looks like an

one called encore and that looks like an
outdoor<00:01:40.979> amphitheater<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.150> have<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
outdoor amphitheater so you have the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.719 
outdoor amphitheater so you have the
stage<00:01:43.200> right<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.740> center<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.130> I'm<00:01:44.520> sure

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
stage right in the center of it I'm sure

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.830 
stage right in the center of it I'm sure
a<00:01:44.759> lot<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:44.970> people<00:01:45.090> are<00:01:45.329> going<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.509> be<00:01:45.600> fighting

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
a lot of people are going to be fighting

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.240 
a lot of people are going to be fighting
over<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.170> but<00:01:46.470> then<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.680> have<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.920> seating

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
over that but then you have the seating

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.590 
over that but then you have the seating
that<00:01:47.280> goes<00:01:47.579> up<00:01:47.790> around<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.210> i<00:01:48.299> don't<00:01:48.450> know<00:01:48.540> if

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
that goes up around it i don't know if

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.690 
that goes up around it i don't know if
you<00:01:48.689> can<00:01:48.810> get<00:01:48.960> up<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.380> there<00:01:49.590> but<00:01:50.100> i<00:01:50.130> imagine<00:01:50.280> if

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
you can get up in there but i imagine if

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.069 
you can get up in there but i imagine if
you<00:01:50.820> can<00:01:50.970> get<00:01:51.119> up<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.509> seating<00:01:51.899> and

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
you can get up in the seating and

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.539 
you can get up in the seating and
looking<00:01:52.500> down<00:01:52.649> that's<00:01:52.950> going<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.159> be<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.250> lot<00:01:53.490> of

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
looking down that's going to be a lot of

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.330 
looking down that's going to be a lot of
people<00:01:53.670> sniping<00:01:54.450> up<00:01:54.600> at<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.200> top<00:01:55.380> there<00:01:55.439> now

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
people sniping up at the top there now

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.560 
people sniping up at the top there now
if<00:01:56.430> you're<00:01:56.490> wondering<00:01:56.610> why<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.119> keep<00:01:57.360> pulling

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
if you're wondering why I keep pulling

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.060 
if you're wondering why I keep pulling
up<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.899> map<00:01:58.110> while<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.439> playing<00:01:58.680> back<00:01:58.860> then

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
up the map while is playing back then

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.219 
up the map while is playing back then
that's<00:01:59.640> because<00:02:00.000> obviously<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.570> hardcore<00:02:00.990> you

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
that's because obviously in hardcore you

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.480 
that's because obviously in hardcore you
know<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.409> don't<00:02:01.619> have<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.890> HUD<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.310> can't

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
know you don't have that HUD you can't

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.580 
know you don't have that HUD you can't
see<00:02:02.700> where<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.000> enemy<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.390> but<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.200> can<00:02:04.350> pull

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
see where the enemy is but you can pull

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.740 
see where the enemy is but you can pull
up<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.890> map<00:02:05.100> see<00:02:05.579> where<00:02:05.790> your<00:02:05.820> teammates<00:02:06.270> are

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
up the map see where your teammates are

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.540 
up the map see where your teammates are
where<00:02:07.079> your<00:02:07.229> teammates<00:02:07.439> are<00:02:07.799> spawning<00:02:08.220> and

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
where your teammates are spawning and

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.460 
where your teammates are spawning and
then<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.179> can<00:02:09.330> get<00:02:09.479> an<00:02:09.629> idea<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:10.050> where<00:02:10.349> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
then you can get an idea of where the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.800 
then you can get an idea of where the
enemy<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:10.860> by<00:02:11.250> where<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.700> blank<00:02:12.000> spaces<00:02:12.390> are

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
enemy is by where the blank spaces are

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.400 
enemy is by where the blank spaces are
usually

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
usually

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.660 
usually
those<00:02:13.500> spaces<00:02:13.740> are<00:02:13.980> going<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.220> be<00:02:14.280> filled<00:02:14.550> with

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
those spaces are going to be filled with

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.280 
those spaces are going to be filled with
the<00:02:14.850> enemies<00:02:15.180> that's<00:02:15.720> where<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:15.990> need<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.260> be

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
the enemies that's where you need to be

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.960 
the enemies that's where you need to be
careful<00:02:16.620> so<00:02:16.890> that's<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.340> great<00:02:17.520> tip<00:02:17.730> when

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
careful so that's a great tip when

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.010 
careful so that's a great tip when

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
interested in about that map is it's

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.050 
interested in about that map is it's
actually<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.170> map<00:02:55.380> firing<00:02:56.040> range<00:02:56.340> with<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.730> new

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
actually the map firing range with a new

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.180 
actually the map firing range with a new
skin<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:57.660> if<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:57.960> ever<00:02:58.050> played<00:02:58.320> black<00:02:58.620> ops<00:02:58.650> 1

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
skin so if you ever played black ops 1

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.730 
skin so if you ever played black ops 1
there<00:03:00.090> was<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.210> map<00:03:00.450> called<00:03:00.690> firing<00:03:01.290> range<00:03:01.530> in

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
there was a map called firing range in
