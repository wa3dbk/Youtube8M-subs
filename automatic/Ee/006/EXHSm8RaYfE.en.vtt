to<00:00:36.570> stop<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.930> think<00:00:37.140> probably<00:00:37.290> the

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
to stop and I think probably the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.400 
to stop and I think probably the
simplest<00:00:37.740> one<00:00:37.980> okay<00:00:38.310> razinin<00:00:38.760> seed<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.570> grab

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
simplest one okay razinin seed so grab

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.380 
simplest one okay razinin seed so grab
yourself<00:00:40.500> generous<00:00:41.070> handful<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.700> raisins<00:00:41.940> now

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390

as<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.600> blend<00:00:42.870> out<00:00:43.050> that's<00:00:43.290> going<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.530> be<00:00:43.590> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
as you blend out that's going to be the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.979 
as you blend out that's going to be the
sticky<00:00:43.950> part<00:00:44.190> yet<00:00:44.490> of<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.239> raisins<00:00:45.810> and

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
two different types of seeds so we've

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.300 
two different types of seeds so we've

them up till you got taste then we can

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.800 
them up till you got taste then we can
move<00:01:44.969> on

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.450 

now<00:01:52.380> once<00:01:52.560> they're<00:01:52.680> all<00:01:52.770> blended<00:01:53.040> up<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.310> get

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
now once they're all blended up you get

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.609 
now once they're all blended up you get
something<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:54.240> looks<00:01:54.510> amazing

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
something that looks amazing

something that looks amazing
ish<00:01:56.010> which<00:01:56.760> is<00:01:56.909> why<00:01:57.090> we<00:01:57.240> need<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.450> do<00:01:57.570> one<00:01:57.780> more

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
ish which is why we need to do one more

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.380 
ish which is why we need to do one more
step<00:01:58.229> just<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.830> make<00:01:59.010> them<00:01:59.159> look<00:01:59.190> better<00:02:00.060> than

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
step just to make them look better than

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.749 
step just to make them look better than
just<00:02:00.690> blitzed<00:02:01.320> up<00:02:01.470> fruit<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.040> nuts<00:02:02.220> yes<00:02:02.610> so

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
just blitzed up fruit and nuts yes so

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.359 
just blitzed up fruit and nuts yes so
this<00:02:02.970> one<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.390> our<00:02:03.930> raisin<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.680> seed<00:02:04.950> if<00:02:05.250> you

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
this one is our raisin and seed if you

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.740 
this one is our raisin and seed if you
can<00:02:05.520> just<00:02:05.670> basically<00:02:05.940> slap<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.450> into<00:02:06.600> there

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
can just basically slap that into there

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.749 
can just basically slap that into there
and<00:02:06.960> kind<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.530> press<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.950> down<00:02:08.130> basically

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
and kind of press it down basically

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.340 
and kind of press it down basically
we've<00:02:08.940> lined<00:02:09.149> any<00:02:09.450> container<00:02:09.840> with<00:02:10.140> cling

we've lined any container with cling

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.750 
we've lined any container with cling
film<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:10.619> it's<00:02:10.800> easier<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.250> get<00:02:11.340> out<00:02:11.459> later<00:02:11.640> on

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
film so it's easier to get out later on

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.729 
film so it's easier to get out later on
and<00:02:12.150> then<00:02:12.510> it's<00:02:12.750> got<00:02:12.900> two<00:02:13.110> seeds<00:02:13.380> in<00:02:13.440> there

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
that whole thing about the natural

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.090 
that whole thing about the natural
sugars<00:03:02.790> compared<00:03:03.570> to<00:03:03.810> unnatural<00:03:04.530> sugars<00:03:04.980> or

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
sugars compared to unnatural sugars or

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.590 
sugars compared to unnatural sugars or
added<00:03:05.370> sugar<00:03:05.549> is<00:03:05.670> quite<00:03:05.880> important<00:03:06.299> thing<00:03:06.480> for

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
added sugar is quite important thing for

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.140 
added sugar is quite important thing for
this<00:03:06.780> whole<00:03:07.440> snack<00:03:07.860> thing<00:03:08.130> absolutely<00:03:08.549> so

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
this whole snack thing absolutely so

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.670 
this whole snack thing absolutely so
it's<00:03:09.299> about<00:03:09.420> there<00:03:09.630> having<00:03:09.840> that<00:03:09.959> medium

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
it's about there having that medium

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.500 
it's about there having that medium
glycemic<00:03:11.400> index<00:03:11.700> okay<00:03:12.150> so<00:03:12.209> it's<00:03:12.390> like<00:03:12.480> a

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
glycemic index okay so it's like a

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.660 
glycemic index okay so it's like a
slower<00:03:12.989> release<00:03:13.470> because<00:03:14.160> of<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.370> nuts<00:03:14.549> and

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
slower release because of the nuts and

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.180 
slower release because of the nuts and

the seeds and the fruit of sugar as

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.590 
the seeds and the fruit of sugar as
opposed<00:03:17.549> as<00:03:17.700> we<00:03:17.790> just<00:03:17.940> had<00:03:18.060> like<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.360> can<00:03:18.570> of

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
opposed as we just had like a can of

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.840 
opposed as we just had like a can of
soda<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:19.170> get<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.590> shoes<00:03:19.829> sugar<00:03:20.220> spike<00:03:20.459> but

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
soda you get the shoes sugar spike but

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.610 
soda you get the shoes sugar spike but
then<00:03:20.970> you<00:03:21.060> also<00:03:21.209> get<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.870> dump<00:03:22.079> afterwards

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
then you also get the dump afterwards

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.280 
then you also get the dump afterwards
yeah<00:03:22.859> so<00:03:23.130> and<00:03:23.459> I<00:03:23.790> think<00:03:24.540> you<00:03:24.600> know<00:03:24.720> I<00:03:24.750> mean<00:03:24.989> so

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
yeah so and I think you know I mean so

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.050 
yeah so and I think you know I mean so
this<00:03:25.470> is<00:03:25.620> more<00:03:26.160> about<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.370> steady<00:03:26.670> release<00:03:26.940> of

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
this is more about a steady release of

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.920 
this is more about a steady release of
sugar<00:03:27.209> throughout<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.600> day<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.780> keep

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
sugar throughout the day to keep

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.690 
sugar throughout the day to keep
conservation<00:03:28.470> it<00:03:28.560> was<00:03:28.650> up<00:03:28.769> lovely<00:03:29.310> now<00:03:29.640> the

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
conservation it was up lovely now the

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.420 
conservation it was up lovely now the
