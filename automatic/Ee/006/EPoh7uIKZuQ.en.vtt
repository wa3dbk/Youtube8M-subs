00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
so here we have the full moon on August

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.700 
so here we have the full moon on August
twenty-ninth<00:00:09.179> this<00:00:09.780> is<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.019> full<00:00:10.320> moon<00:00:10.500> in

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
twenty-ninth this is a full moon in

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.799 
twenty-ninth this is a full moon in
Pisces<00:00:11.509> so<00:00:12.509> we<00:00:12.780> have<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.259> Sun<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:13.860> Jupiter

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
Pisces so we have the Sun and Jupiter

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.900 
Pisces so we have the Sun and Jupiter
conjunct<00:00:15.809> in<00:00:15.960> Virgo<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.130> jupiter<00:00:17.760> in

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
conjunct in Virgo this is jupiter in

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.910 
conjunct in Virgo this is jupiter in
virgo<00:00:17.940> we'll<00:00:18.539> talk<00:00:18.750> more<00:00:19.020> about<00:00:19.199> this<00:00:19.560> over

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
virgo we'll talk more about this over

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.200 
virgo we'll talk more about this over
the<00:00:19.949> next<00:00:20.070> month's<00:00:20.670> because<00:00:20.820> it's<00:00:21.000> going<00:00:21.150> to

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
the next month's because it's going to

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.300 
the next month's because it's going to
be<00:00:21.330> there<00:00:21.510> all<00:00:21.660> year<00:00:22.050> but<00:00:22.650> Jupiter<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.189> the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
be there all year but Jupiter is the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.050 
be there all year but Jupiter is the
biggest<00:00:23.670> planet<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:25.099> virgo<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.849> most

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
biggest planet and virgo is the most

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.650 
biggest planet and virgo is the most
narrowest<00:00:27.930> field<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.590> vision<00:00:29.090> so<00:00:30.090> there's<00:00:30.449> a

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
narrowest field of vision so there's a

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.990 
narrowest field of vision so there's a
Jupiter<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.560> virgos<00:00:31.949> like<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.189> very<00:00:32.489> big<00:00:32.759> thing

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
Jupiter and virgos like a very big thing

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.420 
Jupiter and virgos like a very big thing
in<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.210> very<00:00:33.390> small<00:00:33.690> place<00:00:34.020> it's<00:00:34.800> like<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> big

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
in a very small place it's like a big

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.690 
in a very small place it's like a big
opportunity<00:00:35.850> if<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.600> can<00:00:36.780> narrow<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.350> focus

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
opportunity if you can narrow in focus

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.740 
opportunity if you can narrow in focus
it's<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:39.120> some<00:00:40.850> doctor<00:00:41.850> who<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:43.160> TARDIS

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
it's in some doctor who the TARDIS

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.529 
it's in some doctor who the TARDIS
jupiter<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:45.870> virgo<00:00:46.789> you<00:00:47.789> know<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:47.940> go<00:00:48.210> into<00:00:48.390> a

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
jupiter in virgo you know you go into a

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.340 
jupiter in virgo you know you go into a
limited<00:00:48.989> place<00:00:49.230> than<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.590> have<00:00:49.739> infinite

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
limited place than you have infinite

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.529 
limited place than you have infinite
that's<00:00:52.350> that's<00:00:52.949> jupiter<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.579> virgo<00:00:53.610> but

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
that's that's jupiter in virgo but

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.350 
that's that's jupiter in virgo but
Jupiter<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.379> Sun<00:00:55.680> are<00:00:56.370> still<00:00:56.879> within<00:00:57.180> a

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
Jupiter and the Sun are still within a

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.720 
Jupiter and the Sun are still within a
few<00:00:57.510> degrees<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:58.079> being<00:00:58.289> aligned<00:00:58.649> here<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.340> at

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
few degrees of being aligned here and at

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.360 
few degrees of being aligned here and at
the<00:00:59.910> full<00:01:00.149> moon<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:01.050> full<00:01:01.350> moon<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.859> not<00:01:02.100> only

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
the full moon the full moon is not only

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.670 
the full moon the full moon is not only
opposite<00:01:03.149> Jupiter<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> Sun<00:01:03.989> but<00:01:04.500> it's

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
opposite Jupiter in the Sun but it's

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.880 
opposite Jupiter in the Sun but it's
conjunct<00:01:05.280> Neptune<00:01:05.790> as<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.900> Sun<00:01:07.290> over<00:01:07.619> the

next couple of days opposes Neptune this

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.280 
next couple of days opposes Neptune this
is<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.850> different<00:01:11.850> flavor<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.540> defines<00:01:12.960> the

meditation something happens that takes
it<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.140> next<00:01:40.229> level<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:42.079> where<00:01:43.079> we're

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
it to the next level and where we're

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.139 
it to the next level and where we're
somewhere<00:01:43.829> else<00:01:44.390> because<00:01:46.009> Neptune<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
somewhere else because Neptune is the

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.740 
somewhere else because Neptune is the
god<00:01:48.329> or<00:01:48.750> goddess<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.530> Seas<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.549> of

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
infinite space and time it's imagination

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.580 
infinite space and time it's imagination
it's<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.090> dream<00:01:57.360> time<00:01:57.890> Neptune<00:01:58.890> is

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
it's the dream time Neptune is

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.950 
it's the dream time Neptune is
everything<00:02:00.189> that's<00:02:00.369> so<00:02:00.729> real<00:02:01.030> which<00:02:01.600> is<00:02:01.780> why

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
everything that's so real which is why

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.590 
everything that's so real which is why
it's<00:02:02.140> confusing<00:02:02.710> and<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.789> moon<00:02:04.000> lined<00:02:04.359> up

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
it's confusing and the moon lined up

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.050 
it's confusing and the moon lined up
with<00:02:04.780> Neptune<00:02:05.200> as<00:02:05.350> it<00:02:05.469> does<00:02:05.649> once<00:02:05.920> a<00:02:06.130> month<00:02:06.310> can

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
with Neptune as it does once a month can

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.380 
with Neptune as it does once a month can
be<00:02:07.329> you<00:02:07.960> know<00:02:08.080> a<00:02:08.110> few<00:02:08.470> hours<00:02:08.920> of<00:02:09.280> total<00:02:09.849> escape

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390

and Jupiter are in Virgo we need to

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.090 
and Jupiter are in Virgo we need to
remember<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.209> keep<00:03:10.480> our<00:03:10.750> feet<00:03:10.930> firmly<00:03:11.650> planted

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100
