00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.670
 hi machines not 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.670
 conflict 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.360
 read on the forums you came to realize 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.970
 move closing buttons 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:29.950
 door locks and seat heating here 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:32.739
 here forward they were originally here 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:37.090
 when put the armrest crawl under 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:41.280
 It became very convenient for them so I will show you how 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.280
 I did it as I shot this tunnel 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:51.399
 because I did cut the buttons from here and 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:55.769
 put in a niche of coins which was 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:58.480
 originally here is further here is plastic 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:01.239
 to make the surface hard enough 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.950
 did not bend putty put on 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:09.220
 plastic then skins and pulled everything 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:11.770
 I studied film quite well my 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.140
 I will show the first experience as I shot 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:20.170
 how to pick up the phone how to pick up everything 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:23.259
 the rest of the handbrake film why everyone too 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.810
 did the first time as if not so difficult 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.479
 cutting wiring is not necessary here 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.320
 get the wires quite well as 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.210
 would deliberately know something of some kind 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.229
 over do not have to can everyone do well i 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.079
 made me comfortable 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.960
 that they are really deepening 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:44.829
 turned out as if I wanted to be stolen but not 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.939
 it turned out like u could so good luck to all 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.939
 I'll show you how I did it 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:55.600
 to take everything in this tunnel 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:59.970
 we need to unscrew the two screws 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:03.579
 which is right there behind 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:08.259
 turn on the terminals of the lock buttons 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:13.590
 door seat heating pull this one 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:16.209
 stub here this stub and pull off 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.209
 the tunnel is this sigh plex which 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:23.019
 is right here right here now i 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.310
 show this torture remove the cap from 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.470
 parking brake 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.880
 hook up with either a screwdriver or my 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:36.750
 another tool or easy to go 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.750
 It is mounted on such a retainer 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.359
 in order to be more convenient to shoot this 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.859
 I see this box 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:51.200
 the whole tunnel needs to be translated pen 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:53.750
 automatic gear shift 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.189
 neutral do it when off 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:01.099
 engine push this button and 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:04.790
 leading the jump to neutral 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:07.760
 get these two screws to us 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:12.109
 it is necessary to move the chair forward as much as possible 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:19.480
 and unscrew one here another ball 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:19.480
 another country further so we pull over 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:30.280
 here are the two squeaks on which 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.280
 attached here 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:39.770
 here they will do the whole thing 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.530
 rise now we need to turn off 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:48.800
 get to the cream 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:52.140
 buttons blu3 doors and while sitting 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:56.910
 we removed all this panel 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:59.880
 Well, unfasten the pads from the buttons 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.850
 hard enough therefore had to 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:07.140
 unscrew the block itself and it is easy to get it 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:10.910
 mounted on four trans screws 234 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:13.769
 access for buttons then enough 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:17.340
 easy to take out the pad 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:20.700
 this clamp is clamped and stretches on 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.860
 she herself Tuga enough ailments sit and 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.590
 pull out is very hard therefore taught 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.630
 so good is applied so 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.820
 be careful not to break 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.470
 here is this chicco clip 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:38.780
 Well, we pull out further 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.780
 cut out the stubs and glue them together
