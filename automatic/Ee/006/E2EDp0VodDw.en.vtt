that<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.700> looks<00:02:08.849> really<00:02:09.119> great<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.899> works<00:02:10.140> very

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
that it looks really great it works very

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.890 
that it looks really great it works very
well<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:12.290> one<00:02:13.290> thing<00:02:13.440> about

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
well and one thing about

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.649 
well and one thing about
is<00:02:14.019> that<00:02:14.200> when<00:02:14.349> he<00:02:14.379> rotates<00:02:15.180> its<00:02:16.180> like<00:02:16.329> that<00:02:16.360> it

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
is that when he rotates its like that it

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:17.280 
is that when he rotates its like that it
doesn't<00:02:16.810> fall<00:02:17.079> off

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
doesn't fall off

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.259 
doesn't fall off
all<00:02:17.530> right<00:02:17.650> so<00:02:17.799> every<00:02:18.340> much<00:02:18.489> stays<00:02:18.730> in<00:02:18.970> place

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
all right so every much stays in place

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.929 
all right so every much stays in place
which<00:02:19.569> really<00:02:19.780> works<00:02:19.989> really<00:02:20.140> well<00:02:20.819> so<00:02:21.819> that

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:21.939 
which really works really well so that

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.119 
which really works really well so that
that<00:02:22.209> looks<00:02:22.510> good<00:02:22.750> but<00:02:23.349> then<00:02:23.470> when<00:02:23.799> using<00:02:23.950> an

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
that looks good but then when using an

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.360 
that looks good but then when using an
iPhone<00:02:24.870> let<00:02:25.870> me<00:02:25.930> just<00:02:26.079> get<00:02:26.170> this<00:02:26.260> off<00:02:26.470> let<00:02:27.340> me

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
iPhone let me just get this off let me

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.679 
iPhone let me just get this off let me
just<00:02:27.489> get<00:02:27.700> off<00:02:27.819> the<00:02:27.939> attachment<00:02:28.480> so<00:02:28.540> I<00:02:28.569> can

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:28.689 
just get off the attachment so I can

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:32.160 
just get off the attachment so I can
show<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:28.950> it's<00:02:29.950> uh<00:02:30.120> yeah<00:02:31.120> here's<00:02:32.109> the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
show you it's uh yeah here's the

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.679 
show you it's uh yeah here's the
attachment<00:02:32.709> if<00:02:33.310> you<00:02:33.489> look<00:02:33.730> carefully<00:02:34.030> it<00:02:34.480> says

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:34.689 
attachment if you look carefully it says

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.440 
attachment if you look carefully it says
iPod<00:02:35.260> Nano<00:02:35.709> fifth<00:02:36.640> generation<00:02:37.209> but<00:02:37.329> also

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
iPod Nano fifth generation but also

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.309 
iPod Nano fifth generation but also
works<00:02:37.659> with<00:02:37.750> fourth<00:02:39.329> so<00:02:40.329> and<00:02:40.900> then<00:02:40.989> here<00:02:41.170> is

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
works with fourth so and then here is

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.110 
works with fourth so and then here is
where<00:02:41.470> you<00:02:41.560> just<00:02:41.650> attach<00:02:41.890> it<00:02:41.920> but<00:02:42.909> when<00:02:43.060> you're

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
where you just attach it but when you're

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.410 
where you just attach it but when you're
using<00:02:43.299> an<00:02:43.450> iPhone<00:02:43.650> like<00:02:44.650> this<00:02:44.829> one<00:02:45.389> you<00:02:46.389> can

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
using an iPhone like this one you can

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.740 
using an iPhone like this one you can
just<00:02:46.620> when<00:02:47.620> you<00:02:47.709> when<00:02:48.099> you<00:02:48.190> plug<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:48.519> in<00:02:48.750> let's

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
just when you when you plug it in let's

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.800 
just when you when you plug it in let's
see<00:02:49.870> let<00:02:50.470> me<00:02:50.500> put<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:50.769> in<00:02:50.829> there<00:02:50.920> there<00:02:51.810> it

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
see let me put it in there there it

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.190 
see let me put it in there there it
actually<00:02:53.709> fall<00:02:54.159> off<00:02:54.340> when<00:02:54.909> you're<00:02:55.030> using<00:02:55.239> the

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
actually fall off when you're using the

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.369 
actually fall off when you're using the
rotation<00:02:56.829> like<00:02:56.920> watch<00:02:57.540> so<00:02:58.540> it<00:02:58.659> just<00:02:58.900> falls<00:02:59.139> off

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
rotation like watch so it just falls off

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.860 
rotation like watch so it just falls off
and<00:02:59.739> that's<00:03:00.129> a<00:03:00.220> very<00:03:00.340> big<00:03:00.670> flaw<00:03:00.970> you<00:03:01.359> can't<00:03:01.599> use

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
and that's a very big flaw you can't use

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.319 
and that's a very big flaw you can't use
an<00:03:02.049> iPhone<00:03:02.470> when<00:03:03.250> using<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.639> speaker<00:03:03.879> unless

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
an iPhone when using the speaker unless

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.210 
an iPhone when using the speaker unless
you<00:03:04.629> never<00:03:04.900> want<00:03:05.109> to<00:03:05.139> rotate<00:03:05.349> it<00:03:05.680> which<00:03:05.889> is<00:03:06.159> a

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
you never want to rotate it which is a

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.280 
you never want to rotate it which is a
big<00:03:06.459> feature<00:03:06.670> because<00:03:07.120> it's<00:03:07.329> when<00:03:07.959> if<00:03:08.170> you

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
big feature because it's when if you

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.470 
big feature because it's when if you
accidentally<00:03:08.739> click<00:03:09.069> it<00:03:09.250> on<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:10.090> mount<00:03:10.299> on

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
accidentally click it on the mount on

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.170 
accidentally click it on the mount on
the<00:03:10.720> remote<00:03:11.260> I'll<00:03:11.530> show<00:03:11.680> you<00:03:11.879> see<00:03:12.879> at<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.030> top

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
the remote I'll show you see at the top

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.289 
the remote I'll show you see at the top
of<00:03:13.299> the<00:03:13.359> remote<00:03:13.599> says<00:03:14.639> rotate<00:03:15.639> you

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
of the remote says rotate you

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:17.580 
of the remote says rotate you
accidentally<00:03:16.720> pressed<00:03:16.930> that<00:03:17.109> when<00:03:17.409> you're

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
accidentally pressed that when you're

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.300 
accidentally pressed that when you're
using<00:03:17.980> this<00:03:18.190> it<00:03:18.730> falls<00:03:19.030> off<00:03:19.239> no<00:03:20.169> more<00:03:20.349> music<00:03:20.500> so

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
using this it falls off no more music so

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.000 
using this it falls off no more music so
that's<00:03:21.459> definitely<00:03:21.699> a<00:03:21.910> big<00:03:22.030> flaw<00:03:22.329> um<00:03:22.889> so<00:03:23.889> I'll

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
that's definitely a big flaw um so I'll

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.830 
that's definitely a big flaw um so I'll
go<00:03:24.250> now<00:03:24.579> through<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.060> features<00:03:25.419> of<00:03:25.449> this

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
large number um let's see it takes an

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.719 
large number um let's see it takes an
incoming<00:03:59.409> an<00:03:59.590> analog<00:04:00.069> signal<00:04:00.459> and<00:04:00.549> converts

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:00.729 
incoming an analog signal and converts

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:02.129 
incoming an analog signal and converts
it<00:04:01.120> into<00:04:01.209> a<00:04:01.359> digital<00:04:01.599> representation

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
it into a digital representation

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:05.219 
it into a digital representation
comprised<00:04:02.949> of<00:04:03.280> pulse<00:04:03.639> width<00:04:03.970> and<00:04:04.389> that<00:04:05.079> is

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:05.229 
comprised of pulse width and that is

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:08.640 
comprised of pulse width and that is
what<00:04:05.440> a<00:04:05.470> UH<00:04:05.620> a<00:04:06.099> closet<00:04:06.849> D<00:04:07.000> amplifier<00:04:07.750> means<00:04:08.019> now

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
what a UH a closet D amplifier means now
