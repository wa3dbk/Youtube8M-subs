for Joshua and the kids we knew he'd

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.520 
for Joshua and the kids we knew he'd
love<00:01:28.549> it<00:01:28.700> but<00:01:28.940> we<00:01:29.149> didn't<00:01:29.420> really<00:01:29.570> realize<00:01:30.229> he

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
I think some people feel that the Opera

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.830 
I think some people feel that the Opera
House<00:01:38.900> may<00:01:39.140> not<00:01:39.440> be<00:01:39.650> accessible<00:01:40.160> to<00:01:40.580> them

being<00:01:41.840> able<00:01:42.110> to<00:01:42.230> break<00:01:42.440> down<00:01:42.650> those<00:01:42.830> barriers

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
being able to break down those barriers

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.730 
being able to break down those barriers
and<00:01:43.640> that<00:01:43.820> stigma<00:01:44.420> means<00:01:44.810> that<00:01:45.110> people<00:01:45.410> of

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
and that stigma means that people of

I think foundations like this basically

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.250 
I think foundations like this basically
give<00:02:29.360> families<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.230> opportunity<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:31.250> pause

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
give families the opportunity to pause

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.790 
give families the opportunity to pause
time<00:02:33.260> is<00:02:33.530> precious<00:02:34.630> seeing<00:02:35.630> him<00:02:35.930> enjoying

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800
