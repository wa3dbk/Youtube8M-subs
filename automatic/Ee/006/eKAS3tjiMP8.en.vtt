to<00:04:36.180> see<00:04:36.420> you<00:04:36.870> know<00:04:36.990> what<00:04:37.110> God<00:04:37.380> could<00:04:37.590> do

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
to see you know what God could do

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.460 
to see you know what God could do
nothing<00:04:38.240> the<00:04:39.240> thing<00:04:39.450> about<00:04:39.660> the<00:04:39.900> mother's<00:04:40.170> pre

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
nothing the thing about the mother's pre

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.320 
nothing the thing about the mother's pre
was<00:04:40.740> part<00:04:41.070> naming<00:04:41.460> as<00:04:41.610> well<00:04:41.880> and<00:04:42.150> how<00:04:42.300> a

was part naming as well and how a

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.110

mother's<00:04:43.050> priest<00:04:43.380> can<00:04:43.650> change<00:04:43.950> enough<00:04:44.280> just

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
mother's priest can change enough just

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.850 
mother's priest can change enough just
brought<00:04:45.330> the<00:04:45.480> reality<00:04:45.930> of<00:04:46.050> what<00:04:46.530> happened
