okay<00:00:04.710> I'm<00:00:04.890> checking<00:00:06.830> acupuncture<00:00:07.830> points<00:00:08.280> on

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:09.180 
okay I'm checking acupuncture points on

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.890 
okay I'm checking acupuncture points on
the<00:00:09.719> horse's<00:00:10.110> body<00:00:10.760> to<00:00:11.760> tell<00:00:11.940> me<00:00:12.119> what<00:00:12.389> areas

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
the horse's body to tell me what areas

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.730 
the horse's body to tell me what areas
need<00:00:13.309> therapeutic<00:00:14.309> attention

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.710 

where<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.400> get<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.730> response<00:00:21.830> to<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.950> point

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
where I get a response to the point

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.850 
where I get a response to the point
if<00:00:25.080> there's<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:26.150> reaction<00:00:27.560> you'll<00:00:28.560> see<00:00:28.830> a

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
if there's a reaction you'll see a

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.910 
if there's a reaction you'll see a
muscle<00:00:29.190> twitch<00:00:30.350> sometimes<00:00:31.350> they'll<00:00:31.740> move

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
muscle twitch sometimes they'll move

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.610 
muscle twitch sometimes they'll move
away<00:00:32.130> from<00:00:32.310> the<00:00:32.700> pressure<00:00:36.020> you<00:00:37.020> can<00:00:37.200> see<00:00:37.440> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
away from the pressure you can see the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.400 
away from the pressure you can see the
muscles<00:00:38.040> react<00:00:38.840> to<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:39.989> point<00:00:41.870> I'm<00:00:42.870> pressing

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
muscles react to this point I'm pressing

muscles react to this point I'm pressing
very<00:00:43.590> lightly<00:00:44.540> but<00:00:45.540> you<00:00:45.660> can<00:00:45.809> see<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.110> muscles

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
very lightly but you can see the muscles

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:58.900 
very lightly but you can see the muscles
react

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.360 

not<00:00:59.480> getting<00:00:59.840> reaction<00:01:00.050> on<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:00.649> points<00:01:01.070> here

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.170 

now<00:01:09.619> here<00:01:09.890> I'm<00:01:10.040> getting<00:01:10.190> a<00:01:10.400> reaction<00:01:10.580> to<00:01:11.090> the

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
now here I'm getting a reaction to the

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.320 
now here I'm getting a reaction to the
point<00:01:12.040> you<00:01:13.040> can<00:01:13.220> see<00:01:13.460> through<00:01:13.759> the<00:01:13.880> lumbar<00:01:14.299> and

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
point you can see through the lumbar and

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.889 
point you can see through the lumbar and
the<00:01:14.570> gluteal<00:01:14.960> muscles<00:01:15.500> he's<00:01:16.220> moving<00:01:16.610> away<00:01:16.899> so

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
the gluteal muscles he's moving away so

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.020 
the gluteal muscles he's moving away so
I'm<00:01:17.990> getting<00:01:18.200> a<00:01:18.409> reaction<00:01:18.979> to<00:01:19.520> that<00:01:19.549> point

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
I'm getting a reaction to that point

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.570 
I'm getting a reaction to that point
that<00:01:20.119> there's<00:01:20.390> an<00:01:20.509> imbalance<00:01:21.399> related<00:01:22.399> to

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
that there's an imbalance related to

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.929 
that there's an imbalance related to
that<00:01:22.759> point<00:01:24.940> this<00:01:25.940> is<00:01:26.149> under<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.570> bicep

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
that point this is under the bicep

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.209 
that point this is under the bicep
sucking<00:01:29.719> here<00:01:29.960> for<00:01:30.200> any<00:01:30.350> reaction<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:30.950> the

points

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.710 

checking<00:01:35.680> points<00:01:36.040> for<00:01:36.220> the<00:01:36.310> shoulder<00:01:36.820> relate

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
checking points for the shoulder relate

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.910 
checking points for the shoulder relate
to<00:01:37.930> the<00:01:38.050> shoulder

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.950 

or<00:01:41.370> the<00:01:41.520> triangle<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.120> I<00:01:42.270> check<00:01:42.660> here<00:01:42.930> that

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
or the triangle that I check here that

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.890 
or the triangle that I check here that
tells<00:01:43.410> me<00:01:43.710> if<00:01:44.010> they're<00:01:44.480> pulling<00:01:45.480> with<00:01:45.720> that

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
tells me if they're pulling with that

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.030 
tells me if they're pulling with that
shoulder<00:01:47.030> instead<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.650> using<00:01:49.650> it<00:01:49.770> properly

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
shoulder instead of using it properly

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.190 
shoulder instead of using it properly
and<00:01:50.640> then<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.850> go<00:01:51.030> along<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.480> Meridian<00:01:51.900> along

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
and then I go along the Meridian along

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.220 
and then I go along the Meridian along
the<00:01:52.410> back<00:01:53.180> and<00:01:54.180> as<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.540> can<00:01:54.720> see<00:01:54.780> I'm<00:01:55.080> not

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
the back and as you can see I'm not

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.550 
the back and as you can see I'm not
getting<00:01:55.590> any<00:01:55.740> reaction<00:01:55.980> on<00:01:56.490> these<00:01:56.700> points

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
getting any reaction on these points

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.250 
getting any reaction on these points
then<00:01:58.560> when<00:01:58.800> I<00:01:58.830> get<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.550> this<00:02:00.330> point<00:02:00.660> behind<00:02:00.930> the

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
then when I get to this point behind the

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.720 
then when I get to this point behind the
last<00:02:01.470> rib<00:02:01.940> you<00:02:02.940> can<00:02:03.120> see<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.390> reaction

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.999 

there<00:02:07.360> and<00:02:07.660> the<00:02:07.810> muscle

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.280 

next<00:02:11.700> point<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.090> check<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.569> here<00:02:12.870> between<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
next point I check is here between the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.190 
next point I check is here between the
15th<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:13.890> 16th<00:02:14.069> rib<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:14.819> you<00:02:14.940> can<00:02:15.090> see<00:02:15.360> in<00:02:15.599> the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
15th and 16th rib and you can see in the

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.990 
15th and 16th rib and you can see in the
back<00:02:16.440> he's<00:02:16.739> reacting<00:02:17.930> to<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.050> point<00:02:20.000> with

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
back he's reacting to that point with

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.309 
back he's reacting to that point with
not<00:02:21.209> much<00:02:21.420> pressure<00:02:23.000> follow<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.270> rib<00:02:24.450> down

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.160 

this<00:02:27.920> triangle<00:02:28.370> of<00:02:28.790> points<00:02:29.329> relates<00:02:29.749> to<00:02:30.049> the

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
this triangle of points relates to the

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.539 
this triangle of points relates to the
immune<00:02:30.499> system<00:02:31.959> okay<00:02:32.959> then<00:02:33.829> we<00:02:33.950> go<00:02:33.980> back<00:02:34.280> along

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
immune system okay then we go back along

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:43.050 
immune system okay then we go back along
the<00:02:34.730> Meridian<00:02:35.180> along<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.629> back

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.240 

it's<00:02:43.360> good<00:02:43.600> through<00:02:43.840> here

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.059 

triangle<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.340> points<00:02:47.849> here<00:02:48.349> you<00:02:49.349> can<00:02:49.530> see<00:02:49.830> a

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
triangle of points here you can see a

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.270 
triangle of points here you can see a
bit<00:02:50.400> of<00:02:50.519> a<00:02:50.580> reaction<00:02:50.940> here<00:02:51.799> you<00:02:52.799> can<00:02:52.950> see<00:02:53.159> the

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
bit of a reaction here you can see the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.970 
bit of a reaction here you can see the
muscles<00:02:53.700> tense<00:02:54.150> up<00:02:56.599> so<00:02:57.599> this<00:02:57.840> triangle<00:02:58.470> of

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
muscles tense up so this triangle of

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.520 
muscles tense up so this triangle of
points<00:03:00.349> is<00:03:01.349> doctor<00:03:01.860> Keynes<00:03:02.220> in<00:03:02.750> EPM<00:03:03.750> triangle

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
points is doctor Keynes in EPM triangle

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.400 
points is doctor Keynes in EPM triangle
and<00:03:04.769> you<00:03:05.730> can<00:03:05.879> see<00:03:06.090> he<00:03:06.299> is<00:03:06.330> sensitive<00:03:06.989> on<00:03:07.200> those

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
and you can see he is sensitive on those

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.460 
and you can see he is sensitive on those
points

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.550 

when<00:03:14.470> these<00:03:14.620> points<00:03:15.190> are<00:03:15.430> reactive<00:03:16.200> then<00:03:17.200> we

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
when these points are reactive then we

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.509 
when these points are reactive then we
use<00:03:18.420> different<00:03:19.420> modalities<00:03:20.200> most<00:03:20.920> time<00:03:21.250> we

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
use different modalities most time we

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.660 
use different modalities most time we
use<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:22.000> lights<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.569> infrared<00:03:23.110> the<00:03:23.379> laser<00:03:23.670> to

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
use the lights the infrared the laser to

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.390 
use the lights the infrared the laser to
either<00:03:25.230> stimulate<00:03:26.230> these<00:03:26.440> points<00:03:27.069> to

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
either stimulate these points to

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.059 
either stimulate these points to
stimulate<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:28.060> immune<00:03:28.330> system<00:03:28.420> or<00:03:29.410> sedate

stimulate the immune system or sedate

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.680 
stimulate the immune system or sedate
these<00:03:30.700> points<00:03:31.420> which<00:03:32.760> dr.<00:03:33.760> Caine<00:03:34.060> has<00:03:34.390> taught

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
these points which dr. Caine has taught

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.789 
these points which dr. Caine has taught
us<00:03:34.720> relate<00:03:35.349> to<00:03:35.650> EPM<00:03:36.190> so<00:03:37.060> we're<00:03:37.269> using

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
us relate to EPM so we're using

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.440 
us relate to EPM so we're using
different<00:03:38.799> types<00:03:39.099> of<00:03:39.400> light<00:03:39.640> therapy<00:03:40.299> and

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
different types of light therapy and

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.860 
different types of light therapy and
lasers<00:03:40.989> to<00:03:41.650> either<00:03:41.920> stimulate<00:03:42.730> or<00:03:42.940> sedate

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
lasers to either stimulate or sedate

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.039 
lasers to either stimulate or sedate
those<00:03:44.170> points<00:03:46.080> with<00:03:47.080> therapy<00:03:47.680> with<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.610> lower

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
those points with therapy with the lower

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.800 
those points with therapy with the lower
frequencies<00:03:50.049> you<00:03:50.829> are<00:03:51.190> stimulating<00:03:52.120> points

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
frequencies you are stimulating points

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.620 
frequencies you are stimulating points
and<00:03:52.989> then<00:03:53.769> when<00:03:53.950> you<00:03:54.069> use<00:03:54.099> higher<00:03:54.630> frequencies

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
and then when you use higher frequencies

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.530 
and then when you use higher frequencies
you're<00:03:56.049> sedating<00:03:56.769> points<00:03:57.340> so<00:03:57.819> we<00:03:58.030> use<00:03:58.269> the

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
you're sedating points so we use the

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.479 
you're sedating points so we use the
higher<00:03:58.750> frequencies<00:03:59.590> on<00:03:59.829> these<00:04:00.190> type<00:04:00.459> of

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
higher frequencies on these type of

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.759 
higher frequencies on these type of
points<00:04:01.180> as<00:04:01.329> we've<00:04:01.599> been<00:04:01.750> taught<00:04:01.989> by<00:04:02.200> dr.<00:04:02.530> King

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
points as we've been taught by dr. King

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.350 
points as we've been taught by dr. King
to<00:04:04.410> sedate<00:04:05.410> these<00:04:05.739> points<00:04:06.370> so<00:04:06.880> you<00:04:06.940> use<00:04:07.329> a

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
to sedate these points so you use a

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.120 
to sedate these points so you use a
higher<00:04:07.660> frequency<00:04:08.579> to<00:04:09.579> sedate<00:04:10.360> those<00:04:10.630> points

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
higher frequency to sedate those points

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.860 
higher frequency to sedate those points

we've<00:04:18.639> checked<00:04:19.269> the<00:04:19.419> points<00:04:19.930> to<00:04:20.109> see<00:04:20.289> what

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
we've checked the points to see what

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.250 
we've checked the points to see what
