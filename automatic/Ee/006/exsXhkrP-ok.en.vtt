00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
the slider on an angle you wouldn't be

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.650 
the slider on an angle you wouldn't be
able<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.129> adjust<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.850> make<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.120> camera<00:00:39.360> low

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
so this is what having a ball head

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.900 
so this is what having a ball head
allows<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.180> do<00:00:43.040> so<00:00:44.040> as<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.219> open<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.789> up

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
allows you to do so as you open it up

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.340 
allows you to do so as you open it up
that<00:00:45.649> much<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:46.890> at<00:00:47.039> all<00:00:48.200> air<00:00:49.200> bags<00:00:49.500> here<00:00:50.039> and

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
that much to it at all air bags here and

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:58.610 
that much to it at all air bags here and
just<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.500> head<00:00:52.710> itself<00:00:55.370> okay<00:00:56.870> so<00:00:57.870> let's<00:00:58.379> go

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
just the head itself okay so let's go

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.970 
just the head itself okay so let's go
ahead<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.039> open<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.640> up<00:01:00.559> you<00:01:01.559> see<00:01:01.739> on<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
ahead and open this up you see on the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.780 
ahead and open this up you see on the
box<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.430> really<00:01:03.019> nothing<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.320> at<00:01:04.350> all<00:01:04.790> just

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
box is really nothing to it at all just

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.750 
box is really nothing to it at all just
the<00:01:05.880> company<00:01:06.750> name<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.380> then<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.619> have<00:01:07.799> 494

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
the company name and then you have 494

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:20.969 
the company name and then you have 494
RC<00:01:09.270> 2<00:01:09.510> mini<00:01:10.200> ball<00:01:10.500> head

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.249 

so<00:01:21.979> next<00:01:22.250> you<00:01:22.490> have<00:01:22.700> a<00:01:23.000> bag<00:01:23.420> and<00:01:24.049> there's

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
so next you have a bag and there's

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:25.920 
so next you have a bag and there's

so that's inside and you have just the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.550 
so that's inside and you have just the
head<00:01:30.710> itself<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:31.789> a<00:01:32.119> little<00:01:32.560> instruction

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.880 
head itself and a little instruction
manual<00:01:33.860> here<00:01:35.259> I'm<00:01:36.259> sure<00:01:36.469> there<00:01:36.619> won't<00:01:36.740> be

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
manual here I'm sure there won't be

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.889

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
in any position like I mentioned before

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.380 
in any position like I mentioned before
which<00:02:23.780> is<00:02:23.810> why<00:02:24.500> we<00:02:24.950> specifically<00:02:25.459> wanted<00:02:26.269> a

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
which is why we specifically wanted a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.319 
which is why we specifically wanted a
ball<00:02:26.540> head<00:02:26.780> mount<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:28.400> use<00:02:28.579> with<00:02:28.790> our<00:02:28.910> slider

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
ball head mount to use with our slider

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.930 
ball head mount to use with our slider

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
it also has a really cool quick-release

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.349 
it also has a really cool quick-release
plate<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.569> it<00:02:32.750> it's<00:02:33.140> kind<00:02:33.530> of<00:02:33.680> a<00:02:34.359> childproof

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:35.359 
plate to it it's kind of a childproof

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:37.150 
plate to it it's kind of a childproof
innocence<00:02:36.019> so<00:02:36.260> let's<00:02:36.680> say<00:02:36.799> you<00:02:36.889> have<00:02:37.040> your

camera on here and you accidentally hit

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.740 
camera on here and you accidentally hit
this<00:02:39.440> it<00:02:39.739> won't<00:02:40.040> come<00:02:40.670> off<00:02:40.700> you<00:02:41.540> need<00:02:41.690> to

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
this it won't come off you need to

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.500 
this it won't come off you need to
actually<00:02:41.989> hit<00:02:42.350> this<00:02:43.100> and<00:02:43.459> this<00:02:43.940> other<00:02:44.239> little

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
actually hit this and this other little

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.440 
actually hit this and this other little
lever<00:02:44.810> down<00:02:45.019> here<00:02:45.380> to<00:02:46.310> release<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.209> plate

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
lever down here to release the plate

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.349 
lever down here to release the plate
it's<00:02:47.930> like<00:02:48.109> that<00:02:48.730> another<00:02:49.730> cool<00:02:49.940> thing<00:02:49.970> is

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
it's like that another cool thing is

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.199 
it's like that another cool thing is
when<00:02:50.959> you<00:02:51.049> have<00:02:51.160> this<00:02:52.160> opened<00:02:52.700> up<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:53.030> lock

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
when you have this opened up and lock

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.569 
when you have this opened up and lock
like<00:02:53.480> that<00:02:53.720> when<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:54.769> put<00:02:54.980> put<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.340> plate

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
like that when you put put the plate

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.729 
like that when you put put the plate
back<00:02:55.760> in<00:02:56.000> there<00:02:56.209> you<00:02:56.239> can<00:02:56.540> literally<00:02:57.200> snap<00:02:57.530> it

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
back in there you can literally snap it

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.190 
back in there you can literally snap it
back<00:02:58.250> in<00:02:58.489> and<00:02:58.670> you<00:02:58.730> know<00:02:58.880> it's<00:02:59.090> secure<00:02:59.720> and<00:02:59.930> not

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
back in and you know it's secure and not

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.670 
back in and you know it's secure and not
hugging<00:03:00.700> anywhere<00:03:01.700> at<00:03:01.819> all<00:03:01.880> pretty<00:03:02.269> much<00:03:02.680> you

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
hugging anywhere at all pretty much you

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.509 
hugging anywhere at all pretty much you
also<00:03:03.889> have<00:03:04.250> two<00:03:04.700> different<00:03:05.569> types<00:03:06.319> of<00:03:06.650> ways<00:03:07.190> to

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
also have two different types of ways to

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.720 
also have two different types of ways to
lock<00:03:07.819> the<00:03:08.030> actual<00:03:08.450> ball<00:03:08.630> head<00:03:08.900> itself<00:03:09.730> this

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
lock the actual ball head itself this

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.840 
lock the actual ball head itself this
not<00:03:10.970> appears<00:03:11.329> for<00:03:11.660> friction<00:03:11.930> so<00:03:12.530> this

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
not appears for friction so this

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.670 
not appears for friction so this
determines<00:03:13.850> you<00:03:14.150> know<00:03:14.180> how<00:03:14.510> hard<00:03:15.079> or<00:03:15.260> easy<00:03:15.440> it

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
determines you know how hard or easy it

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.490 
determines you know how hard or easy it
is<00:03:15.769> to<00:03:15.950> move<00:03:16.239> once<00:03:17.239> you've<00:03:17.420> unlocked<00:03:17.690> it<00:03:18.200> here

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
is to move once you've unlocked it here

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.470 
is to move once you've unlocked it here
and<00:03:18.739> this<00:03:18.920> is<00:03:19.099> the<00:03:19.250> locking<00:03:19.639> plate<00:03:19.819> and<00:03:20.239> then

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
and this is the locking plate and then

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.330 
and this is the locking plate and then
this<00:03:20.660> also<00:03:21.079> has<00:03:21.290> a<00:03:21.790> you<00:03:22.790> know<00:03:22.910> moveable

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
this also has a you know moveable

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.589 
this also has a you know moveable
position<00:03:25.340> to<00:03:25.670> it<00:03:25.849> so<00:03:26.000> if<00:03:26.090> you<00:03:26.180> don't<00:03:26.269> want<00:03:26.510> it

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
position to it so if you don't want it

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:27.140 
position to it so if you don't want it
in<00:03:26.690> this

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
in this

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.789 
in this
you<00:03:27.239> can<00:03:27.360> just<00:03:27.510> move<00:03:27.599> it<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:28.079> this<00:03:28.200> position<00:03:28.379> to

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
you can just move it to this position to

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.170 
you can just move it to this position to
be<00:03:28.980> more<00:03:29.939> out-of-the-way<00:03:31.579> so<00:03:32.579> yeah<00:03:32.730> it<00:03:32.939> pretty

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
be more out-of-the-way so yeah it pretty

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.399 
be more out-of-the-way so yeah it pretty
much<00:03:33.299> wraps<00:03:33.900> up<00:03:34.939> this<00:03:35.939> unboxing<00:03:36.180> we<00:03:36.900> also<00:03:37.079> much

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 
much wraps up this unboxing we also much

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.640 
much wraps up this unboxing we also much
must<00:03:37.860> mention<00:03:38.129> that<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:39.180> bottom<00:03:39.900> mount<00:03:40.349> here

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
must mention that the bottom mount here

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.569 
must mention that the bottom mount here
is<00:03:40.799> a<00:03:40.829> three-eighths<00:03:41.519> amount<00:03:43.129> so<00:03:44.129> if<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.370> have

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
is a three-eighths amount so if you have

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:45.649 
is a three-eighths amount so if you have
a<00:03:44.939> slider

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
a slider

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.899 
a slider
once<00:03:46.230> again<00:03:46.379> the<00:03:46.620> konova<00:03:46.950> k2<00:03:46.980> slider<00:03:47.489> which<00:03:47.790> we

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
once again the konova k2 slider which we

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.360 
once again the konova k2 slider which we
just<00:03:48.120> got<00:03:48.329> the<00:03:49.140> mounting<00:03:49.739> plate<00:03:49.950> for<00:03:49.980> that<00:03:50.250> as

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
just got the mounting plate for that as

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.880 
just got the mounting plate for that as
a<00:03:50.400> three-eighths<00:03:51.140> mounting<00:03:52.140> plate<00:03:52.349> so<00:03:52.620> that

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
a three-eighths mounting plate so that

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.099 
a three-eighths mounting plate so that
will<00:03:53.730> go<00:03:53.819> right<00:03:54.030> on<00:03:54.150> top<00:03:54.269> of<00:03:54.450> that<00:03:54.569> like<00:03:54.840> that

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
will go right on top of that like that

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.470 
will go right on top of that like that
and<00:03:55.439> then<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.739> camera<00:03:56.159> will<00:03:56.400> attach<00:03:56.849> here<00:03:57.150> so

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
and then the camera will attach here so

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.440 
and then the camera will attach here so
it's<00:03:58.140> gonna<00:03:58.230> be<00:03:58.409> very<00:03:58.650> very<00:03:58.950> very<00:03:59.220> nice<00:03:59.609> of<00:04:00.000> a
