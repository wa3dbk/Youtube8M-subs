00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.980
 Creative projects were sought at this year's anti-atom school competition 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.120
 which develop the entire nuclear production cycle of 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.029
 Atomic 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:18.980
 the EU can deal with dismantling priesthood storage or parts thereof 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.480
 to treat 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.869
 enthusiastically congratulated representatives of domestic politics d-youth meaningful and 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.779
 was pleased with the great commitment and interest in the anti-nuclear demo 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.339
 Optics we are very big of the source 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.530
 it is about the future of our children both the climate protection and the 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.250
 Protection against nuclear energy 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.760
 and that's why it's important that the kids learn what it's all about 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.820
 Formations get and the school projects in the context of this 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.320
 Learning to compete and what can I do about it and how can I do it 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.150
 bring 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.950
 it's about children learning how to shape their own future 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.150
 can and are such great projects 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.810
 I'm not worried about the future 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.740
 the child is very clear before the Dutchman complained Linda s 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.080
 whoever passed by for the idea itself, the parade becomes the student 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.070
 Even the upper hand BZ feel the activists all the years you have only 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.410
 always the energy AG moves from the adolescent the popular stood St 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.660
 the title of the project excited 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.970
 with the song Satellite the competition is running after 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.490
 be complained of close friends with whom he participated in the narrow anti-nuclear movement 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.660
 and, accordingly, this will be on this project 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.330
 whether the young people ask 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.590
 their ideas 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.680
 ran 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.200
 show and 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.460
 What sounds great to me that is still getting noticed is that they too 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.630
 have the opportunity 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.759
 to present the projects and the middle of the school with them 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.830
 so the young people do not value their money 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.630
 So we get really great 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.170
 The Anti Atom School competition was with a stake of around 1600 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.270

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.130
 a pure he deep pleasure in that 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.009
 so many young people have dealt so intensively with the topic 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.220

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.880
 Hann the projects have all become totally awesome and what they now easy 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.050
 They were very motivated in the matter they were very motivated 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.790
 intense way with the entire nuclear production cycle 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.690
 apart from the uranium mining the devastating consequences of it 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.490
 for humans animal and environment up to still unresolved 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.429

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:31.039
 and what I really liked is that she likes it a lot 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:33.169
 have made constructive 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:37.699

 must go about it then has to create the students themselves 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:55.199
 asks what they take on responsibility other than to develop ideas for 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:58.739
 Projects but a lot of protest but coach wet I am now that 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.089

 have staged their film protests cheerful and colorful and creative 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.019
 So that's our approach to the projects 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.269
 Private investors were important constructive to meaningful climate protection measures too 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:14.730

 Waas the backgrounds numbers from the current situation why is there such a thing 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.319
 Anyway, it has a lot to do with the power of Azure 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.449
 what is behind it and how can it be better? 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:47.069
