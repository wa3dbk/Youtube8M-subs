00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
then I might go away bit for like just

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.360 
then I might go away bit for like just
15<00:00:58.570> seconds<00:00:59.199> just<00:00:59.230> to<00:00:59.499> get<00:00:59.649> the<00:00:59.769> peel<00:01:00.010> soft

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
15 seconds just to get the peel soft

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.250 
15 seconds just to get the peel soft
just<00:01:00.699> to<00:01:00.789> see<00:01:00.969> you<00:01:01.629> know<00:01:01.690> cuz<00:01:01.870> it<00:01:01.960> was<00:01:02.079> pretty

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
just to see you know cuz it was pretty

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.470 
just to see you know cuz it was pretty
hard<00:01:02.589> just<00:01:02.890> to<00:01:02.980> see<00:01:03.100> how<00:01:03.249> I<00:01:03.280> would<00:01:03.460> peel<00:01:03.940> it<00:01:04.150> and

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:04.480 
hard just to see how I would peel it and

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.780 
hard just to see how I would peel it and
it<00:01:05.019> got<00:01:05.170> really<00:01:05.350> really<00:01:05.710> soft<00:01:05.950> but<00:01:06.100> 20<00:01:06.430> seconds

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
it got really really soft but 20 seconds

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.650 
it got really really soft but 20 seconds
so<00:01:06.850> I<00:01:06.909> think<00:01:07.210> I'm<00:01:07.930> gonna<00:01:08.110> throw<00:01:08.230> this<00:01:08.590> out<00:01:08.800> and

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
so I think I'm gonna throw this out and

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.420 
so I think I'm gonna throw this out and
microwave<00:01:10.660> this<00:01:10.990> one<00:01:11.200> for<00:01:11.470> about<00:01:11.590> just<00:01:12.160> 10

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
microwave this one for about just 10

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.790 
microwave this one for about just 10
seconds<00:01:12.940> just<00:01:13.690> so<00:01:13.780> I<00:01:13.870> can<00:01:14.080> feel<00:01:14.320> it<00:01:14.500> and<00:01:14.650> then

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
seconds just so I can feel it and then

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.230 
seconds just so I can feel it and then
put<00:01:15.010> it<00:01:15.130> into<00:01:15.460> the<00:01:15.990> Vitamix<00:01:17.520> then<00:01:18.520> it<00:01:18.880> calls

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
put it into the Vitamix then it calls

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.030 
put it into the Vitamix then it calls
for<00:01:20.220> half<00:01:21.220> a<00:01:21.400> cup<00:01:21.640> of<00:01:21.820> fresh<00:01:22.170> spinach<00:01:23.170> which<00:01:23.770> I
