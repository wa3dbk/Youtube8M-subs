00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
kind of screwed me around a little bit

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.270 
kind of screwed me around a little bit
was<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:06.979> holes<00:01:07.220> for<00:01:07.850> where<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.210> doors<00:01:08.479> go

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
was the holes for where the doors go

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.280 
was the holes for where the doors go
there's<00:01:10.280> one<00:01:10.340> there<00:01:12.729> and<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:14.390> other<00:01:14.540> panel<00:01:15.140> is

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
there's one there and the other panel is

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.670 
there's one there and the other panel is
exactly<00:01:15.979> the<00:01:16.220> same<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:16.970> it<00:01:17.960> tells<00:01:18.200> you<00:01:18.470> in<00:01:18.560> the

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
exactly the same and it tells you in the

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.590 
exactly the same and it tells you in the
manual<00:01:18.710> to<00:01:19.280> flip<00:01:19.880> it<00:01:20.409> 180<00:01:21.409> degrees<00:01:22.130> if<00:01:22.670> the

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
manual to flip it 180 degrees if the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.100 
manual to flip it 180 degrees if the
hole<00:01:23.810> doesn't<00:01:24.440> line<00:01:24.950> up<00:01:25.220> right<00:01:25.810> well<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:26.900> hole

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
hole doesn't line up right well the hole

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.140 
hole doesn't line up right well the hole
in<00:01:27.320> this<00:01:27.440> other<00:01:27.680> panel<00:01:28.010> ended<00:01:28.490> up<00:01:28.640> at<00:01:28.880> the

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
in this other panel ended up at the

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.740 
in this other panel ended up at the
other<00:01:29.360> end<00:01:30.610> which<00:01:31.610> kind<00:01:31.880> of<00:01:32.030> threw<00:01:32.240> me<00:01:32.299> for<00:01:32.479> a

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
other end which kind of threw me for a

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.800 
other end which kind of threw me for a
loop

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
loop

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.469 
loop
so<00:01:35.810> I<00:01:36.250> kind<00:01:37.250> of<00:01:37.340> got<00:01:37.460> excited<00:01:37.969> there<00:01:38.210> thought

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
so I kind of got excited there thought

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.830 
so I kind of got excited there thought
they<00:01:38.659> sent<00:01:38.869> me<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.049> wrong<00:01:39.079> panel<00:01:40.570> but<00:01:41.570> the

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
they sent me the wrong panel but the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.990 
they sent me the wrong panel but the
wife<00:01:42.229> actually<00:01:42.740> figured<00:01:43.070> today<00:01:43.219> when<00:01:43.700> you<00:01:43.820> do

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
wife actually figured today when you do

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.749 
wife actually figured today when you do
flip<00:01:44.450> it<00:01:44.570> 180<00:01:44.930> degrees<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.829> hole<00:01:46.070> is<00:01:46.399> a<00:01:46.460> little

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
flip it 180 degrees the hole is a little

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.490 
flip it 180 degrees the hole is a little
different<00:01:47.450> your<00:01:48.140> hole<00:01:48.969> here<00:01:49.969> is<00:01:50.320> actually<00:01:51.320> in

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
different your hole here is actually in

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.819 
different your hole here is actually in
a<00:01:51.649> slot<00:01:52.100> and<00:01:52.490> it's<00:01:52.640> rounded<00:01:53.149> right<00:01:53.390> here<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:54.710> I

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
a slot and it's rounded right here and I

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.260 
a slot and it's rounded right here and I
never<00:01:55.130> noticed<00:01:55.609> that<00:01:55.700> so<00:01:56.390> that's<00:01:56.600> just<00:01:56.840> maybe

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
never noticed that so that's just maybe

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.399 
never noticed that so that's just maybe
something<00:01:59.270> you'd<00:01:59.420> want<00:01:59.630> to<00:01:59.719> take<00:01:59.899> note<00:02:00.140> of<00:02:02.409> but

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
something you'd want to take note of but

after we got that figured out we were
pretty<00:02:06.079> much<00:02:06.200> pretty<00:02:06.799> good<00:02:06.950> to<00:02:07.039> go<00:02:08.289> anyway<00:02:09.289> I'm

very<00:02:51.190> good<00:02:51.520> I<00:02:51.550> can't<00:02:51.970> really<00:02:52.210> get<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.480> screw<00:02:52.930> in

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
very good I can't really get a screw in

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.270 
very good I can't really get a screw in
that<00:02:53.310> so<00:02:54.310> I'm<00:02:54.430> going<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.700> have<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:55.710> I'm<00:02:56.710> just

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
that so I'm going to have to I'm just

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.070 
that so I'm going to have to I'm just
going<00:02:57.460> to<00:02:57.490> drill<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.790> little<00:02:58.090> pilot<00:02:58.330> hole<00:02:58.570> it

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
going to drill a little pilot hole it

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.270 
going to drill a little pilot hole it
was<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.350> same<00:02:59.590> on<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.890> other<00:02:59.920> side<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.980> two

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
was the same on the other side the two

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.700 
was the same on the other side the two
bottom<00:03:03.730> ones<00:03:03.760> lined<00:03:04.120> up<00:03:04.330> perfect<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:05.350> center

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
bottom ones lined up perfect the center

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.220 
bottom ones lined up perfect the center
one<00:03:05.920> was<00:03:06.220> off<00:03:06.400> I<00:03:06.700> just<00:03:06.940> kind<00:03:07.180> of<00:03:07.300> wedged<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:08.110> in

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
one was off I just kind of wedged it in

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.500 
one was off I just kind of wedged it in
there<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.590> twisted<00:03:08.980> it<00:03:09.100> in<00:03:09.250> but<00:03:10.000> these<00:03:10.180> top

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
there and twisted it in but these top

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.960 
there and twisted it in but these top
ones<00:03:10.870> I<00:03:11.170> don't<00:03:11.230> think<00:03:11.980> I<00:03:12.100> can<00:03:12.280> do<00:03:12.490> that<00:03:12.520> there's

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
ones I don't think I can do that there's

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.790 
ones I don't think I can do that there's
really<00:03:13.210> not<00:03:13.480> enough<00:03:13.810> room<00:03:14.080> there<00:03:15.510> so<00:03:16.560> I'm<00:03:17.560> just

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
really not enough room there so I'm just

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.760 
really not enough room there so I'm just
going<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:17.980> drill<00:03:18.220> a<00:03:18.250> little<00:03:18.490> pilot<00:03:18.700> hole<00:03:19.000> and

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
going to drill a little pilot hole and

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.790 
going to drill a little pilot hole and
put<00:03:20.770> the<00:03:20.890> screws<00:03:21.190> in<00:03:21.220> there<00:03:21.670> but<00:03:22.470> other<00:03:23.470> than

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
put the screws in there but other than

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.000 
put the screws in there but other than
that<00:03:24.010> everything<00:03:24.580> went<00:03:24.730> pretty<00:03:24.940> good<00:03:25.240> so<00:03:25.540> far

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
that everything went pretty good so far

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.960 
that everything went pretty good so far
and<00:03:27.010> we'll<00:03:27.940> keep<00:03:28.180> you<00:03:28.240> posted<00:03:29.490> okay<00:03:30.490> here<00:03:30.850> it

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
and we'll keep you posted okay here it

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.570 
and we'll keep you posted okay here it
is<00:03:31.620> it's<00:03:32.620> roughly<00:03:33.180> around<00:03:34.180> 2<00:03:34.630> o'clock<00:03:35.430> so<00:03:36.430> it

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
is it's roughly around 2 o'clock so it

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.800 
is it's roughly around 2 o'clock so it
pretty<00:03:36.790> much<00:03:36.970> took<00:03:37.210> me<00:03:37.390> all<00:03:37.570> day<00:03:37.600> to<00:03:38.500> do<00:03:38.620> this

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
pretty much took me all day to do this

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.870 
pretty much took me all day to do this
it<00:03:40.810> turned<00:03:41.080> it<00:03:41.260> fairly<00:03:41.620> well<00:03:41.980> I<00:03:42.250> guess<00:03:42.550> there's

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
it turned it fairly well I guess there's

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.270 
it turned it fairly well I guess there's
a<00:03:43.030> I<00:03:43.360> have<00:03:44.170> a<00:03:44.200> few<00:03:44.500> complaints<00:03:44.800> but<00:03:45.040> nothing

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
a I have a few complaints but nothing

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.160 
a I have a few complaints but nothing
serious<00:03:45.520> as<00:03:45.880> you<00:03:46.000> can<00:03:46.150> see<00:03:46.390> the<00:03:46.600> doors<00:03:46.840> don't

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
serious as you can see the doors don't

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.950 
serious as you can see the doors don't
line<00:03:47.470> up<00:03:48.150> I've<00:03:49.150> played<00:03:49.540> with<00:03:49.720> them<00:03:49.930> for

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:49.960 
line up I've played with them for

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.810 
line up I've played with them for
probably<00:03:50.440> half<00:03:50.710> an<00:03:50.890> hour<00:03:51.040> and<00:03:51.310> I<00:03:51.370> can't<00:03:51.640> get

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
probably half an hour and I can't get

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.400 
probably half an hour and I can't get
them<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.120> line<00:03:52.300> up<00:03:52.480> at<00:03:52.600> all<00:03:52.750> I<00:03:52.780> don't<00:03:53.200> know

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
them the line up at all I don't know

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.950 
them the line up at all I don't know
it's<00:03:53.950> just<00:03:54.100> the<00:03:54.310> plastics<00:03:54.850> warped<00:03:55.360> or<00:03:55.540> what<00:03:55.840> it

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
it's just the plastics warped or what it

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.900 
it's just the plastics warped or what it
is<00:03:55.990> but<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:59.410> guess<00:03:59.950> I'll<00:04:00.160> have<00:04:00.400> to<00:04:00.550> figure

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
is but I guess I'll have to figure

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.600 
is but I guess I'll have to figure
something<00:04:00.940> out<00:04:01.330> there<00:04:01.690> I<00:04:02.190> don't<00:04:03.190> want<00:04:03.340> snow

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
something out there I don't want snow

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.180 
something out there I don't want snow
getting<00:04:03.880> in<00:04:04.090> there<00:04:04.330> of<00:04:04.480> course<00:04:05.190> figure

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
getting in there of course figure

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.090 
getting in there of course figure
something<00:04:06.610> out<00:04:06.790> Oh

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.510 

other<00:04:09.850> than<00:04:10.090> that<00:04:10.300> I<00:04:10.600> had<00:04:10.780> a<00:04:10.810> couple<00:04:11.680> of<00:04:11.980> stuff

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
other than that I had a couple of stuff

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:20.640 
other than that I had a couple of stuff
left<00:04:13.510> over<00:04:13.750> I<00:04:18.450> found<00:04:19.450> the<00:04:19.630> biggest<00:04:19.810> problem

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
left over I found the biggest problem

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.410 
left over I found the biggest problem
with<00:04:20.770> this<00:04:20.950> thing<00:04:21.190> is<00:04:21.400> definitely<00:04:21.970> the<00:04:22.060> roof

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.390 

it's<00:04:25.420> quite<00:04:25.840> a<00:04:25.870> job<00:04:26.170> that<00:04:26.470> swept<00:04:26.800> off<00:04:26.950> most<00:04:27.220> of

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
it's quite a job that swept off most of

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.900 
it's quite a job that swept off most of
the<00:04:27.490> time<00:04:29.700> a<00:04:31.620> couple<00:04:32.620> if<00:04:32.860> I<00:04:32.980> did<00:04:33.160> it<00:04:33.250> myself<00:04:33.400> if

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
the time a couple if I did it myself if

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.370 
the time a couple if I did it myself if
you<00:04:33.940> had<00:04:34.150> a<00:04:34.180> couple<00:04:34.480> of<00:04:34.690> people<00:04:34.870> it<00:04:35.200> wouldn't

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
you had a couple of people it wouldn't

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.860 
you had a couple of people it wouldn't
be<00:04:35.500> too<00:04:35.680> bad<00:04:35.710> I<00:04:35.920> guess<00:04:36.370> but<00:04:37.300> it's<00:04:37.450> quite<00:04:37.600> a<00:04:37.630> job

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
be too bad I guess but it's quite a job

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.110 
be too bad I guess but it's quite a job
when<00:04:38.110> you<00:04:38.170> try<00:04:38.290> to<00:04:38.350> do<00:04:38.500> it<00:04:38.650> yourself<00:04:39.070> there's<00:04:40.060> a

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
when you try to do it yourself there's a

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.120 
when you try to do it yourself there's a
couple<00:04:40.330> of<00:04:40.540> things<00:04:40.720> I<00:04:40.870> didn't<00:04:41.140> like<00:04:41.170> as<00:04:41.950> you

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
couple of things I didn't like as you

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.860 
couple of things I didn't like as you
can<00:04:42.280> see<00:04:42.550> right<00:04:42.760> up<00:04:42.970> here<00:04:43.240> in<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.450> corner<00:04:43.660> of

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
can see right up here in the corner of

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:44.040 
can see right up here in the corner of
the

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
the

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.689 
the
doors<00:04:44.259> I<00:04:44.440> got<00:04:44.590> quite<00:04:44.800> a<00:04:44.830> gap<00:04:45.129> there<00:04:45.430> I'm<00:04:45.550> gonna

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
doors I got quite a gap there I'm gonna

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.309 
doors I got quite a gap there I'm gonna
have<00:04:45.789> to<00:04:45.940> put<00:04:46.060> some<00:04:46.180> silicone<00:04:46.419> in<00:04:46.840> there<00:04:47.050> I

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:47.319 
have to put some silicone in there I

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:50.240 
have to put some silicone in there I
don't<00:04:48.280> know<00:04:48.520> why<00:04:48.789> I<00:04:48.819> saw<00:04:49.180> it<00:04:49.240> sitting<00:04:49.509> down

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
don't know why I saw it sitting down

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.219 
don't know why I saw it sitting down
like<00:04:51.250> I<00:04:51.400> say<00:04:51.610> I<00:04:51.639> fit<00:04:51.970> the<00:04:52.090> plastics<00:04:52.629> warped<00:04:53.080> or

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
like I say I fit the plastics warped or

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.399 
like I say I fit the plastics warped or
something<00:04:53.789> this<00:04:54.789> side<00:04:55.090> here<00:04:55.389> is<00:04:55.419> not<00:04:55.629> too<00:04:55.990> bad

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:56.409 
something this side here is not too bad

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:01.379 
something this side here is not too bad
but<00:04:56.770> it's<00:04:56.949> it's<00:04:57.789> there<00:04:58.150> a<00:04:58.180> little<00:04:58.629> bit<00:05:00.120> but<00:05:01.120> a

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
but it's it's there a little bit but a

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.279 
but it's it's there a little bit but a
silicone<00:05:02.229> look<00:05:02.440> after<00:05:02.740> that<00:05:03.750> other<00:05:04.750> than<00:05:05.080> that

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
silicone look after that other than that

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.270 
silicone look after that other than that
I<00:05:05.650> had<00:05:06.039> a<00:05:06.069> couple<00:05:06.340> of<00:05:06.610> pieces<00:05:06.879> left<00:05:07.300> over<00:05:08.280> right

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
I had a couple of pieces left over right

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.700 
I had a couple of pieces left over right
there

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
there

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.490 
there
as<00:05:11.710> you<00:05:11.919> can<00:05:12.069> see<00:05:12.460> I<00:05:12.819> have<00:05:13.270> no<00:05:13.629> idea<00:05:14.080> what<00:05:14.319> they

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
as you can see I have no idea what they

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.170 
as you can see I have no idea what they
are<00:05:16.349> the<00:05:17.349> manual<00:05:17.830> does<00:05:18.009> show<00:05:18.310> them<00:05:18.580> then<00:05:18.940> it

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
are the manual does show them then it

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.629 
are the manual does show them then it
shows<00:05:19.479> they<00:05:19.780> go<00:05:19.930> up<00:05:20.050> on<00:05:20.199> the<00:05:20.349> door<00:05:20.590> up<00:05:20.979> in<00:05:21.280> here

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
shows they go up on the door up in here

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:25.260 
shows they go up on the door up in here
somewhere<00:05:22.319> but<00:05:23.319> I<00:05:23.469> have<00:05:23.740> no<00:05:24.009> idea<00:05:24.460> I<00:05:24.759> can't

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
somewhere but I have no idea I can't

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.469 
somewhere but I have no idea I can't
figure<00:05:25.509> that<00:05:25.629> out<00:05:25.810> I<00:05:26.199> don't<00:05:26.259> know<00:05:26.500> what<00:05:26.560> I

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
figure that out I don't know what I

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:33.439 
figure that out I don't know what I
don't<00:05:28.479> know<00:05:28.810> I<00:05:31.199> don't<00:05:32.199> know<00:05:32.349> how<00:05:32.500> they<00:05:32.680> go

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449 
don't know I don't know how they go

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.330 
don't know I don't know how they go
maybe<00:05:34.449> something<00:05:34.900> like<00:05:35.050> that<00:05:35.289> or<00:05:35.680> I'm<00:05:36.159> going

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
maybe something like that or I'm going

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.830 
maybe something like that or I'm going
to<00:05:36.370> have<00:05:36.520> to<00:05:36.639> do<00:05:36.759> a<00:05:36.789> little<00:05:36.969> more<00:05:37.150> research<00:05:37.389> on

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
to have to do a little more research on

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.330 
to have to do a little more research on
that<00:05:37.900> and<00:05:38.229> see<00:05:38.440> what<00:05:38.620> that's<00:05:38.740> all<00:05:39.009> about<00:05:39.039> I

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
that and see what that's all about I

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.730 
that and see what that's all about I
don't<00:05:39.520> I<00:05:39.909> don't<00:05:40.659> understand<00:05:41.289> what<00:05:41.590> they're

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
don't I don't understand what they're

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.249 
don't I don't understand what they're
for<00:05:41.949> but<00:05:42.009> oh<00:05:42.870> they're<00:05:43.870> not<00:05:43.990> all<00:05:44.259> in<00:05:44.289> all<00:05:44.590> it's<00:05:44.860> a

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:46.259 
for but oh they're not all in all it's a

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:48.839 
for but oh they're not all in all it's a
nice<00:05:47.259> little<00:05:47.770> I<00:05:47.800> think<00:05:48.130> we'll<00:05:48.430> know<00:05:48.610> when

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:48.849 
nice little I think we'll know when

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:51.980 
nice little I think we'll know when
the<00:05:48.880> snow<00:05:49.210> hits<00:05:49.539> here<00:05:49.990> another<00:05:50.229> couple<00:05:50.469> months

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
the snow hits here another couple months

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.659 
the snow hits here another couple months
and<00:05:52.990> we'll<00:05:53.169> see<00:05:53.409> how<00:05:53.919> it<00:05:54.069> pans<00:05:54.310> out<00:05:54.580> but<00:05:56.669> anyway

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
and we'll see how it pans out but anyway

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:01.499 
and we'll see how it pans out but anyway
it's<00:05:58.150> a<00:05:58.240> done<00:05:58.419> deal<00:05:58.449> and<00:05:59.699> I<00:06:00.699> never<00:06:00.909> really<00:06:01.300> run

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:01.509 
it's a done deal and I never really run

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:03.629 
it's a done deal and I never really run
into<00:06:01.659> anything<00:06:02.050> too<00:06:02.380> major<00:06:02.770> that<00:06:03.219> I<00:06:03.250> couldn't

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:03.639 
into anything too major that I couldn't

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.040 
into anything too major that I couldn't
figure<00:06:03.819> out<00:06:05.430> it<00:06:06.430> is<00:06:06.969> time-consuming<00:06:07.270> without

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
figure out it is time-consuming without

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.249 
figure out it is time-consuming without
a<00:06:08.080> doubt<00:06:08.849> but<00:06:09.849> when<00:06:10.539> it's<00:06:10.659> all<00:06:10.810> said<00:06:10.840> and<00:06:11.169> done

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:11.259 
a doubt but when it's all said and done

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:16.980 
a doubt but when it's all said and done
it's<00:06:12.250> not<00:06:12.460> a<00:06:12.520> bad<00:06:12.789> little<00:06:12.969> shed<00:06:13.300> a<00:06:15.990> little

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
it's not a bad little shed a little

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.839 
it's not a bad little shed a little
follow<00:06:17.349> up<00:06:17.469> here<00:06:17.919> I've<00:06:18.250> been<00:06:18.490> playing<00:06:18.699> around

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:18.849 
follow up here I've been playing around

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:20.969 
follow up here I've been playing around
shipping<00:06:19.509> these<00:06:19.629> doors<00:06:19.960> up<00:06:20.259> a<00:06:20.469> little<00:06:20.710> bit<00:06:20.860> I

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:20.979 
shipping these doors up a little bit I

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:22.740 
shipping these doors up a little bit I
put<00:06:21.190> a<00:06:21.219> little<00:06:21.520> bit<00:06:21.639> of<00:06:21.789> shim<00:06:22.060> than<00:06:22.300> this<00:06:22.479> side

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
put a little bit of shim than this side

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.920 
put a little bit of shim than this side
here<00:06:23.229> just<00:06:24.300> put<00:06:25.300> a<00:06:25.330> couple<00:06:25.599> of<00:06:25.659> shims

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
here just put a couple of shims

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:31.860 
here just put a couple of shims
underneath<00:06:26.289> that<00:06:26.650> pin<00:06:29.370> the<00:06:30.370> doors<00:06:30.639> do<00:06:31.419> line<00:06:31.659> up

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
underneath that pin the doors do line up

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.800 
underneath that pin the doors do line up
pretty<00:06:32.020> good<00:06:32.169> there<00:06:32.349> now<00:06:33.300> they're<00:06:34.300> not<00:06:34.479> bad

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
pretty good there now they're not bad

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.510 
pretty good there now they're not bad
but<00:06:35.789> the<00:06:36.789> worst<00:06:37.029> part<00:06:37.330> is<00:06:37.569> I<00:06:37.960> had<00:06:38.830> to<00:06:39.009> shim<00:06:39.340> up

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
but the worst part is I had to shim up

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.420 
but the worst part is I had to shim up
this<00:06:39.699> back<00:06:39.969> corner<00:06:40.300> back<00:06:40.599> here<00:06:40.960> I<00:06:41.229> had<00:06:42.159> to<00:06:42.279> put

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:42.430 
this back corner back here I had to put

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.260 
this back corner back here I had to put
a<00:06:42.460> board<00:06:42.819> in<00:06:43.090> underneath<00:06:43.419> there<00:06:45.090> so<00:06:46.090> that

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270 
a board in underneath there so that

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.629 
a board in underneath there so that
means<00:06:46.419> my<00:06:46.629> platform<00:06:46.960> is<00:06:47.500> up<00:06:47.680> off<00:06:47.949> the<00:06:48.159> ground<00:06:48.340> a

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 
means my platform is up off the ground a

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:52.150 
means my platform is up off the ground a
little<00:06:48.669> bit

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.040 

now<00:06:53.160> I<00:06:53.190> pick<00:06:53.660> boarding<00:06:54.660> on<00:06:54.780> the<00:06:54.900> back<00:06:55.080> side<00:06:55.410> too

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050 
now I pick boarding on the back side too

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.050 
now I pick boarding on the back side too
but<00:06:58.050> I<00:06:58.350> mean<00:06:58.800> I<00:06:59.040> don't<00:06:59.220> know<00:06:59.460> what<00:06:59.640> else<00:06:59.790> to<00:06:59.850> do

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060 
but I mean I don't know what else to do

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.550 
but I mean I don't know what else to do
with<00:07:00.090> it<00:07:01.760> it's<00:07:02.760> funny<00:07:03.030> my<00:07:03.750> platform<00:07:04.050> was

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 
with it it's funny my platform was

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.790 
with it it's funny my platform was
perfectly<00:07:04.980> level<00:07:05.460> but<00:07:06.440> there's<00:07:07.440> some<00:07:07.620> odd

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 
perfectly level but there's some odd

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.440 
perfectly level but there's some odd
reason<00:07:08.280> that<00:07:08.400> must<00:07:08.610> be<00:07:08.670> just<00:07:08.910> twisting<00:07:09.420> the

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:09.450 
reason that must be just twisting the

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.910 
reason that must be just twisting the
plastic<00:07:09.990> of<00:07:10.110> the<00:07:10.140> shed<00:07:10.500> or<00:07:10.770> whatever<00:07:11.250> and

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:12.920 
plastic of the shed or whatever and

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.020 
plastic of the shed or whatever and
there's<00:07:13.920> probably<00:07:14.310> not<00:07:14.460> much<00:07:14.640> I<00:07:14.790> can<00:07:14.910> do<00:07:15.000> about

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:15.030 
there's probably not much I can do about

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.110 
there's probably not much I can do about
it<00:07:15.270> anyway<00:07:16.130> that's<00:07:17.130> how<00:07:17.400> I<00:07:17.520> fixed<00:07:17.880> my<00:07:17.940> door

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 
it anyway that's how I fixed my door

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.540 
it anyway that's how I fixed my door
