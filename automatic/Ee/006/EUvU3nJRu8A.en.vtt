here you're going to want to Center the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.819 
here you're going to want to Center the
jack<00:00:44.670> there<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.090> jack<00:00:45.329> up<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.629> car<00:00:45.710> what<00:00:46.710> we

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
jack there and jack up the car what we

want<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.070> be<00:00:47.160> draining<00:00:48.590> the<00:00:49.590> antifreeze<00:00:49.920> from

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
want to be draining the antifreeze from

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.520 
want to be draining the antifreeze from
right<00:00:50.550> here<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:50.850> red<00:00:51.180> circle<00:00:51.660> we're<00:00:52.320> going

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
right here this red circle we're going

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.020 
right here this red circle we're going
to<00:00:52.649> just<00:00:52.860> put<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> straight<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.520> divert<00:00:53.730> and

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
to just put a straight to divert and

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.750 
to just put a straight to divert and
turn<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.170> going<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.320> start<00:00:55.500> raining

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
turn it and it's going to start raining

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.760 
turn it and it's going to start raining
so<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.789> think<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.210> good<00:00:57.420> enough

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
so I think this is good enough

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.080 
so I think this is good enough
so<00:00:58.770> we're<00:00:58.949> going<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.160> do<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.520> put<00:00:59.820> our<00:00:59.910> dirty

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
so we're going to do is put our dirty

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.840 
so we're going to do is put our dirty
rag<00:01:00.359> on<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.570> floor<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:00.989> in<00:01:01.140> case<00:01:01.289> any<00:01:01.500> leaks

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
rag on the floor just in case any leaks

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.810 
rag on the floor just in case any leaks
put<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.969> drain<00:01:03.180> pan<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.600> top<00:01:04.460> we're<00:01:05.460> going<00:01:05.670> to

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
put the drain pan on top we're going to

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.250 
put the drain pan on top we're going to
slowly<00:01:06.060> loosen<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.750> you'll<00:01:06.900> see<00:01:07.110> the

slowly loosen it and you'll see the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.620 
slowly loosen it and you'll see the
antifreeze<00:01:08.070> will<00:01:08.490> start<00:01:08.760> dripping<00:01:11.510> just<00:01:12.510> like

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
antifreeze will start dripping just like

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.109 
antifreeze will start dripping just like
that<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.470> pick<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.920> up<00:01:14.010> let's<00:01:14.640> speed<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:14.909> up

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
that you pick it up let's speed it up

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.330 
that you pick it up let's speed it up
loosen<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.750> lot<00:01:15.900> unplug<00:01:16.500> your<00:01:16.680> red<00:01:16.799> knob<00:01:17.040> and

we'll pour straight down like that and

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.980 
we'll pour straight down like that and
the<00:01:19.530> red<00:01:19.680> knob<00:01:19.860> comes<00:01:20.130> out<00:01:20.720> that's<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
the red knob comes out that's in the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.140 
the red knob comes out that's in the
fourth<00:01:22.200> straight<00:01:22.409> down<00:01:22.970> you're<00:01:23.970> going<00:01:24.060> to

and<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:35.759> raining<00:01:35.939> out<00:01:36.180> more<00:01:36.390> antifreeze<00:01:36.930> and

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
and it's raining out more antifreeze and

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.460 
and it's raining out more antifreeze and
we're<00:01:38.850> gonna<00:01:38.970> let<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.180> all<00:01:39.390> drain<00:01:39.689> out<00:01:39.869> so

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.109 
and antifreeze so I'm going to start
pouring<00:02:01.030> my<00:02:01.240> antifreeze<00:02:01.659> in<00:02:04.290> good<00:02:05.290> boy<00:02:05.470> slowly

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
pouring my antifreeze in good boy slowly

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.100 
pouring my antifreeze in good boy slowly
so<00:02:07.119> now<00:02:07.240> what<00:02:07.420> I'm<00:02:07.479> going<00:02:07.509> to<00:02:07.630> be<00:02:07.720> doing<00:02:07.840> is

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
so now what I'm going to be doing is

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.900 
so now what I'm going to be doing is
training<00:02:08.319> on<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.649> car<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:09.429> can<00:02:09.459> see<00:02:09.729> it<00:02:09.819> from

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
training on the car you can see it from

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:17.350 
training on the car you can see it from
here

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.830 

trying<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.750> go<00:02:17.870> down<00:02:18.080> slowly

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
trying to go down slowly

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.830 
trying to go down slowly
see<00:02:20.410> as<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.560> could<00:02:20.890> see<00:02:21.540> coolant<00:02:22.540> went<00:02:22.660> down

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
see as you could see coolant went down

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.170 
see as you could see coolant went down
and<00:02:23.050> it<00:02:23.110> took<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.410> whole<00:02:23.459> four<00:02:24.459> liters<00:02:24.819> one

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
and it took the whole four liters one

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.199 
and it took the whole four liters one
gallon<00:02:25.569> bottle<00:02:25.930> in<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.260> car<00:02:26.470> pouring<00:02:26.860> slowly

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.839 

it<00:02:31.750> should<00:02:31.989> take<00:02:32.230> about<00:02:32.260> six<00:02:32.950> chord<00:02:33.310> six<00:02:33.640> to

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
it should take about six chord six to

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.599 
it should take about six chord six to
seven<00:02:34.319> you<00:02:35.319> can<00:02:35.530> see<00:02:35.680> it's<00:02:35.829> full<00:02:36.069> so<00:02:36.430> we're

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
seven you can see it's full so we're

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.089 
seven you can see it's full so we're
going<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:36.819> do<00:02:36.969> let<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.079> car<00:02:38.290> run<00:02:38.469> for<00:02:38.739> five<00:02:38.890> six

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
going to do let the car run for five six

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.580 
going to do let the car run for five six
minutes<00:02:39.659> and<00:02:40.659> you're<00:02:41.140> going<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.319> want<00:02:41.530> to

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
minutes and you're going to want to

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.220 
minutes and you're going to want to
watch<00:02:41.739> consumer-level<00:02:42.459> in<00:02:42.670> here<00:02:42.939> you<00:02:43.870> can<00:02:44.079> see

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
watch consumer-level in here you can see

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.309 
watch consumer-level in here you can see
it<00:02:44.349> starting<00:02:44.650> to<00:02:44.680> go<00:02:44.829> down<00:02:45.069> again<00:02:45.370> very<00:02:45.909> slowly

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
it starting to go down again very slowly

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.569 
it starting to go down again very slowly
we're<00:02:47.319> going<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.590> want<00:02:47.739> to<00:02:47.829> do<00:02:47.980> is<00:02:48.129> make<00:02:48.370> sure

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
it flushes goes into the system and

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.280
