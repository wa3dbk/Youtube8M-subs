digital trips at all in watch dogs
that's<00:01:02.659> just<00:01:02.870> my<00:01:03.019> personal<00:01:03.379> opinion<00:01:03.470> I<00:01:03.949> really

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
that's just my personal opinion I really

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.300 
that's just my personal opinion I really
like<00:01:04.760> them<00:01:05.059> to<00:01:05.299> stick<00:01:05.659> to<00:01:06.080> what<00:01:06.530> watchdogs<00:01:07.130> was

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
like them to stick to what watchdogs was

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.390 
like them to stick to what watchdogs was
about<00:01:07.580> which<00:01:07.820> was<00:01:07.850> hacking<00:01:08.770> stealth<00:01:09.770> and<00:01:10.010> then

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
about which was hacking stealth and then

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.370 
about which was hacking stealth and then
the<00:01:10.670> gunplay<00:01:11.150> in<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.390> digital<00:01:11.600> trip<00:01:11.960> with<00:01:12.170> way
