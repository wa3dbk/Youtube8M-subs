00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.500
 program number one how to become the best in 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.840
 what are you doing 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.389
 I was born a long time here I did my trainings 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.000
 usually create fast enough then 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.000
 the book was written 2 bedroom years 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.669
 so the one-day full-fledged 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.050
 training and it so happened that he was completely 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.000
 does not match the book that is the book 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.130
 was written alone about the training case 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.259
 by itself then when I wrote the book 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.019
 and looked at the training it turned out that they 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:36.079
 very nice structure diverges 1 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:37.610
 but the content is different so I can 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.489
 say what are the people who book 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.110
 have read can come to seminars on 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.670
 Greek other side look at 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.879
 I can say exactly the same question 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.409
 that this is unusual for me dad's training 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.210
 a little bit personally if all the time 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.820
 I tell about working a market no 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.769
 what is now alienated then number one 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.600
 this is something i have experienced several times i 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.460
 I consider myself number one in marketing and 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.769
 article number one on the entire calendar 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.199
 in our country, and so it happened that 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.330
 I even became number one in our country 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.450
 topic how to become number one want to say 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.039
 that the content is very very useful that is 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.039
 no water specifically 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:14.840
 what to do how to do and here are the permanent 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:16.850
 ignition we already read spent this 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.259
 training once Moscow and I still 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.140
 I receive thank-you letters 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.970
 people who say cool work and 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.440
 it really works 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.539
 the application of this technique about which 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.580
 tell the first stage you put 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.530
 in front of you goal you must understand what 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.849
 you want to be number one there 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.649
 certain exercise that you 

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:35.330
 perform at this stage you do 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.099
 analysis of yourself you are doing analysis 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.020
 environmental factors that either 

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:41.239
 helps you stop you from reaching your 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.459
 goals you adjust it goal 2 let 

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:45.349
 of how you set a goal and spent 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:47.179
 audit situation you are you 

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:48.530
 you start to do the third 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.200
 their professional and personal 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.280
 development 4 we live cynical enough 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.099
 country and you must necessarily 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.020
 show results you must something 

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:59.119
 demonstrate that you are number one it 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.489
 there are external attributes somehow dressed something

 what car do you wear? 

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:07.700
 how much you earn but it and such 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:11.180
 in it are internal things some sort of ranking 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.209
 some awards and the last we are about it 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.510
 also speak very little quite a bit 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.739
 about marketing itself i'm just showing 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.870
 several dozen ways as possible 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.940
 promote yourself and you do 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.480
 should what is comfortable for you I 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.190
 really my face 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.879
