with the black g-10 and stone wash frame
and<00:00:12.990> blade<00:00:14.570> and<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.690> have<00:00:15.870> here<00:00:16.550> a<00:00:18.109> starter<00:00:19.109> sng

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
and blade and I have here a starter sng

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.910 
and blade and I have here a starter sng
drop<00:00:20.490> point<00:00:21.140> with<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.460> OD<00:00:23.460> green<00:00:23.670> g10<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.920> the

drop point with a OD green g10 and the
striped<00:00:26.220> blade<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.910> basically<00:00:27.840> I'm<00:00:28.019> just

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
striped blade and basically I'm just

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.109 
striped blade and basically I'm just
going<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.320> be<00:00:28.439> talking<00:00:28.619> about<00:00:28.830> which<00:00:29.640> size<00:00:29.910> is

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
going to be talking about which size is

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.190 
going to be talking about which size is
right<00:00:30.269> for<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:31.219> now<00:00:32.219> even<00:00:32.910> though<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.930> P<00:00:34.170> key

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
right for you now even though the P key

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.069 
right for you now even though the P key
is<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.219> know<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.460> SMG<00:00:35.880> go<00:00:36.059> brother<00:00:36.329> it's

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
is you know the SMG go brother it's

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.959 
is you know the SMG go brother it's
basically<00:00:37.440> like<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.680> baby<00:00:38.100> brother<00:00:38.399> it's<00:00:38.730> a

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
basically like the baby brother it's a

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.549 
basically like the baby brother it's a
lot<00:00:39.360> smaller<00:00:39.570> than<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.260> G<00:00:40.670> I<00:00:42.290> mean<00:00:43.290> on

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
lot smaller than this in G I mean on

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.100 
lot smaller than this in G I mean on
camera<00:00:44.399> it's<00:00:44.610> not<00:00:44.820> really<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.300> obvious<00:00:45.840> but

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
camera it's not really that obvious but

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.049 
camera it's not really that obvious but
when<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.379> have<00:00:46.649> them<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:47.010> hand<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.520> mean

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
when you have them in hand I mean

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.819 
when you have them in hand I mean
they're<00:00:48.239> immensely<00:00:48.570> different<00:00:49.170> size<00:00:51.829> here's

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
they're immensely different size here's

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.110 
they're immensely different size here's
a<00:00:52.890> little<00:00:53.039> comparison<00:00:53.280> on<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.610> handle<00:00:54.030> you

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
a little comparison on the handle you

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.180 
a little comparison on the handle you
can<00:00:54.180> just<00:00:54.390> have<00:00:54.539> small<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> handle<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.800> PT

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
can just have small the handle of the PT

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.819 
can just have small the handle of the PT
is<00:00:56.399> compared<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.270> sng<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.960> this

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
is compared to the sng and this

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.549 
is compared to the sng and this
difference<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.340> really<00:00:59.609> significant<00:01:00.410> you<00:01:01.410> can

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
difference is really significant you can

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.399 
difference is really significant you can
see<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.800> difference<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.219> blade<00:01:02.520> here<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.600> few

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
see the difference in blade here a few

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.940 
see the difference in blade here a few
specs<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.670> PT<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.270> actually<00:01:06.570> 2.3<00:01:07.350> ounces<00:01:07.470> so

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
specs the PT is actually 2.3 ounces so

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.990 
specs the PT is actually 2.3 ounces so
it's<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.130> very<00:01:08.159> light<00:01:08.930> easy<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.170> carry<00:01:10.409> blade<00:01:11.000> in

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
it's a very light easy to carry blade in

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.710 
it's a very light easy to carry blade in
contrast<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.680> strata<00:01:14.310> sng<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:14.909> 5<00:01:15.299> ounces

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
contrast the strata sng is 5 ounces

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.870 
contrast the strata sng is 5 ounces
which<00:01:16.500> means<00:01:16.770> it's<00:01:16.920> over<00:01:17.220> twice<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.549> weight

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
which means it's over twice the weight

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.190 
which means it's over twice the weight
of<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.450> PT<00:01:20.869> here's<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.140> PT<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.590> hand

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
of the PT here's the PT in hand

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.679 
of the PT here's the PT in hand
basically<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.939> it's<00:01:26.939> only<00:01:27.119> for<00:01:27.420> EDC

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
basically it's a it's only for EDC

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.640 
basically it's a it's only for EDC
purposes<00:01:28.939> and<00:01:29.939> not<00:01:30.540> really<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.140> heavy<00:01:31.409> ones

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
purposes and not really that heavy ones

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.390 
purposes and not really that heavy ones
at<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:33.320> basically<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.740> only<00:01:34.829> reason<00:01:35.220> why<00:01:35.310> I

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
at that basically the only reason why I

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.100 
at that basically the only reason why I
say<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.939> little<00:01:36.360> weaker<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.930> knife

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
say this is a little weaker of a knife

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.830 
say this is a little weaker of a knife
because<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:38.009> because<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.640> thin<00:01:39.509> blade

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
because it's because of the thin blade

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.810 
because it's because of the thin blade
you<00:01:40.710> can<00:01:40.860> see<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.100> blade<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.430> actually

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
you can see the blade is actually

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.740 
you can see the blade is actually
significantly<00:01:42.030> thinner<00:01:42.930> than<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.350> sng<00:01:47.750> and

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
significantly thinner than the sng and

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.780 
significantly thinner than the sng and
the<00:01:49.079> PD<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.530> basically<00:01:49.920> only<00:01:50.070> usable<00:01:50.430> when<00:01:50.640> you

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
the PD is basically only usable when you

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.840 
the PD is basically only usable when you
use<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.060> fort<00:01:51.479> or<00:01:51.720> along<00:01:52.229> with<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:53.280> part<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.790> a

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
use a fort or along with the part of a

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.179 
use a fort or along with the part of a
handle<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:55.079> want<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.290> put<00:01:55.409> three<00:01:55.680> fingers<00:01:55.710> on

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
handle you want to put three fingers on

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.590 
handle you want to put three fingers on
the<00:01:56.310> handle<00:01:56.610> back<00:01:56.700> here<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.240> second

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
the handle back here and the second

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.260 
the handle back here and the second
finger<00:01:57.869> on<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.469> toil<00:01:58.969> as<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.030> very

and so to cut straight my knuckles
banging<00:02:14.840> into<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.080> wood<00:02:16.040> here<00:02:17.080> it's<00:02:18.080> much

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
banging into the wood here it's much

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.050 
banging into the wood here it's much
more<00:02:18.470> comfortable<00:02:18.740> if<00:02:19.070> you<00:02:19.190> loosen<00:02:19.550> up<00:02:19.700> and

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.000 

use<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.210> second<00:02:23.540> choice<00:02:23.750> here<00:02:24.110> by<00:02:24.770> contrast

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
use the second choice here by contrast

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.280 
use the second choice here by contrast
the<00:02:25.460> sng<00:02:25.940> has<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:26.300> know<00:02:26.420> more<00:02:26.720> handle<00:02:27.110> space

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
the sng has you know more handle space

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.680 
the sng has you know more handle space
and<00:02:27.530> you'll<00:02:27.650> need<00:02:28.210> up<00:02:29.210> here<00:02:29.270> is<00:02:29.510> very

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
and you'll need up here is very

and now you can just choked back and do

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.880 
and now you can just choked back and do
some<00:02:43.070> work<00:02:43.370> with<00:02:43.580> this<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:45.410> know<00:02:45.530> what<00:02:45.650> I<00:02:45.680> use

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
some work with this you know what I use

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.440 
some work with this you know what I use
these<00:02:46.040> knives<00:02:46.250> i<00:02:46.430> always<00:02:46.700> use<00:02:46.850> a<00:02:46.880> troll<00:02:47.210> though

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
these knives i always use a troll though

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.810 
these knives i always use a troll though
it<00:02:48.050> just<00:02:48.320> feels<00:02:48.770> more<00:02:48.920> natural<00:02:49.070> i<00:02:49.520> mean<00:02:49.670> like

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
it just feels more natural i mean like

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.100 
it just feels more natural i mean like
why<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.030> trial<00:02:50.480> there<00:02:50.660> if<00:02:50.720> you're<00:02:50.840> not<00:02:50.960> going

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
why the trial there if you're not going

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.620 
why the trial there if you're not going
to<00:02:51.200> use<00:02:51.290> it<00:02:51.350> right<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:52.000> like<00:02:53.000> I<00:02:53.180> kind<00:02:53.450> of<00:02:53.480> feel

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
to use it right and like I kind of feel

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.690 
to use it right and like I kind of feel
like<00:02:53.690> my<00:02:53.930> hand<00:02:54.170> is<00:02:54.320> too<00:02:54.500> far<00:02:54.680> back<00:02:54.950> compared<00:02:55.640> to

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
like my hand is too far back compared to

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.730 
like my hand is too far back compared to
the<00:02:55.850> blade<00:02:56.120> here<00:02:56.750> it<00:02:56.930> just<00:02:56.960> feels<00:02:57.320> just<00:02:57.620> right

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
the blade here it just feels just right

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.650 
the blade here it just feels just right
for<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.040> right<00:02:58.190> amount<00:02:58.310> of<00:02:58.550> control<00:02:58.850> but<00:02:59.630> I

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
for the right amount of control but I

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.660 
for the right amount of control but I
mean<00:02:59.990> depending<00:03:00.380> on<00:03:00.470> your<00:03:00.590> task<00:03:00.860> choking<00:03:01.640> back

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
mean depending on your task choking back

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.360 
mean depending on your task choking back
is<00:03:02.000> probably<00:03:02.300> a<00:03:02.510> good<00:03:02.570> idea<00:03:05.770> as<00:03:06.770> I<00:03:06.920> said<00:03:06.980> the

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
is probably a good idea as I said the

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.930 
is probably a good idea as I said the
blades<00:03:07.760> are<00:03:07.970> a<00:03:08.030> different<00:03:08.270> thickness<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:10.190> sng

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
blades are a different thickness the sng

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.340 
blades are a different thickness the sng
is<00:03:11.000> actually<00:03:11.300> a<00:03:11.360> very<00:03:11.480> stout<00:03:11.780> blade<00:03:12.050> and<00:03:12.320> the

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
is actually a very stout blade and the

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.490 
is actually a very stout blade and the
PT<00:03:12.680> is<00:03:12.740> also<00:03:13.070> very<00:03:13.190> stout<00:03:13.460> blade<00:03:14.020> for<00:03:15.020> it<00:03:15.110> some

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
PT is also very stout blade for it some

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:22.300 
PT is also very stout blade for it some
mike<00:03:16.340> and<00:03:17.950> you<00:03:18.950> know<00:03:19.100> i<00:03:19.840> would<00:03:20.840> say<00:03:21.410> that<00:03:21.950> the

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
mike and you know i would say that the

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.710 
mike and you know i would say that the
sng<00:03:22.850> is<00:03:22.940> about<00:03:23.120> one<00:03:23.360> and<00:03:23.480> a<00:03:23.540> half<00:03:23.570> times

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
sng is about one and a half times

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.430 
sng is about one and a half times
thicker<00:03:24.230> than<00:03:24.350> the<00:03:24.530> PT<00:03:25.040> played<00:03:25.390> as<00:03:26.440> is

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
thicker than the PT played as is

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.950 
thicker than the PT played as is
everything<00:03:27.740> else<00:03:28.010> I<00:03:28.220> mean<00:03:28.540> this<00:03:29.540> life<00:03:29.780> is

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
everything else I mean this life is

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.600 
everything else I mean this life is
basically<00:03:30.170> one<00:03:30.800> and<00:03:30.980> a<00:03:31.010> half<00:03:31.070> times<00:03:31.160> this

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
basically one and a half times this

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.750 
basically one and a half times this
knife<00:03:31.820> maybe<00:03:32.120> two<00:03:32.390> times<00:03:32.570> this<00:03:32.840> knife<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:34.280> key

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
knife maybe two times this knife the key

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.960 
knife maybe two times this knife the key
I<00:03:34.790> slab<00:03:35.180> and<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.600> g10<00:03:36.080> slab<00:03:36.410> are<00:03:36.970> similarly

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
I slab and the g10 slab are similarly

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.750 
I slab and the g10 slab are similarly
thicker<00:03:38.570> on<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:38.900> sng<00:03:39.350> and<00:03:39.590> thinner<00:03:39.980> on<00:03:40.070> the<00:03:40.220> PT

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
thicker on the sng and thinner on the PT

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.640 
thicker on the sng and thinner on the PT
now<00:03:41.420> this<00:03:41.690> difference<00:03:42.050> is<00:03:42.170> much<00:03:42.410> less

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
now this difference is much less

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.490 
now this difference is much less
noticeable<00:03:42.980> i<00:03:43.340> think<00:03:43.610> actually<00:03:44.210> i<00:03:44.630> may<00:03:45.440> be

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
noticeable i think actually i may be

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.860 
noticeable i think actually i may be
wrong<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:46.460> g10<00:03:46.850> 5<00:03:47.090> is<00:03:47.240> definitely<00:03:47.630> a<00:03:47.660> thicker

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
wrong the g10 5 is definitely a thicker

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.950 
wrong the g10 5 is definitely a thicker
on<00:03:48.050> the<00:03:48.170> sng<00:03:48.790> but<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:49.910> ti<00:03:50.330> slab<00:03:50.720> might

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:50.960 
on the sng but the ti slab might

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.920 
on the sng but the ti slab might
actually<00:03:51.200> be<00:03:51.500> the<00:03:51.620> same<00:03:51.830> thickness<00:03:52.070> I<00:03:55.930> don't

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
actually be the same thickness I don't

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:03.330 
actually be the same thickness I don't
know<00:03:57.020> if<00:03:57.140> I<00:03:57.200> can<00:03:57.260> tell<00:03:58.360> let<00:03:59.360> me<00:03:59.510> see

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.720 

yeah<00:04:04.860> they're<00:04:05.860> about<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.160> same<00:04:06.370> thickness

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
yeah they're about the same thickness

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.940 
yeah they're about the same thickness
actually<00:04:07.330> so<00:04:07.569> you<00:04:07.989> know<00:04:08.110> in<00:04:08.200> terms<00:04:08.349> of<00:04:08.560> lot<00:04:08.769> of

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
actually so you know in terms of lot of

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
actually so you know in terms of lot of
you<00:04:09.069> don't<00:04:09.190> have<00:04:09.280> to<00:04:09.370> worry<00:04:09.519> about<00:04:09.640> with<00:04:09.849> your

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
you don't have to worry about with your

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.089 
you don't have to worry about with your
PT<00:04:10.300> I<00:04:10.540> just<00:04:11.050> feel<00:04:11.319> like<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.590> sng<00:04:11.950> has<00:04:12.069> a

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
PT I just feel like the sng has a

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.070 
PT I just feel like the sng has a
sticker<00:04:12.430> lock<00:04:12.700> bar<00:04:13.000> I<00:04:13.209> think<00:04:13.420> it<00:04:13.540> does<00:04:13.750> but

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
sticker lock bar I think it does but

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.909 
sticker lock bar I think it does but
it's<00:04:14.260> not<00:04:14.379> really<00:04:14.530> noticeable<00:04:14.769> at<00:04:15.129> all<00:04:15.359> I<00:04:16.919> mean

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
it's not really noticeable at all I mean

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
now I meanwhile the SN

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.650 
now I meanwhile the SN
gee<00:06:14.410> the<00:06:15.410> ecliptic<00:06:15.800> mounted<00:06:16.460> a<00:06:16.660> basically

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:17.660 
gee the ecliptic mounted a basically

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.189 
gee the ecliptic mounted a basically
much<00:06:17.900> lower<00:06:18.199> on<00:06:18.440> the<00:06:18.590> handle<00:06:18.979> and<00:06:19.870> you<00:06:20.870> know<00:06:20.990> it

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 
much lower on the handle and you know it

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:23.260 
much lower on the handle and you know it
just<00:06:21.229> makes<00:06:21.530> it<00:06:21.740> a<00:06:21.889> lot<00:06:22.039> more<00:06:22.099> concealed<00:06:22.910> to

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
just makes it a lot more concealed to

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.070 
just makes it a lot more concealed to
carry<00:06:23.479> and<00:06:23.919> also<00:06:25.330> it's<00:06:26.330> actually<00:06:26.660> more<00:06:26.750> secure

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
carry and also it's actually more secure

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.360 
carry and also it's actually more secure
because<00:06:27.199> it's<00:06:27.470> a<00:06:27.530> bigger<00:06:27.740> knife<00:06:27.979> heavier

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.370 
because it's a bigger knife heavier

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.890 
because it's a bigger knife heavier
knife<00:06:28.580> so<00:06:28.819> it<00:06:28.880> feels<00:06:29.030> like<00:06:29.270> it's<00:06:29.449> been<00:06:29.630> in<00:06:29.780> your

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 
knife so it feels like it's been in your

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.210 
knife so it feels like it's been in your
pocket<00:06:30.610> I'm<00:06:31.610> gonna<00:06:31.729> bring<00:06:31.910> that<00:06:32.090> in<00:06:32.240> again<00:06:32.509> and

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 
more the PT definitely sticks out

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.170 
more the PT definitely sticks out
especially<00:06:49.159> considering<00:06:49.729> the<00:06:49.819> size<00:06:50.000> of<00:06:50.030> the

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:50.180 
especially considering the size of the

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.809 
especially considering the size of the
knife<00:06:50.360> anyway<00:06:51.169> that's<00:06:51.889> my<00:06:52.069> little<00:06:52.550> size

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:52.819 
knife anyway that's my little size

knife anyway that's my little size
