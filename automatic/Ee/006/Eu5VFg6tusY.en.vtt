00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:08.800
 hello very good I come to present you a 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:11.169
 I play a game fast and fast the truth 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.179
 is that it is a way in which I 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:13.929
 I recommend not too many explanations to 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.780
 your audience 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.550
 so suddenly impromptu that is called him 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.550
 deliveries the deck you will see that it is 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.980
 tremendously effective they deliver the 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.500
 shuffle an alarm clock you do not have to 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.970
 mix and once mixed that you the 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.730
 return you are going to do the following you are going to 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.350
 throw four cards on the table 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.030
 separated from chance 24 and 22 is 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.039
 separately and you're going to have a first 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.170
 viewer who thinks of a letter of 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:43.079
 the ones that he sees that he thinks about it and that he does not say 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.539
 nothing remember them simply we are going to 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.640
 suppose for as an example let's do 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.699
 1 order but that does not have to be that way 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.219
 precisely but it is for your good 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.710
 understanding as we see who chooses us 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.229
 the first the diamond box spears 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.079
 four fourths four more cards and 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:03.869
 covering the first you have a 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.690
 second spectator who thinks of a 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:08.280
 letter suppose you think about the 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.310
 second 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.799
 the 6 of spades a third occasion 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.650
 plugging the letters to a third 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.190
 viewer tells you to think a 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.479
 letter suppose you think the third 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.040
 that does not have to be that order nor 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.399
 much less about the memories and 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.800
 fourth and last time you ask another 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.260
 viewer who thinks of a letter and 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.650
 suppose he thinks 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.020
 in the fourth I have done this 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.140
 every person spectator a letter that you 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.450
 you do not know your position start choosing 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.680
 the first package and you'll ask the 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.250
 first spectator your letter is here 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.770
 if it tells you that if it is the case that 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.190
 four diamonds you know that your letter is 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.190
 the first 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.970
 to the second spectator you will ask in 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:05.270
 this because the letters can match 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.580
 in the same pile because each of 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.280
 they do not know who is chosen so 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:15.360
 which of each bunch we will earn from each 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:18.840
 lots of shows to the spectators 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.260
 you will know that if it is the second spectator 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.180
 the second letter here the 6 if it's the 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.150
 third viewer is the third letter 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.450
 here the 10 and if it is the fourth spectator 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.040
 the fourth letter to this evidently 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.140
 It is fair to say that you will not do any 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.680
 mention class simply as already 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.630
 I say you will show the letters to your 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.790
 viewer until your letter yes or no 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.459
 no, well, the next one is here 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.070
 letter yes or no if it is the first first 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.110
 if that second second the same thing will happen 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.540
 here if that first first if it's the 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:55.230
 third third there where appropriate 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:03:00.380
 you can see it fast game where there are and 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:03.860
 done spontaneously assured 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:07.330
 full effectiveness thank you very much 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.330
 and until the next video
