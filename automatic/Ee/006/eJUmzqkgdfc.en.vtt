as far as I can tell I'll get on with it
go<00:00:31.150> horribly<00:00:31.419> wrong<00:00:31.540> but<00:00:31.930> we<00:00:32.020> should<00:00:32.200> do<00:00:32.380> our

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
go horribly wrong but we should do our

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.069

yeah so type 240 in down here which kind
of<00:02:54.540> sets<00:02:54.750> our<00:02:54.930> endpoint<00:02:56.569> refresh<00:02:57.569> play<00:03:00.500> yeah

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
of sets our endpoint refresh play yeah

there you go it's nice it's working it's

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.120 
there you go it's nice it's working it's
a<00:03:04.080> miracle<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:07.410> animation<00:03:07.860> should<00:03:08.040> be

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
a miracle the animation should be

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.770 
a miracle the animation should be
working<00:03:08.340> by<00:03:08.730> now<00:03:09.500> okay<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:12.060> that's<00:03:12.300> basic

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
working by now okay and that's basic

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.660 
working by now okay and that's basic
tweening<00:03:13.140> between<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:13.890> first<00:03:14.099> proposed<00:03:14.459> and

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
tweening between the first proposed and

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.210 
tweening between the first proposed and
the<00:03:14.730> last<00:03:14.940> pose<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:16.080> way<00:03:16.110> I've<00:03:16.380> been<00:03:16.680> doing<00:03:16.739> it

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
the last pose the way I've been doing it

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.250 
the last pose the way I've been doing it
is<00:03:17.459> you<00:03:17.879> pick<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.120> point<00:03:18.390> in<00:03:18.569> between<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.049> two

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
is you pick a point in between the two

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.870 
is you pick a point in between the two
on<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.790> timeline<00:03:21.299> and<00:03:21.650> then<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:22.860> can<00:03:23.099> add<00:03:23.849> a

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
on the timeline and then you can add a

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.830 
on the timeline and then you can add a
rotation<00:03:24.450> in<00:03:24.599> here<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.170> loop<00:03:26.900> move<00:03:27.900> move<00:03:28.230> a

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
rotation in here and loop move move a

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.250 
rotation in here and loop move move a
leg<00:03:30.840> over<00:03:31.200> here<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:32.780> just<00:03:33.780> generally<00:03:34.110> keep

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
leg over here and just generally keep

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.970 
leg over here and just generally keep
tweaking<00:03:34.560> with<00:03:34.890> things<00:03:35.190> until<00:03:35.519> you've<00:03:35.640> got

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
tweaking with things until you've got

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.839 
tweaking with things until you've got
your<00:03:37.980> fantastic<00:03:39.500> animation<00:03:40.610> again<00:03:41.610> you

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
your fantastic animation again you

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.589 
your fantastic animation again you
select<00:03:42.299> all<00:03:42.569> press<00:03:43.319> I<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:43.920> do<00:03:44.430> rotation<00:03:45.060> I'm

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
select all press I and do rotation I'm

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:46.850 
select all press I and do rotation I'm
sure<00:03:45.810> there's<00:03:45.989> a<00:03:46.019> whole<00:03:46.170> lot<00:03:46.319> of<00:03:46.410> other<00:03:46.620> clever
