 welcome to the audible version and video 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.970
 of endodontic notes this resource 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.940
 audiovisual is a complement to the 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.920
 Internet page that you consulted was 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.750
 prepared by Dr. Ricardo Rivas 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.300
 muÃ±oz of the faculty of studies 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.690
 superior iztacala of the university 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.900
 national autonomy of mexico and seventh 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.059
 thumb pathology unit the topic that I'm going 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.220
 to read is the classification of 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.120
 pulpal diseases 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.090
 there is a lot of 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.710
 classifications and terminologies 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.140
 published by researchers very 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.880
 reasoned and of great scientific value 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.280
 but that have provoked controversies and 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.500
 dissidence in what all the authors 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.989
 they agree is that there is no 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.870
 correlation between the findings 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.070
 histopathological and clinical symptoms 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.630
 generally in the works of 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.210
 investigation cuts were made 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.520
 insufficient and mistakes were made in 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.220
 its interpretation is accepted that 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.720
 classifications clearly 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.850
 Histopathological findings are important in 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.920
 scientific research and for purposes 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.770
 academics to understand the processes 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.869
 it reacts them pulpares on the other hand 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.119
 a classification should be preferred 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.310
 clinic to help the professional 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.790
 decide with precision the best 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.290
 treatment by most authors 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.210
 classify pulp diseases in 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.850
 inflammatory processes or pulp and tish 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.850
 regressive and degenerative processes or 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.320
 octopus and s and pulp death or necrosis is 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.869
 interesting to know the various 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.450
 classifications published during the 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.190
 last years compare them and deduce which 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.740
 it must be its practical application 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.180
 this is all for now to see the 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.230
