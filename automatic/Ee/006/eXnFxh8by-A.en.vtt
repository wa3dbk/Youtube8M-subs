some stem the first thing you have to do
with<00:01:10.290> boutonnieres<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.159> wire<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:12.150> flower<00:01:12.450> any

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
with boutonnieres is wire the flower any

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.240 
with boutonnieres is wire the flower any
reason<00:01:13.110> why<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.619> wire<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:13.890> is

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
reason why you have to wire it is

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.539 
reason why you have to wire it is
because<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:15.090> has<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:16.369> pretty<00:01:17.369> much

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
because it has to have a pretty much

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.539 
because it has to have a pretty much
stiff<00:01:17.939> look<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.530> has<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.710> be<00:01:19.979> pinned<00:01:20.220> on

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
stiff look and it has to be pinned on

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.570 
stiff look and it has to be pinned on
you<00:01:20.880> could<00:01:21.869> pin<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.259> just<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:22.770> this

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
you could pin it on just like this

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.899 
you could pin it on just like this
however<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.750> flower<00:01:25.049> may<00:01:25.560> actually<00:01:25.909> be

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
however the flower may actually be

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.499 
however the flower may actually be
tilted<00:01:27.570> or<00:01:27.960> bend<00:01:28.520> and<00:01:29.520> then<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:30.090> will<00:01:30.240> be<00:01:30.360> any

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
tilted or bend and then it will be any

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.840 
tilted or bend and then it will be any
good<00:01:30.720> but<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.079> stem<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.710> wiring<00:01:32.220> helps<00:01:32.579> keep

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
good but the stem the wiring helps keep

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.880 
good but the stem the wiring helps keep
the<00:01:33.240> stem<00:01:33.509> straight<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.170> last<00:01:34.560> longer

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the stem straight and last longer

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.550 
the stem straight and last longer
throughout<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.790> day<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:37.170> first<00:01:37.500> thing

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
throughout the day so the first thing

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.190
