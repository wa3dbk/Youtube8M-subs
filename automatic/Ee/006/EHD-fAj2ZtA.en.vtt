00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.669
 sulfur stink tutorial perseveres in the 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.610
 normal tutorial tutorials for people 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:16.080
 normal to wear normal makeup 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.699
 used the number 24 of the dreams of 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.939
 lg paola p 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.160
 it is a purple matte eye shadow designed 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.349
 from my beloved one elects dreams 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.349
 on the back of the channel I leave the link 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.070
 in the info box of eleonora a person 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.190
 awesome 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.080
 so I'm not sure he is 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.390
 good in the sense according names but does not 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.610
 so there are conflicting opinions on 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.670
 this color and tells me I 'm good there is 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.960
 who tells me you're sick I don't 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.070
 they convince I'm sure you say so 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.380
 a shrewdness only as it is 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.730
 slightly unpleasant to put me to 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.340
 example the first time unused 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.780
 uses essence linen companions 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.790
 since it was not so good a little 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.610
 panel uses a good I brush 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.230
 This use of zero to get you 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.730
 understand the best brush I have is the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.830
 says a lot about the quality employees that 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.780
 I still have these good ones 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.310
 brushes that I know tutorial tell me a little 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.310
 what do you think 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.810
 but it's not a halloween touch I swear now 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.659
 looks like we're just at halloween 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.090
 fine but I do not have a concealer I do not have for 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.170
 nothing for like a little colored cream 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:26.100
 but tough i 'm as beautiful as natural as 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:30.180
 the tuna watches the less epic tutorial 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.909
 painterly on the eyelid or slightly 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.670
 wet the brush is in fact a bit 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:42.270
 less intense because the product is getting 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:46.620
 starting dry now I take dreams 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:51.680
 skin number 24 for the obligation 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.680
 slowly over all the fear 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.180
 I swear it's not a halloween trick 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:07.860
 then like a pen brush I take 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:11.130
 marzipan of to face to face is more than 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:19.740
 having faded hallows smoke with 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:22.620
 pen brush with masi pan apply 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.690
 the concealer because I let it dry 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.400
 this corrector therefore just for 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.870
 always less dead because we say 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.870
 that the glasses are seen from afar 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.510
 then in the kata photo a kilo 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:46.350
 I bring the concealer to the car 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.200

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:33.280
 number that I always forget a number 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:34.810

 concealer that if we were not, I will burn a 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.140
 lip balm a board they are planning 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.910
