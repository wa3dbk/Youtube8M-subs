00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
draw a bullet hole we just draw like a

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:22.270 
draw a bullet hole we just draw like a
circle<00:06:17.210> like<00:06:17.270> that<00:06:17.330> and<00:06:20.860> then<00:06:21.860> the<00:06:22.010> crack<00:06:22.250> of

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 
circle like that and then the crack of

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.850 
circle like that and then the crack of
the<00:06:22.460> yeah

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.340 

and<00:06:26.280> then<00:06:26.520> uh<00:06:26.550> so<00:06:27.450> the<00:06:27.570> bolt<00:06:27.780> comes<00:06:27.990> in<00:06:28.170> and

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
and then uh so the bolt comes in and

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.770 
and then uh so the bolt comes in and
creates<00:06:28.830> an<00:06:28.920> indentation<00:06:29.390> it<00:06:30.390> sounds<00:06:30.660> like

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
creates an indentation it sounds like

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:37.389
