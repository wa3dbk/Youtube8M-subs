00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
seed beads onto a spool of 26 gauge

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.010 
seed beads onto a spool of 26 gauge
craft<00:00:14.940> wire<00:00:16.490> so<00:00:17.490> she's<00:00:17.880> leaving<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.270> wire<00:00:18.539> on

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
craft wire so she's leaving the wire on

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.900 
craft wire so she's leaving the wire on
the<00:00:19.500> spool<00:00:19.770> she<00:00:20.039> hasn't<00:00:20.220> caught<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.580> piece<00:00:20.850> of

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
the spool she hasn't caught a piece of

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.730 
the spool she hasn't caught a piece of
it<00:00:21.180> she's<00:00:21.420> just<00:00:21.480> stringing<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.140> bunch<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.500> them

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
it she's just stringing a bunch of them

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
it she's just stringing a bunch of them
directly<00:00:23.460> on<00:00:24.019> so<00:00:25.019> she<00:00:25.650> has<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.099> best<00:00:26.279> success

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
directly on so she has the best success

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.939 
directly on so she has the best success
when<00:00:27.029> she<00:00:27.269> strings<00:00:27.840> them<00:00:28.080> individually

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
when she strings them individually

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.560 
when she strings them individually
some<00:00:29.369> people<00:00:29.670> have<00:00:29.849> success<00:00:30.269> when<00:00:30.539> they

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
some people have success when they

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.359 
some people have success when they
scooped<00:00:31.050> them<00:00:31.230> up<00:00:31.289> Carolyn<00:00:32.040> would<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.279> like

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
scooped them up Carolyn would you like

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.479 
scooped them up Carolyn would you like
to<00:00:32.489> demonstrate<00:00:32.669> scooping<00:00:33.450> them<00:00:37.309> let's<00:00:38.309> see

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
to demonstrate scooping them let's see

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.780 
to demonstrate scooping them let's see
how<00:00:38.579> you're<00:00:38.790> letting<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.410> couple<00:00:40.410> at<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> time

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
how you're letting in a couple at a time

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.180 
how you're letting in a couple at a time
so<00:00:41.790> try<00:00:42.510> different<00:00:43.020> techniques<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.770> see<00:00:43.920> what

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
so try different techniques and see what

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.250 
so try different techniques and see what
works<00:00:44.399> best<00:00:44.520> for<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.690> once<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.110> have

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
works best for you so once you have

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.400 
works best for you so once you have
about<00:00:46.860> four<00:00:47.190> feet<00:00:47.399> strung<00:00:47.989> then<00:00:48.989> you'll<00:00:49.200> move

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
about four feet strung then you'll move

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.130 
about four feet strung then you'll move
on<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.829> next<00:00:50.010> step<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.550> we're<00:00:50.940> going<00:00:51.059> to

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
on to the next step so we're going to

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.930 
on to the next step so we're going to
wait<00:00:52.140> while<00:00:52.410> Carolyn<00:00:52.829> strings<00:00:53.129> four<00:00:53.370> feet<00:00:53.610> and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
wait while Carolyn strings four feet and

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.860 
wait while Carolyn strings four feet and
we'll<00:00:54.780> come<00:00:54.960> back<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.379> okay<00:00:56.360> so<00:00:57.360> she<00:00:57.420> has

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
we'll come back to you okay so she has

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.410 
we'll come back to you okay so she has
strong<00:00:58.289> four<00:00:58.680> feet<00:00:58.910> what<00:00:59.910> she's<00:01:00.059> going<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.239> do

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
strong four feet what she's going to do

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.900 
strong four feet what she's going to do
next<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.899> string<00:01:01.410> her<00:01:01.680> button<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> middle

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
next is string her button to the middle

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
taken her wrist measurement times two

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.109 
taken her wrist measurement times two
and<00:01:07.950> then<00:01:08.430> we've<00:01:08.549> added<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:09.119> foot<00:01:10.400> so<00:01:11.400> she's

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
and then we've added a foot so she's

going<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.420> string<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> middle<00:01:15.799> and

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
going to string that to the middle and

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.350 
going to string that to the middle and
as<00:01:17.220> soon<00:01:17.400> as<00:01:17.490> she<00:01:17.549> gets<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> middle

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
as soon as she gets it in the middle

a<00:02:20.450> few<00:02:20.600> good<00:02:20.810> times<00:02:21.080> and<00:02:21.819> it's<00:02:22.819> easier<00:02:23.180> if<00:02:23.390> you

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
a few good times and it's easier if you

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.699 
a few good times and it's easier if you
twist<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.319> cord<00:02:24.680> rather<00:02:25.190> than<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:26.209> wire<00:02:26.900> but

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
twist the cord rather than the wire but

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.340 
twist the cord rather than the wire but
do<00:02:27.890> what<00:02:28.100> works<00:02:28.280> best<00:02:28.580> for<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:29.000> so<00:02:29.989> once<00:02:30.170> she

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
do what works best for you so once she

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.020 
do what works best for you so once she
does<00:02:30.500> that<00:02:30.739> we'll<00:02:31.130> let<00:02:31.250> you<00:02:31.400> take<00:02:31.550> a<00:02:31.610> good<00:02:31.880> look

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
does that we'll let you take a good look

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.960 
does that we'll let you take a good look
at<00:02:32.209> it<00:02:32.239> so<00:02:32.540> you<00:02:32.630> can<00:02:32.810> see<00:02:36.160> so<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.580> know<00:02:37.790> it's

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
at it so you can see so I know it's

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.140 
at it so you can see so I know it's
black<00:02:38.180> on<00:02:38.360> black<00:02:38.540> but<00:02:39.230> I<00:02:39.970> imagine<00:02:40.970> you'll<00:02:41.120> be

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
black on black but I imagine you'll be

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.920 
black on black but I imagine you'll be
able<00:02:41.329> to<00:02:41.600> see<00:02:41.810> good<00:02:42.380> deal<00:02:43.180> so<00:02:44.180> then<00:02:44.600> what<00:02:44.780> she's

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
able to see good deal so then what she's

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.330 
able to see good deal so then what she's
going<00:02:45.049> to<00:02:45.110> do<00:02:45.290> is<00:02:45.410> she's<00:02:45.560> going<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:45.799> slide<00:02:46.070> some

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
going to do is she's going to slide some

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.620 
going to do is she's going to slide some
of<00:02:46.370> those<00:02:46.549> beads<00:02:46.820> up<00:02:47.090> to<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.680> cord<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:49.630> she's

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
of those beads up to the cord and she's

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.050 
of those beads up to the cord and she's
going<00:02:50.810> to<00:02:50.870> kind<00:02:51.380> of<00:02:51.440> have<00:02:51.739> to<00:02:51.970> she'll<00:02:52.970> be

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
going to kind of have to she'll be

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.390 
going to kind of have to she'll be
having<00:02:53.209> to<00:02:53.450> slide<00:02:54.049> the<00:02:54.260> beads<00:02:54.470> up<00:02:54.680> along<00:02:55.220> the

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
having to slide the beads up along the

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.900 
having to slide the beads up along the
way<00:02:55.519> so<00:02:56.170> don't<00:02:57.170> slide<00:02:57.680> all<00:02:58.010> of<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.489> beads<00:02:58.700> up

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
way so don't slide all of the beads up

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.180 
way so don't slide all of the beads up
as<00:02:59.120> you<00:02:59.360> go<00:02:59.510> just<00:02:59.810> sections<00:03:00.680> of<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:00.950> time

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
as you go just sections of the time

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.819 
as you go just sections of the time
sections<00:03:01.910> at<00:03:02.030> a<00:03:02.060> time<00:03:02.150> work<00:03:02.510> so<00:03:02.930> notice<00:03:03.709> how

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
sections at a time work so notice how

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.060 
sections at a time work so notice how
she<00:03:03.920> is<00:03:04.130> twisting<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.790> bracelet<00:03:05.239> around<00:03:05.480> as

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
she is twisting the bracelet around as

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.420 
she is twisting the bracelet around as
she<00:03:07.070> is<00:03:07.130> kind<00:03:07.880> of<00:03:08.109> lining<00:03:09.109> the<00:03:09.230> beads<00:03:09.440> up<00:03:09.680> as

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
she is kind of lining the beads up as

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.280 
she is kind of lining the beads up as
she<00:03:10.700> is<00:03:10.760> coiling<00:03:11.269> it's<00:03:11.510> going<00:03:11.810> to<00:03:11.870> take<00:03:12.079> up

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
she is coiling it's going to take up

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.039 
she is coiling it's going to take up
some<00:03:12.500> slack<00:03:12.950> in<00:03:13.130> a<00:03:13.220> wire<00:03:13.430> so<00:03:14.120> you'll<00:03:14.690> notice

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
some slack in a wire so you'll notice

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.900 
some slack in a wire so you'll notice
that<00:03:15.320> it's<00:03:15.650> important<00:03:16.280> that<00:03:16.310> we<00:03:16.430> keep<00:03:16.700> the

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
that it's important that we keep the

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.640 
that it's important that we keep the
wire<00:03:17.090> actually<00:03:17.390> on<00:03:17.690> the<00:03:17.840> spool<00:03:18.109> because<00:03:18.470> the

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
wire actually on the spool because the

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.270 
wire actually on the spool because the
beads<00:03:18.829> will<00:03:19.070> move<00:03:19.280> down<00:03:20.019> the<00:03:21.019> wire<00:03:21.260> and<00:03:21.620> we'll

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
beads will move down the wire and we'll

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.250 
beads will move down the wire and we'll
need<00:03:22.400> more<00:03:22.459> wire<00:03:22.880> than<00:03:23.209> you'd<00:03:23.390> think

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.729 

so<00:03:28.010> she's<00:03:28.879> just<00:03:29.110> boiling<00:03:30.110> and<00:03:30.260> coiling<00:03:30.709> and

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
so she's just boiling and coiling and

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.580 
so she's just boiling and coiling and
moving<00:03:33.739> beads<00:03:33.980> up<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:35.049> coiling<00:03:36.049> and<00:03:36.319> coiling

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
moving beads up and coiling and coiling

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.140 
moving beads up and coiling and coiling
so<00:03:36.920> Carolyn<00:03:37.310> would<00:03:37.400> she<00:03:37.549> get<00:03:37.670> a<00:03:37.700> few<00:03:37.909> turns

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
so Carolyn would she get a few turns

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.550 
so Carolyn would she get a few turns
around<00:03:38.480> why<00:03:38.629> don't<00:03:38.840> you<00:03:38.900> let<00:03:39.049> us<00:03:39.080> take<00:03:39.349> a<00:03:39.379> look

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
around why don't you let us take a look

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.550 
around why don't you let us take a look
at<00:03:39.739> it<00:03:40.150> and<00:03:41.150> get<00:03:41.480> one<00:03:41.599> more<00:03:41.840> silver<00:03:42.230> on<00:03:42.379> there

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
at it and get one more silver on there

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:53.680 
at it and get one more silver on there
okay<00:03:50.980> looks<00:03:51.980> nice<00:03:52.220> so<00:03:52.519> we'll<00:03:53.239> come<00:03:53.390> back<00:03:53.420> to

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690

okay looks nice so we'll come back to
you<00:03:53.750> when<00:03:53.870> she's<00:03:54.079> got<00:03:54.230> a<00:03:54.290> little<00:03:54.560> bit<00:03:54.709> more

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
you when she's got a little bit more

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.520 
you when she's got a little bit more
done

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
done

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.080 
done
okay<00:03:57.530> Carolyn<00:03:57.980> has<00:03:58.129> reached<00:03:58.340> her<00:03:58.579> goal<00:03:58.640> of

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
okay Carolyn has reached her goal of

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.539 
okay Carolyn has reached her goal of
wrapping<00:03:59.660> around<00:03:59.900> until<00:04:00.769> the<00:04:00.920> bracelet<00:04:01.250> just

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
wrapping around until the bracelet just

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.759 
wrapping around until the bracelet just
barely<00:04:01.790> fits<00:04:02.120> around<00:04:02.329> her<00:04:02.690> wrist<00:04:04.120> so<00:04:05.120> you<00:04:05.769> can

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
barely fits around her wrist so you can

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.900 
barely fits around her wrist so you can
see<00:04:07.609> that<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.090> button<00:04:08.299> just<00:04:08.420> barely<00:04:09.379> hits

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
see that the button just barely hits

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.949 
see that the button just barely hits
right<00:04:10.910> there

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
right there

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.330 
right there
and<00:04:12.109> so<00:04:12.290> now<00:04:12.440> what<00:04:12.590> she's<00:04:12.769> going<00:04:12.920> to<00:04:13.010> do<00:04:13.190> is

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
and so now what she's going to do is

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.069 
and so now what she's going to do is
she's<00:04:13.640> going<00:04:13.670> to<00:04:13.879> tie<00:04:14.090> an<00:04:14.239> overhand<00:04:14.359> knot<00:04:14.780> with

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
she's going to tie an overhand knot with

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.689 
she's going to tie an overhand knot with
the<00:04:15.109> leather<00:04:15.470> we're<00:04:16.100> going<00:04:16.220> to<00:04:16.280> tie<00:04:16.489> the<00:04:16.549> knot

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699 
the leather we're going to tie the knot

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:21.789 
the leather we're going to tie the knot
first<00:04:17.209> that<00:04:18.199> way<00:04:18.470> if<00:04:18.739> we<00:04:19.370> aren't<00:04:20.530> tying<00:04:21.530> it<00:04:21.680> in

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
first that way if we aren't tying it in

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.439 
first that way if we aren't tying it in
the<00:04:21.919> exact<00:04:22.250> spot<00:04:22.490> we<00:04:22.729> don't<00:04:22.910> have<00:04:23.090> the<00:04:23.210> coil

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:23.449 
the exact spot we don't have the coil

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:28.600 
the exact spot we don't have the coil
done<00:04:23.800> before<00:04:26.320> so<00:04:27.320> that<00:04:27.470> we<00:04:27.620> can<00:04:27.830> change<00:04:28.400> it

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
done before so that we can change it

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:35.710 
done before so that we can change it
basically<00:04:33.099> so<00:04:34.099> and<00:04:34.669> she's<00:04:35.270> going<00:04:35.419> to<00:04:35.479> tie

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
basically so and she's going to tie

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.270 
basically so and she's going to tie
another<00:04:36.020> knot<00:04:37.300> so<00:04:38.300> that<00:04:38.330> she<00:04:39.139> can<00:04:39.380> put<00:04:40.250> the

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
another knot so that she can put the

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:47.820 
another knot so that she can put the
button<00:04:40.639> through<00:04:42.070> so<00:04:43.070> she's<00:04:43.340> sizing<00:04:43.849> it

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:05:01.309 

I<00:04:48.060> like<00:04:49.060> this<00:04:49.240> I<00:04:49.420> don't<00:04:49.480> have<00:04:49.660> to<00:04:49.930> talk

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:01.319 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:04.850 

and<00:05:02.569> she's<00:05:03.569> making<00:05:04.169> sure<00:05:04.319> that<00:05:04.469> the<00:05:04.649> knot<00:05:04.830> is

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
and she's making sure that the knot is

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.589 
and she's making sure that the knot is
placed<00:05:06.589> in<00:05:07.589> the<00:05:07.800> right<00:05:07.979> way<00:05:08.189> and<00:05:08.520> we're<00:05:09.449> going

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
placed in the right way and we're going

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:10.790 
placed in the right way and we're going
to<00:05:09.659> double<00:05:09.869> check<00:05:10.199> to<00:05:10.319> make<00:05:10.349> sure<00:05:10.469> the<00:05:10.680> button

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
to double check to make sure the button

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.519 
to double check to make sure the button
fits<00:05:11.159> through<00:05:11.369> before<00:05:11.699> we<00:05:11.819> go<00:05:11.939> further

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:12.529 
fits through before we go further

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:16.040 
fits through before we go further
perfect<00:05:13.529> so<00:05:14.129> now<00:05:14.509> what<00:05:15.509> we're<00:05:15.629> going<00:05:15.749> to<00:05:15.779> do<00:05:15.930> is

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
perfect so now what we're going to do is

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.489 
perfect so now what we're going to do is
take<00:05:16.289> the<00:05:16.559> tail<00:05:16.949> end<00:05:17.249> of<00:05:17.490> wire<00:05:18.029> and<00:05:18.499> Carolyn

00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:19.499 
take the tail end of wire and Carolyn

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:22.519 
take the tail end of wire and Carolyn
can<00:05:19.740> cut<00:05:20.009> off<00:05:20.249> about<00:05:21.149> maybe<00:05:21.479> six<00:05:22.050> inches<00:05:22.349> of

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:22.529 
can cut off about maybe six inches of

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:24.739 
can cut off about maybe six inches of
wire<00:05:22.710> whatever<00:05:23.610> you<00:05:23.879> think<00:05:24.180> you'll<00:05:24.330> need<00:05:24.479> to

00:05:24.739 --> 00:05:24.749 
wire whatever you think you'll need to

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:27.489 
wire whatever you think you'll need to
get<00:05:24.869> a<00:05:24.899> good<00:05:25.259> spiral<00:05:25.860> going<00:05:26.069> or<00:05:26.460> a<00:05:26.550> good<00:05:26.759> coil

00:05:27.489 --> 00:05:27.499 
get a good spiral going or a good coil

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:32.839 
get a good spiral going or a good coil
and<00:05:29.330> then<00:05:30.619> wrap<00:05:31.619> wrap<00:05:31.860> wrap<00:05:32.129> wrap<00:05:32.159> wrap<00:05:32.399> and

and then wrap wrap wrap wrap wrap and
just<00:05:32.879> coil<00:05:33.270> around<00:05:33.479> and<00:05:34.189> then<00:05:35.189> once<00:05:35.939> you<00:05:36.240> have

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:36.449 
just coil around and then once you have

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:38.570 
just coil around and then once you have
a<00:05:36.479> coil<00:05:36.809> that's<00:05:37.110> sufficient<00:05:37.770> you<00:05:38.159> can<00:05:38.369> trim

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
a coil that's sufficient you can trim

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.219

and you can use pliers if you want I
always<00:05:54.569> use<00:05:54.719> my<00:05:54.899> fingernails<00:05:55.379> because<00:05:55.589> I<00:05:55.800> find

always use my fingernails because I find
that<00:05:56.249> I<00:05:56.490> have<00:05:57.029> more<00:05:57.089> control<00:05:57.599> that<00:05:57.629> way<00:05:57.839> and

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
that I have more control that way and

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:01.329 
that I have more control that way and
that<00:05:58.439> way<00:05:58.559> don't<00:05:58.919> risk<00:05:59.099> scratching<00:05:59.969> the<00:06:00.089> wire

00:06:01.329 --> 00:06:01.339 
that way don't risk scratching the wire

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:07.329 
that way don't risk scratching the wire
Carolyn<00:06:02.339> has<00:06:02.520> chosen<00:06:02.759> to<00:06:03.029> use<00:06:03.089> pliers<00:06:05.870> and

00:06:07.329 --> 00:06:07.339 
Carolyn has chosen to use pliers and

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:11.570 
Carolyn has chosen to use pliers and
then<00:06:08.389> once<00:06:09.389> that<00:06:10.289> is<00:06:10.529> done<00:06:10.800> what<00:06:11.069> she'll<00:06:11.279> do<00:06:11.430> is

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
then once that is done what she'll do is

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.909

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:20.819 
or you can apply glue to the knots if

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:33.149 
or you can apply glue to the knots if
you<00:06:21.029> wish<00:06:21.240> it's<00:06:22.169> not<00:06:22.740> 100%<00:06:23.490> necessary

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:33.159 

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:45.290 

okay<00:06:34.159> you<00:06:34.849> got<00:06:35.090> it<00:06:35.300> yes

00:06:45.300 --> 00:07:01.350 

here<00:06:46.300> we<00:06:46.540> go<00:06:59.460> you<00:07:00.460> may<00:07:00.640> need<00:07:00.790> a<00:07:00.910> friend<00:07:01.150> to<00:07:01.210> do

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 
here we go you may need a friend to do

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.480 
here we go you may need a friend to do
this<00:07:01.510> the<00:07:01.690> first<00:07:01.900> couple<00:07:02.260> of<00:07:02.320> times<00:07:02.490> it's

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.490 
this the first couple of times it's

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.970 
this the first couple of times it's
gonna<00:07:03.730> be<00:07:03.880> stiff<00:07:04.180> but<00:07:04.420> since<00:07:04.720> the<00:07:04.870> wire<00:07:05.080> is

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:05.980 
gonna be stiff but since the wire is

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.380 
gonna be stiff but since the wire is
going<00:07:06.250> to<00:07:06.310> bend<00:07:06.550> in<00:07:06.730> the<00:07:06.850> shape<00:07:07.030> it'll<00:07:07.300> be

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:07.390 
going to bend in the shape it'll be

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.060 
going to bend in the shape it'll be
easier<00:07:07.750> once<00:07:07.990> you<00:07:08.110> get<00:07:08.290> it<00:07:08.410> around<00:07:08.710> your<00:07:08.920> wrist

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.070 
easier once you get it around your wrist

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.720 
easier once you get it around your wrist
the<00:07:09.190> first<00:07:09.400> time

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:09.730
