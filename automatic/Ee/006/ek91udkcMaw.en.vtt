00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.430
 I very much appreciate the dictations dictated are 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.449
 centuries, they are always present in 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.869
 our lives 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:32.590
 they indicate living situations that 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.000
 they happen but there is a saying that I think 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.600
 that it is not true that it does not 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.040
 it works is this saying to good 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:45.309
 half-hearted not enough 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.870
 I'm not re-adapting the saying that says 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.190
 that for a good half-word 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.920
 enough 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.070
 I'm saying this to you 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.830
 because we have a habit in the life of 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.479
 We speak sometimes in a very 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:04.449
 subjective to speak for metaphors 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:06.220
 to talk to others, do not pluralize 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.770
 but our conversation and we are not 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.290
 Clear we are not goals 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.439
 we do not offer to the other thing 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.650
 that we are actually thinking an example 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.780
 that serves in your house, the tutti finds 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.909
 with a friend of yours he asks everything well 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.060
 With you and you 're not well 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.070
 A lot of that, alright, alright, everything alright. 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.470
 day by inept people times a person 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.210
 of intimacy not okay not know 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.150
 also upset by this for tito 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.700
 bored because this happened to me 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.159
 I do not know what kids 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.280
 people get bored pretty at work 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.080
 so this is one aspect so much 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.270
 important thing I want to emphasize for 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.050
 you, but why is it important to 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.390
 whole word because we have 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.420
 of our imagination a desire that the 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.770
 people find out what we think 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.659
 this is a thing from childhood to child 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.520
 thinks parents have the power to know 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.110
 what is she thinking about your pages? 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.010
 with beauty is sometimes very boring 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.810
 very angry 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.090
 The problem is that adults grow with 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.830
 this fantasy that the other has to 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.190
 find out what you are thinking you are 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.080
 in the face she gave hints hour 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.849
 Guys, this is a great stupidity. 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.810
 great nonsense we do not have to 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.659
 find out why people are 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.190
 thinking and what people are wanting 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:23.650
 we need to offer 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.480
 I at work if the patient does not 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.409
 said he 's wondering if it's not clear 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.510
 I'm going to board I will not have the perception 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.200
 Of course I can so I have more 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.120
 abiliity 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.760
 that this work of mine I can perceive 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.190
 some things but it is important if 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.860
 Let's say what we're thinking. 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.920
 This is very important for me these days. 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.980
 I went to meet two friends who 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.560
 They were having lunch and they 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.180
 I meet there to talk and 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.650
 I arrived later and had an interest in 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.819
 talk about a subject even with a 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.760
 of those people 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.650
 He welcomed me and received me, but when I 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.110
 I spoke about it and I just lunch 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.250
 I realized that I needed to withdraw 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.980
 because they had come to 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.420
 talk and I was a bit embarrassed 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.160
 tell the staff will leave leave you 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.730
 talk and my friend told me the 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.010
 next I applauded his attitude to me. 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.780
 I feel old, I'm going to ask you a favor. 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.610
 I would like you to leave me alone with 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.220
 another friend who talks about it with 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.989
 When he said that, he says, man. 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.120
 Cool, that 's what I was saying. 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.799
 taking care of me thinking though I 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.200
 I was a little embarrassed and you told me 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:32.019
 what good feet like this and it deserves a 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.720
 text does not act frankly to ask that I 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:37.239
 I retired, would not they not stay? 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.709
 time you need to talk 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.560
 this is what is important as soon as 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.269
 people tell them what they are 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.819
 thinking as soon as we offer 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.709
 It's true that we say yes to us. 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.510
 let's think that this makes the whole 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.600
 difference in relations in relationships 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.209
 loving relationships with parents is because 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.069
 if we do not talk now after 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.870
 We will charge people 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.310
 we'll get annoyed with people 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.709
 We'll give the change. 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.630
 then that in a relation a relation of 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.769
 work an affective relationship that is 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.590
 fundamental 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:11.739
 another example for example in sex life 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.630
 of couples transit and often this 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.829
 we observe more the woman the woman 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.950
 was not satisfied with the relationship 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.450
 because it obtained a very rapid regulation 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.940
 Why did not you do Jacques? 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.710
 penetrate it and the woman does not say that 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.990
 Why are you upset? I want to stay. 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.610
 bullshit and going by goes the 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.900
 time knows what the danger is and hence 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.900
 she has little interest in sex 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.840
 begins to have pain to get sex begins 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.340
 escape the companion begins to fix or 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.919
 tidying up consciously or unconsciously 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.349
 other symptoms have a headache 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:45.500
 that is boring because it offers the 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:47.480
 true then my message 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.060
 the message in order to stimulate you 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.970
 think about it so always offer 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.730
 it is true that this is very interesting 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.640
 I was already on the bench and left a message 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.650
 to my manager and she did not answer me 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.940
 and then I called back after a 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.730
 cuba time but I had a message 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.590
 she says to the gay man but I do not 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.300
 I think you 're very tired. 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.710
 satisfied with having 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.970
 ax I was not satisfied and 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.280
 I hope so, I wish I had 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.800
 Find it because I feel it leaves me a message 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.800
 I 'll find you this, will not I? 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.330
 again this and of course this is mine 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.770
 way of doing is not a thing either. 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.540
 easy, so we have to be 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.340
 delicate when it will offer the truth 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.620
 for the other but fundamental in 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.990
 relationships if you want to have a 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.130
 healthier with someone always offers 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.630
 What are you feeling? 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.200
 thinking in a delicate way 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.200
 obviously
