00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.629
 Ouch it's all welcome for the finish 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:17.279
 of scan number 686 so here is a scan 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.410
 which begins in beauty since we see 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.720
 simply a new movie that is 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.369
 in preparation now we see naruto and 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.169
 sasuke in color posters 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.939
 you probably had the seller bah 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:29.189
 I'm going to put you 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.929
 the picture in the background we see 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.830
 also the eye of his what is 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.690
 since we were wondering 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.910
 does his eye look uneven and red 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.160
 as 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.470
 as I do not know who or where is the 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.000
 ashtray erin egan campaign this is the 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.590
 answer is given since it is in 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.410
 color and his eye and uneven colors 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.600
 this is finally short so the scan resumes 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.519
 after this little information that is 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.930
 really interesting even if good 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.090
 know that there are often naruto movies 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.830
 every year so it's not really a 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.290
 amazing surprise anyway 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:03.320
 their listening to the Senate had made a 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.350
 small visit remember our friends 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.229
 yz hokage so here is minato without arms I 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.180
 remind him to chew rama and samba 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.180
 but that's okay so he discusses with 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.009
 they have them so they have a plan 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.530
 apparently to be able to stop so his 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.250
 mother we have a second page after and 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.619
 cowboys 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.399
 then I will not comment 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.960
 on naruto who is holding revolvers 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.190
 game we will spend a little bit the photo 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.979
 I put it to you in the background 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.970
 page one is still comic 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.229
 I 'll be the same and we will not do too much 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.680
 of comments on it 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.030
 the fight takes over so here is the mother of the 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.619
 ry cooder senin you know against the 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.470
 roto i fight naruto and his 50 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:46.099
 million clown so she had believed 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.240
 see that the real naruto the real nardo 

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:50.710
 in all these clones was the one that 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.240
 had the bull species in 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.670
 in the back the black balls duration 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.159
 kudu and actually lacks pot he has 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.140
 managed to make a kind of hunger I 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.700
 think I think it's a gay anthem where 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.080
 he was facing the enemy in the belief that 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.210
 it was not really at all 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.850
 was not the real naruto what has 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.459
 saved time and what has 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.810
 allowed his skateboard to arrive on the 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.910
 terrain so now that's what 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.140
 came back from the parallel world in 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.370
 which he was stuck then as I 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.590
 had said it last time it's 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.080
 complicated because in its place I would have 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.239
 really scared what is she she's me 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.560
 simply because you 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.060
 have you really noticed it 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.769
 loved crisis all the elements and she 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.180
 did that very quickly so who got 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.140
 so much trouble to bring back that 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.110
 what am I told myself if 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.940
 frankly go there he re he returns 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.330
 in the blink of an eye it's really 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.850
 mess 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.500
 anyway they are all 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.800
 set together now so here is 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.010
 they are all kakashi sakura obito 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.470
 naruto and sasuke so we see cape to 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.360
 kaguya pardon excuse me a developed 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.980
 a new technique and which we 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.489
 shows once again his immense 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.760
 power 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.660
 she's just doing how 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.310
 can say that 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.860
 I do not know how we could 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.600
 as you might say it's wrong 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.820
 it's gravity finally she uses the 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.770
 gravity let's say to bring back everything 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.780
 any object finally any matter towards the 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.050
 soil from which they are all stuck towards the 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.270
 ground 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.890
 they have a lot of trouble moving so that 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.910
 it's a really interesting power 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.710
 unfortunately it is a counterpart 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.870
 since she too is apparently 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.150
 really weighed down and she really has 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.110
 bad to move too so that's it would have 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.390
 been a good immobilization technique 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.070
 of the enemy if she could do it 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.840
 only on the enemy here it is 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.210
 colossal it will move is perfect 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.070
 unfortunately she is struggling too 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.640
 but she still manages to send 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:36.290
 two species of back then the last 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.030
 I had spoken a little bit about the clan 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.800
 who marot me where I said that the 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.390
 technique to look like it's getting in 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.970
 more frankly so I really think 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.310
 that there is a connection between this woman and the 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.440
 so king marot clan I think we 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.910
 will see it in the past but there really 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.830
 it really looks really like 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.690
 anyway kakashi this but 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.850
 in front of that what to protect it and 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.980
 obito gets in front of naruto for the 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.350
 also protect since kabuya is in 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.350
 train to send these species backs that's it 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.550
 so she wants to kill Naruto and Sasuke and 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.640
 there we see the two cases cash and 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:10.190
 obito protect the young prodigies we go 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.370
 say and when we see two peaks a 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.820
 obito 1 / kakashi spell we see obito 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.440
 used are camille for to do 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.980
 disappear the peak that are heading right 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.410
 kakashi glory and obviously he he 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.570
 takes the peak that was intended for him 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.770
 so here I think it was a 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.930
 little suicide action 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.610
 I had said in previous scans 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.160
 anyway it was not long before my 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.560
 notice to die in hospitals because 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.180
 that it's been a long time since 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.740
 finally here is remember here that we have it 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.390
 we had known price finally we had him 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.240
 removed his jewels he was in agony 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.890
 he was alive thanks to half of 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.529
 below and it's not really it was 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.809
 it was a bit 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:51.699
 survival rather than life is there from 

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:53.739
 shot he apparently commits suicide 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.869
 save naruto and at the same time they in 

00:04:53.739 --> 00:04:59.889
 take advantage to save kakashi that's fine 

00:04:55.869 --> 00:05:02.139
 gesture from him and so I think he 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.819
 will finish on his a little touch we're going 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.219
 to say finish in beauty since it is a 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:09.579
 it's a nice gesture and it reminds you 

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:10.419
 obviously to kakashi both for in 

00:05:09.579 --> 00:05:13.119
 ka-shing hayden cases 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:15.009
 he saved from the rock so that's the 

00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:17.259
 second time he uses his own 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.359
 life to save kakashi that's way 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:21.129
 it was a good scan I do not know too much 

00:05:19.359 --> 00:05:22.479
 how's it going to be since since I 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:24.099
 wanted 10 are stuck on the ground 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.439
 she sent her spades so 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:28.209
 actually hospitals managed to save 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:30.129
 kakashi and to take the pic but nothing 

00:05:28.209 --> 00:05:32.349
 does not prevent kaguya from continuing to send 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:34.809
 spades and reach the target that 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:36.789
 is of course naruto and sasuke 

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:39.189
 we'll see that at the next scan whatever 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:40.899
 in be good remember new movie 

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:42.639
 naruto so I hope you like it 

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:45.069
 a lot at that last round two 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:46.929
 Ninja really liked with the species 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:49.149
 change of mood so listen we are 

00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:51.849
 in a hurry to see him arrive on our 

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:54.519
 French pc and I will make you I think 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:56.319
 a review also two this little movie 

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:58.659
 in any case good end of the day to 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:00.159
 toucy is not too ugly if I look 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:02.949
 I myself did not too bad and we 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:04.719

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:06.929

 chaos
