00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
I want to talk about a pretty advanced

tactic so bear with me here and that is

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.860 
tactic so bear with me here and that is
bluffing<00:00:07.230> let's<00:00:08.040> get<00:00:08.250> started<00:00:08.730> so<00:00:09.690> if<00:00:09.750> you're

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
bluffing let's get started so if you're

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.270 
bluffing let's get started so if you're
watching<00:00:10.050> this<00:00:10.290> then<00:00:10.559> you<00:00:10.620> probably<00:00:10.860> know

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
watching this then you probably know

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.490 
watching this then you probably know
what<00:00:11.490> baiting<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.570> for<00:00:13.019> those<00:00:13.110> who<00:00:13.290> don't

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
what baiting is and for those who don't

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.990 
what baiting is and for those who don't
it's<00:00:13.920> where<00:00:14.099> you<00:00:14.160> try<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.400> trick<00:00:14.610> your<00:00:14.790> point

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
it's where you try to trick your point

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.519 
it's where you try to trick your point
into<00:00:15.330> thinking<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:15.929> are<00:00:15.960> weaker<00:00:16.379> than

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
into thinking that you are weaker than

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.320 
into thinking that you are weaker than
you<00:00:16.650> actually<00:00:16.830> are<00:00:17.130> then<00:00:17.730> pull<00:00:17.970> out<00:00:18.060> something

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
you actually are then pull out something

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.240 
you actually are then pull out something
like<00:00:18.570> an<00:00:18.690> ally<00:00:18.960> coming<00:00:19.230> in<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.439> gank<00:00:19.650> or<00:00:19.830> maybe

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
like an ally coming in to gank or maybe

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.519 
like an ally coming in to gank or maybe
just<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.580> lot<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.880> burst<00:00:21.060> damage<00:00:21.529> bluffing

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
just a lot of burst damage bluffing

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.439 
just a lot of burst damage bluffing
however<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:23.160> kind<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.490> like<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.730> opposite<00:00:24.300> of

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
however is kind of like the opposite of

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.480 
however is kind of like the opposite of
baiting<00:00:24.900> instead<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.769> pretending<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.279> you

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
baiting instead of pretending that you

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.939 
baiting instead of pretending that you
don't<00:00:26.820> have<00:00:27.060> an<00:00:27.240> advantage<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.869> pretend<00:00:28.619> that

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
don't have an advantage you pretend that

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.759 
don't have an advantage you pretend that
you<00:00:29.250> do<00:00:29.609> have<00:00:30.029> an<00:00:30.210> advantage<00:00:30.590> bluffing<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.710> a

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
you do have an advantage bluffing is a

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.470 
you do have an advantage bluffing is a
great<00:00:32.130> way<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.369> see<00:00:32.669> how<00:00:32.700> your<00:00:33.000> opponent's

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
great way to see how your opponent's

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.360 
great way to see how your opponent's
will<00:00:33.600> react<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.230> particularly<00:00:34.649> situation

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
will react to a particularly situation

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.549 
will react to a particularly situation
for<00:00:35.850> example<00:00:36.390> if<00:00:36.600> my<00:00:36.660> jungler<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.380> out<00:00:37.530> of

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
for example if my jungler is out of

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.950 
for example if my jungler is out of
sight<00:00:37.829> then<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.430> might<00:00:38.640> Bluff<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.149> gank<00:00:39.540> by

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
sight then I might Bluff a gank by

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.020 
sight then I might Bluff a gank by
randomly<00:00:40.440> attempting<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.219> fight<00:00:41.520> after

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
randomly attempting to fight after

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.420 
randomly attempting to fight after
playing<00:00:42.270> defensively<00:00:43.190> assuming<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.309> they

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
playing defensively assuming that they

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.369 
playing defensively assuming that they
do<00:00:44.489> not<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:44.910> solid<00:00:45.210> ward<00:00:45.480> coverage<00:00:45.870> my

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
do not have solid ward coverage my

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.959 
do not have solid ward coverage my
opponents<00:00:46.800> will<00:00:46.920> likely<00:00:47.160> end<00:00:47.309> up<00:00:47.700> thinking

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
opponents will likely end up thinking

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.760 
opponents will likely end up thinking
that<00:00:48.300> they<00:00:48.420> are<00:00:48.450> being<00:00:48.750> ganked<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.260> from

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
that they are being ganked and from

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.010 
that they are being ganked and from
there<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.190> can<00:00:50.610> see<00:00:50.760> how<00:00:51.000> they<00:00:51.180> will<00:00:51.300> react<00:00:51.690> if

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
there I can see how they will react if

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.930 
there I can see how they will react if
they<00:00:52.559> simply<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:52.890> fight<00:00:53.250> us<00:00:53.430> then<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.760> could

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
they simply just fight us then I could

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.580 
they simply just fight us then I could
take<00:00:54.090> advantage<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.750> by<00:00:55.199> having<00:00:55.379> my

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
take advantage of that by having my

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.650 
take advantage of that by having my
jungler<00:00:55.949> come<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.309> for<00:00:56.489> an<00:00:56.550> actual<00:00:57.030> gank<00:00:57.420> and

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
jungler come in for an actual gank and

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.049 
jungler come in for an actual gank and
then<00:00:58.109> execute<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.590> same<00:00:58.859> tactic<00:00:59.370> resulting

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
then execute the same tactic resulting

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.340 
then execute the same tactic resulting
in<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.210> fight<00:01:00.390> where<00:01:00.539> your<00:01:00.660> jungler<00:01:00.960> can<00:01:01.109> come

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
in a fight where your jungler can come

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.770 
in a fight where your jungler can come
in<00:01:01.530> easily<00:01:01.980> whereas<00:01:02.789> if<00:01:03.000> they<00:01:03.120> decide<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.480> back

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
in easily whereas if they decide to back

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.719 
in easily whereas if they decide to back
off<00:01:04.019> when<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.260> Bluff<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.680> gank<00:01:04.890> then<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.519> means

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
off when I Bluff a gank then that means

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:06.980 
off when I Bluff a gank then that means
that<00:01:05.790> playing<00:01:06.150> aggressive<00:01:06.630> versus<00:01:06.869> my

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
that playing aggressive versus my

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.600 
that playing aggressive versus my
opponents<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.770> going<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.130> be<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> good<00:01:08.460> idea

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
opponents is going to be a good idea

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.760 
opponents is going to be a good idea
from<00:01:08.939> there<00:01:09.150> on<00:01:09.360> when<00:01:09.840> my<00:01:09.960> jungler<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.439> hidden

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
from there on when my jungler is hidden

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.560 
from there on when my jungler is hidden
either<00:01:11.250> because<00:01:11.670> they're<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:12.030> scared<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.390> me

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
either because they're just scared of me

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.300 
either because they're just scared of me
or<00:01:12.750> my<00:01:12.990> jungler<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.590> creating<00:01:13.979> enough

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
or my jungler is creating enough

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.280 
or my jungler is creating enough
pressure<00:01:14.640> by<00:01:14.970> not<00:01:15.150> being<00:01:15.330> visible<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.110> map

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
pressure by not being visible on the map

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.219 
pressure by not being visible on the map
that<00:01:17.009> bluffed<00:01:17.430> gank<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:18.270> easily<00:01:18.689> put<00:01:18.930> me<00:01:19.080> in

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
that bluffed gank can easily put me in

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.710 
that bluffed gank can easily put me in
an<00:01:19.320> advantageous<00:01:20.009> situation<00:01:20.420> since<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.570> gives

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
an advantageous situation since it gives

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.800 
an advantageous situation since it gives
me<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> solid<00:01:22.439> read<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:23.100> my<00:01:23.310> opponents<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.570> same

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
me a solid read on my opponents the same

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.450 
me a solid read on my opponents the same
strategies<00:01:25.380> can<00:01:25.619> be<00:01:25.740> used<00:01:25.950> for<00:01:26.189> things<00:01:26.310> like

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
strategies can be used for things like

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.280 
strategies can be used for things like
tower<00:01:26.759> dives<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.540> see<00:01:27.659> if<00:01:27.720> my<00:01:27.869> opponents<00:01:28.229> are

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
tower dives to see if my opponents are

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.620 
tower dives to see if my opponents are
vulnerable<00:01:28.799> flight<00:01:29.430> initiations<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.360> see<00:01:30.509> how

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
vulnerable flight initiations to see how

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.080 
vulnerable flight initiations to see how
scared<00:01:30.960> my<00:01:31.170> opponents<00:01:31.590> are<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.920> me<00:01:32.100> roams<00:01:32.820> to

is especially true with roams and tower
dives<00:01:57.899> Bluffs<00:01:58.860> are<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> great<00:01:59.520> way<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.820> see<00:02:00.149> how

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
dives Bluffs are a great way to see how

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.940 
dives Bluffs are a great way to see how
your<00:02:00.630> opponent<00:02:01.079> will<00:02:01.200> respond<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.829> those

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
your opponent will respond to those

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.810 
your opponent will respond to those
situations

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
situations

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.780 
situations
now<00:02:03.719> obviously<00:02:03.930> bluffing<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.770> not<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.340> perfect

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
now obviously bluffing is not a perfect

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.910 
now obviously bluffing is not a perfect
strategy<00:02:06.000> all<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:07.140> takes<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.560> deal<00:02:07.740> with<00:02:07.890> a

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
strategy all it takes to deal with a

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.609 
strategy all it takes to deal with a
bluff<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.700> know<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.270> it's<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.539> bluff<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.470> be

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
bluff is to know that it's a bluff so be

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.860 
bluff is to know that it's a bluff so be
careful<00:02:11.129> wards<00:02:11.849> are<00:02:11.970> definitely<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.599> biggest

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
careful wards are definitely the biggest

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.610 
careful wards are definitely the biggest
counters<00:02:13.410> to

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
counters to

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.440 
counters to
laughs<00:02:13.799> so<00:02:14.370> being<00:02:14.640> aware<00:02:14.879> of<00:02:14.940> your<00:02:15.060> opponents

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
laughs so being aware of your opponents

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.300 
laughs so being aware of your opponents
awards<00:02:15.720> is<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.870> great<00:02:16.200> thing<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.560> do<00:02:16.709> but<00:02:17.250> that

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
awards is a great thing to do but that

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.729 
awards is a great thing to do but that
isn't<00:02:17.879> always<00:02:18.060> possible<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:19.349> you<00:02:19.409> want<00:02:19.620> to

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
isn't always possible so you want to

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.339 
isn't always possible so you want to
bluff<00:02:19.980> in<00:02:20.129> a<00:02:20.190> way<00:02:20.370> that<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:20.700> low-risk<00:02:21.390> bluff<00:02:22.230> in

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
bluff in a way that is low-risk bluff in

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.660 
bluff in a way that is low-risk bluff in
a<00:02:22.409> way<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.709> involves<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:23.190> very<00:02:23.220> low

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
a way that involves a very low

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.729 
a way that involves a very low
commitment<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.390> doesn't<00:02:24.989> actually<00:02:25.470> use<00:02:25.709> up

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
commitment and doesn't actually use up

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.309 
commitment and doesn't actually use up
very<00:02:26.190> much<00:02:26.489> for<00:02:27.180> example<00:02:27.569> if<00:02:27.690> I<00:02:27.780> want<00:02:28.019> to<00:02:28.110> bluff

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
very much for example if I want to bluff

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.820 
very much for example if I want to bluff
a<00:02:28.409> fight

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
a fight

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.649 
a fight
I<00:02:28.860> might<00:02:29.340> just<00:02:29.519> walk<00:02:29.670> up<00:02:29.879> to<00:02:29.970> my<00:02:30.060> opponents<00:02:30.540> in

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
I might just walk up to my opponents in

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.690 
I might just walk up to my opponents in
an<00:02:30.750> aggressive<00:02:31.049> way<00:02:31.260> but<00:02:32.069> without<00:02:32.370> actually

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
an aggressive way but without actually

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.110 
an aggressive way but without actually
using<00:02:33.360> any<00:02:33.480> abilities<00:02:34.110> or<00:02:34.379> overextending

using any abilities or overextending

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.910 
using any abilities or overextending
significantly<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.480> doesn't<00:02:37.260> take<00:02:37.440> much<00:02:37.709> to

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
significantly it doesn't take much to

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.399 
significantly it doesn't take much to
execute<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.430> bluff<00:02:38.670> properly<00:02:39.269> just<00:02:39.900> know<00:02:40.140> that
