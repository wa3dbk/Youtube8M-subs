00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
that I get the time but on at least 250

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.760 
that I get the time but on at least 250
for<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.329> that's<00:00:42.570> pretty<00:00:43.170> much<00:00:43.260> throwing<00:00:43.680> it

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
for it that's pretty much throwing it

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.709 
for it that's pretty much throwing it
away<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.100> magneto<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.640> probably<00:00:44.940> worth<00:00:45.180> 250

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
away the magneto is probably worth 250

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.279 
away the magneto is probably worth 250
bucks<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.260> its<00:00:46.410> own<00:00:46.610> so<00:00:47.690> it'd<00:00:48.690> be<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.870> good<00:00:49.050> deal

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
bucks on its own so it'd be a good deal

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.670 
bucks on its own so it'd be a good deal
for<00:00:49.500> somebody<00:00:50.180> and<00:00:51.180> as<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.230> can<00:00:52.350> see<00:00:52.379> it's<00:00:52.649> a

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
for somebody and as you can see it's a

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.959 
for somebody and as you can see it's a
bit<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.890> mess<00:00:53.129> here<00:00:53.309> at<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.640> rest<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
bit of a mess here at the rest of the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.770 
bit of a mess here at the rest of the
hydraulic<00:00:54.510> stuff<00:00:54.949> got<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.039> tank<00:00:56.600> hoses<00:00:57.600> other

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
hydraulic stuff got the tank hoses other

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.029 
hydraulic stuff got the tank hoses other
bits<00:00:58.020> i<00:00:58.170> got<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.379> make<00:00:58.500> some<00:00:58.649> new<00:00:58.800> hoses

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
bits i got to make some new hoses

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.139 
bits i got to make some new hoses
because<00:00:59.340> these<00:00:59.460> ones<00:00:59.699> look<00:00:59.760> like<00:00:59.879> they'll

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
because these ones look like they'll

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.389 
because these ones look like they'll
explode<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:01.590> one<00:01:01.710> already<00:01:01.829> has<00:01:01.980> on<00:01:02.309> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
explode that one already has on the

explode that one already has on the
outside<00:01:05.930> it's<00:01:06.930> been<00:01:07.049> playing<00:01:07.320> around

cleaning up the valve body and other

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.850 
cleaning up the valve body and other
bits<00:01:09.150> for<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.049> I'm<00:01:10.290> going<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.470> make<00:01:10.619> room

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
bits for it so I'm going to make room

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.490 
bits for it so I'm going to make room
and<00:01:11.760> then<00:01:11.850> put<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.180> evaporator<00:01:13.049> unit<00:01:13.380> back

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
and then put that evaporator unit back

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.690 
and then put that evaporator unit back
to<00:01:13.680> hear<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.010> really<00:01:14.310> don't<00:01:14.490> know<00:01:14.549> where

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
to hear that I really don't know where

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.580 
to hear that I really don't know where
I'm<00:01:14.820> going<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.000> put<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.180> condenser<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:15.960> put

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
I'm going to put the condenser and put

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.010 
I'm going to put the condenser and put
the<00:01:16.680> evaporator<00:01:17.189> up<00:01:17.400> here<00:01:17.850> but<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.720> got<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.930> run

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
the evaporator up here but I got to run

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.740 
the evaporator up here but I got to run
the<00:01:19.170> line<00:01:19.350> set<00:01:19.850> possibly<00:01:20.850> outside<00:01:21.299> down<00:01:21.600> the

the line set possibly outside down the

the line set possibly outside down the

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
other side of this wall because there's

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.760 
other side of this wall because there's
another<00:01:23.939> one<00:01:24.180> another<00:01:24.720> fujitsu<00:01:25.229> just<00:01:25.500> along

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
another one another fujitsu just along

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.190 
another one another fujitsu just along
the<00:01:25.799> side<00:01:26.700> there<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.210> probably<00:01:27.540> not<00:01:27.780> directly

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the side there so probably not directly

just<00:01:31.140> out<00:01:31.380> there<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.310> I'll<00:01:32.970> run<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.270> line<00:01:33.450> set

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
just out there and I'll run the line set

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.840 
just out there and I'll run the line set
through<00:01:34.200> there<00:01:34.560> next<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:34.979> bug<00:01:35.220> zapper<00:01:35.729> and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
through there next to the bug zapper and

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.300 
through there next to the bug zapper and
along<00:01:36.689> next<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.560> truss<00:01:38.750> so<00:01:40.040> i'll<00:01:41.040> have<00:01:41.189> an

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
along next to the truss so i'll have an

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.160 
along next to the truss so i'll have an
installation<00:01:41.909> video<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.479> one<00:01:42.960> i'll

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
installation video on that one i'll

real<00:03:44.190> rear<00:03:44.489> brakes<00:03:44.790> next<00:03:45.239> we<00:03:46.230> have<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.410> front

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
real rear brakes next we have the front

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.350 
real rear brakes next we have the front
brakes<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:47.070> is<00:03:47.280> he's<00:03:47.880> done<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.150> front

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
brakes that is he's done the front

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.550 
brakes that is he's done the front
brakes<00:03:48.570> I'll<00:03:48.780> probably<00:03:48.900> tackle<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.380> rear

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
brakes I'll probably tackle the rear

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.420 
brakes I'll probably tackle the rear

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
ones which are inboard discs so can't

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.430 
ones which are inboard discs so can't
get<00:03:53.580> rid<00:03:53.670> of<00:03:53.730> that<00:03:53.790> engine<00:03:54.150> and<00:03:54.390> put<00:03:55.290> that

kit<00:04:18.810> and<00:04:19.530> tired<00:04:19.769> of<00:04:19.859> this<00:04:19.980> intake<00:04:20.580> was<00:04:20.760> busted

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
kit and tired of this intake was busted

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.510 
kit and tired of this intake was busted
off<00:04:21.359> so<00:04:21.720> all<00:04:22.410> that<00:04:22.650> was<00:04:22.770> busted<00:04:23.160> actually<00:04:23.460> I

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520

off so all that was busted actually I
admit<00:04:23.850> I've<00:04:24.000> ticked<00:04:24.300> it<00:04:24.419> up<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:25.050> mess

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040

that's got rust pitting in the bore and
everything<00:04:36.970> and<00:04:37.090> it<00:04:37.150> keeps<00:04:37.330> going<00:04:37.720> so<00:04:38.710> you're

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
everything and it keeps going so you're

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.150 
everything and it keeps going so you're
staying<00:04:39.389> that's<00:04:40.389> a<00:04:40.510> little<00:04:40.720> two-stroke<00:04:41.710> it's

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
staying that's a little two-stroke it's

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.560 
staying that's a little two-stroke it's
got<00:04:42.280> a<00:04:42.310> Bosch<00:04:42.550> magneto<00:04:43.030> system<00:04:43.479> and

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
got a Bosch magneto system and

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.420 
got a Bosch magneto system and
everything<00:04:43.840> on<00:04:43.960> it<00:04:43.990> no<00:04:44.830> idea<00:04:45.100> who<00:04:45.250> actually

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
everything on it no idea who actually

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.920 
everything on it no idea who actually
made<00:04:45.820> it<00:04:46.000> I<00:04:46.030> think<00:04:46.090> it<00:04:46.300> might<00:04:46.419> be<00:04:46.449> chef<00:04:46.780> an

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
made it I think it might be chef an

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.040 
made it I think it might be chef an
arker<00:04:47.260> or<00:04:47.410> some<00:04:47.740> German<00:04:48.130> company<00:04:48.900> there's<00:04:49.900> the

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
arker or some German company there's the

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.210 
arker or some German company there's the
Briggs<00:04:50.290> which<00:04:50.500> I<00:04:51.000> shave<00:04:52.000> the<00:04:52.240> head<00:04:52.449> down<00:04:52.750> on<00:04:53.220> so

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
Briggs which I shave the head down on so

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.650 
Briggs which I shave the head down on so
it's<00:04:54.370> a<00:04:54.430> really<00:04:54.610> high<00:04:54.850> compression<00:04:55.270> right

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
it's a really high compression right

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.529 
it's a really high compression right
experiment<00:04:56.500> engine<00:04:56.889> but<00:04:57.760> it<00:04:57.940> has<00:04:58.060> a<00:04:58.090> busted

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
experiment engine but it has a busted

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.860 
experiment engine but it has a busted
ring<00:04:58.780> so<00:04:59.680> it's<00:05:00.340> it<00:05:01.150> was<00:05:01.300> an<00:05:01.389> experimental

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
ring so it's it was an experimental

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.250 
ring so it's it was an experimental
thing<00:05:02.260> it's<00:05:02.440> good<00:05:02.560> for<00:05:02.590> parts<00:05:03.810> still<00:05:04.810> runs<00:05:05.020> I'm

either<00:05:38.740> end<00:05:39.010> up<00:05:39.160> at<00:05:39.310> a<00:05:39.370> Morris<00:05:39.870> specialist<00:05:40.870> as

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
either end up at a Morris specialist as

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.129 
either end up at a Morris specialist as
a<00:05:41.080> spare<00:05:41.349> parts<00:05:41.740> pile<00:05:42.039> or<00:05:42.690> maybe<00:05:43.690> somebody

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:44.139 
a spare parts pile or maybe somebody

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:46.710 
a spare parts pile or maybe somebody
might<00:05:44.349> want<00:05:44.560> to<00:05:44.620> adopt<00:05:44.860> it<00:05:45.130> i<00:05:45.360> think<00:05:46.360> i<00:05:46.479> paid

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
might want to adopt it i think i paid

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.390 
might want to adopt it i think i paid
about<00:05:46.900> 50<00:05:47.320> bucks<00:05:47.470> for<00:05:47.620> the<00:05:47.800> whole<00:05:47.950> lot<00:05:48.220> and

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
about 50 bucks for the whole lot and

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.070 
about 50 bucks for the whole lot and
I've<00:05:48.490> spent<00:05:48.789> God<00:05:49.060> knows<00:05:49.270> how<00:05:49.479> much<00:05:49.630> on<00:05:49.840> it<00:05:49.870> but

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
I've spent God knows how much on it but

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.589 
I've spent God knows how much on it but
I<00:05:50.729> probably<00:05:51.729> get<00:05:51.910> rid<00:05:52.030> of<00:05:52.090> the<00:05:52.180> whole<00:05:52.330> project

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
I probably get rid of the whole project

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:54.960 
I probably get rid of the whole project

cover it is having a few issues at the

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.050 
cover it is having a few issues at the
moment<00:06:26.680> but<00:06:27.160> you<00:06:28.120> get<00:06:28.270> that<00:06:28.470> and<00:06:30.060> again

moment but you get that and again
computers<00:06:31.990> are<00:06:32.080> going<00:06:32.199> to<00:06:32.260> work<00:06:32.410> through<00:06:32.770> they

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:32.979 
computers are going to work through they

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:35.490 
computers are going to work through they
all<00:06:33.099> work<00:06:33.370> fine<00:06:33.699> I<00:06:34.090> just<00:06:34.510> don't<00:06:34.960> know<00:06:35.140> the<00:06:35.320> need

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:35.500 
all work fine I just don't know the need

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.710 
all work fine I just don't know the need
for<00:06:35.800> slower<00:06:36.760> older<00:06:37.240> computers

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 
for slower older computers

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.620 
for slower older computers
like<00:06:38.900> one<00:06:39.110> point<00:06:39.470> as<00:06:40.130> 1.8<00:06:40.730> giga<00:06:40.910> hertz<00:06:41.270> that's

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:41.630 
like one point as 1.8 giga hertz that's

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.410 
like one point as 1.8 giga hertz that's
maybe<00:06:41.900> two<00:06:42.230> points<00:06:42.590> something<00:06:43.130> I<00:06:43.370> might<00:06:44.180> keep

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:44.420 
maybe two points something I might keep

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.080 
maybe two points something I might keep
this<00:06:44.570> one<00:06:44.810> is<00:06:44.990> the<00:06:45.110> cool<00:06:45.320> case<00:06:45.620> but<00:06:45.920> the<00:06:46.790> slower

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090 
this one is the cool case but the slower

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.740 
this one is the cool case but the slower
ones<00:06:47.210> like<00:06:47.600> in<00:06:47.780> there<00:06:48.080> I<00:06:48.790> don't<00:06:49.790> know<00:06:49.850> scrap

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:50.750 
ones like in there I don't know scrap

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.760 
ones like in there I don't know scrap
