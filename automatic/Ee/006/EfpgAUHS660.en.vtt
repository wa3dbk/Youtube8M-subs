00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:20.939
 to all those like me 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.109
 they use the ipad also to see the very thick 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:26.100
 some good films 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.369

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.390

 matera 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.450
 they are giving me maria updates but still suffering 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.730
 always of the same problem 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.260
 of the recall of the images that I am a little scazzi see not come to an end 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.129
 it is not seen in an optimal manner 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.010
 a little bit you suffer this problem 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.950
 and personally I've never seen a movie via ipse dixit 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.630
 it's on it's play irmao always converted my x's to where you got me 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.170
 harley 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.320
 scenes filmed 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.030
 that I have on the PC 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.020
 but mp4 format to be able to view them with the integrated reader 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.270
 of the fairies 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.280
 but it is an application that takes away time 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.030
 a film with ventilation what they are 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.580
 a 7 8 minutes if not more then when we want to put a dozen 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.700
 movies are save for the time taken to convert 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.920
 very very 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.640
 long 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.920
 today came this beautiful application that is both x play hard grinders 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.580
 that does nothing but 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.410
 do the same things that yx play yara does 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.430
 one of those who also have the name 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.700
 mother does much better 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.049
 let's say that siemens driver 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.869
 does not play many formats this application reproduces only xd 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.670
 you then all the movies you 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.970
 usually if they download 'nsomma ad aware belon they convert to the dvd 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:06.610
 original 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.299
 but anyway it is 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:10.940
 most of the video files we have 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.740
 only in this way therefore I believe that this is the final version 

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:21.469
 to fill our signature part without wasting even a second 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.450
 to convert our video feet to the only time that squeaked in quotes 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.089
 it will take us to transfer our videos 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.239
 among the ideas the file sharing diet a very simple person sowing 1 that you 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.989

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.179
 I was really surprised by his life 

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:46.889
 of images that are practically identical to those of the film in Turin 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:51.899
 dario none.the flashforward and in avi format and look at the 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.689

 direct tieffe that there is absolutely no delay or rush 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:07.479
 in images with gad lerner the film will be kind of true that it is 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:12.829
 big tits then rsrsrsrs we shouldn't do a black dress 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.109

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:31.889
 club really a surprise this application especially thanks for 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:33.069
 it's free 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.339
 we have not said but because the card is the difference of resignation xperia arc e 

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:40.429
 lump nevano history a much greater cost 

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:45.499
 the person so free I think is the definitive solution tonight ours 

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:47.559
 problems 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:52.439
 also file conversion me honestly always has an annoyed parking space 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:03.430
 especially when close that I'm about to leave the house I have to take my ipad one 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:07.309
 that in the end I do not report what I do not have time to convert it into this 

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:10.879
 case, on the other hand, very few second courses transfer mode for all the films that 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.949
 we wish he laughs inside cinexplayer he hurt to see on the mac

 this operation of transferring my video files from our pc 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.479
 within this fever 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.479
 and I'm embracing a simple past rinostil 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:27.610
 our videos 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.219
 from pc or mac 

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:32.580
 inside x3 it will be enough to open tunz file go 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.580
 if it is our pub connected as you see 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:38.099
 level applications 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:41.150
 down 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.889
 there is the chapel dedicated to sharing documents we will find 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.300
 we will select cinexplayer 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.729
 as you see here is flashforward I will put another string earlier 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.289
 master go 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.469
 another 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:56.719
 transfer 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:57.779
 quick way 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:00.830
 within our part for example up 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.430
 which has the same film I had tried on csplay pigeons 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.430
 because I showed com 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.419
 images baron way jerky 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.919
 we will see now how cinexplayer behaves instead for the same movie in the 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.529
 same file 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:19.469
 we will see the reproduction 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:21.830

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.830
 hamster a dvd rip as you see this a movie 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.360
 but therefore complex from an original dvd 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.490
 and therefore much more 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.499
 as the respect says 1 episode 

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:39.729

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:45.999

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.069
 how to see been added here above 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:09.039
 but what I want to show you is selecting the same file that we were 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:12.039
 previously seeing therefore flashforward and there will be a resuming 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:14.789

 but really 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.110
 extremely fluid

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.949
 a really amazing person especially because free and 

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:03.050
 and achieves internet results - application like the sun shining 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.249
 it costs us around 4 euros 

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:08.020
 stay close to getting 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.210
 so far youtube cinexplayer 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.210
 gives me a view as they say in Rome 

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:19.389
 but without penis odor they also have the ability to view movies 

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:22.689
 in hd such as mk2 

00:07:22.689 --> 00:07:25.689
 but it will really be the ideal shoes to take advantage of 

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:29.490
 fir take full advantage of the quality of the drinking screen as 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.180
 we know it supports 

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.180
 television broke 

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:40.289
 and it is an application that needless to say that the advice to all the best 

00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:46.229
 you can see a movie alone beats a pleasure - oriental furniture 

00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:49.229
 main when I'm out 

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.050
 stay with the cards on the bed on the traveling train 

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:54.849
 Wherever you are 

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:57.139
