00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.820 
we we're trying to adopt him and make
sure<00:05:41.060> that<00:05:41.420> we've<00:05:41.570> got<00:05:41.600> as<00:05:41.930> part<00:05:42.230> of<00:05:42.380> our<00:05:42.530> games

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
we've shown that where we are going off

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.720 
we've shown that where we are going off
a<00:05:44.780> level<00:05:45.080> definitely<00:05:45.860> with<00:05:46.340> yesterday

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
a level definitely with yesterday

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.880 
a level definitely with yesterday
yesterday<00:05:47.240> performance<00:05:47.840> I<00:05:48.020> think<00:05:48.620> we<00:05:48.680> know<00:05:48.800> we

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:48.890 
yesterday performance I think we know we

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:49.870 
yesterday performance I think we know we
need<00:05:48.980> to<00:05:49.040> work<00:05:49.250> on<00:05:49.430> their<00:05:49.610> technical

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
need to work on their technical

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.760 
need to work on their technical
finishing<00:05:50.360> you<00:05:50.810> know<00:05:50.990> to<00:05:51.290> win<00:05:51.440> games<00:05:51.650> you've

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
finishing you know to win games you've

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
finishing you know to win games you've
got<00:05:51.860> to<00:05:51.920> put<00:05:52.010> the<00:05:52.070> ball<00:05:52.220> in<00:05:52.250> the<00:05:52.340> back<00:05:52.490> in<00:05:52.640> there

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
got to put the ball in the back in there

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.220 
got to put the ball in the back in there
and<00:05:52.940> we<00:05:53.000> didn't<00:05:53.180> do<00:05:53.240> that<00:05:53.300> tonight<00:05:53.510> I<00:05:53.840> think

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:54.230 
and we didn't do that tonight I think

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.480 
and we didn't do that tonight I think
tonight<00:05:54.560> was<00:05:54.710> another<00:05:54.950> brick<00:05:55.220> in<00:05:55.250> the<00:05:55.460> wall

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
tonight was another brick in the wall

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.370 
tonight was another brick in the wall
even<00:05:55.880> though<00:05:55.970> it's<00:05:56.120> really<00:05:56.300> hard<00:05:56.900> to<00:05:57.170> take

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
even though it's really hard to take

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.770 
even though it's really hard to take
it's<00:05:58.190> more<00:05:58.520> evidence<00:05:58.970> that<00:05:59.210> we<00:05:59.330> are<00:05:59.510> moving

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
it's more evidence that we are moving

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.810 
it's more evidence that we are moving
towards<00:06:00.470> where<00:06:00.650> we<00:06:00.830> want<00:06:01.010> to<00:06:01.040> be<00:06:01.220> in<00:06:01.490> a<00:06:01.580> year's

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
towards where we want to be in a year's

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.910 
towards where we want to be in a year's
time
