00:00:02.489 --> 00:00:05.489
 and 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.600
 hello easy code friends talk to you 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.670
 gustavo salgado and I am and I am going to 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.700
 accompany in this new series of videos 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:25.740
 tutorials about searching throughout 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:28.180
 of the course we work everything with the version 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.960
 2.3.2 that was the last version of the 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.940
 branch two because bus trap and others and now 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.180
 I made myself enter this url 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.280
 what is the official url of the bus trap 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.710
 we are going to give him in third to give account 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.540
 that many things have changed here 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.640
 they make a direct re bus 3 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.300
 but as you can see it's a release 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.260
 candidate that is the 1 or what is 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.790
 the first version that they release to see 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.340
 to see if it becomes the version 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.710
 official but it still does not mean 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.070
 make it a 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.930
 a version to use in production 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.640
 the same is almost already be ready to 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.060
 be a release has already gone through beta 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.880
 alpha for everything for this whole process 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.400
 so then it's almost ready if they want 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.869
 back to documentation 2.3.2 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.149
 that was what we saw throughout the 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.860
 video tutorial we click here and 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:26.550
 we would have perfectly that 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:31.020
 documentation and we will treat this 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:33.300
 course we're going to talk about version 2.3.2 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.250
 basically because this version the 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.410
 they pulled out already when I was practically 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.020
 finishing doing the courses but not 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:44.310
 worry have calm do not lose 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.840
 the control because in the end I'm going to give 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.360
 a walk through the main 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.170
 new features of version 3 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.869
 that are not many in their essence 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.729
 but that is what we are going to learn 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.680
 of 2.3.2 will be enough to 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.140
 that can adapt to this new 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.850
 version so I invite you to 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.350
 encourage to follow the tutorial in 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.979
 first videotutorials we will be 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.660
 talking about the components of each one 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.730
 of the components as simply in 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.700
 each of the components in css that 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.129
 it's going to be a part 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.379
 initial in which we are going to download the 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:24.560
 simple version of searching that is 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:27.290
 just the css code then after 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.170
 let's go on the part let's be let's go to 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.790
 enter a second part of the course that 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.560
 is when we are going to download the version 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.750
 that is compiled which is the 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.849
 bus trap source code that is 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:42.080
 written in English where we will learn 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:44.060
 we are going to learn this sub line 5 dyn 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.760
 will learn to write code as 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:52.010
 some true masters in css in html5 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.049
 but mostly everything focused on 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.900
 look up we're even going to see some things 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:59.650
 of color theories how to combine 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.329
 colors use colors better 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.160
 Design trends how to use well 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.849
 vustra so your design does not look like 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.670
 to all bus trap designs and make 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:13.340
 that your design is what you want and 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.040
 that you put your creativity and 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.730
 that you put new competitive concepts 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.400
 for your pages, it is advisable that 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.290
 already have an idea of ​​html 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.640
 s although you do not need to make a super 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.890
 expert 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.810
 the ready you're going to win the one you're going to 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:34.290
 have when you finish the course we are going to 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:36.629
 do this kind of play out 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.519
 we will have at the end of the course a 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.489
 layout like this one that we're going to create in 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:44.189
 the course's course so you 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.980
 they will know how it goes, how we are going to create it 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:48.959
 step by step we will also have another 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.329
 like this one with a radial gradient we're going 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.120
 to see how that radial degree is made 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:56.519
 shadows all 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.650
 let's also have one like this one that 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.650
 all these are trends the trend 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.480
 classic large background image 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.989
 high definition image 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.940
 the spam background and we're going to 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.950
 talk a lot about I'm going to give you many 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.040
 tips milestones that I know are going to 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.769
 like a lot because they are going to create their 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.220
 pages 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.099
 and they will have an idea of ​​how to face 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.590
 a development of a web design so 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:27.569
 if you are a great designer if you are 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.060
 developer also great because you're going 

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:32.759
 to learn a little bit of design so 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.620
 now on when we go to 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:36.389
 the documentation to the official link of 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.650
 like to watch the videos, let's see what 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:42.330
 will go to the documentation of 2.3.2 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.210
 so you can easily find her here 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.360
 down we have the link that says look for 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:51.990
 the look at the documentation for Austria 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:56.240
 2.3.2 and it would simply be this url 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:59.370
