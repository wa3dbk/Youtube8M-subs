display it features a brand new a7 chip
which<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.640> apparently<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.420> first<00:00:39.719> 64-bit<00:00:40.290> CPU

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
which is apparently the first 64-bit CPU

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.030 
which is apparently the first 64-bit CPU
to<00:00:41.280> be<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.719> smartphone<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.710> they<00:00:43.890> have

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
have 10 hours of battery life on 4G

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.670 
have 10 hours of battery life on 4G
which<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.239> again<00:00:57.449> amount<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.750> battery<00:00:58.020> life<00:00:58.170> it

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
which is again amount of battery life it

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.549 
which is again amount of battery life it
has<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> new<00:00:59.280> m7<00:00:59.550> chip<00:01:00.239> which<00:01:00.600> apparently<00:01:01.199> is

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
has a new m7 chip which apparently is

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.080 
has a new m7 chip which apparently is
going<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.859> be<00:01:01.949> used<00:01:02.129> for<00:01:02.219> things<00:01:02.489> like<00:01:02.579> Nike

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
going to be used for things like Nike

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.920 
going to be used for things like Nike
and<00:01:03.420> stuff<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.010> now<00:01:05.010> interestingly

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
and stuff like that now interestingly

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.390 
and stuff like that now interestingly
enough<00:01:08.270> it<00:01:09.270> also<00:01:09.689> has<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> brand<00:01:10.770> new<00:01:10.830> camera

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
enough it also has a brand new camera

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.330 
enough it also has a brand new camera
that<00:01:12.080> what<00:01:13.080> they've<00:01:13.260> gone<00:01:13.439> ahead<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.770> did<00:01:14.100> is

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
that what they've gone ahead and did is

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.249 
that what they've gone ahead and did is
keep<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.970> same<00:01:15.150> megapixel<00:01:15.720> count<00:01:15.840> but<00:01:16.140> they

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
keep the same megapixel count but they

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.230 
keep the same megapixel count but they
did<00:01:16.470> go<00:01:16.650> ahead<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.950> make<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.700> pixels<00:01:18.060> bigger

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
did go ahead and make the pixels bigger

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.359 
did go ahead and make the pixels bigger
so<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.570> take<00:01:18.780> better<00:01:19.259> photos<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:19.920> they<00:01:20.130> have

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
so you take better photos like they have

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.020 
so you take better photos like they have
done<00:01:20.670> with<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.330> HTC<00:01:21.750> One<00:01:22.170> they<00:01:22.530> also<00:01:23.520> have<00:01:24.000> a

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
done with the HTC One they also have a

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.940 
done with the HTC One they also have a
new<00:01:24.180> burst<00:01:24.420> mode<00:01:24.720> which<00:01:25.110> will<00:01:25.530> take<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.710> bunch

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
new burst mode which will take a bunch

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.469 
new burst mode which will take a bunch
of<00:01:26.070> photos<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.549> automatically<00:01:27.000> pick<00:01:27.299> the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
of photos and automatically pick the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.969 
of photos and automatically pick the
best<00:01:27.630> one<00:01:27.869> for<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.439> don't<00:01:28.560> have<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.799> pick

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
best one for you you don't have to pick

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.069 
best one for you you don't have to pick
it<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.579> automatically<00:01:30.150> will<00:01:30.450> delete<00:01:30.840> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
it and it automatically will delete the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.590 
it and it automatically will delete the
other<00:01:31.770> ones<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.549> that's<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.180> pretty<00:01:33.329> cool

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
other ones so that's a pretty cool

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.240 
other ones so that's a pretty cool
feature<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.619> that's<00:01:34.770> one<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.100> main<00:01:35.220> things

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
feature so that's one of the main things

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.670 
feature so that's one of the main things
they<00:01:35.549> were<00:01:35.610> focusing<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.540> camera<00:01:36.900> they're

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
they were focusing on the camera they're

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.800 
they were focusing on the camera they're
also<00:01:37.920> claiming<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.579> this<00:01:38.759> camera<00:01:39.150> takes

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
also claiming that this camera takes

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.010 
also claiming that this camera takes
DSLR<00:01:40.439> quality<00:01:41.040> photos<00:01:41.490> which<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.509> don't

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
DSLR quality photos which I don't

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.240 
DSLR quality photos which I don't
believe<00:01:43.409> at<00:01:43.619> all<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.579> also<00:01:45.149> will<00:01:45.720> have<00:01:46.250> 120

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
believe at all it also will have 120

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.490 
believe at all it also will have 120
frames<00:01:47.490> per<00:01:47.670> second<00:01:48.060> slow<00:01:48.299> motion<00:01:48.720> option<00:01:49.229> for

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
frames per second slow motion option for

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.399 
frames per second slow motion option for
video<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.180> it<00:01:51.180> does<00:01:51.420> have<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.020> rumored

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
video and it does have the rumored

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.389 
video and it does have the rumored
fingerprint<00:01:53.250> scanner<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.479> has<00:01:55.399> they're

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
fingerprint scanner and it has they're

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.310 
fingerprint scanner and it has they're
going<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.700> be<00:01:56.820> calling<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.210> touch<00:01:57.420> ID<00:01:57.630> which

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
going to be calling it touch ID which

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.690 
going to be calling it touch ID which
will<00:01:58.530> be<00:01:58.619> embedded<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.189> home<00:01:59.340> button<00:01:59.520> now

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
will be embedded in the home button now
