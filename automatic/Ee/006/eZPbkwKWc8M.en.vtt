might be a couple bisexuals but I have

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.429 
might be a couple bisexuals but I have
really<00:02:13.939> found<00:02:14.150> that<00:02:14.299> cheat<00:02:14.720> to<00:02:14.840> exploit<00:02:15.260> yet

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:15.439 
really found that cheat to exploit yet

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:18.339 
really found that cheat to exploit yet
the<00:02:16.069> point<00:02:16.310> is<00:02:16.489> yes<00:02:17.150> force<00:02:17.659> breeding<00:02:18.140> is<00:02:18.290> a

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
the point is yes force breeding is a

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.460 
the point is yes force breeding is a
huge<00:02:19.159> part<00:02:19.489> of<00:02:19.670> this<00:02:19.879> game<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.390> is<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.750> fastest

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
huge part of this game it is the fastest

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.119 
huge part of this game it is the fastest
way<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:21.980> build<00:02:22.670> up<00:02:22.939> your<00:02:23.000> ranks<00:02:23.629> in<00:02:23.780> order<00:02:24.560> to

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
way to build up your ranks in order to

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.960 
way to build up your ranks in order to
get<00:02:25.819> to<00:02:25.849> that<00:02:26.299> 200<00:02:27.140> dweller<00:02:27.560> cap<00:02:27.920> okay<00:02:28.640> and

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
get to that 200 dweller cap okay and

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.509 
get to that 200 dweller cap okay and
yeah<00:02:29.299> I<00:02:29.480> have<00:02:29.750> forced<00:02:30.079> bread<00:02:30.379> the<00:02:30.650> shit<00:02:31.010> out<00:02:31.220> of

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
yeah I have forced bread the shit out of

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:32.350 
yeah I have forced bread the shit out of
my<00:02:31.879> people

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
my people

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.649 
my people
but<00:02:32.629> that's<00:02:32.810> not<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.079> only<00:02:33.110> way<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:34.879> expand

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:35.659 
but that's not the only way to expand

but that's not the only way to expand
your<00:02:35.870> ranks<00:02:36.909> the<00:02:37.909> pregnancy<00:02:38.329> mechanics<00:02:38.780> are

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
your ranks the pregnancy mechanics are

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.110 
your ranks the pregnancy mechanics are
just<00:02:39.019> the<00:02:39.440> best<00:02:39.590> way<00:02:39.829> but<00:02:40.370> you<00:02:40.489> can<00:02:40.670> put<00:02:40.849> people

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
just the best way but you can put people

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.210 
just the best way but you can put people
in<00:02:41.269> a<00:02:41.359> radio<00:02:41.659> tower<00:02:41.900> that<00:02:42.319> send<00:02:42.739> out<00:02:42.890> signals

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
in a radio tower that send out signals

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.119 
in a radio tower that send out signals
every<00:02:44.150> so<00:02:44.299> often<00:02:44.510> to<00:02:44.959> the<00:02:45.049> wasteland<00:02:45.409> and<00:02:45.709> hope

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
every so often to the wasteland and hope

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.280 
every so often to the wasteland and hope
to<00:02:46.159> attract<00:02:46.760> another<00:02:47.269> member<00:02:47.659> it's<00:02:47.900> a<00:02:48.049> slow

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
to attract another member it's a slow

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.280 
to attract another member it's a slow
process<00:02:48.470> sure<00:02:49.040> but<00:02:49.640> that's<00:02:50.629> another<00:02:51.049> way<00:02:51.230> to

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
process sure but that's another way to

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.970 
process sure but that's another way to
do<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:51.760> when<00:02:52.760> you<00:02:53.569> get<00:02:54.079> a<00:02:54.109> woman<00:02:54.349> pregnant<00:02:54.709> in

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
do it when you get a woman pregnant in

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.430 
do it when you get a woman pregnant in
the<00:02:55.099> game<00:02:55.280> she<00:02:55.730> is<00:02:55.909> competent<00:02:56.420> she<00:02:56.780> can<00:02:56.930> still

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
the game she is competent she can still

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.399 
the game she is competent she can still
train<00:02:57.739> she<00:02:58.190> can<00:02:58.459> still<00:02:58.819> work<00:02:59.120> but<00:02:59.720> in<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.200> case

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:00.409 
train she can still work but in the case

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:04.149 
train she can still work but in the case
of<00:03:00.680> an<00:03:01.639> event<00:03:01.970> like<00:03:02.690> fire<00:03:03.049> radroach<00:03:03.769> or<00:03:03.950> Raider

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
of an event like fire radroach or Raider

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.240 
of an event like fire radroach or Raider
yeah<00:03:05.000> she<00:03:05.780> throws<00:03:06.349> up<00:03:06.379> her<00:03:06.590> arms<00:03:06.829> in<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.040> air

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
yeah she throws up her arms in the air

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.699 
yeah she throws up her arms in the air
and<00:03:07.459> she<00:03:07.790> takes<00:03:08.000> off<00:03:08.239> running<00:03:08.450> Wow<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.470> dudes

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
and she takes off running Wow the dudes

and she takes off running Wow the dudes
sit<00:03:10.519> around<00:03:10.730> and<00:03:11.090> solved<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.840> problem<00:03:12.310> but

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
sit around and solved the problem but

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.640 
sit around and solved the problem but
that's<00:03:13.519> not<00:03:13.700> really<00:03:14.030> a<00:03:14.060> bad<00:03:14.329> thing<00:03:14.599> because<00:03:15.139> at

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
that's not really a bad thing because at

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.069 
that's not really a bad thing because at
that<00:03:16.099> moment<00:03:16.280> in<00:03:16.519> time<00:03:16.549> she's<00:03:17.209> not<00:03:17.480> carrying

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
that moment in time she's not carrying

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.770 
that moment in time she's not carrying
for<00:03:18.500> just<00:03:18.709> herself<00:03:18.889> she's<00:03:19.790> caring<00:03:20.180> for<00:03:20.480> the

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
for just herself she's caring for the

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.439 
for just herself she's caring for the
little<00:03:21.169> one<00:03:21.319> in<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:21.739> womb<00:03:21.919> and<00:03:22.220> since<00:03:22.940> your

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:23.449 
little one in the womb and since your

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:25.390 
little one in the womb and since your
colony<00:03:23.900> expansion<00:03:24.470> is<00:03:24.650> pretty<00:03:25.040> much<00:03:25.190> the

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
colony expansion is pretty much the

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.270 
colony expansion is pretty much the
primary<00:03:25.819> point<00:03:26.419> of<00:03:26.629> the<00:03:26.750> game<00:03:26.930> it<00:03:27.440> makes<00:03:27.769> sense

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
primary point of the game it makes sense

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.629 
primary point of the game it makes sense
that<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.449> woman<00:03:29.989> who<00:03:30.139> is<00:03:30.349> with<00:03:30.620> child<00:03:30.980> would

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
that the woman who is with child would

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.289 
that the woman who is with child would
avoid<00:03:31.940> any<00:03:32.269> in<00:03:32.540> all<00:03:32.660> danger<00:03:33.019> now<00:03:33.349> granted<00:03:34.299> many

avoid any in all danger now granted many

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.689 
avoid any in all danger now granted many
many<00:03:35.900> things<00:03:36.169> could<00:03:36.379> be<00:03:36.530> said<00:03:36.769> for<00:03:37.099> having<00:03:37.430> a

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:37.699 
many things could be said for having a

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:39.809 
many things could be said for having a
pregnant<00:03:38.120> woman<00:03:38.299> working<00:03:38.599> a<00:03:38.720> nuclear<00:03:39.109> reactor

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
and suspension of disbelief is pretty

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.300
