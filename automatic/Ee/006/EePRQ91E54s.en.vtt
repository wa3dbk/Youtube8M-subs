00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.610
 I joke today Morrell around this SCM 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.639
 3m art ending 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.179
 the Megaman references Chile can relate to Amend Grossman 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.129
 everyone can play 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.269
 to make the first state 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:18.330
 Weber stand 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.330
 the sea that goes s Corp 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.249
 v loaded say 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:26.550
 now, when natural stagnation 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.550
 in the first broadcast 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.190
 Now they do not know anymore 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.780
 That may be true to some other important ones that Mauch Cooperatives are 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.670
 so lost as a first point 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.930
 the clou select it down here 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.020
 his normal topstar 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.710
 just a bit of a turn here 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.470
 around 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.040
 of which only one act would be fasting 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.370
 So no feedback production but it gets a little wet here on plastic 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.660
 beat 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.980
 nothing has changed since 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.400
 around 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.280
 If you give people there you can go here 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.970
 This whole team worrying with such sayings between the cell 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.570
 apply once in a while 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.570
 once 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.039
 The next point is here 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:26.380
 although Jun 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.540
 Letschin 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.820
 What I have not done yet is that is due to two text files 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.260
 right now Potemkin Black I am doing right here now 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.360
 he does it now 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.670
 of course bad 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.580
 around 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.520
 which of course does not work it the monster if you hold it 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.320
 you have to remember to go back and forth 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.500
 but they also do not change anything 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.690
 I have not quite arrived yet 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.180
 next to magic 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.030
 the GEW Selection 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.030
 twice twice 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.190
 six times 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.530
 what they did not say anything there 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.600
 He does not do it yet 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.509
 of course, so beneficial 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.529
 and what annoys me it proved the points now 

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:13.919
 tried with ads 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:16.479
 the targeted points would 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:19.479
 Washington's in the middle of it are dams and points 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:22.729
 There you do not meet dancing 

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:25.729
 So if you're stress's percent I would not just recommend that 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:30.900
 which, of course, dogs like to overlaps okay I would like now 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.479
 Bring northeast pressure 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:34.279
 that will give you ideas in no time 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:37.279
 You can have this prägant included here 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:41.719
 by 10 8 pieces and the numbers can all be proclaimed 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:45.069
 Time should be short 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.819
 around 100 men 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.229
 from below - do it from dealers 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:52.329
 Game but also handle and worry 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.209
 around the flowers 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.449
 that should be now 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:58.449
 saw our plans 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:03.199
 the turning 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:06.199
 the stuff readers 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.049
 the reason that's the stop sign 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.209
 that only three games 

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:20.179
 Now let's take it 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:24.229
 now so happy too 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:32.649
 so loaded songs as well 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:35.829
 if you think you see, you see 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.669
 Now I want to go up 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.669
 return by post and 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:48.309
 stopped world cup points 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:51.199
 "I have never been seen 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:54.199
 although more is in it though 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:59.159
 Sander all very well on points but and finally does not always meet 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:01.999
 finally very little fingers 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:05.739
 and at midnight which of course is great it's gonna be the course 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.949
 he has here in the middle Benko 0 2 d 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:09.489
 you can with heads 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.260
 when the 2 3 were on the net 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.659
 once in focus 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:17.760
 Almost at the end of staying no one can think long kick I then showed 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:18.359
 times 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.639
 but with someone to find 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:21.579
 Munich 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.479
 You can now fairly rate the Jersey to the Zoo 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.529
 that it jumps nicely here and there 

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:28.729
 Of course, really great 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:31.460
 it is already certain super alternative 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.460
 As I said, we can do this here 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.409
 Patton and West LB up 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:40.409
 You can always do it like that 

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:44.379
 or FX stuff 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:46.090
 together Magna 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.169
 you can only turn them around in Rome 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.729
 but immediately 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.729
 or even lower down 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.029
 So it's great, too 

00:04:58.029 --> 00:05:01.180
 and I like that but not the reactions are a bit 

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:04.129
 slower than media pro called 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:06.099
 that's why it's a bit more difficult 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:09.379
 for someone who wants to play around is of course super you can do everything nicely 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:11.009
 prove how you want 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:15.430
 as I said, I would say the proclamation and percent 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.860
 as always, of course, come 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.259
 but otherwise the device is really great 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:25.270
 announce complain but for my use is a bit too plastic 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.009
 detention 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.619
 to the small and yet has not heard the way the FCE the 

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:32.919
 Münchinger Löw spends, of course, tables can server 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:35.419
 for longer things 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:37.129
 I would not do that 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:40.629
 All right, that Bormann video I hope will please and by Freddy Nock when 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:41.819
 you have the appearance
