that<00:03:35.440> I<00:03:35.620> wrote<00:03:35.650> when<00:03:35.890> I<00:03:35.950> was<00:03:35.980> in<00:03:36.130> grade<00:03:36.250> 12

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
that I wrote when I was in grade 12

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.640 
that I wrote when I was in grade 12
which<00:03:36.970> is<00:03:37.000> like<00:03:37.270> six<00:03:38.140> years<00:03:38.230> ago<00:03:39.600> cuz<00:03:40.600> I'm<00:03:40.720> 23<00:03:41.470> I

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
which is like six years ago cuz I'm 23 I

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.510 
which is like six years ago cuz I'm 23 I
told<00:03:42.190> you<00:03:42.310> my<00:03:42.430> name<00:03:42.459> and<00:03:42.940> my<00:03:42.970> age<00:03:43.660> I<00:03:43.900> love<00:03:44.380> you

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.729 
told you my name and my age I love you
so<00:03:45.520> the<00:03:45.640> song<00:03:45.790> is<00:03:45.940> basically<00:03:46.390> about<00:03:46.510> I<00:03:47.020> guess

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
so the song is basically about I guess

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.009 
so the song is basically about I guess
not<00:03:48.100> not<00:03:48.310> me<00:03:48.580> but<00:03:48.850> anyone<00:03:49.390> in<00:03:49.540> general<00:03:49.870> the

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
not not me but anyone in general the

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.330 
not not me but anyone in general the
title<00:03:50.290> of<00:03:50.320> the<00:03:50.410> song<00:03:50.560> is<00:03:50.709> coma<00:03:51.130> and<00:03:51.190> the

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
title of the song is coma and the

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.100 
title of the song is coma and the
concept<00:03:51.790> is<00:03:51.910> that<00:03:51.940> when<00:03:52.600> you're<00:03:52.720> in<00:03:52.780> a<00:03:52.840> coma

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
concept is that when you're in a coma

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.770 
concept is that when you're in a coma
your<00:03:53.320> subconscious<00:03:53.830> mind<00:03:53.860> still<00:03:54.550> has<00:03:54.780> control

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
your subconscious mind still has control

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.180 
your subconscious mind still has control
over<00:03:55.989> your<00:03:56.230> senses<00:03:56.620> and<00:03:56.650> things<00:03:56.890> like<00:03:56.980> that<00:03:57.040> so

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
over your senses and things like that so

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.820 
over your senses and things like that so
smell<00:03:57.790> sight<00:03:58.300> will<00:03:59.170> probably<00:03:59.200> not<00:03:59.590> so<00:03:59.709> much

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
smell sight will probably not so much

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.640 
smell sight will probably not so much
site<00:04:00.040> but<00:04:00.280> yeah<00:04:00.880> hearing<00:04:01.660> taste<00:04:01.959> those<00:04:02.350> sorts

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
site but yeah hearing taste those sorts

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.350 
site but yeah hearing taste those sorts
of<00:04:02.680> things<00:04:02.769> and<00:04:03.100> the<00:04:03.160> way<00:04:03.700> that<00:04:03.820> it<00:04:03.940> can<00:04:04.000> affect

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
of things and the way that it can affect

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.060 
of things and the way that it can affect
your<00:04:04.480> conscious<00:04:04.959> mind<00:04:04.989> whether<00:04:05.620> you<00:04:05.800> might<00:04:05.920> be

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
your conscious mind whether you might be

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.350 
your conscious mind whether you might be
dreaming<00:04:06.519> or<00:04:06.670> whatever<00:04:06.970> I<00:04:07.060> don't<00:04:07.239> know<00:04:07.300> I've

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
dreaming or whatever I don't know I've

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.550 
dreaming or whatever I don't know I've
never<00:04:07.480> been<00:04:07.630> in<00:04:07.720> a<00:04:07.780> coma<00:04:07.930> I<00:04:08.080> don't<00:04:08.230> know<00:04:08.350> anyone

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
never been in a coma I don't know anyone

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.290 
never been in a coma I don't know anyone
that's<00:04:08.739> been<00:04:08.830> in<00:04:08.950> a<00:04:09.040> coma<00:04:09.160> but<00:04:09.790> the<00:04:09.940> idea<00:04:10.269> is

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
that's been in a coma but the idea is

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.180 
that's been in a coma but the idea is
there<00:04:10.600> you<00:04:11.050> know<00:04:11.170> what<00:04:11.320> a<00:04:11.350> coma<00:04:11.590> is<00:04:11.769> so<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.070> way

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
there you know what a coma is so the way

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.890 
there you know what a coma is so the way
the<00:04:12.519> way<00:04:12.640> the<00:04:12.760> story<00:04:13.120> goes<00:04:13.239> throughout<00:04:13.750> the

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
the way the story goes throughout the

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.039 
the way the story goes throughout the
song<00:04:14.110> is<00:04:14.350> that<00:04:14.940> me<00:04:15.940> in<00:04:16.209> the<00:04:16.359> video<00:04:16.510> I<00:04:16.720> guess

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
song is that me in the video I guess

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.210 
song is that me in the video I guess
would<00:04:17.590> be<00:04:17.620> in<00:04:17.920> a

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
would be in a

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.890 
would be in a

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
and I'm sort of having an out-of-body

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.690 
and I'm sort of having an out-of-body
experience<00:04:20.140> and<00:04:21.070> I'm<00:04:21.280> sort<00:04:21.430> of<00:04:21.549> walking

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
experience and I'm sort of walking

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.760 
experience and I'm sort of walking
around<00:04:21.940> through<00:04:22.180> the<00:04:22.270> city<00:04:22.480> looking<00:04:23.140> for<00:04:23.440> my

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770
