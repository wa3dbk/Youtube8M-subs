00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
don't even think i've seen these types

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.490 
don't even think i've seen these types
of<00:00:57.370> positions<00:00:57.550> and<00:00:58.090> in<00:00:58.270> quite<00:00:58.840> some<00:00:59.170> time<00:00:59.440> and

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
of positions and in quite some time and

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.410 
of positions and in quite some time and
you<00:01:00.160> know<00:01:00.250> you're<00:01:00.610> seeing<00:01:00.879> it<00:01:01.059> on<00:01:01.150> screen

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
you know you're seeing it on screen

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.119 
you know you're seeing it on screen
obviously<00:01:01.960> you<00:01:02.050> know<00:01:02.199> that<00:01:02.440> these<00:01:02.650> clothes<00:01:02.920> by

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
obviously you know that these clothes by

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.359 
obviously you know that these clothes by
grounds<00:01:03.580> can<00:01:03.760> be<00:01:03.879> very<00:01:04.180> very<00:01:04.449> rough<00:01:04.979> yeah<00:01:05.979> and

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
grounds can be very very rough yeah and

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.020 
grounds can be very very rough yeah and
I<00:01:06.670> think<00:01:06.850> as<00:01:07.420> soon<00:01:07.450> if<00:01:08.229> dde<00:01:08.710> Scouts<00:01:09.280> this<00:01:09.580> early

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
I think as soon if dde Scouts this early

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.330 
I think as soon if dde Scouts this early
on<00:01:10.180> it<00:01:10.450> just<00:01:10.630> opens<00:01:11.020> up<00:01:11.170> two<00:01:11.440> racks<00:01:11.710> I<00:01:11.950> mean<00:01:12.100> one

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
on it just opens up two racks I mean one

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.020 
on it just opens up two racks I mean one
of<00:01:12.369> the<00:01:12.520> really<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:13.149> biggest<00:01:13.660> reasons<00:01:14.290> that

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
of the really the biggest reasons that

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.790 
of the really the biggest reasons that
people<00:01:16.030> really<00:01:16.450> don't<00:01:16.930> play<00:01:17.320> the<00:01:17.530> metal

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
people really don't play the metal

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.950 
people really don't play the metal
opolis<00:01:18.160> latter<00:01:18.580> version<00:01:18.910> anymore<00:01:19.690> is<00:01:19.930> because

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
opolis latter version anymore is because

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.560 
opolis latter version anymore is because
you<00:01:20.560> are<00:01:20.710> so<00:01:20.979> susceptible<00:01:21.340> to<00:01:22.149> close<00:01:22.360> by

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
you are so susceptible to close by

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.719 
you are so susceptible to close by
ground<00:01:22.899> spawns<00:01:23.259> which<00:01:23.560> means<00:01:23.830> that<00:01:23.979> you're

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
ground spawns which means that you're

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.820 
ground spawns which means that you're
the<00:01:25.090> distance<00:01:25.450> between<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.810> two<00:01:25.899> bases<00:01:26.350> is<00:01:26.500> so

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
the distance between the two bases is so

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.130 
the distance between the two bases is so
so<00:01:27.190> short<00:01:27.550> that<00:01:27.640> a<00:01:27.910> t-rex<00:01:28.479> opening<00:01:28.690> is<00:01:29.020> she's

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
so short that a t-rex opening is she's

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.840 
so short that a t-rex opening is she's
going<00:01:29.229> to<00:01:29.350> be<00:01:29.440> so<00:01:29.619> much<00:01:29.770> stronger<00:01:30.160> and<00:01:30.729> i'm

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
going to be so much stronger and i'm

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.460 
going to be so much stronger and i'm
fairly<00:01:31.090> certain<00:01:31.210> on<00:01:31.660> the<00:01:31.690> metal<00:01:32.050> opolis

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
fairly certain on the metal opolis

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.320 
fairly certain on the metal opolis
latter<00:01:33.039> version<00:01:33.220> you<00:01:33.490> can<00:01:33.580> also<00:01:33.820> do<00:01:34.119> these

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
latter version you can also do these

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.570 
latter version you can also do these
bunker<00:01:34.840> wall<00:01:35.050> offs<00:01:35.289> there<00:01:35.530> at<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.130> bottom<00:01:36.280> of

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
bunker wall offs there at the bottom of

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.580 
bunker wall offs there at the bottom of
that<00:01:36.789> main<00:01:37.090> round<00:01:37.450> yeah<00:01:38.140> I<00:01:38.170> think<00:01:38.319> you're

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
that main round yeah I think you're

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.919 
that main round yeah I think you're
right<00:01:38.649> this<00:01:39.340> is<00:01:39.550> going<00:01:39.670> to<00:01:39.729> be<00:01:39.880> pretty<00:01:40.179> scary<00:01:40.690> I

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
right this is going to be pretty scary I

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:43.380 
right this is going to be pretty scary I
think<00:01:41.289> Indra<00:01:41.770> might<00:01:42.160> be<00:01:42.369> a<00:01:42.399> little<00:01:42.670> bit<00:01:42.850> upset

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
think Indra might be a little bit upset

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.900 
think Indra might be a little bit upset
when<00:01:44.020> he<00:01:44.050> realizes<00:01:44.530> that<00:01:44.920> it<00:01:45.310> is<00:01:45.429> close<00:01:45.700> by

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
when he realizes that it is close by

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.940 
when he realizes that it is close by
ground<00:01:46.209> and<00:01:46.390> what<00:01:46.569> is<00:01:46.720> Ed<00:01:46.959> gonna<00:01:47.229> open<00:01:47.530> with<00:01:47.709> I

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
ground and what is Ed gonna open with I

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.770 
ground and what is Ed gonna open with I
think<00:01:48.459> it's<00:01:48.610> going<00:01:48.670> to<00:01:48.759> be<00:01:48.849> two<00:01:49.030> racks<00:01:49.270> you<00:01:49.599> did

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
think it's going to be two racks you did

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.109 
think it's going to be two racks you did
put<00:01:49.959> down<00:01:50.170> that<00:01:50.200> supply<00:01:51.160> depot<00:01:51.490> back<00:01:51.759> in<00:01:52.000> his

nervous yeah I mean even though he
hasn't<00:01:56.830> scouted<00:01:57.459> his<00:01:57.580> opponent<00:01:58.149> it's

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
hasn't scouted his opponent it's

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.600 
hasn't scouted his opponent it's
definitely<00:01:58.780> a<00:01:58.840> possibility<00:01:59.740> and<00:02:00.280> he's<00:02:00.399> got

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610

habit but even a 15 full 15 hatch would

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.820 
habit but even a 15 full 15 hatch would
have<00:02:13.540> been<00:02:13.660> so<00:02:13.930> much<00:02:13.959> better<00:02:14.140> there<00:02:14.650> the

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
have been so much better there the

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.870 
have been so much better there the
second<00:02:15.250> Drax<00:02:15.520> is<00:02:15.790> going<00:02:16.120> down<00:02:16.330> JP<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.880> even

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
second Drax is going down JP and even

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.290 
second Drax is going down JP and even
the<00:02:19.030> SCV<00:02:19.569> is<00:02:19.750> going<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.470> go<00:02:21.160> in<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.670> opposite
