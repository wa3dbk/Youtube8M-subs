00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
yeah it was just a very very basic one

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.469 
yeah it was just a very very basic one
it's<00:01:27.069> not<00:01:27.310> one<00:01:27.460> of<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.609> additions<00:01:28.060> it's<00:01:28.329> just

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
it's not one of the additions it's just

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:29.940 
it's not one of the additions it's just
something<00:01:28.840> new<00:01:28.990> now<00:01:29.140> this<00:01:29.289> next<00:01:29.500> one<00:01:29.619> is

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
something new now this next one is

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.980 
something new now this next one is
something<00:01:30.609> I<00:01:30.700> found<00:01:30.939> out<00:01:31.119> in<00:01:31.270> my<00:01:31.299> friends<00:01:31.810> well

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
something I found out in my friends well

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.419 
something I found out in my friends well
that's<00:01:32.259> gonna<00:01:32.380> be<00:01:32.469> good<00:01:32.679> for<00:01:32.890> the<00:01:32.950> next<00:01:33.009> update

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
that's gonna be good for the next update

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:34.800 
that's gonna be good for the next update
and<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:33.819> reason<00:01:34.119> why<00:01:34.209> I'm<00:01:34.299> saying<00:01:34.509> that<00:01:34.659> is

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
and the reason why I'm saying that is

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.270 
and the reason why I'm saying that is
because<00:01:35.049> we're<00:01:35.350> gonna<00:01:35.439> need<00:01:35.530> to<00:01:35.709> find<00:01:35.979> clay

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
because we're gonna need to find clay

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.190 
because we're gonna need to find clay
because<00:01:36.549> it<00:01:36.640> doesn't<00:01:36.909> look<00:01:37.000> like<00:01:37.209> Mesa<00:01:37.780> biomes

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
because it doesn't look like Mesa biomes

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.959 
because it doesn't look like Mesa biomes
will<00:01:38.409> be<00:01:38.500> introduced<00:01:39.130> now<00:01:39.310> you<00:01:39.369> can<00:01:39.579> see<00:01:39.789> it's

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:39.969 
will be introduced now you can see it's

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:41.580 
will be introduced now you can see it's
hard<00:01:40.149> to<00:01:40.329> see<00:01:40.479> in<00:01:40.569> the<00:01:40.689> water<00:01:40.929> you<00:01:41.560> really

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
hard to see in the water you really

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.130 
hard to see in the water you really
can't<00:01:42.009> see<00:01:42.189> many<00:01:42.369> blocks<00:01:42.700> but<00:01:43.450> a<00:01:43.479> cool<00:01:43.719> fact<00:01:43.990> is

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
can't see many blocks but a cool fact is

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.139 
can't see many blocks but a cool fact is
if<00:01:44.319> you<00:01:44.409> placed<00:01:44.679> on<00:01:44.829> a<00:01:44.890> portal<00:01:45.490> and<00:01:45.640> you<00:01:45.880> look

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
if you placed on a portal and you look

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.300 
if you placed on a portal and you look
you<00:01:46.450> can<00:01:46.659> see<00:01:46.899> very<00:01:47.350> clearly<00:01:47.590> that<00:01:48.009> you<00:01:48.069> can

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
you can see very clearly that you can

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.190 
you can see very clearly that you can
see<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.670> majority<00:01:48.969> of<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.630> blocks<00:01:49.929> and<00:01:50.110> the

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
see the majority of the blocks and the

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.229 
see the majority of the blocks and the
leaf<00:01:50.380> and<00:01:50.560> I<00:01:50.649> can<00:01:50.829> see<00:01:51.009> that<00:01:51.489> right<00:01:51.729> there

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:52.239 
leaf and I can see that right there

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:54.899 
leaf and I can see that right there
that<00:01:52.569> is<00:01:52.840> going<00:01:53.409> to<00:01:53.530> be<00:01:53.829> at<00:01:54.099> place<00:01:54.489> when<00:01:54.729> we<00:01:54.789> go

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
that is going to be at place when we go

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.639 
that is going to be at place when we go
and<00:01:55.030> check<00:01:55.090> it<00:01:55.329> with<00:01:55.420> this<00:01:55.509> clay<00:01:55.840> I<00:01:56.110> think<00:01:56.560> I

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
and check it with this clay I think I

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.199 
and check it with this clay I think I
was<00:01:56.799> correct<00:01:57.159> yes<00:01:57.489> you<00:01:57.610> can<00:01:57.759> see<00:01:57.909> that<00:01:58.060> that<00:01:58.149> is

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209 
was correct yes you can see that that is

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:59.880 
was correct yes you can see that that is
clay<00:01:58.509> right<00:01:58.719> there<00:01:58.959> so<00:01:59.140> it's<00:01:59.530> just<00:01:59.679> a<00:01:59.739> little

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
clay right there so it's just a little

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.649 
clay right there so it's just a little
thing<00:02:00.099> a<00:02:00.130> fun<00:02:00.459> thing<00:02:00.670> to<00:02:00.729> have<00:02:00.909> especially<00:02:01.299> if

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
thing a fun thing to have especially if

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.600 
thing a fun thing to have especially if
you're<00:02:01.750> gonna<00:02:01.869> be<00:02:01.989> hunting<00:02:02.349> for<00:02:02.590> clay<00:02:02.829> and<00:02:03.129> and

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
you're gonna be hunting for clay and and

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.339 
you're gonna be hunting for clay and and
you'll<00:02:04.090> notice<00:02:04.450> that<00:02:04.599> the<00:02:04.719> lily<00:02:04.929> pads<00:02:05.170> are

00:02:05.339 --> 00:02:05.349 
you'll notice that the lily pads are

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:06.929 
you'll notice that the lily pads are
kind<00:02:05.560> of<00:02:05.679> invisible<00:02:06.189> as<00:02:06.310> well<00:02:06.489> so<00:02:06.700> I<00:02:06.729> thought

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
kind of invisible as well so I thought

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:08.339 
kind of invisible as well so I thought
that<00:02:07.090> was<00:02:07.239> really<00:02:07.390> pretty<00:02:07.659> awesome<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.200> can

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
that was really pretty awesome you can

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.199 
that was really pretty awesome you can
see<00:02:08.530> very<00:02:08.799> very<00:02:09.009> far<00:02:09.340> you<00:02:09.759> can<00:02:09.940> see<00:02:10.119> the

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
see very very far you can see the

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.819 
see very very far you can see the
difference<00:02:10.660> right<00:02:10.750> there<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.379> so<00:02:11.620> I<00:02:11.650> thought

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:11.829 
difference right there and so I thought

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:12.900 
difference right there and so I thought
that<00:02:11.950> was<00:02:12.010> definitely<00:02:12.400> something<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.760> add

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
that was definitely something to add

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.030 
that was definitely something to add
especially<00:02:13.870> when<00:02:14.049> they<00:02:14.140> do<00:02:14.200> introducing<00:02:14.920> new

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
especially when they do introducing new

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.150 
especially when they do introducing new
biomes<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:15.810> maybe<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:17.019> can<00:02:17.170> find<00:02:17.440> ravines<00:02:17.860> on

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
biomes and maybe you can find ravines on

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.410 
biomes and maybe you can find ravines on
the<00:02:18.250> water<00:02:18.489> I<00:02:18.700> don't<00:02:18.910> know<00:02:18.970> I<00:02:19.000> just<00:02:19.090> folks

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
the water I don't know I just folks

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.059 
the water I don't know I just folks
definitely<00:02:19.810> way<00:02:19.900> of<00:02:19.989> sharing<00:02:20.319> as<00:02:20.530> well<00:02:20.799> so<00:02:20.980> the

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
definitely way of sharing as well so the

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.920 
definitely way of sharing as well so the
next<00:02:21.340> one<00:02:21.549> is<00:02:21.970> something<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.480> lot<00:02:22.569> of<00:02:22.630> people

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
next one is something a lot of people

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.319 
next one is something a lot of people
will<00:02:23.109> know<00:02:23.319> and<00:02:23.799> that<00:02:23.950> is<00:02:24.100> soul<00:02:24.700> sand<00:02:25.030> can<00:02:25.299> be

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
will know and that is soul sand can be

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.059 
will know and that is soul sand can be
very<00:02:25.720> very<00:02:26.019> evil<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:26.650> this<00:02:26.769> is<00:02:26.889> what<00:02:27.010> I'm

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
very very evil and this is what I'm

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.650 
very very evil and this is what I'm
talking<00:02:27.400> about<00:02:27.609> soul<00:02:27.850> sand<00:02:28.060> is<00:02:28.180> what<00:02:28.299> you<00:02:28.420> use

talking about soul sand is what you use

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.379 
talking about soul sand is what you use
to<00:02:28.870> make<00:02:29.079> and<00:02:29.440> with<00:02:30.100> that<00:02:30.280> sooner<00:02:30.880> or<00:02:30.910> later<00:02:30.970> on

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:31.389 
to make and with that sooner or later on

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:34.920 
to make and with that sooner or later on
xbox<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:31.989> on<00:02:32.380> PlayStation<00:02:33.069> 4<00:02:33.099> also<00:02:33.670> it<00:02:34.660> can<00:02:34.900> be

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
xbox and on PlayStation 4 also it can be

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.319 
xbox and on PlayStation 4 also it can be
used<00:02:35.230> for<00:02:35.410> convincing<00:02:35.799> trap<00:02:36.370> now<00:02:37.000> I'm<00:02:37.209> going

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
used for convincing trap now I'm going

to<00:02:37.389> give<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:37.540> an<00:02:37.599> example<00:02:37.840> of<00:02:38.049> where<00:02:38.170> we<00:02:38.260> could

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
to give you an example of where we could

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.800 
to give you an example of where we could
use<00:02:38.590> this<00:02:38.769> trap<00:02:39.069> so<00:02:39.099> if<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.400> grab<00:02:39.459> say<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.359> chest

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.140 
use this trap so if I grab say a chest
where's<00:02:41.079> a<00:02:41.139> Chester<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:42.069> you've<00:02:42.730> got<00:02:42.849> a<00:02:42.880> chest

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
diamonds where the diamonds are there we

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.330 
diamonds where the diamonds are there we
go<00:02:51.970> there's<00:02:52.269> 64<00:02:52.690> diamonds<00:02:53.230> in<00:02:53.349> there<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:53.950> this

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
go there's 64 diamonds in there and this

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.650 
go there's 64 diamonds in there and this
is<00:02:54.459> like<00:02:54.579> say<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.819> big<00:02:55.209> room

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
is like say a big room

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.020 
is like say a big room

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
they have no action to grab anything and

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.420 
they have no action to grab anything and
basically<00:02:58.630> you<00:02:59.290> can<00:02:59.500> walk<00:02:59.739> through<00:02:59.769> this

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
basically you can walk through this

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.909 
basically you can walk through this
simply<00:03:01.359> like<00:03:01.569> this<00:03:01.840> you<00:03:02.169> can<00:03:02.349> walk<00:03:02.560> through

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:02.919 
simply like this you can walk through

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:05.069 
simply like this you can walk through
but<00:03:03.459> what<00:03:03.669> you<00:03:03.760> cannot<00:03:04.120> do<00:03:04.329> is<00:03:04.359> you<00:03:04.540> cannot<00:03:04.810> go

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
but what you cannot do is you cannot go

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.979 
but what you cannot do is you cannot go
back<00:03:05.380> and<00:03:05.739> on<00:03:06.639> soul<00:03:07.120> sound<00:03:07.450> because<00:03:07.810> if<00:03:07.930> you

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
back and on soul sound because if you

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.659 
back and on soul sound because if you
can<00:03:08.169> go<00:03:08.290> back<00:03:08.470> as<00:03:08.650> you<00:03:08.769> can<00:03:08.919> see<00:03:09.130> I'm<00:03:09.340> trapped

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:09.669 
can go back as you can see I'm trapped

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:11.339 
can go back as you can see I'm trapped
if<00:03:09.849> and<00:03:09.970> if<00:03:10.030> I<00:03:10.090> try<00:03:10.329> and<00:03:10.450> sprint<00:03:10.810> you<00:03:10.900> can<00:03:11.139> see<00:03:11.319> I

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
if and if I try and sprint you can see I

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.620 
if and if I try and sprint you can see I
am<00:03:11.590> stopped<00:03:11.980> there<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:12.430> so<00:03:13.060> be<00:03:13.269> kind<00:03:13.480> of<00:03:13.510> like

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
am stopped there and so be kind of like

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.449 
am stopped there and so be kind of like
a<00:03:13.690> trap<00:03:13.989> and<00:03:14.200> maybe<00:03:14.349> on<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:15.010> other<00:03:15.160> side<00:03:15.340> there

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
a trap and maybe on the other side there

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.680 
a trap and maybe on the other side there
could<00:03:15.579> be<00:03:15.609> a<00:03:15.700> pressure<00:03:15.940> play<00:03:16.180> here<00:03:16.419> you<00:03:16.540> can

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
could be a pressure play here you can

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.089 
could be a pressure play here you can
activate<00:03:16.870> lava<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:17.650> they're<00:03:17.739> gonna<00:03:17.859> die

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
activate lava and they're gonna die

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.740 
activate lava and they're gonna die
because<00:03:18.310> they<00:03:18.519> can't<00:03:18.790> get<00:03:18.910> through<00:03:19.180> here<00:03:19.419> so

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
because they can't get through here so

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.490 
because they can't get through here so
and<00:03:20.169> basically<00:03:20.590> yes

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
and basically yes

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.050 
and basically yes
what<00:03:21.830> it<00:03:21.890> is<00:03:22.010> I'm<00:03:22.160> not<00:03:22.250> sure<00:03:22.310> so<00:03:22.670> Sun<00:03:22.910> is

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
what it is I'm not sure so Sun is

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.850 
what it is I'm not sure so Sun is
slightly<00:03:23.300> smaller<00:03:23.540> or<00:03:23.960> taller<00:03:23.990> but<00:03:24.380> look

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
slightly smaller or taller but look

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.800 
slightly smaller or taller but look
closely<00:03:25.130> that<00:03:25.340> I<00:03:25.400> watch<00:03:25.760> my<00:03:26.060> character<00:03:26.660> go

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
closely that I watch my character go

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.980 
closely that I watch my character go
down<00:03:27.110> in<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.560> in<00:03:27.740> the<00:03:27.950> air<00:03:28.070> the<00:03:28.310> world<00:03:28.810> as<00:03:29.810> you

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
down in the in the air the world as you

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.300 
down in the in the air the world as you
can<00:03:30.110> see<00:03:30.260> that<00:03:30.410> we<00:03:30.500> dropped<00:03:30.740> a<00:03:30.860> little<00:03:31.100> bit<00:03:31.190> we

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
can see that we dropped a little bit we

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.700 
can see that we dropped a little bit we
drop<00:03:31.550> significantly<00:03:31.820> I'm<00:03:32.720> so<00:03:33.080> yes<00:03:33.260> Seoul<00:03:33.470> Sun

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
is very very evil to be careful we can't

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.600 
is very very evil to be careful we can't
go<00:03:36.260> through<00:03:36.440> this<00:03:36.590> way<00:03:36.770> but<00:03:37.040> like<00:03:37.130> I<00:03:37.250> said<00:03:37.310> you

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
go through this way but like I said you

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.220 
go through this way but like I said you
can<00:03:37.730> go<00:03:37.880> through<00:03:38.120> this<00:03:38.240> way<00:03:38.420> very<00:03:38.720> very<00:03:38.870> easy

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
can go through this way very very easy

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.570 
can go through this way very very easy
as<00:03:39.440> well<00:03:39.470> so<00:03:39.830> I'm<00:03:40.130> not<00:03:40.190> sure<00:03:40.430> if<00:03:40.490> it's

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
as well so I'm not sure if it's
