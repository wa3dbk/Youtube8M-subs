okay<00:00:02.280> this<00:00:02.550> video<00:00:03.120> of<00:00:03.330> the<00:00:04.220> exterior<00:00:05.359> LED

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
okay this video of the exterior LED

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:14.539 
okay this video of the exterior LED
conversion<00:00:07.140> on<00:00:07.680> my<00:00:08.010> LS<00:00:09.559> first<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:13.429> angel<00:00:14.429> I

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
conversion on my LS first is the angel I

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.200 
conversion on my LS first is the angel I
don't<00:00:15.949> know<00:00:16.949> how<00:00:17.130> well<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.490> going<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.910> show<00:00:18.090> up

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
don't know how well is going to show up

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.710 
don't know how well is going to show up
on<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.539> camera<00:00:20.449> but<00:00:21.449> there's<00:00:21.900> those<00:00:23.720> LED

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
on the camera but there's those LED

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.200 
on the camera but there's those LED
rings<00:00:24.990> from<00:00:25.350> whom<00:00:25.740> it's<00:00:26.039> tough<00:00:27.680> and<00:00:28.849> this<00:00:29.849> is

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
rings from whom it's tough and this is

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.940 
rings from whom it's tough and this is
the<00:00:31.610> stock<00:00:32.610> side<00:00:33.390> marker<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.770> LED<00:00:35.219> bulbs<00:00:35.640> and

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
the stock side marker to LED bulbs and

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.680 
the stock side marker to LED bulbs and
then<00:00:38.120> don't<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.329> see<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:39.690> there<00:00:39.899> but<00:00:40.230> that's

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
then don't you see in there but that's

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.619 
then don't you see in there but that's
the<00:00:42.690> oh<00:00:43.489> the<00:00:44.489> camera<00:00:44.820> light<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.090> on<00:00:45.239> just

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
the oh the camera light is on just

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.479 
the oh the camera light is on just
realize<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.039> okay<00:00:47.989> that's<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.379> LED<00:00:50.190> turn

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
realize that okay that's the LED turn

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.119 
realize that okay that's the LED turn
signal<00:00:50.879> bulb<00:00:51.320> notice<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.860> with<00:00:53.100> my

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
signal bulb notice this is with my

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.069 
signal bulb notice this is with my
parking<00:00:53.699> lights<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.539> bulb<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.050> not

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
parking lights on and that bulb is not

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.819 
parking lights on and that bulb is not
lit<00:00:55.850> with<00:00:56.850> LEDs<00:00:57.059> those<00:00:57.840> didn't<00:00:58.320> light<00:00:58.440> up<00:00:58.469> for

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
lit with LEDs those didn't light up for

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.310 
lit with LEDs those didn't light up for
some<00:00:58.980> reason<00:00:59.010> but<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.910> side<00:01:00.120> marker<00:01:00.539> still

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
some reason but the side marker still

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.770 
some reason but the side marker still
lights<00:01:01.500> up<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.579> that's<00:01:02.969> think<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.539> looks

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
lights up and that's think it looks

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.969 
lights up and that's think it looks
pretty<00:01:04.320> cool<00:01:04.500> still<00:01:05.990> gives<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.110> little<00:01:07.650> glow

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
pretty cool still gives a little glow

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.710 
pretty cool still gives a little glow
without<00:01:08.159> being<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:09.180> full<00:01:09.450> blown<00:01:09.659> bulb<00:01:11.720> and

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
without being the full blown bulb and

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.289 
without being the full blown bulb and
here's<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> other<00:01:13.380> side<00:01:13.680> same<00:01:14.369> thing

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
here's the other side same thing

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:22.490 
here's the other side same thing
and<00:01:16.810> it'll<00:01:16.990> come<00:01:17.229> around<00:01:17.350> to<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:17.710> back

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.200 

through<00:01:23.500> my<00:01:24.570> tinted<00:01:26.759> taillights<00:01:27.759> that<00:01:28.090> are

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
through my tinted taillights that are

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.959 
through my tinted taillights that are
melted<00:01:28.600> because<00:01:28.840> of<00:01:29.049> the<00:01:29.380> incandescent<00:01:30.219> bulbs

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
melted because of the incandescent bulbs

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:34.950 
melted because of the incandescent bulbs
but<00:01:31.539> they're<00:01:31.719> now<00:01:31.869> LEDs<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:34.360> the<00:01:34.539> use<00:01:34.659> of<00:01:34.689> a

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
but they're now LEDs with the use of a

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.029 
but they're now LEDs with the use of a
resistor<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.869> you<00:01:37.929> can<00:01:38.319> kind<00:01:38.530> of<00:01:38.560> see<00:01:38.709> the<00:01:38.799> bulb

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
resistor so you can kind of see the bulb

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.740 
resistor so you can kind of see the bulb
in<00:01:39.219> there<00:01:39.399> it<00:01:39.909> looks<00:01:40.090> pretty<00:01:40.390> sweet<00:01:40.600> actually

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
in there it looks pretty sweet actually

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.649 
in there it looks pretty sweet actually
and<00:01:43.750> then<00:01:44.700> there's<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.819> LED<00:01:46.179> lights<00:01:46.450> and

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
and then there's the LED lights and

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:54.330 
and then there's the LED lights and
plates<00:01:48.060> down<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:50.229> back<00:01:50.439> view<00:01:50.679> of<00:01:50.709> this<00:01:53.340> now

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
plates down in back view of this now

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.880 
plates down in back view of this now
I'll<00:01:54.489> show<00:01:54.729> you<00:01:54.759> the<00:01:54.909> fog<00:01:55.750> lights

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.120 

our<00:02:00.890> lights<00:02:01.280> are<00:02:01.520> also<00:02:01.880> LED<00:02:02.329> bulbs<00:02:02.780> got<00:02:03.619> an<00:02:03.740> HID

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
our lights are also LED bulbs got an HID

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.459 
our lights are also LED bulbs got an HID
kit<00:02:04.310> in<00:02:04.670> there<00:02:04.820> first<00:02:05.180> and<00:02:05.420> I<00:02:05.960> didn't<00:02:06.259> like<00:02:06.439> it

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
kit in there first and I didn't like it

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:12.009 
kit in there first and I didn't like it
the<00:02:07.250> color<00:02:07.520> match<00:02:07.759> wasn't<00:02:08.179> very<00:02:08.300> good<00:02:08.539> and<00:02:11.019> the

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
the color match wasn't very good and the

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.270 
the color match wasn't very good and the
LEDs<00:02:12.380> match<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:13.360> Rings<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.950> angel<00:02:15.950> eye<00:02:16.010> rings

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
LEDs match the Rings the angel eye rings

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.710 
LEDs match the Rings the angel eye rings
a<00:02:16.400> lot<00:02:16.519> better<00:02:16.790> so<00:02:17.800> it<00:02:18.800> looks<00:02:19.099> pretty<00:02:19.400> sweet

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:32.759 

know<00:02:23.720> how<00:02:23.900> well<00:02:24.110> it's<00:02:24.319> gonna<00:02:24.440> focus<00:02:24.800> but<00:02:25.580> it

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.220 

so<00:02:33.769> you<00:02:34.280> see<00:02:34.489> it<00:02:34.610> matches<00:02:35.019> pretty<00:02:36.019> much

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
so you see it matches pretty much

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.800 
so you see it matches pretty much
perfect

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
perfect

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:45.869 
perfect
with<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:39.170> all<00:02:39.650> LED<00:02:40.250> front<00:02:41.799> now<00:02:42.799> I'll<00:02:43.190> show<00:02:43.430> the

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:03:10.690 

reverse<00:02:46.879> lights

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.890 

these<00:03:11.270> are<00:03:11.420> also<00:03:11.569> LEDs<00:03:12.550> obviously<00:03:13.550> and<00:03:14.120> these

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
these are also LEDs obviously and these

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.680 
these are also LEDs obviously and these
are<00:03:15.080> extremely<00:03:15.530> bright<00:03:15.980> I<00:03:16.280> have<00:03:16.670> dark<00:03:17.360> window

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
are extremely bright I have dark window

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.630 
are extremely bright I have dark window
tint<00:03:17.930> so<00:03:18.940> these<00:03:19.940> helped<00:03:20.239> a<00:03:20.360> lot<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:21.400> it<00:03:22.400> just

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
tint so these helped a lot and it just

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.470 
tint so these helped a lot and it just
looks<00:03:22.849> a<00:03:22.970> lot<00:03:23.150> better<00:03:23.360> than<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:25.480> incandescent

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
looks a lot better than the incandescent

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.780 
looks a lot better than the incandescent
bulbs<00:03:29.230> with<00:03:30.230> my<00:03:30.440> parking<00:03:30.890> sensitive<00:03:31.430> since

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
bulbs with my parking sensitive since

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.190 
bulbs with my parking sensitive since
who's<00:03:32.000> going<00:03:32.270> off<00:03:32.450> because<00:03:32.720> I'm<00:03:33.110> just

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
who's going off because I'm just

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.840 
who's going off because I'm just
standing<00:03:33.590> on<00:03:33.709> my<00:03:33.890> car<00:03:35.920> but<00:03:36.920> I'm<00:03:37.459> going<00:03:37.670> to<00:03:37.730> set

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
standing on my car but I'm going to set

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.190 
standing on my car but I'm going to set
the<00:03:37.940> camera<00:03:38.209> down<00:03:38.239> to<00:03:38.510> show<00:03:38.690> you<00:03:38.750> guys<00:03:38.959> the

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
the camera down to show you guys the

00:03:39.200 --> 00:04:19.270 
the camera down to show you guys the
brake<00:03:39.590> lights

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.100 

so<00:04:19.880> I<00:04:20.420> think<00:04:20.959> the<00:04:22.750> taillights<00:04:23.750> are<00:04:23.900> a<00:04:23.930> lot

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
so I think the taillights are a lot

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.350 
so I think the taillights are a lot
better<00:04:24.320> now<00:04:24.610> especially<00:04:25.610> with<00:04:25.880> the<00:04:25.940> instant

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
better now especially with the instant

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.870 
better now especially with the instant
on<00:04:26.570> and<00:04:26.780> off<00:04:26.870> like<00:04:27.200> the<00:04:27.320> LED<00:04:27.500> light<00:04:28.280> bar<00:04:28.520> that's

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
on and off like the LED light bar that's

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.130 
on and off like the LED light bar that's
stock<00:04:29.330> in<00:04:29.570> the<00:04:29.690> LS<00:04:31.120> it<00:04:32.120> all<00:04:32.300> matches<00:04:32.540> and<00:04:32.930> comes

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
stock in the LS it all matches and comes

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.890 
stock in the LS it all matches and comes
on<00:04:33.290> perfectly<00:04:33.890> now<00:04:34.070> so<00:04:34.510> looks<00:04:35.510> really<00:04:35.780> good

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
on perfectly now so looks really good

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.000 
on perfectly now so looks really good
clean<00:04:37.450> that's<00:04:38.450> pretty<00:04:38.750> much<00:04:38.840> it<00:04:39.080> look<00:04:39.830> at<00:04:39.920> the

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
clean that's pretty much it look at the

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.590 
clean that's pretty much it look at the
interior<00:04:40.310> real<00:04:40.670> quick<00:04:40.880> because<00:04:41.030> it's<00:04:41.360> also

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
interior real quick because it's also

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.660 
interior real quick because it's also
led<00:04:42.730> but<00:04:43.730> that's<00:04:43.910> old<00:04:44.090> news

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
led but that's old news

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.770 
led but that's old news
so<00:04:46.670> I'm<00:04:46.940> putting<00:04:47.240> my<00:04:47.360> dome<00:04:47.660> lights<00:04:49.780> passenger

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
so I'm putting my dome lights passenger

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.350 
so I'm putting my dome lights passenger
side<00:04:51.320> lights<00:04:51.850> and<00:04:52.850> or<00:04:53.330> lights<00:04:53.630> and<00:04:54.200> then

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
side lights and or lights and then

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:10.930 
side lights and or lights and then
glovebox<00:05:05.470> also<00:05:06.470> an<00:05:06.710> LED<00:05:06.860> and<00:05:09.669> that's<00:05:10.669> pretty

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
glovebox also an LED and that's pretty

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.830 
glovebox also an LED and that's pretty
much<00:05:11.060> it

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.120 

okay<00:05:14.840> so<00:05:14.900> you'll<00:05:15.230> notice<00:05:15.410> I'm<00:05:15.650> in<00:05:15.770> a<00:05:15.830> different

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
okay so you'll notice I'm in a different

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.909 
okay so you'll notice I'm in a different
location<00:05:16.190> because<00:05:17.060> I<00:05:17.480> talked<00:05:18.080> about<00:05:18.200> turn

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
location because I talked about turn

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.240 
location because I talked about turn
signals<00:05:19.340> but<00:05:19.580> I<00:05:19.610> didn't<00:05:19.880> actually<00:05:20.000> show<00:05:20.600> them

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
signals but I didn't actually show them

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:28.360 
signals but I didn't actually show them
so<00:05:22.510> you<00:05:23.510> show<00:05:23.750> you<00:05:23.810> them<00:05:24.110> now<00:05:27.070> here's<00:05:28.070> the

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
so you show you them now here's the

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.420 
so you show you them now here's the
front<00:05:28.669> of<00:05:29.150> the<00:05:29.330> car<00:05:31.000> with<00:05:32.000> the<00:05:32.300> turn<00:05:32.690> signals

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
front of the car with the turn signals

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:41.719 
front of the car with the turn signals
on<00:05:34.430> all<00:05:34.970> the<00:05:35.300> hazard<00:05:36.080> lights

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:44.270 

I'll<00:05:42.270> be<00:05:42.389> really<00:05:42.599> annoying<00:05:42.930> to<00:05:43.110> look<00:05:43.349> at<00:05:43.560> and

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
I'll be really annoying to look at and

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.869 
I'll be really annoying to look at and
then<00:05:44.729> the<00:05:45.210> back<00:05:45.710> just<00:05:46.710> coincidence<00:05:47.400> that<00:05:47.669> I

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:47.879 
then the back just coincidence that I

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:50.659 
then the back just coincidence that I
have<00:05:48.180> actually<00:05:48.719> the<00:05:49.050> stock<00:05:49.530> fold<00:05:49.830> and<00:05:50.310> an<00:05:50.490> LED

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
have actually the stock fold and an LED

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:55.369 
have actually the stock fold and an LED
because<00:05:51.389> one<00:05:52.050> of<00:05:52.080> my<00:05:52.319> LEDs<00:05:52.620> was<00:05:53.219> defective<00:05:54.379> so

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:55.379 
because one of my LEDs was defective so

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:57.550 
because one of my LEDs was defective so
it's<00:05:55.590> in<00:05:55.800> the<00:05:55.919> mail<00:05:56.129> right<00:05:56.460> now<00:05:56.639> for<00:05:56.939> return

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
it's in the mail right now for return

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.709 
it's in the mail right now for return
but<00:05:58.560> you<00:05:58.800> can<00:05:59.039> see<00:05:59.249> on<00:05:59.580> the<00:05:59.939> right<00:06:00.120> here<00:06:00.419> is<00:06:00.539> the

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:00.719 
but you can see on the right here is the

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:05.119 
but you can see on the right here is the
incandescent<00:06:01.460> stock<00:06:02.460> pull<00:06:03.289> on<00:06:04.289> the<00:06:04.590> left<00:06:04.830> is

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:05.129 
incandescent stock pull on the left is

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:09.230 
incandescent stock pull on the left is
our<00:06:05.789> link<00:06:06.539> evil<00:06:07.249> against<00:06:08.249> the<00:06:08.430> wall<00:06:08.639> here<00:06:08.969> so<00:06:08.999> I

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
our link evil against the wall here so I

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.439 
our link evil against the wall here so I
can't<00:06:09.509> really<00:06:11.150> get<00:06:12.150> too<00:06:12.360> far<00:06:12.659> back<00:06:12.870> but<00:06:14.449> you

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
can't really get too far back but you

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:18.110 
can't really get too far back but you
can<00:06:15.569> see<00:06:15.810> the<00:06:16.469> LED<00:06:16.620> has<00:06:17.039> an<00:06:17.250> instant<00:06:17.669> on<00:06:17.879> and

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
can see the LED has an instant on and

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.379 
can see the LED has an instant on and
off<00:06:18.680> looks<00:06:19.680> pretty<00:06:19.919> cool<00:06:20.159> and<00:06:20.520> I<00:06:21.180> don't<00:06:21.300> know

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:21.389 
off looks pretty cool and I don't know

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:23.869 
off looks pretty cool and I don't know
about<00:06:21.479> on<00:06:21.659> camera<00:06:22.050> but<00:06:22.229> in<00:06:22.349> person<00:06:22.879> it's

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:23.879 
about on camera but in person it's

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:26.929 
about on camera but in person it's
probably<00:06:24.360> twice<00:06:24.599> as<00:06:24.870> right<00:06:25.169> maybe<00:06:25.949> one<00:06:26.669> and<00:06:26.849> a

00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:26.939 
probably twice as right maybe one and a

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:36.760 
probably twice as right maybe one and a
half<00:06:27.150> more<00:06:27.750> right<00:06:31.789> so<00:06:32.789> there's<00:06:33.509> a<00:06:33.680> comparison

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.770 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.399 

real<00:06:37.770> quick<00:06:38.009> I'll<00:06:38.279> turn<00:06:38.490> on<00:06:38.520> the<00:06:38.639> parking<00:06:38.969> lots

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:39.409 
real quick I'll turn on the parking lots

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:47.269 
real quick I'll turn on the parking lots
parking<00:06:40.409> lights<00:06:44.719> just<00:06:45.719> show<00:06:45.870> the<00:06:46.139> LED<00:06:46.560> on<00:06:46.889> top

00:06:47.269 --> 00:06:47.279 
parking lights just show the LED on top

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:51.909 
parking lights just show the LED on top
of<00:06:47.460> LED<00:06:47.879> it<00:06:48.479> looks<00:06:48.659> real<00:06:48.870> crisp<00:06:49.909> thank<00:06:50.909> you

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:55.370 
and there's the stock

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.120 
and there's the stock
I<00:06:55.400> say<00:06:56.270> stock<00:06:56.570> but<00:06:56.840> it's<00:06:56.960> actually<00:06:57.320> a<00:06:57.590> chromium
