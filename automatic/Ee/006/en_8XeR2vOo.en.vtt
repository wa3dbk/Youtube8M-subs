00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.950
 dzsenifer marozsÃ¡n how have you today 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.269
 seen the game 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.309
 in my opinion it was very important 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.740
 that we did the early 1 0 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.960
 reloaded relatively quickly with the 2 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.609
 0 then we have the game out a bit 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.279
 given by hand and have this well 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.060
 good chances given but I think 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.490
 the conversion which we do not access there 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.160
 So the duisburger admitted 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.050
 We mostly have the game 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.880
 have very well combined very well 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.950
 good chances are played out 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.660
 the only thing that needs to get even better 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.930
 to exploit the opportunities 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.210
 ok with frankfurt they are now 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.190
 the step 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.289
 they have lost points against 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.190
 leverkusen at home and eating at home 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:54.660
 How did it happen? It's always like that 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.969
 that little moments in sweden the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.489
 one is unfocused that often 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.039
 be punished quickly and hard 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.110
 It's just that the bundesliga 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.229
 From the level has become even stronger 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.510
 and you can not underestimate anyone and 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.850
 also we must not allow ourselves 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.350
 to be unfocused in the game but 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.250
 must from the first to the last 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.320
 be fully awake in seconds 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.509
 next week, the game comes against that 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.140
 in a top game in dfb-cup like 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.770
 do you see that? 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.820
 I am happy and we are all 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.820
 Hot on the game and 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.119
 because you are already world champion and 20 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.539
 Germany also her masters now what 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:43.570
 is the most important thing for you, it is clear 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.990
 nice with the u teams everything 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.470
 to have experienced that were unforgettable 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.179
 moments for me but I think 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:02:10.090
 european championship at the women's 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:02:12.010
 is always a headache and now with 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.000
 germany are already on the way to 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.390
 camera 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.310
 how does that work now so we are very 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.080
 Well started in the quali and now 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.940
 it just has to continue like that 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.569
 to be pulled through we must continue 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.989
 stay focused and then likely 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:31.570
 nothing stands in the way and tutsi what is 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.190
 these years your animals so i want 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.620
 In any case, always from the beginning 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.440
 play my best for that 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.290
 team and just all the more difficult ones 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.500
 dearest and the technology where have you 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.579

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.620
 brother together 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:51.489
 from morning to evening always with boys 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.200
 kicked and of course, a talent with 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.590
 On the way given by my 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.819
 Father and I think that is too 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.040
 a lot of training and a lot of work behind it 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.630
 is not just like that 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.680
 and you also have a role model in the 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.389
 movie of the year 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.709
