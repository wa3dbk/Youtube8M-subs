00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
high-speed shot n things that will

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.680 
high-speed shot n things that will
continue<00:04:57.340> the<00:04:57.790> continuous<00:05:00.120> action<00:05:01.120> for<00:05:01.540> that

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
the high-speed video and so can get

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.610 
the high-speed video and so can get
slower<00:05:06.340> motion<00:05:06.580> effects<00:05:07.320> so<00:05:10.080> please<00:05:11.080> rate

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
slower motion effects so please rate

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.100 
slower motion effects so please rate
