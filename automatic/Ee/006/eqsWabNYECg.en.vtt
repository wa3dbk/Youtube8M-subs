and<00:02:36.360> whatnot<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.870> then<00:02:37.110> you<00:02:37.260> get<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.590> test<00:02:37.860> it

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
and whatnot and then you get to test it

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.009 
and whatnot and then you get to test it
out<00:02:38.099> in<00:02:38.340> your<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.760> your<00:02:38.790> scrimmage<00:02:39.450> were<00:02:39.780> not

to trying to get my takedowns right and
I'm<00:03:35.669> trying<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:35.970> do<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.150> with<00:03:36.269> speed<00:03:36.569> you<00:03:37.169> know

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
I'm trying to do it with speed you know

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.530 
I'm trying to do it with speed you know
I<00:03:37.560> know<00:03:37.919> when<00:03:38.280> I<00:03:38.310> actually<00:03:38.549> go<00:03:38.849> to<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.030> UFC<00:03:39.510> and

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
I know when I actually go to the UFC and

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.180 
I know when I actually go to the UFC and
all<00:03:39.810> that<00:03:39.989> stuff<00:03:40.139> it's<00:03:40.500> gonna<00:03:40.650> be<00:03:40.829> really<00:03:40.950> hard

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
all that stuff it's gonna be really hard

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.949 
all that stuff it's gonna be really hard
cuz<00:03:41.400> these<00:03:41.519> guys<00:03:41.730> have<00:03:41.940> counter-attacks<00:03:42.720> but

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
cuz these guys have counter-attacks but

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.680 
cuz these guys have counter-attacks but
this<00:03:43.079> is<00:03:43.200> just<00:03:43.230> a<00:03:43.470> pudding<00:03:43.889> basics<00:03:44.639> but<00:03:45.150> I<00:03:45.209> got

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
this is just a pudding basics but I got

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.180 
this is just a pudding basics but I got
a<00:03:45.720> black<00:03:45.930> belt<00:03:45.959> in<00:03:46.290> and<00:03:46.440> I<00:03:46.470> finished<00:03:46.769> in<00:03:46.859> 21

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
a black belt in and I finished in 21

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.800 
a black belt in and I finished in 21
seconds<00:03:47.639> so<00:03:47.760> we<00:03:47.849> did<00:03:48.000> we<00:03:48.180> did<00:03:48.299> it<00:03:48.389> pretty<00:03:48.569> well

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
seconds so we did we did it pretty well

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.690 
seconds so we did we did it pretty well
and<00:03:49.200> this<00:03:49.500> is<00:03:49.650> probably<00:03:49.769> my<00:03:50.040> favorite<00:03:50.370> part<00:03:50.579> of

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
and this is probably my favorite part of

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.400 
and this is probably my favorite part of
the<00:03:50.880> game<00:03:51.120> so<00:03:51.419> far<00:03:51.690> from<00:03:51.930> what<00:03:52.019> I've<00:03:52.230> done

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
the game so far from what I've done

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.099 
the game so far from what I've done
attempting<00:03:53.280> submissions<00:03:53.880> now<00:03:54.419> I<00:03:54.450> had<00:03:54.930> to

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
attempting submissions now I had to

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.170 
attempting submissions now I had to
retry<00:03:55.620> it<00:03:55.650> because<00:03:56.250> it<00:03:56.669> was<00:03:56.730> actually<00:03:57.120> a

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
retry it because it was actually a

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.640 
retry it because it was actually a
really<00:03:57.329> big<00:03:57.599> fail<00:03:57.870> I<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:58.109> Rita<00:03:58.410> really

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
really big fail I to Rita really
