through<00:01:04.180> it<00:01:04.270> and<00:01:04.420> then<00:01:04.809> sometimes<00:01:05.199> it<00:01:05.350> does

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
through it and then sometimes it does

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.550 
through it and then sometimes it does
hit<00:01:05.740> the<00:01:05.830> boat<00:01:06.010> but<00:01:06.430> not<00:01:06.760> often<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:08.080> I<00:01:08.140> can<00:01:08.350> sort

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
hit the boat but not often so I can sort

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:16.790 
hit the boat but not often so I can sort
of<00:01:10.560> well<00:01:11.560> it's<00:01:11.680> hitting<00:01:11.980> the<00:01:12.010> boat<00:01:12.190> now<00:01:13.710> oh

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.230 

right<00:01:17.800> I<00:01:18.010> think<00:01:18.250> that's<00:01:18.430> a<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:22.060> that<00:01:22.120> a

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
right I think that's a is that a

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.300 
right I think that's a is that a
graphical<00:01:23.050> glitch<00:01:23.260> I'm<00:01:23.710> not<00:01:23.860> entirely<00:01:24.130> sure

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
graphical glitch I'm not entirely sure

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.960 
graphical glitch I'm not entirely sure
but<00:01:24.810> um<00:01:25.810> yeah<00:01:26.470> might<00:01:27.100> be<00:01:27.250> slightly<00:01:27.520> buggy

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
but um yeah might be slightly buggy

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.780 
but um yeah might be slightly buggy
might<00:01:28.270> be<00:01:28.390> slightly<00:01:28.660> buggy<00:01:29.020> I<00:01:29.380> have<00:01:30.250> to<00:01:30.400> was

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
might be slightly buggy I have to was

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.450 
might be slightly buggy I have to was
working<00:01:31.390> earlier<00:01:31.570> with<00:01:32.050> arrows<00:01:32.560> it's<00:01:32.980> strange

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
working earlier with arrows it's strange

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.600 
working earlier with arrows it's strange
it's<00:01:33.790> not<00:01:34.000> right<00:01:34.210> now<00:01:34.390> but<00:01:34.890> let's<00:01:35.890> some<00:01:36.190> go

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
it's not right now but let's some go

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.000 
it's not right now but let's some go
into<00:01:36.910> game<00:01:37.720> mode<00:01:37.750> 1<00:01:38.050> and<00:01:38.230> you<00:01:38.710> can<00:01:38.830> see<00:01:38.980> that

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
into game mode 1 and you can see that

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.800 
into game mode 1 and you can see that
the<00:01:39.160> effect<00:01:39.580> turns<00:01:39.820> off<00:01:40.030> because<00:01:40.210> any<00:01:40.390> effects

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
the effect turns off because any effects

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.560 
the effect turns off because any effects
me<00:01:40.960> and<00:01:41.140> them<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:42.670> adventure<00:01:43.060> mode<00:01:43.240> and<00:01:43.480> I'm

doing it with only four command blocks
and<00:01:45.940> they<00:01:46.659> activate<00:01:47.080> in<00:01:47.260> this<00:01:47.440> order<00:01:47.650> this

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
and they activate in this order this

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.100

any player we have

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.660 
any player we have
a<00:02:14.030> score<00:02:14.720> point<00:02:15.410> of<00:02:15.680> zero<00:02:15.740> and<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.370> score

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
a score point of zero and the score

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.320 
a score point of zero and the score

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.030 
point is actually am sneak scoreboard
it's<00:02:20.570> tracking<00:02:21.110> whether<00:02:21.530> or<00:02:21.710> not<00:02:21.830> I'm

it's tracking whether or not I'm

this<00:02:29.630> is<00:02:29.780> from<00:02:29.960> previous<00:02:30.440> test<00:02:30.770> this<00:02:31.610> is<00:02:31.790> from

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
this is from previous test this is from

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.220 
this is from previous test this is from
a<00:02:31.970> previous<00:02:32.330> test<00:02:32.540> this<00:02:32.690> command<00:02:33.080> block

a previous test this command block

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.300 
a previous test this command block
actually<00:02:33.440> isn't<00:02:33.770> used<00:02:34.100> at<00:02:34.280> all<00:02:35.200> in<00:02:36.200> this<00:02:36.860> in

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
actually isn't used at all in this in

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.490 
actually isn't used at all in this in
this<00:02:37.550> design<00:02:37.940> I<00:02:38.000> was<00:02:38.360> playing<00:02:38.900> around<00:02:39.050> with<00:02:39.320> a

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
this design I was playing around with a

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.270 
this design I was playing around with a
teleporting<00:02:40.280> skeletons<00:02:41.080> yep<00:02:42.080> so<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.950> the

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
teleporting skeletons yep so the the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.070 
teleporting skeletons yep so the the
first<00:02:43.490> one<00:02:43.730> just<00:02:43.760> summons<00:02:44.330> your<00:02:44.570> boat<00:02:44.750> the

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
first one just summons your boat the

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.860 
first one just summons your boat the
second<00:02:45.470> one<00:02:45.680> destroys<00:02:46.550> your<00:02:46.850> boat<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:47.239> the

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
second one destroys your boat and the

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.920 
second one destroys your boat and the
third<00:02:48.110> one<00:02:48.350> makes<00:02:48.650> sure<00:02:48.920> that<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.160> sneak

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
third one makes sure that the sneak

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.440 
third one makes sure that the sneak
scoreboard<00:02:50.930> that<00:02:51.260> i<00:02:51.290> have<00:02:51.560> is<00:02:51.920> reset<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:52.760> zero

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
scoreboard that i have is reset to zero

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.270 
scoreboard that i have is reset to zero
so<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:54.140> whole<00:02:54.260> thing<00:02:54.470> is<00:02:54.590> really<00:02:54.770> done<00:02:55.100> by

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
so the whole thing is really done by

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.340 
so the whole thing is really done by
these<00:02:55.430> three<00:02:56.209> command<00:02:56.600> blocks<00:02:56.780> that's<00:02:56.989> just

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
these three command blocks that's just

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.620 
these three command blocks that's just
go<00:02:58.280> back<00:02:58.430> into<00:02:58.580> game<00:02:58.820> mode<00:02:59.680> to<00:03:00.680> and<00:03:01.360> check<00:03:02.360> that

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
go back into game mode to and check that

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.360 
go back into game mode to and check that
ah<00:03:03.610> mmm<00:03:04.900> now<00:03:05.900> that's<00:03:06.200> not<00:03:06.410> working<00:03:06.650> very

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
ah mmm now that's not working very

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.449 
ah mmm now that's not working very
interesting<00:03:08.350> now<00:03:09.350> i'm<00:03:09.560> experimenting<00:03:10.040> on

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
interesting now i'm experimenting on

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.130 
interesting now i'm experimenting on
camera<00:03:10.880> which<00:03:11.120> was<00:03:11.300> the<00:03:11.420> one<00:03:11.600> thing<00:03:11.870> that<00:03:11.930> I

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
camera which was the one thing that I

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.890 
camera which was the one thing that I
said<00:03:12.470> that<00:03:12.650> I<00:03:12.680> didn't<00:03:13.040> want<00:03:13.220> to<00:03:13.280> do<00:03:16.600> but<00:03:17.600> I'm

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
said that I didn't want to do but I'm

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.780 
said that I didn't want to do but I'm
doing<00:03:18.170> it<00:03:18.350> apparently<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:20.420> again<00:03:20.720> oh<00:03:21.760> here<00:03:22.760> we

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
doing it apparently to again oh here we

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:32.730 
doing it apparently to again oh here we
go<00:03:23.799> 0.5<00:03:24.799> seems<00:03:25.070> to<00:03:25.220> work<00:03:26.620> does<00:03:27.620> that<00:03:27.709> work

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.250 

that's<00:03:33.370> really<00:03:33.670> weird<00:03:33.840> so<00:03:34.840> apparently<00:03:34.990> you

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
that's really weird so apparently you

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.800 
that's really weird so apparently you
can't<00:03:35.470> shoot<00:03:35.800> thought<00:03:36.580> you<00:03:36.700> could<00:03:37.710> huh<00:03:39.810> that's

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
strange that's really weird it was it

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.810 
strange that's really weird it was it
was<00:03:42.550> working<00:03:42.910> before<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:44.170> now<00:03:44.320> it's<00:03:44.470> not

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
was working before and and now it's not

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.940 
was working before and and now it's not
tell<00:03:45.820> you<00:03:45.880> what<00:03:46.030> though<00:03:46.150> now<00:03:46.300> it's<00:03:46.510> gotten

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
yeah now it's gotten rid of the boat

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
yeah now it's gotten rid of the boat
when<00:03:50.830> I'm<00:03:50.950> on<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.070> floor<00:03:51.280> which<00:03:51.580> is<00:03:51.700> quite

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
when I'm on the floor which is quite

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.060 
when I'm on the floor which is quite
nice<00:03:52.060> which<00:03:52.480> is<00:03:52.600> quite<00:03:52.720> nice<00:03:52.900> so<00:03:53.680> yeah<00:03:53.770> maybe<00:03:53.920> I

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
nice which is quite nice so yeah maybe I

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.830 
nice which is quite nice so yeah maybe I
need<00:03:54.190> to<00:03:54.430> experiment<00:03:55.090> around<00:03:55.390> with<00:03:55.690> this<00:03:55.780> a

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
need to experiment around with this a

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.060 
need to experiment around with this a
little<00:03:55.990> bit<00:03:56.170> more<00:03:56.320> but<00:03:56.500> I<00:03:56.530> wanted<00:03:56.740> to<00:03:56.800> show<00:03:57.040> you

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
little bit more but I wanted to show you

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.900 
little bit more but I wanted to show you
I<00:03:57.640> wanted<00:03:58.330> to<00:03:58.450> start<00:03:58.750> doing<00:03:59.020> more<00:03:59.410> like<00:03:59.910> mini

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
I wanted to start doing more like mini

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.730 
I wanted to start doing more like mini
mini<00:04:01.420> episodes<00:04:01.900> because<00:04:02.230> i<00:04:02.440> know<00:04:02.500> that<00:04:02.590> i

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
mini episodes because i know that i

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.340 
mini episodes because i know that i
usually<00:04:03.010> just<00:04:03.250> release<00:04:03.880> maps<00:04:04.180> and<00:04:04.540> do<00:04:04.690> map

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
usually just release maps and do map

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.380 
usually just release maps and do map
making<00:04:05.590> videos<00:04:05.980> so<00:04:06.250> i<00:04:06.550> wanted<00:04:06.940> to<00:04:07.000> do<00:04:07.120> a<00:04:07.150> little

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
making videos so i wanted to do a little

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.680 
making videos so i wanted to do a little
bit<00:04:07.510> of<00:04:07.540> something<00:04:08.440> extra<00:04:09.010> and<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:10.450> we'll<00:04:10.570> get

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
bit of something extra and and we'll get

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.100 
bit of something extra and and we'll get
on<00:04:10.840> to<00:04:11.220> this<00:04:12.220> whole<00:04:12.460> contraption<00:04:13.000> probably<00:04:13.990> at

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
on to this whole contraption probably at

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.990 
on to this whole contraption probably at
a<00:04:14.140> later<00:04:14.380> date<00:04:14.470> i'm<00:04:14.980> working<00:04:15.280> on<00:04:15.550> that<00:04:15.700> for<00:04:15.760> a

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
a later date i'm working on that for a

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.940 
a later date i'm working on that for a
map<00:04:16.180> so<00:04:16.360> i<00:04:16.780> hope<00:04:17.020> you've<00:04:17.170> all<00:04:17.320> enjoyed<00:04:17.380> this

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
map so i hope you've all enjoyed this

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.490 
map so i hope you've all enjoyed this
little<00:04:18.340> mini<00:04:19.299> episode<00:04:19.480> i<00:04:19.989> think<00:04:20.260> it's<00:04:20.380> quite

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
little mini episode i think it's quite

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.760 
little mini episode i think it's quite
nice<00:04:20.680> magic<00:04:21.250> carpet<00:04:22.530> apparently<00:04:23.530> it<00:04:23.620> doesn't

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
nice magic carpet apparently it doesn't

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.980 
nice magic carpet apparently it doesn't
work<00:04:23.980> with<00:04:24.130> those<00:04:24.360> it<00:04:25.360> was<00:04:25.510> working<00:04:25.870> earlier

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
work with those it was working earlier
