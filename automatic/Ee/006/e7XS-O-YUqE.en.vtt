00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:06.149
 good just married that is out there let's see what a wave with a with a 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:07.870
 mistake I had a while ago 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.819
 I think it's good because if it took a long time 

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:12.489
 in telling the lie solution 

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:16.790
 Estepona and in several forums this and Latin gabachos 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.180
 and there will find solution to icon some kids of the I do not remember that the forum 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.550
 but this one is half 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.259
 what happens is that all this data from the computer independently 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:29.289
 be the reason is 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.480
 this year people who like it or for the city I have the xp and windows 7 in 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.900
 the same computer 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.969
 for those we use 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.120
 We are not operational because we already know that at the beginning a 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.250
 menu where question answered operative that starts with windows 7 or with the 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:44.069
 earlier version 

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:45.880
 which in this case would be xp 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.010
 but by chance of the fate that knows that you have to be careful making cash 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.500
 if I install xp and when the computer says that you think 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.670
 the beggar menu and now it was there went in directly cherubs 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.210
 and windows 7 who knows where he was 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.040
 aemec always rocked and the eleven this in what to the 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.790
 the forums and nothing you have to be will be first seeing from xp view and 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.550
