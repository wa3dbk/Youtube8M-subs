in<00:03:55.720> robot<00:03:56.350> mode<00:03:56.380> he<00:03:56.739> looks<00:03:57.690> pretty<00:03:58.690> darn<00:03:59.050> near

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
in robot mode he looks pretty darn near

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.009 
in robot mode he looks pretty darn near
right<00:03:59.500> on<00:03:59.680> what<00:04:00.340> the<00:04:00.459> movie<00:04:00.730> does<00:04:00.910> a<00:04:01.180> little

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
right on what the movie does a little

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:08.370 
right on what the movie does a little
bit<00:04:02.610> more<00:04:03.610> stocky<00:04:04.330> side<00:04:05.010> but<00:04:06.570> overall<00:04:07.570> the

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
bit more stocky side but overall the

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.710 
bit more stocky side but overall the
lines<00:04:08.620> and<00:04:09.100> that<00:04:09.310> work<00:04:09.640> definitely<00:04:10.390> work<00:04:10.510> for

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
lines and that work definitely work for

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.270 
lines and that work definitely work for

something involving a war which is

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.060 
something involving a war which is

Chevy<00:04:33.520> to<00:04:34.800> do<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:35.919> Camaro's<00:04:36.510> which<00:04:37.510> is<00:04:37.690> a<00:04:37.930> nice

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
Chevy to do the Camaro's which is a nice

departure from his old beetle form and
they<00:04:42.940> also<00:04:43.090> paint<00:04:43.900> homage<00:04:44.290> to<00:04:44.710> that<00:04:45.190> if<00:04:45.520> you've

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
they also paint homage to that if you've

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.170 
they also paint homage to that if you've
seen<00:04:46.419> the<00:04:46.570> movie<00:04:46.600> in<00:04:47.490> one<00:04:48.490> of<00:04:48.580> the<00:04:48.700> first<00:04:48.910> shots

seen the movie in one of the first shots

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.290 
seen the movie in one of the first shots
of<00:04:49.390> bumblebee<00:04:49.810> that<00:04:49.990> you<00:04:50.140> see<00:04:50.550> of<00:04:51.550> him<00:04:52.000> in

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
of bumblebee that you see of him in

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.719 
of bumblebee that you see of him in
Bobby<00:04:53.050> Bolivia's<00:04:54.510> car<00:04:55.510> lot<00:04:56.410> he's<00:04:57.370> sitting

Bobby Bolivia's car lot he's sitting

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.450 
Bobby Bolivia's car lot he's sitting
right<00:04:57.760> next<00:04:58.510> to<00:04:58.780> an<00:04:59.080> old<00:04:59.320> Volkswagen<00:04:59.680> Beetle

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
right next to an old Volkswagen Beetle

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.659 
right next to an old Volkswagen Beetle
which<00:05:00.640> I<00:05:00.760> thought<00:05:00.940> was<00:05:01.630> a<00:05:01.690> cute<00:05:02.020> little<00:05:02.669> homage

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
which I thought was a cute little homage

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:09.680 
which I thought was a cute little homage
there<00:05:05.010> all<00:05:06.010> right<00:05:06.300> and<00:05:07.300> that's<00:05:07.600> about<00:05:08.350> it<00:05:08.890> for

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
there all right and that's about it for

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.270 
there all right and that's about it for
his<00:05:10.690> vehicle<00:05:11.140> mode<00:05:11.169> honestly<00:05:11.800> I<00:05:11.919> think<00:05:11.979> it's

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
his vehicle mode honestly I think it's

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.980 
his vehicle mode honestly I think it's
one<00:05:12.580> of<00:05:12.610> the<00:05:12.729> best<00:05:12.910> ones<00:05:13.180> I've<00:05:13.450> seen<00:05:13.479> in<00:05:13.900> a<00:05:13.930> long
