either side comes in a very nice bright
polished<00:00:56.389> chrome<00:00:56.600> finish<00:00:57.069> this<00:00:58.069> gives<00:00:58.309> it<00:00:58.399> a

00:00:58.449 --> 00:00:58.459 
polished chrome finish this gives it a

00:00:58.459 --> 00:01:00.250 
polished chrome finish this gives it a
bit<00:00:58.609> of<00:00:58.699> protection<00:00:58.819> for<00:00:59.329> the<00:00:59.449> metal<00:01:00.139> work

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
bit of protection for the metal work

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.610 
bit of protection for the metal work
underneath<00:01:02.619> second<00:01:03.619> stage<00:01:03.829> is<00:01:04.040> an<00:01:04.129> X<00:01:04.280> DX<00:01:04.489> 40

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620

entry level to the apex range but no

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.150 
entry level to the apex range but no
means<00:01:09.230> a<00:01:09.580> poor<00:01:10.580> regulator<00:01:11.620> ideally<00:01:12.620> built<00:01:12.830> for

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
means a poor regulator ideally built for

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.820 
means a poor regulator ideally built for
cold<00:01:13.760> water<00:01:14.000> has<00:01:14.840> heat<00:01:15.080> exchangers<00:01:15.650> on<00:01:15.770> the

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
cold water has heat exchangers on the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.880 
cold water has heat exchangers on the
hoses<00:01:16.250> and<00:01:16.750> a<00:01:17.750> great<00:01:18.170> feature<00:01:18.440> of<00:01:18.530> this<00:01:18.710> is

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
hoses and a great feature of this is

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.950 
hoses and a great feature of this is
that<00:01:18.920> can<00:01:19.220> actually<00:01:19.370> be<00:01:19.550> very<00:01:19.880> reverse<00:01:20.600> so<00:01:20.870> you

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
that can actually be very reverse so you

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.660 
that can actually be very reverse so you
can<00:01:21.080> have<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.290> hose<00:01:21.470> coming<00:01:22.100> out<00:01:22.220> left<00:01:22.490> side

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
can have the hose coming out left side

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.560 
can have the hose coming out left side
great<00:01:23.450> for<00:01:23.600> twin<00:01:23.780> sets<00:01:24.080> and<00:01:24.590> things<00:01:24.620> like<00:01:24.830> that

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
great for twin sets and things like that

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.690 
great for twin sets and things like that
on<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:26.900> side<00:01:27.850> you've<00:01:28.850> got<00:01:29.180> venturi<00:01:29.840> control

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
on the side you've got venturi control

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.380 
on the side you've got venturi control
which<00:01:31.700> is<00:01:31.880> helps<00:01:32.650> the<00:01:33.650> flow<00:01:34.010> the<00:01:34.940> air<00:01:35.060> inside

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
which is helps the flow the air inside

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.030 
which is helps the flow the air inside
the<00:01:35.660> regulator<00:01:36.730> in<00:01:37.730> its<00:01:38.030> minus<00:01:38.480> pre-dive

the regulator in its minus pre-dive
setting<00:01:40.040> it<00:01:40.430> just<00:01:40.640> prevents<00:01:40.940> any<00:01:41.150> free<00:01:41.360> flying

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660
