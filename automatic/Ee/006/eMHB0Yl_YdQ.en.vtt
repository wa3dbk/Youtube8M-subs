to the front panel there are three

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.340 
to the front panel there are three
different<00:00:41.520> types<00:00:41.790> usually<00:00:42.540> used<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
different types usually used in the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.860 
different types usually used in the
industry<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.489> first<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.149> spring<00:00:45.570> type

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
industry and the first is a spring type

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.160 
industry and the first is a spring type
which<00:00:46.739> we're<00:00:47.160> doing<00:00:48.120> here<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.629> can<00:00:48.899> see<00:00:49.050> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
which we're doing here you can see the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.529 
which we're doing here you can see the
spring<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.559> holds<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.920> wire<00:00:50.129> together<00:00:50.579> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
spring that holds the wire together the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.069 
spring that holds the wire together the
next<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.710> nylon<00:00:53.370> hospitai<00:00:54.180> p'<00:00:54.210> which<00:00:54.840> will

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
next is a nylon hospitai p' which will

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.220 
next is a nylon hospitai p' which will
actually<00:00:55.350> lock<00:00:55.890> into<00:00:56.309> place<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.989> third

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.080 
little trick to get the wire band back
on<00:04:26.880> is<00:04:27.710> just<00:04:28.710> put<00:04:28.889> a<00:04:28.919> little<00:04:29.250> bit<00:04:29.610> of<00:04:29.759> fairly
