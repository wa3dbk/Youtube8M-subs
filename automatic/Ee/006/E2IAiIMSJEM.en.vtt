00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.370
 good 

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:07.370
 today I will talk about the bladder 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.370
 swim 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.780
 the swim bladder problem is 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.930
 when your weight 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.420
 it fills with air 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.900
 and tends to climb to the top of 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.900
 your aquarium 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.100
 that's just because of the dry food 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.720
 like the pellets the scales is why 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.150
 always good to vary the food of your 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.119
 fishes 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.980
 tell them that this beta is this enjoyment 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.380
 that you see here suffered from this 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.079
 problem 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.770
 what it says to cure it 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:44.620
 The first thing I did was to buy 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.710
 a laxative that is served to the chs that 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.040
 It is made from vegetables is 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.040
 this 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.880
 what she later was 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:08.610
 take golf and in this plastic bottle 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.180
 introducing 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:16.110
 more or less this unequal amount acz 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.110
 in the bottle 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:24.770
 when it is already inside the bottle 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.770
 the only thing that we should do is 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.890
 dilute the 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.970
 we must leave the fish at least 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.580
 all one night and the next day 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.980
 make a change 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.970
 30 or 40 percent 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.970
 of this bottle 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.040
 that would be more or less up here 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.979
 we reload the water and return 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.979
 to add a tablet of similar 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.979
 characteristic 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:08.350
 on the second day the fish should have 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:10.630
 dedicated enough means that your 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.250
 stomach should be already clean and not 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.250
 I should have trouble floating 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.519
 then our country should of this 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.519
 shape 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.710
 and also tell you that this problem 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:27.100
 of swim bladder 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:30.220
 If we do not treat on time in a short time 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:34.330
 our our fish whether they are 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.660
 golfers scalars disks or others 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.820
 can suffer from opt 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.490
 what is a deadly disease like all 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.760
 we know then to avoid 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.770
 this is good to always treat them when 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.900
 we already see that there is this kind of 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.900
 good problem I hope it serves them 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.310
 I would already be publishing other videos for 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.550
 that they can help their fish in some 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.590
 in some diseases 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.590
 I say goodbye goodbye
