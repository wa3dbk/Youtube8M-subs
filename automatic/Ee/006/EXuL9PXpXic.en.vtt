 mixing spatula that will make 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.120
 everything looks like a homogeneous mixture 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.520
 spectacular that we are going to do we are going to 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.390

 let's put this 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:48.160
 a pot of yogurt with that same pot you're going 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:53.450
 to use it to measure the quantities 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:55.100
 of sugar flour and oil we mix 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.519
 then it has to be a pot of yogurt 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.570
 of vanilla preferably whole if 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:05.600
 you want then we put a pot of 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.300
 sugar we're going to put half a bottle of 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.960
 neutral oil 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:15.320
 let's mix everything in the blender whisk 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.650
 mixter I have already mixed the three 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.020
 flour pots we are going to mix everything with 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.240
 a trickle of vanilla essence a 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.090
 little bit of orange zest 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.070
 we place here 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.700
 3b videos 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.700
 and now yes 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.050
 to missions 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.119
 in the middle of the preparation we're going to 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.720
 incorporate the rest of the flour that 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.720
 we had measured 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.190
 and there we activate again 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:57.680
 and it's ready it was impeccable look at the 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:00.880
 consistency that has remained very good 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.980
 what we are going to do now is fill 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.940
 our molds for cupcakes or muffins 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:11.000
 so you're going to fill all of them up to a 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.520
 little more than half if you want 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.100
 you stay tufted if you want me to 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.350
 stay chatito is up to half you're going to 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.820
 preheat the oven about 3 minutes 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:25.940
 before taking them to cook and then 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:31.750
 you will leave us approximately between 15 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:35.100
 and 20 minutes to medium to mild oven 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.100
 until they are well cooked and barely 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.100
 golden 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.500
 let's use the blender function 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.020
 manual of our bat mixer and we're going to 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.209
 make a topping for our cupcakes 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.849
 what we had done a little while ago 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.940
 what we are going to use we have cheese 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.830

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.130
 place in a bowl we will put 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.060
 this impalpable sugar to form 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.610
 our cream 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.340
 and we're going to put it if they want a 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.160
 little bit of dye in paste 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.690
 edible to give color painkillers with 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.670
 the tip of a knife a 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.210
