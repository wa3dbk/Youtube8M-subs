00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:11.800 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.560 

large<00:00:12.800> blocks<00:00:13.219> of<00:00:13.430> the<00:00:13.580> frozen<00:00:13.969> lake<00:00:14.180> were

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
large blocks of the frozen lake were

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.140 
large blocks of the frozen lake were
blown<00:00:14.840> onto<00:00:15.080> land<00:00:15.440> by<00:00:15.799> a<00:00:15.830> force<00:00:16.250> nine<00:00:16.610> storm

blown onto land by a force nine storm

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.690 
blown onto land by a force nine storm
and<00:00:18.020> you<00:00:18.140> can<00:00:18.289> begin<00:00:18.470> to<00:00:18.890> see<00:00:19.130> the<00:00:19.430> huge

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
and you can begin to see the huge

and you can begin to see the huge
destructive<00:00:20.270> forces<00:00:20.660> we're<00:00:20.930> talking<00:00:21.380> about

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
destructive forces we're talking about

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.910 
destructive forces we're talking about
directly<00:00:23.840> in<00:00:23.930> its<00:00:24.050> path<00:00:24.759> was<00:00:25.759> miles<00:00:26.060> home<00:00:26.920> when

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
directly in its path was miles home when

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.800 
directly in its path was miles home when
I<00:00:27.949> saw<00:00:28.310> it<00:00:28.460> it<00:00:28.580> was<00:00:28.640> probably<00:00:29.150> out<00:00:29.269> here<00:00:29.480> maybe

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
I saw it it was probably out here maybe

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.019 
I saw it it was probably out here maybe
30<00:00:30.109> feet<00:00:30.350> or<00:00:30.529> so<00:00:30.740> and<00:00:30.769> it<00:00:31.369> was<00:00:31.490> moving<00:00:31.760> about

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
30 feet or so and it was moving about

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.390 
30 feet or so and it was moving about
the<00:00:32.269> same<00:00:32.449> speed<00:00:33.019> as<00:00:33.199> a<00:00:33.230> brisk<00:00:33.769> walk

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
the same speed as a brisk walk

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.689 
the same speed as a brisk walk
a<00:00:35.440> colleague<00:00:36.440> of<00:00:36.620> Miles<00:00:36.890> filmed<00:00:37.460> on<00:00:37.580> his

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
a colleague of Miles filmed on his

a colleague of Miles filmed on his
camera<00:00:37.970> phone<00:00:38.000> as<00:00:38.390> the<00:00:38.750> wave<00:00:38.960> of<00:00:39.140> ice<00:00:39.320> forced

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
camera phone as the wave of ice forced

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.030 
camera phone as the wave of ice forced
them<00:00:40.040> inside<00:00:43.660> like<00:00:44.660> at<00:00:44.899> Isaac's<00:00:45.260> ease<00:00:45.500> there

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
them inside like at Isaac's ease there

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.650 
them inside like at Isaac's ease there
was<00:00:46.160> nothing<00:00:46.550> they<00:00:46.700> could<00:00:46.760> do<00:00:47.059> to<00:00:47.390> stop<00:00:47.450> it

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
was nothing they could do to stop it

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.260 
was nothing they could do to stop it
this<00:00:48.320> is<00:00:48.530> shocking<00:00:48.829> to<00:00:49.160> watch<00:00:49.370> I<00:00:49.670> have<00:00:49.850> to<00:00:49.879> say

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
this is shocking to watch I have to say

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.420 
this is shocking to watch I have to say
I<00:00:50.510> mean<00:00:50.539> as<00:00:51.110> a<00:00:51.170> glaciologist<00:00:51.530> I'm<00:00:52.190> used<00:00:52.370> to

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
I mean as a glaciologist I'm used to

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.400 
I mean as a glaciologist I'm used to
seeing<00:00:52.670> ice<00:00:52.910> in<00:00:53.149> motion<00:00:53.690> but<00:00:53.840> normally<00:00:54.230> we're

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
seeing ice in motion but normally we're

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.860 
seeing ice in motion but normally we're
talking<00:00:54.710> about<00:00:55.120> millimeters<00:00:56.120> per<00:00:56.300> day<00:00:56.570> you

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
talking about millimeters per day you

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.330 
talking about millimeters per day you
know<00:00:56.930> this<00:00:57.199> is<00:00:57.350> moving<00:00:57.559> so<00:00:57.800> fast<00:00:57.829> we<00:00:58.219> can

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
know this is moving so fast we can

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.830 
know this is moving so fast we can
actually<00:00:58.460> see<00:00:58.820> it<00:00:58.969> and<00:00:59.000> you<00:00:59.300> can<00:00:59.449> see<00:00:59.690> the

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
actually see it and you can see the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.450 
actually see it and you can see the
forces<00:01:00.350> at<00:01:00.500> work<00:01:00.680> and<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.010> destructive

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
forces at work and the destructive

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.509 
forces at work and the destructive
forces

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.570 

trilling<00:01:05.519> hey

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
trilling hey

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.750 
trilling hey
because<00:01:07.940> this<00:01:08.120> goes

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.980 

get<00:01:15.030> out<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.180> here<00:01:16.160> miles<00:01:17.450> we<00:01:18.450> gotta<00:01:18.630> move<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
get out of here miles we gotta move the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.380 
get out of here miles we gotta move the
cabin<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:19.380> blew<00:01:19.620> apart

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.100 

there's<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.140> hoverla<00:01:25.500> Coker<00:01:25.980> Beach<00:01:27.110> this

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
there's the hoverla Coker Beach this

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.160 
there's the hoverla Coker Beach this
happen<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.740> matter<00:01:28.980> of<00:01:29.270> five<00:01:30.270> minutes

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:41.910 

this<00:01:33.500> is<00:01:33.680> absolutely<00:01:34.750> crazy

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.830 

after<00:01:42.920> 15<00:01:43.310> minutes<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.880> increased<00:01:44.570> friction

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
after 15 minutes the increased friction

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.830 
after 15 minutes the increased friction
the<00:01:45.229> ice<00:01:45.350> experienced<00:01:46.189> on<00:01:46.310> land<00:01:46.549> again<00:01:47.119> slowed

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
the ice experienced on land again slowed

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.779 
the ice experienced on land again slowed
it<00:01:47.990> down<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:48.530> it<00:01:49.429> finally<00:01:49.670> stopped<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:51.789> yet

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
it down and it finally stopped and yet

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.419 
it down and it finally stopped and yet
incredibly<00:01:53.179> in<00:01:53.659> that<00:01:54.140> short<00:01:54.500> period<00:01:54.920> of<00:01:55.130> time

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
incredibly in that short period of time

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.940 
incredibly in that short period of time
it<00:01:55.880> had<00:01:56.149> completely<00:01:56.600> destroyed<00:01:57.140> 12<00:01:57.530> homes

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
it had completely destroyed 12 homes

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.209 
it had completely destroyed 12 homes
along<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.520> lakes<00:01:58.729> edge<00:01:58.939> and<00:01:59.270> damaged<00:02:00.259> 15

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
along the lakes edge and damaged 15
