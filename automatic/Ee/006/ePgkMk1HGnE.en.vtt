00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.199
 and the engineer 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.910
 look 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.040
 because they were here again for the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.350
 juniors commenting on this new video and 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.990
 this time we are in a new tutorial of 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.720
 decoration but this time it's not going to be one 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.460
 but there are going to be several for your house 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.410
 well then let's start once 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.190
 you are entered your house and all and 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:29.080
 well then good now one or another 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.690
 what is going to say I want we have the 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.660
 terrace or something like that for when my 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.489
 friends come to my world see what good 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.039
 they are built or not and well 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.280
 let's start the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:44.649
 this mini tutorial something like this we're going to 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.699
 place two valleys around here and we're going to 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:52.210
 put two slabs here in this from above 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.940
 of the fences and now we are going to place a 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.690
 oven like this in order to achieve 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.969
 do this little grill we have now 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.400
 here you just go up and do what 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.370
 you want 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.510
 what are we going to do to see if you're not here 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.260
 part of the tutorial 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.940
 well now let's do the next 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.370
 construction that the truth does not come out its 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.730
 name but good I'll tell you 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:22.140
 heats something like that because it is not 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:25.510
 that had his name but last oblivion and 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.460
 right now I do not have internet in my house and 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.310
 I can not investigate what is so good 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.830
 Well, we're going to call it a very good heater 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.990
 we put first I have not said anything let's go 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.450
 to place this kind of bridge cited 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.390
 once placed that we're going to fill in 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.180
 new behind this in this way so 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.390
 that does not know anything and now we place slabs 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.240
 of stone in this part so well 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.880
 perfect now what are we going to do 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.010
 we take blocks from the lower world the 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.020
 we place and light them with a 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.600
 lighter now 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.810
 let's get these two ways not a 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.030
 grill and the heater or forgiveness is me 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.179
 forgot to put something we put this here 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.239
 and this here simulating that these two are 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:13.780
 they could close inwards but they do not 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:16.599
 can so it's a simulation ok now 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.670
 what are we going to do very well, since 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.610
 we have these two, we need a 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.160
 place to relax very well for that 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.000
 we will do as follows we will 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.610
 take this form a small square of 4 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.060
 cubes of wood and now we're going to place 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.849
 a ladder here and another here 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.220
 this way we do not have it but the 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:42.579
 I'm going to do a little more here because 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.650
 I stay very close to the grill and if it happens 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:48.920
 are where are we going to place the table 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.340
 we place I'm perfect there we are very 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.890
 all right 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.450
 now let's put it on this side 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:59.090
 let's put this here here and here 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.939
 we put these two like this in this way 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.489
 nothing else here we would place a 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:07.489
 small table and I think I'm going to 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.849
 go this a little further back and 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:13.819
 we put it back in place for sure 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:17.900
 they learned how everything is like that and now 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:21.829
 let's take wipes of these we're going to 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:25.519
 take this away from us and we take this very well 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:28.400
 we place them and there we have it already 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.409
 we have our little terrace and now 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.200
 they will ask and if it is done at night it is 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:34.909
 where we get light because here not from and not 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.189
 when we go to get there we go 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:39.980
 make some small towers and you're 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:42.620
 four valleys high once that's done 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.950
 we are going to place any cube in the 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.920
 part above placed these two 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.480
 things very well we need to place 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.750
 any cube 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.900
 we take glass panels and surround it 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.930
 in this way until you have this 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.069
 way now we remove the center and 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.319
 we put a juice of the water 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.859
 in this way the valleys are not going to 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:11.280
 burn but a precaution do not have it 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:14.790
 so close to wood because if they do 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.430
 it's going to burn but then something else 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:21.599
 they look very good these lamps are very 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:24.120
 nice for me not for me 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:27.840
 very beautiful and jump pears but good 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.090
 everyone has their opinions and I 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.039
 I have mine very well, we do it again 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.620
 the same we surround it with panels of 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:38.090
 crystal until achieving the following form 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.370
 of something like that 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.550
 the round ones in a square but that 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.919
 is surrounding something once this is done 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.979
 We have our little terrace but 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:51.710
 imagine that one says he wanted a 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:54.260
 campaign phrase very well let 's go is a 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:05:05.320
 let it be campaign let's make it this 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:05.320
 side here well here we are 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:14.780
 we put in this way very well there 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.840
 we are there is and now we are going to place 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.120
 3 1 2 3 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.810
 very well now let's do what 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.630
 next very well yes 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.920
 A) Yes 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:35.300
 and so very now we are going to place a 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:38.450
 pisito little of this good was us 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:41.050
 any material both wool and 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:45.350
 These can be used by you 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:47.930
 they will see how they have better material 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.680
 liked it more or more so that you have 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.550
 a little more than 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:56.160
 and how would this be 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.960
 be the good word that has a little 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.350
 more variety 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:04.789
 of colors to make it good let's 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:08.310
 keep putting this here we are 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:09.900
 let's continue placing this campaign house 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:13.470
 It also serves for things in 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:15.990
 survival though it's not very good 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.620
 but it works so if they want 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:21.240
 use it well then it is your choice 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:24.479
 nobody uses it but five minutes 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.759
 then he has a clip at home so he does not 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:30.090
 it is so recommended very well we already have 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:33.120
 our campaign house showed something here 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:36.870
 and well now you just put your bed 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.910
 in there for what is here you sleep and 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.950
 already 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.930
 and here we have our little 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.840
 terrace for the back of your 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:50.450
 house and so we could have something more 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:52.370
 nice and more so everything more pro and so that 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:55.520
 our friends when visiting our world 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:58.460
 say wow what a wonderful thing 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.800
 yes well, here I'm going and 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.570

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.270
 decoration I hope you liked it
