00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.530
 is one of those few professions in which 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.559
 there is a direct confirmation of one's own 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.439
 operated ie where all faced a 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.270
 person who for different reasons 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:20.580
 regardless of extraction e 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.849
 cultural of social extraction at the age 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.489
 personal data need your assistance 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.169
 the fact that your work has therefore 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.509
 positive feedback 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.460
 gives you a live bonus I think 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.110
 that in very few other professions either 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.390
 detectable then the professional 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.990
 nurse that professional that is 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.220
 deputy to the provision of assistance 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.570
 in the collective imagination the use 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.550
 of the professional nurse is 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.410
 closely related to what the 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.120
 our health organization that has 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.520
 a prevalence in the field of acute and 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.990
 therefore we mistakenly place the 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.910
 figure of Professor's infirmary 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.220
 Fermiano stand in the hospital environment 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.260
 in reality the potential is that 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.239
 in respect of those are the plans 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.770
 national health authorities who then come 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.989
 diversified also at regional level 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.899
 in a better autonomy in the field 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.200
 territorial especially in a trend of 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:12.060
 those that are currently for the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.950
 population in which there is an incidence of 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.630
 chronic degenerative diseases and therefore 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.550
 of patients who need to be 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.830
 acquired in areas other than those 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.810
 for had and then the hospitals in 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.880
 their homes and then to the ssistenza 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.180
 a competent assistance that is 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.540
 peculiarities of nurses 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.670
 would guarantee those levels 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.140
 need for peace of mind for health 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.180
 of the citizen to the attainment of 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.280
 baccalaureate degree you must write a 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.270
 degree course you entered in the 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.010
 faculty of medicine lasts three years and the 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.550
 three-year degree or first degree 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.050
 level from releases contextually the 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.090
 qualification for the exercise of 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.320
 profession and therefore is one of the few 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.820
 triennial titles that coincides with 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.370
 professional qualification the offer 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.850
 formative is quite diversified to 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.259
 vertical point of view for following 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.810
 what is the current order 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.340
 university for which after three years it is 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.290
 You can continue with the degree 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.770
 masterful that are two more years for 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.180
 become nursing coordinators 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.520
 those that are commonly grown 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.530
 a course will be provided as a leader 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.840
 always from the same type regulation 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.220
 horizontal there is once acquired i 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.110
 three years 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.320
 bachelor's degree ie it is 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.820
 You can access a master's degree for the 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.070
 Coordination evolutions that have the 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.930
 duration of a year to date unlike 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.540
 of the past if we also see data 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.010
 almalaurea compared to 2007 there was a 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.900
 employment and nurses at one year 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.450
 of the consequent a degree higher than 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.150
 90 percent now there was one 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.450
 regrettable that one arrives around 65 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.110
 per cent 2011 data is true that anyway 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.740
 remains among the professions most 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.480
 palatable to the point of view 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.160
 occupational because always data 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.440
 however, at five years of age there is the 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.500
 total employment we saw a 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.120
 increase in requests for 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.340
 our professionalism also abroad 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.200
 especially in england countries 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.000
 Scandinavian and who has courage also in 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.459
 australia working in such contexts 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.240
 those in hospitals where a 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:17.290
 24- hour operativity of a shift nurse 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:20.380
 so that it plays its only morning 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.070
 for the 8th day of actual Sundays e 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.830
 anything else with the accessory indemnities 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.810
 just hired earns about 1,600 euros 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.900
 years later there is big 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.100
 difference because I think it reflects 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.500
 a contractual method 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.510
 there is a diversification in the field 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.490
 public according to seniority beautiful 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.010
 difference is clear to me who comes 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.370
 placed in days and then contexts 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.890
 all that is one is less 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.590
 specific dignity for some situations 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.700
 takes less then gets to take 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.700
 even 1,300 euros
