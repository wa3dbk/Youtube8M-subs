00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.860
 Good day to all you on the channel 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.020
 history of tanks and today we will not 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.530
 about old cars that are already gone 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.990
 past 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:24.560
 about cutting edge development 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:28.070
 Russian designers and tanks t-90 9 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.439
 Armata new Russian tank t 90 9 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.310
 has some similarities in common with 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:38.000
 project t95 black eagle which was to 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:40.820
 the word closed in May 2010 Armata 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.460
 weighs about 55 tons and has 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.890
 125 gauge smoothbore gun 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.770
 millimeters are also days if necessary 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.560
 it can be replaced by 125 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.990
 millimeters tank will have completely 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.930
 uninhabited tower which is very noticeable 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.820
 reduce the silhouette of the automatic loader of the new 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.400
 type along with separate from crew 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.590
 ammunition will remove the lack of many 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.619
 Russian tanks video vulnerabilities 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.470
 ammunition and the defeat of the crew at his 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.680
 explosions special armor capsules together 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.260
 yourself all three crew members that very 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.530
 greatly increase their security and improve 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.940
 communication between them in battle 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.159
 the survival rate of the tank itself also 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.950
 will increase as it will be possible 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:28.010
 book a larger body volume and 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.570
 tower out booking bye talk 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:34.550
 early as this information is classified 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.180
 maybe a new tank will be installed on the tank 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.560
 active protection system 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.020
 analyze the situation around combat 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.479
 cars and when approaching the enemy tank 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.210
 rockets or shells shoot them out 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.479
 guns this system was called a tank that is 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.850
 tank missile system 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.040
 it was developed in the 80s 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.930
 represented two rapid-fire 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.750
 guns twin machine gun and 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.110
 radar arranged 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.630
 in the container and in between the 80s 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.000
 project tank shut down due to low 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.849
 efficiency but now development 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.519
 technology has leaped forward so 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:16.100
 Russian tank Armata may well 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.830
 get similar and effective 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.390
 something else active defense system on this 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.340
 all friends of me if you like 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.620

 strongly supported by the author and also not 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.330
 forget to offer in the comments 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.380
