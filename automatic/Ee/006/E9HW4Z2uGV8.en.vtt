00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.820
 zara thugs with you panda top 10 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.160
 ramps who wrote subscribers went 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.259
 it happens that it’s worth it on roshana like everything 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.829
 calm the enemy team you all over 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:17.560
 visibility is no longer waiting when 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:22.199
 you can compose aegis and here they happen 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:26.410
 weird stuff on the other end of the map 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.029
 For example, here are my God the roads 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.369
 doing rampagu let's see how it is 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.860
 actually happened and so are you 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.530
 little leshrac with horns running on 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.399
 the base is not clear why the whole team 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:48.329
 gathered and leaving oh kid and roshana 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:48.329
 taken away from moose to obviously problems 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.470
 ok guys as you understood after the release 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.760
 Minera today will be many ramps on it 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.310
 to be honest with our friend 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.440
 rampagi striker is just full 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.210
 some are beautiful so part 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.960
 we decided to take but surely be on 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.860
 other heroes are ramping too 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.750
 don't bomb much 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:17.150
 and so the miner takes two and quietly 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.790
 farm creeps at this time let 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.380
 the kneading and miner begins 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.780
 Of course, I am ready to sacrifice my 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.500
 life for the sake of the team well and good 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.330
 a kilo especially if up to 3 rolls next 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.930
 miner also looks quite interesting 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.020
 This rampage should be called something like this. 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.440
 fate gives all those who can read 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.600
 so base break against oh snuggles 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.149
 nothing else and comrades are going 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.899
 together to finally push 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.509
 win the game 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:51.259
 miner can do nothing because 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:54.110
 just comes gushing bewilderment 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.940
 fountain prostration but very soon he 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.460
 the stairs and as you understand will click 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.330
 magic button 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.570
 pub another fun rampag on me 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.970
 and 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.770
 but as you understand it you are not 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.979
 ends because you are waiting for more 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.420
 one rampag and guess on which hero I am 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.180
 I think that many have heard in the menu radik 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.250
 take care so not surprised so 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.690
 I promise the number of ramps on it today 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.980
 that the next issues are of course so much 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.830
 there will not be as much until we will 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.220
 name if it is a fact sure ultra kill and 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.730
 last customer must die menu 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.049
 wounds of war of course 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.739
 well, the last rampag on today 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:36.560
 me and in my opinion very well she 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.950
 Made from of course they will help him but not 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.700
 Still it is also quite fun and 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.690
 So 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:48.200
 barsha ulting Magnus brings 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.269
 and the miner presses the magic blast button 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.709
 ok guys i understand you are already tired 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.090
 from the ramps on the menu and therefore a bit 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.090
 rest for the eyes and continue 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.930
 ok next our visage hero finally 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.150
 that sent on visage rarely is 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:17.370
 what happens is therefore especially nice 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.269
 the team confidently flies once 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.750
 next next next 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.330
 three in a row 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.660
 enigma goes to the fountain and of course 5 as 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.130
 always appears the most given 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.220
 joyfully, but now you yourself all 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.519
 see by went x went on really wants 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.880
 pick rampag naturally and comes 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.599
 angry man greedy forest trait 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.810
 furion 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:45.569
 he becomes 5 goals of visage and visage 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:49.140
 makes sure rampagu same 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:51.019
 well fit our next invoker hero 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.269
 on invoker we always love 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:57.560
 because it is not even a rikimaru though 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:06.239
 would not be a miner and rikimaru is already good 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:09.450
 meteors fly wind all things 4 and 5 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.310
 the client himself refuses to go to the fountain 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.190
 says i better give all the fight 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.049
 well what is your choice suddenly it's yours 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.289
 choice and 5 kilos 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.419
 the invoker floor is also very, very 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.740
 fit 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.970
 our next hero is magnus 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.940
 who I really like on it ramp 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.979
 it would seem everything just drove drove gave 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.240
 fly across the field but it's all there 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.810
 combined with black hole and we eat we 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.010
 so it looks particularly interesting and 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.530
 surprising as no one had time to have 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:41.100
 to inhabit it but nevertheless there will be 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.860
 pure trump aga pure and honest rampag 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.740
 rhinoceros truth somewhat tightened i'm not 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.969
 so sharp it is usually a hero well 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.419
 and pharma in large account not 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:56.339
 No to auyl damage and powerfully 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:58.699
 pour calmly finished off rampag on 

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:58.699
 magnet 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.229
 the next guest of our transfer panda here 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.699
 I love this hero though to play it 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.680
 few people know how I could not bear it 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:13.169
 subscribers bake because almost 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.940
 always starts a wild plum from behind 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.680
 that the boys do not know how to control those 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.380
 less here panda plays quite test 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.789
 sawn off thank God baby there and 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:26.610
 whist is present which is also good and 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:28.080
 the fight begins for some reason the boys without 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.910
 hop believe that they can afford 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.380
 under these panda with omelet and blink 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.979
 very close it is of course their big 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:37.830
 error 3 comrades already far but again 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:39.659
 blink dagger will catch up with anyone 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.880
 unless of course I will break the panda 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:42.419
 cloister naturally will not be well and legion 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.539
 commander 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:48.569
 come here by the way panda doesn't even get away then 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:52.169
 there is and so everything works out well the remote 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:54.210
 with no need after all there is a duel screech of the field 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:56.430
 resorts and helps to understand and make 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.229
 Trump well if no screech is possible 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.060
 pandas would not have happened so 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:02.669
 free he should at least on lithium 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.500

 today shadow fight often send them 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.469
 but nevertheless you need to take something 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.320

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:11.969
