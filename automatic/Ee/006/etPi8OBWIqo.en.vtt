covered with wooden panels by the
authority<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.370> then<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.329> just<00:00:36.719> put<00:00:37.020> paper<00:00:37.500> on

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
authority and then I just put paper on

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.549 
authority and then I just put paper on
the<00:00:38.820> walls<00:00:39.059> photosensitive<00:00:39.960> paper<00:00:40.170> and

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
the walls photosensitive paper and

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.920 
the walls photosensitive paper and
slowly<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.370> image<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:43.160> registered<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.610> this

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
slowly the image is registered on this

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.110 
slowly the image is registered on this
photosensitive<00:00:45.930> paper<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:47.489> result<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.059> a

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
photosensitive paper the result is a

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.660 
photosensitive paper the result is a
series<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.690> huge<00:00:49.020> photos<00:00:49.500> divided<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.250> various

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
series of huge photos divided in various

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.510 
series of huge photos divided in various
a<00:00:50.879> 34<00:00:51.360> map<00:00:51.539> papers<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.649> be<00:00:52.770> able<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.129> enter<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
a 34 map papers to be able to enter the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.700 
a 34 map papers to be able to enter the
abandoned<00:00:54.000> houses<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.780> artist<00:00:55.170> had<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.559> keep

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
abandoned houses the artist had to keep

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.709 
abandoned houses the artist had to keep
all<00:00:55.949> his<00:00:56.100> material<00:00:56.789> very<00:00:57.030> compact<00:00:57.510> and

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
all his material very compact and

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.229 
all his material very compact and
therefore<00:00:58.680> da<00:00:58.859> three<00:00:59.190> paper<00:00:59.460> format<00:00:59.969> was<00:01:00.180> a

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
therefore da three paper format was a

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.450 
therefore da three paper format was a
compromise<00:01:00.809> between<00:01:01.050> being<00:01:01.710> compacted<00:01:02.129> now

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
compromise between being compacted now

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.609 
compromise between being compacted now
to<00:01:02.520> enter<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> small<00:01:03.329> bag<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.780> big<00:01:04.140> enough<00:01:04.439> to

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
to enter the small bag and big enough to

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.770 
to enter the small bag and big enough to
cover<00:01:04.769> complete<00:01:05.309> walls<00:01:05.580> inside<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.270> rooms<00:01:06.479> he

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
cover complete walls inside the rooms he

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.050 
cover complete walls inside the rooms he
worked<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.920> greed<00:01:08.130> resulting<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.909> this

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
worked in the greed resulting of this

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.390 
worked in the greed resulting of this
puzzling<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.689> papers<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.530> traces<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:11.040> the

puzzling of papers and the traces of the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.580 
puzzling of papers and the traces of the
stitches<00:01:11.700> used<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.330> keep<00:01:12.540> these<00:01:12.720> papers<00:01:13.170> fixed

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
stitches used to keep these papers fixed

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.190 
stitches used to keep these papers fixed
for<00:01:13.979> long<00:01:14.189> amounts<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.700> hours<00:01:15.119> Yoda<00:01:15.750> highly

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
for long amounts of hours Yoda highly

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.710 
for long amounts of hours Yoda highly
crafted<00:01:16.439> aspect<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.490> photography<00:01:18.150> work

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.130 

well<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.110> choice<00:01:23.060> of<00:01:24.060> duel<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.780> really

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
well so the choice of duel is really

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.800 
well so the choice of duel is really
linked<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.710> situation<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.280> founder<00:01:26.820> what

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
linked to the situation of founder what

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.140 
linked to the situation of founder what
I<00:01:27.840> thought<00:01:28.439> interesting<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.280> first<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.790> you

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
I thought interesting is first that you

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.249 
I thought interesting is first that you
have<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:30.479> Authority<00:01:31.909> covering<00:01:32.909> up<00:01:33.259> a

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
have this Authority covering up a

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.520 
have this Authority covering up a
certain<00:01:35.040> way<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.990> situation<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.259> little

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
certain way a situation that is a little

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.609 
certain way a situation that is a little
bit<00:01:38.600> silent<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.780> nod<00:01:39.900> we<00:01:40.229> want<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.500> keep

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
bit silent and nod we want to keep

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.090 
bit silent and nod we want to keep
silent<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:42.390> tool<00:01:42.750> they<00:01:43.020> use<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.560> cover<00:01:43.829> it

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
silent and the tool they use to cover it

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.220 
silent and the tool they use to cover it
up

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
up

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.790 
up
balance<00:01:45.850> I<00:01:46.850> like<00:01:47.600> to<00:01:47.780> think<00:01:47.960> I<00:01:48.140> kind<00:01:48.440> of<00:01:48.530> use

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
balance I like to think I kind of use

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.560 
balance I like to think I kind of use
them<00:01:49.040> to<00:01:49.310> instead<00:01:49.850> talk<00:01:50.150> about<00:01:50.480> the

them to instead talk about the

them to instead talk about the
situations<00:01:51.170> it<00:01:51.380> was<00:01:51.530> really<00:01:51.830> interesting<00:01:52.100> to

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
situations it was really interesting to

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.810 
situations it was really interesting to
have<00:01:52.580> this<00:01:53.320> predestine<00:01:54.320> condition<00:01:54.890> and<00:01:55.100> then

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
have this predestine condition and then

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.900 
have this predestine condition and then
to<00:01:56.030> work<00:01:56.240> with<00:01:56.450> that<00:01:56.950> dude<00:01:57.950> is<00:01:58.130> now<00:01:58.340> abandoned

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
to work with that dude is now abandoned

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.150 
to work with that dude is now abandoned
by<00:01:59.060> most<00:01:59.300> of<00:01:59.540> its<00:01:59.750> inhabitants<00:01:59.900> but<00:02:00.890> if<00:02:01.010> you
