a<00:00:00.439> floppy<00:00:01.439> disk<00:00:01.740> uses<00:00:02.190> a<00:00:02.399> much<00:00:02.840> faster<00:00:03.840> method

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
a floppy disk uses a much faster method

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.680 
a floppy disk uses a much faster method

a cassette the cassette is in a much
more<00:00:10.410> durable<00:00:10.679> package<00:00:11.219> but<00:00:11.849> you<00:00:12.269> have<00:00:12.420> to

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
more durable package but you have to

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.780 
more durable package but you have to
allow<00:00:12.690> for<00:00:12.719> rewinding<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.790> fast-forwarding

the<00:00:18.420> floppy<00:00:18.660> disk<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.490> more<00:00:20.490> fragile<00:00:20.730> than<00:00:20.970> a

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
the floppy disk is more fragile than a

the floppy disk is more fragile than a
cassette<00:00:21.510> since<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.500> actual<00:00:23.390> media<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.660> more
