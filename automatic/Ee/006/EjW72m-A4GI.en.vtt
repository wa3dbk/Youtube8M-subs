our html5 canvas animation tutorial
series<00:00:10.360> in<00:00:11.360> this<00:00:11.690> video<00:00:11.990> we're<00:00:12.200> basically

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:12.499 
series in this video we're basically

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:18.240 
series in this video we're basically
going<00:00:12.950> to<00:00:13.009> be<00:00:14.409> animating<00:00:15.409> a<00:00:15.730> an<00:00:16.810> arc<00:00:17.810> or<00:00:18.140> circle

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250 
going to be animating a an arc or circle

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.180 
going to be animating a an arc or circle
from<00:00:19.450> one<00:00:20.450> point<00:00:20.750> to<00:00:20.900> another<00:00:21.050> and<00:00:21.650> then<00:00:21.980> at

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.190 
from one point to another and then at

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.560 
from one point to another and then at
the<00:00:22.310> end<00:00:22.340> of<00:00:22.490> the<00:00:22.550> video<00:00:22.670> we'll<00:00:23.000> add<00:00:23.180> a<00:00:23.210> third

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
the end of the video we'll add a third

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.370 
the end of the video we'll add a third
point<00:00:23.930> so<00:00:25.750> basically<00:00:26.750> we're<00:00:27.050> going<00:00:27.170> to<00:00:27.230> create

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
point so basically we're going to create

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.529 
point so basically we're going to create
some<00:00:27.590> variables<00:00:27.830> we'll<00:00:28.790> do<00:00:29.030> our<00:00:29.330> X<00:00:29.990> i<00:00:31.419> would<00:00:32.419> do

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:32.539 
some variables we'll do our X i would do

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:38.530 
some variables we'll do our X i would do
point<00:00:33.020> 1<00:00:33.320> is<00:00:34.190> equal<00:00:35.000> to<00:00:35.180> an<00:00:35.300> array<00:00:36.850> okay<00:00:37.850> huh

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
point 1 is equal to an array okay huh

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.400 
point 1 is equal to an array okay huh
and<00:00:39.700> it's<00:00:40.700> going<00:00:40.850> to<00:00:40.910> have<00:00:41.090> an<00:00:41.210> x<00:00:41.420> and<00:00:41.630> y<00:00:41.780> value

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
and it's going to have an x and y value

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.819 
and it's going to have an x and y value
of<00:00:42.650> which<00:00:43.340> are<00:00:43.550> going<00:00:43.670> to<00:00:43.760> be<00:00:43.820> will<00:00:44.390> say<00:00:44.570> 40<00:00:45.110> 40

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
of which are going to be will say 40 40

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.790 
of which are going to be will say 40 40
and<00:00:46.060> then<00:00:47.060> we're<00:00:47.510> going<00:00:47.600> to<00:00:47.720> have<00:00:47.899> our<00:00:47.930> point

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
and then we're going to have our point

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:57.700 
and then we're going to have our point
to<00:00:49.720> and<00:00:51.310> that's<00:00:52.310> going<00:00:52.550> to<00:00:52.640> be<00:00:54.550> 50<00:00:56.470> we'll<00:00:57.470> go

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
to and that's going to be 50 we'll go

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.240 
to and that's going to be 50 we'll go
we'll<00:00:58.340> go<00:01:01.180> 180<00:01:02.500> okay<00:01:03.500> so<00:01:03.800> we're<00:01:04.070> going<00:01:04.159> to

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
we'll go 180 okay so we're going to

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.680 
we'll go 180 okay so we're going to
going<00:01:04.579> from<00:01:04.820> 40<00:01:05.119> 42<00:01:05.560> 180<00:01:06.790> and<00:01:07.790> basically<00:01:08.299> we're

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
going from 40 42 180 and basically we're

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:23.130 
going from 40 42 180 and basically we're
going<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:08.900> be<00:01:11.049> doing<00:01:12.049> that<00:01:12.380> over<00:01:13.960> so<00:01:14.960> we'll<00:01:15.320> say

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.109 

the<00:01:24.140> number<00:01:24.710> of<00:01:25.040> seconds<00:01:25.369> okay<00:01:25.670> so<00:01:25.729> we're

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
the number of seconds okay so we're

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.880 
the number of seconds okay so we're
going<00:01:26.210> to<00:01:26.299> start<00:01:26.330> animating<00:01:27.049> at<00:01:27.470> in<00:01:27.619> 40

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
going to start animating at in 40

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.770 
going to start animating at in 40
seconds<00:01:28.220> will<00:01:28.369> say<00:01:28.520> so<00:01:28.580> if<00:01:28.909> I<00:01:29.150> is<00:01:29.210> greater<00:01:29.510> than

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
seconds will say so if I is greater than

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.090 
seconds will say so if I is greater than
40<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:30.770> will<00:01:31.070> start<00:01:31.340> moving<00:01:32.020> and<00:01:33.020> it<00:01:33.350> so<00:01:33.979> at

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
40 and will start moving and it so at

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.340 
40 and will start moving and it so at
forty<00:01:34.369> cents<00:01:34.780> we're<00:01:35.780> going<00:01:35.869> to<00:01:35.930> start<00:01:36.020> moving

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
forty cents we're going to start moving

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:48.280 
forty cents we're going to start moving
it<00:01:37.030> we're<00:01:38.030> going<00:01:38.210> to

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.500 

let's<00:01:48.920> see<00:01:49.160> we're<00:01:49.940> going<00:01:50.030> to<00:01:50.120> do<00:01:50.300> if<00:01:50.600> I<00:01:50.780> is

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
let's see we're going to do if I is

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:02.800 
let's see we're going to do if I is
we're<00:01:53.510> going<00:01:53.600> to<00:01:53.660> animate<00:01:54.730> to<00:01:55.730> 100<00:01:58.720> here<00:01:59.720> so<00:02:01.810> if

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
we're going to animate to 100 here so if

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:13.330 
we're going to animate to 100 here so if
I<00:02:03.410> is<00:02:04.160> less<00:02:04.670> than<00:02:04.730> 40<00:02:07.570> we're<00:02:08.570> going<00:02:08.720> to<00:02:08.780> do<00:02:12.340> CDOT

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
I is less than 40 we're going to do CDOT

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.140 
I is less than 40 we're going to do CDOT
memory<00:02:14.000> which<00:02:14.330> copying<00:02:14.810> paces<00:02:16.150> starting

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
memory which copying paces starting

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:25.870 
memory which copying paces starting
implement<00:02:17.960> will<00:02:18.140> be<00:02:22.150> alright<00:02:23.950> 10<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:25.400> this

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
implement will be alright 10 and this

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:34.870 
implement will be alright 10 and this
will<00:02:26.120> be<00:02:26.350> point<00:02:29.470> 11<00:02:31.630> okay<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:33.260> then<00:02:34.250> here<00:02:34.640> it's

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
will be point 11 okay and then here it's

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.420 
will be point 11 okay and then here it's
going<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.180> be<00:02:35.680> moving<00:02:36.680> towards<00:02:37.340> point2<00:02:38.110> so<00:02:39.430> we

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
going to be moving towards point2 so we

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.699 
going to be moving towards point2 so we
have<00:02:40.520> to<00:02:40.640> calculate<00:02:43.989> how<00:02:44.989> much<00:02:45.200> it<00:02:45.440> will<00:02:45.530> move

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
have to calculate how much it will move

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.370 
have to calculate how much it will move
each<00:02:45.890> frame<00:02:46.250> in<00:02:46.550> between<00:02:46.940> frame<00:02:47.480> 40<00:02:47.930> and<00:02:48.140> frame

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
each frame in between frame 40 and frame

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.990 
each frame in between frame 40 and frame
100<00:02:48.890> so<00:02:49.700> do<00:02:50.000> that<00:02:50.209> we<00:02:51.080> are<00:02:51.800> going<00:02:52.340> to<00:02:52.489> say<00:02:52.670> point

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
100 so do that we are going to say point

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.880 
100 so do that we are going to say point
1<00:02:53.739> plus<00:02:56.680> power<00:02:57.680> point<00:02:58.160> 10<00:02:58.310> plus<00:02:59.590> and<00:03:00.590> this<00:03:00.739> is

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
1 plus power point 10 plus and this is

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.490 
1 plus power point 10 plus and this is
going<00:03:01.070> to<00:03:01.160> be<00:03:01.310> point<00:03:01.790> 1

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.880 

one<00:03:08.310> plus<00:03:10.700> okay<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:11.910> this<00:03:12.180> is<00:03:12.330> going<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.540> be

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
one plus okay and this is going to be

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:19.300 
one plus okay and this is going to be
basically<00:03:13.890> we're<00:03:14.250> going<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.430> subtract<00:03:14.850> point2

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.440 

we're<00:03:20.310> going<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.490> subtract<00:03:20.730> point<00:03:21.000> one<00:03:21.180> from

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
we're going to subtract point one from

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.160 
we're going to subtract point one from
point<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:22.350> x<00:03:22.500> value<00:03:23.870> and<00:03:24.870> that<00:03:24.900> will<00:03:25.140> give

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
point to the x value and that will give

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.510 
point to the x value and that will give
us<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.530> amount<00:03:26.190> of<00:03:26.340> our<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:29.010> number<00:03:29.400> of

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
us the amount of our the the number of

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.690 
us the amount of our the the number of
pixels<00:03:29.760> in<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:30.390> X<00:03:30.770> on<00:03:31.770> the<00:03:31.890> x<00:03:32.040> axis<00:03:32.190> that<00:03:32.580> we're

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
pixels in the X on the x axis that we're

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.920 
pixels in the X on the x axis that we're
going<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:32.850> be<00:03:33.000> moving<00:03:34.400> okay<00:03:35.510> and<00:03:36.510> then<00:03:36.750> we're

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
going to be moving okay and then we're

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.920 
going to be moving okay and then we're
going<00:03:37.020> to<00:03:37.110> divide<00:03:37.320> that<00:03:37.830> up<00:03:38.040> into<00:03:38.540> 60<00:03:39.540> parts

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
going to divide that up into 60 parts

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.390 
going to divide that up into 60 parts
because<00:03:40.320> it's<00:03:40.830> going<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.070> be<00:03:41.220> over<00:03:41.370> 60<00:03:41.940> seconds

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.280 

so<00:03:47.400> we'll<00:03:47.610> take<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:47.940> number<00:03:48.150> divide<00:03:49.050> it<00:03:49.170> by

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
so we'll take that number divide it by

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.699 
so we'll take that number divide it by
60<00:03:49.680> and<00:03:50.570> then<00:03:51.570> we're<00:03:51.780> going<00:03:51.870> to<00:03:51.959> multiply<00:03:52.260> it

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
60 and then we're going to multiply it

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:59.360 
60 and then we're going to multiply it
by<00:03:53.390> I<00:03:57.350> so<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.470> number<00:03:58.739> of<00:03:58.830> seconds<00:03:59.130> that<00:03:59.220> have

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
by I so the number of seconds that have

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.420 
by I so the number of seconds that have
gone<00:03:59.520> by<00:03:59.840> minus<00:04:00.840> 40<00:04:01.320> because<00:04:01.650> we<00:04:02.010> don't<00:04:02.220> want

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
gone by minus 40 because we don't want

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.729 
gone by minus 40 because we don't want
to<00:04:02.520> have<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:03.180> have<00:04:03.780> anything<00:04:04.050> to<00:04:04.230> do<00:04:04.440> with<00:04:04.590> that

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:14.870 

okay<00:04:07.739> so<00:04:12.799> let's<00:04:13.799> do<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.070> same<00:04:14.340> thing<00:04:14.640> for<00:04:14.820> the

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
okay so let's do the same thing for the

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:27.620 
okay so let's do the same thing for the
y<00:04:15.150> value<00:04:18.229> do<00:04:19.229> we<00:04:19.650> just<00:04:20.489> copy<00:04:20.729> and<00:04:20.850> paste<00:04:20.940> this

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.930 

okay<00:04:28.630> and<00:04:29.020> then<00:04:29.470> this<00:04:29.680> is<00:04:29.950> instead<00:04:30.520> of<00:04:30.580> going

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
okay and then this is instead of going

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.200 
okay and then this is instead of going
to<00:04:31.090> be<00:04:31.300> zeros<00:04:32.140> here<00:04:32.500> we're<00:04:32.650> going<00:04:32.740> to<00:04:32.830> do<00:04:33.210> my

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
to be zeros here we're going to do my

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.320 
to be zeros here we're going to do my
values<00:04:35.370> all<00:04:36.370> right<00:04:36.550> so<00:04:36.850> let's<00:04:36.940> keep<00:04:37.180> that

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
values all right so let's keep that

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:46.700 
values all right so let's keep that
again<00:04:41.850> let's<00:04:42.850> change<00:04:43.150> the<00:04:43.450> frame<00:04:43.870> rate<00:04:44.140> first

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:54.170 

2<00:04:47.710> 30

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.430 

alright<00:04:55.050> so<00:04:56.360> we<00:04:57.360> can<00:04:57.509> move<00:04:57.750> these<00:04:57.930> points

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
alright so we can move these points

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:10.520 
alright so we can move these points
around<00:04:58.680> now<00:05:00.919> let's<00:05:01.919> go<00:05:04.940> 380<00:05:09.139> and<00:05:10.139> it<00:05:10.229> will<00:05:10.350> go

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
around now let's go 380 and it will go

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:16.040 
around now let's go 380 and it will go
to<00:05:10.590> that<00:05:10.800> point<00:05:14.030> now<00:05:15.030> let's<00:05:15.389> add<00:05:15.570> a<00:05:15.600> third

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
to that point now let's add a third

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:27.460 
to that point now let's add a third
point<00:05:18.650> less<00:05:19.650> than<00:05:19.919> 160<00:05:25.220> copy<00:05:26.220> and<00:05:26.400> paste<00:05:26.490> this

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
point less than 160 copy and paste this

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.670 
point less than 160 copy and paste this
this<00:05:28.470> is<00:05:28.710> going<00:05:28.949> to<00:05:29.009> be<00:05:29.130> a<00:05:29.160> lot<00:05:29.460> easier<00:05:30.680> copy

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
this is going to be a lot easier copy

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.689 
this is going to be a lot easier copy
and<00:05:31.800> paste<00:05:31.889> it<00:05:32.220> switch<00:05:32.940> at<00:05:33.120> the<00:05:33.150> point<00:05:33.479> numbers

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:34.699 
and paste it switch at the point numbers

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:41.240 
and paste it switch at the point numbers
so<00:05:35.699> let's<00:05:36.180> make<00:05:36.810> another<00:05:36.900> point<00:05:37.349> here<00:05:40.250> this

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
so let's make another point here this

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:52.520 
so let's make another point here this
will<00:05:41.430> be<00:05:41.630> 300<00:05:42.630> I<00:05:43.430> will<00:05:44.430> do<00:05:45.590> 250<00:05:46.590> and<00:05:50.000> 210<00:05:51.530> okay

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
will be 300 I will do 250 and 210 okay

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.170 
will be 300 I will do 250 and 210 okay
so<00:05:52.590> it's<00:05:52.860> going<00:05:52.949> to<00:05:53.039> go<00:05:53.190> kind<00:05:53.490> of<00:05:53.580> to<00:05:53.729> the<00:05:53.849> right

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
so it's going to go kind of to the right

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.159 
so it's going to go kind of to the right
and<00:05:54.479> then<00:05:54.960> down<00:05:55.289> and<00:05:55.530> back<00:05:56.750> all<00:05:57.750> right<00:05:57.990> and

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
and then down and back all right and

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:00.620 
and then down and back all right and
then<00:05:58.229> let's<00:05:58.740> switch<00:05:59.070> out<00:05:59.370> this<00:06:00.030> with<00:06:00.270> point

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
then let's switch out this with point

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:06.649 
then let's switch out this with point
three<00:06:00.990> and<00:06:01.440> point<00:06:01.830> to<00:06:02.570> change<00:06:03.570> that<00:06:03.900> 2.3<00:06:05.000> so<00:06:06.000> so

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:06.659 
three and point to change that 2.3 so so

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:08.360 
three and point to change that 2.3 so so
we're<00:06:06.780> changing<00:06:07.080> all<00:06:07.199> the<00:06:07.260> ones<00:06:07.740> 22<00:06:08.099> is

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
we're changing all the ones 22 is

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.870 
we're changing all the ones 22 is
basically<00:06:09.000> an<00:06:09.120> all<00:06:09.210> the<00:06:09.330> Tuesday<00:06:09.780> threes<00:06:10.880> are

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 
basically an all the Tuesday threes are

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.290 
basically an all the Tuesday threes are
all<00:06:12.870> the<00:06:13.169> point<00:06:13.409> ones<00:06:13.590> to<00:06:13.770> it<00:06:13.860> 22s<00:06:14.789> and<00:06:15.090> all<00:06:15.210> the

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
all the point ones to it 22s and all the

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:21.379 
all the point ones to it 22s and all the
point<00:06:15.539> to<00:06:15.659> use<00:06:15.750> 2.3<00:06:18.680> all<00:06:19.680> right<00:06:20.240> so<00:06:21.240> that

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:21.389 
point to use 2.3 all right so that

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:25.249 
point to use 2.3 all right so that
should<00:06:21.599> do<00:06:21.750> the<00:06:21.780> trick<00:06:22.550> we<00:06:23.550> also<00:06:23.729> have<00:06:24.060> to<00:06:24.259> we

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:25.259 
should do the trick we also have to we

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:28.999 
should do the trick we also have to we
also<00:06:25.409> change<00:06:26.400> what<00:06:26.909> is<00:06:27.530> subtracting<00:06:28.530> from<00:06:28.710> so

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:29.009 
also change what is subtracting from so

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:34.520 
also change what is subtracting from so
we're<00:06:29.159> going<00:06:29.250> to<00:06:29.370> say<00:06:29.610> minus<00:06:30.120> 100<00:06:33.229> so<00:06:34.229> again

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530 
we're going to say minus 100 so again

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.550 
we're going to say minus 100 so again
we're<00:06:34.770> still<00:06:35.070> dividing<00:06:35.820> up<00:06:35.940> the<00:06:36.180> X<00:06:36.599> distance

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
we're still dividing up the X distance

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.279 
we're still dividing up the X distance
into<00:06:38.430> 60<00:06:38.789> parts<00:06:39.120> and<00:06:39.330> then<00:06:39.419> multiplying<00:06:39.990> that

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:40.289 
into 60 parts and then multiplying that

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:44.180 
into 60 parts and then multiplying that
by<00:06:40.500> I<00:06:40.949> minus<00:06:41.520> 100<00:06:42.030> same<00:06:42.870> with<00:06:43.020> the<00:06:43.139> Y<00:06:43.289> so<00:06:44.039> let's

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
by I minus 100 same with the Y so let's

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:52.430 
by I minus 100 same with the Y so let's
give<00:06:44.370> that<00:06:44.550> a<00:06:44.580> go<00:06:48.380> all<00:06:49.380> right<00:06:49.740> so<00:06:51.169> that's<00:06:52.169> kind

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
give that a go all right so that's kind

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.540 
give that a go all right so that's kind
of<00:06:52.500> the<00:06:52.710> idea<00:06:52.740> behind<00:06:53.190> basic<00:06:54.000> path<00:06:54.300> animation

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550 
of the idea behind basic path animation

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:01.490 
of the idea behind basic path animation
in<00:06:56.550> a<00:06:59.030> game<00:07:00.030> you'd<00:07:00.270> probably<00:07:00.539> be<00:07:00.930> you'd<00:07:01.289> have

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500 
in a game you'd probably be you'd have

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.320 
in a game you'd probably be you'd have
more<00:07:01.830> points<00:07:02.279> or<00:07:02.460> something<00:07:02.580> like<00:07:02.849> that<00:07:02.909> if

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.330 
more points or something like that if

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.670 
more points or something like that if
you<00:07:03.419> were<00:07:03.510> actually<00:07:03.719> using<00:07:04.080> this<00:07:04.320> point

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 
you were actually using this point

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.970 
you were actually using this point
moving<00:07:05.070> system<00:07:05.779> and<00:07:06.779> you<00:07:07.229> would<00:07:07.469> be

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:07.980 
moving system and you would be

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.840 
moving system and you would be
using<00:07:08.730> a<00:07:08.910> for<00:07:09.330> loop<00:07:09.360> to<00:07:10.290> loop<00:07:11.010> and<00:07:11.250> this<00:07:11.700> will

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:11.850 
using a for loop to loop and this will

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.770 
using a for loop to loop and this will
be<00:07:11.970> a<00:07:12.000> multi-dimensional<00:07:12.540> array<00:07:13.200> that<00:07:14.160> would

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:14.780 
be a multi-dimensional array that would

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.460 
be a multi-dimensional array that would
be<00:07:15.780> kind<00:07:16.020> of<00:07:16.050> like<00:07:16.230> points<00:07:17.930> is<00:07:18.930> equal<00:07:19.230> to<00:07:19.350> an

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:19.470 
be kind of like points is equal to an

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.580 
be kind of like points is equal to an
array<00:07:19.800> and<00:07:20.300> then<00:07:21.300> each<00:07:21.600> of<00:07:21.630> these<00:07:22.050> would<00:07:22.320> be<00:07:22.470> an

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:22.590 
array and then each of these would be an

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.290 
array and then each of these would be an
array<00:07:22.860> item<00:07:23.220> and<00:07:23.430> you'd<00:07:23.580> loop<00:07:23.880> through<00:07:24.180> the

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:24.300 
array item and you'd loop through the

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:29.380 
array item and you'd loop through the
points<00:07:24.660> array<00:07:24.960> and<00:07:25.200> do<00:07:26.160> this<00:07:26.730> for<00:07:27.060> each<00:07:27.210> point

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:29.390 
points array and do this for each point

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:34.670 
points array and do this for each point
all<00:07:30.390> right<00:07:30.800> pretty<00:07:32.180> simple<00:07:33.180> concept<00:07:33.390> but<00:07:33.810> it

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 
all right pretty simple concept but it

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.450 
all right pretty simple concept but it
can<00:07:34.830> be<00:07:34.920> very<00:07:34.950> useful<00:07:35.310> when<00:07:35.730> you're<00:07:36.060> doing<00:07:36.870> a

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:37.460 
can be very useful when you're doing a

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.150 
can be very useful when you're doing a
whole<00:07:38.460> bunch<00:07:38.490> of<00:07:38.820> different<00:07:39.120> kind<00:07:39.300> of<00:07:39.360> games

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.160 
whole bunch of different kind of games

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.590 
whole bunch of different kind of games
yeah<00:07:41.160> so<00:07:41.460> that's<00:07:41.610> it<00:07:41.700> for<00:07:41.760> this<00:07:41.970> video<00:07:42.150> and<00:07:42.330> the

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:42.600 
yeah so that's it for this video and the
