I'm going to do I am going to search for

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:53.110 
I'm going to do I am going to search for
ESPN<00:00:46.930> ESPN<00:00:47.930> com<00:00:51.160> it's<00:00:52.160> searched<00:00:52.489> it<00:00:52.670> in<00:00:52.790> google

ESPN ESPN com it's searched it in google
and<00:00:53.270> then<00:00:53.720> i<00:00:53.809> can<00:00:53.960> go<00:00:53.989> ahead<00:00:54.110> and<00:00:54.910> go<00:00:55.910> from

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
and then i can go ahead and go from

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.139 
and then i can go ahead and go from
there<00:00:56.360> so<00:00:56.600> we<00:00:57.290> can<00:00:57.410> try<00:00:57.559> another<00:00:57.620> one<00:00:58.630> NFL<00:00:59.630> com

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
there so we can try another one NFL com

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.459 
there so we can try another one NFL com
it's<00:01:02.149> the<00:01:02.270> start<00:01:02.510> of<00:01:02.540> the<00:01:02.600> NFL<00:01:02.840> season<00:01:03.140> today

so I thought it would be worth wild so

of<00:01:27.500> this<00:01:27.680> from<00:01:27.979> my<00:01:28.430> previous<00:01:28.670> android<00:01:29.240> phone

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
of this from my previous android phone

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.420 
of this from my previous android phone
review<00:01:29.720> but<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:30.380> multitouch<00:01:30.799> keyboard<00:01:30.860> is

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
review but the multitouch keyboard is

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:41.530 
review but the multitouch keyboard is
really<00:01:31.729> pretty<00:01:31.909> good<00:01:32.560> whoops

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.219 

and<00:01:44.119> it<00:01:45.119> didn't<00:01:45.360> really<00:01:45.479> turn<00:01:45.659> out<00:01:45.720> as<00:01:45.960> nicely

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
and it didn't really turn out as nicely

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.929 
and it didn't really turn out as nicely
as<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.560> wanted<00:01:46.740> but<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:47.070> can<00:01:47.250> take<00:01:47.369> my<00:01:47.549> word<00:01:47.580> for

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
as I wanted but you can take my word for

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:48.889 
as I wanted but you can take my word for
it<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.090> actually<00:01:48.180> does<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.479> pretty<00:01:48.540> good<00:01:48.780> job

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
it it actually does a pretty good job

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.289 
it it actually does a pretty good job
it's<00:01:49.259> just<00:01:49.439> again<00:01:50.189> recording<00:01:50.790> from<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.060> weird

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
it's just again recording from a weird

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.810 
it's just again recording from a weird
camera<00:01:51.840> angle<00:01:52.259> puts<00:01:53.009> my<00:01:53.130> hands<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.580> weird

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
camera angle puts my hands in a weird

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:03.850 
camera angle puts my hands in a weird
spot

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.040 

so<00:02:04.490> pretty<00:02:04.940> much<00:02:05.030> similar<00:02:05.300> results<00:02:05.930> in

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
so pretty much similar results in

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.389 
so pretty much similar results in
landscape<00:02:07.270> but<00:02:08.270> if<00:02:08.450> you<00:02:08.539> just<00:02:08.720> hold<00:02:09.399> input

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
landscape but if you just hold input

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.430 
landscape but if you just hold input
method<00:02:10.759> you<00:02:11.210> can<00:02:11.330> change<00:02:11.570> the<00:02:11.720> swype<00:02:11.990> I<00:02:12.170> really

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
method you can change the swype I really

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:22.280 
method you can change the swype I really
I<00:02:12.590> really<00:02:12.650> do<00:02:13.100> love<00:02:13.310> swype

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.759 

how<00:02:22.860> long<00:02:23.129> let<00:02:23.310> me<00:02:23.370> just<00:02:23.549> go<00:02:23.700> back<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:24.120> fix

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
how long let me just go back and fix

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:33.670 
how long let me just go back and fix
good

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.920 

this<00:02:34.310> is<00:02:34.430> a<00:02:34.459> good<00:02:34.640> keyboard<00:02:34.879> and<00:02:35.299> again<00:02:35.810> it

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
this is a good keyboard and again it

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
best in portrait for some reason because

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.259 
best in portrait for some reason because
my<00:02:42.980> thumb<00:02:43.310> doesn't<00:02:43.519> have<00:02:43.760> any<00:02:43.909> problems

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
my thumb doesn't have any problems

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:56.129 
my thumb doesn't have any problems
getting<00:02:44.390> anywhere<00:02:44.780> on<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:44.989> screen<00:02:49.930> this<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:51.230> a

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:01.449 

good<00:02:58.060> keyboard<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.769> if<00:03:00.769> you've<00:03:00.889> used<00:03:01.099> this<00:03:01.280> in

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
good keyboard and if you've used this in

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.569 
good keyboard and if you've used this in
person<00:03:01.700> you<00:03:01.909> know<00:03:02.060> it<00:03:02.209> really<00:03:02.480> is<00:03:02.689> pretty<00:03:02.959> good

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
person you know it really is pretty good

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:11.110 
person you know it really is pretty good
but<00:03:04.579> the<00:03:05.239> final<00:03:05.629> input<00:03:05.810> method<00:03:07.030> is<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:10.120> full

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
but the final input method is the full

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.140 
but the final input method is the full
backlit<00:03:11.750> Cordy<00:03:12.290> keyboard<00:03:12.799> now<00:03:13.370> this<00:03:13.909> has

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
backlit Cordy keyboard now this has

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.690 
backlit Cordy keyboard now this has
three<00:03:14.540> rows<00:03:14.720> for<00:03:15.049> your<00:03:15.260> letters<00:03:15.620> does<00:03:16.400> not

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
three rows for your letters does not

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.610 
three rows for your letters does not
have<00:03:16.970> a<00:03:17.000> dedicated<00:03:17.299> number<00:03:17.810> row<00:03:18.139> at<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.349> top

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
have a dedicated number row at the top

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.690 
have a dedicated number row at the top
so<00:03:19.099> you'll<00:03:19.219> have<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.430> use<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:19.760> alt<00:03:20.000> key<00:03:21.700> so

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
so you'll have to use the alt key so

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:39.690 
so you'll have to use the alt key so
let's<00:03:22.969> say<00:03:23.209> this<00:03:23.599> is<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:25.959> test<00:03:26.959> of<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:29.739> keyboard

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.220 

key<00:03:40.470> board<00:03:41.470> all<00:03:41.950> right<00:03:42.780> that's<00:03:43.780> a<00:03:43.870> typo

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
key board all right that's a typo

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.610 
key board all right that's a typo
whatever<00:03:44.590> anyway<00:03:45.660> so<00:03:46.660> this<00:03:47.110> actually<00:03:47.290> turned

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
whatever anyway so this actually turned

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.900 
whatever anyway so this actually turned
out<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:47.860> best<00:03:47.890> because<00:03:48.280> I<00:03:48.340> was<00:03:48.430> able<00:03:48.519> to<00:03:48.670> tilt

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
out the best because I was able to tilt

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.229 
out the best because I was able to tilt
it<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.150> my<00:03:49.300> angle<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:49.840> best<00:03:50.550> but<00:03:51.550> I<00:03:51.760> don't

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
it to my angle the best but I don't

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.670 
it to my angle the best but I don't
think<00:03:52.420> it's<00:03:52.599> the<00:03:53.500> best<00:03:53.680> input<00:03:54.190> method<00:03:54.810> on<00:03:55.810> this

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
think it's the best input method on this

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.330 
think it's the best input method on this
phone<00:03:56.890> to<00:03:57.099> be<00:03:57.220> frank<00:03:57.430> with<00:03:57.640> you<00:03:58.890> I'm<00:03:59.890> kind<00:04:00.310> of

together if you look here you can see

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.800

I've<00:04:15.250> used<00:04:15.280> this<00:04:15.700> keyboard<00:04:16.350> which<00:04:17.350> was<00:04:17.530> pretty

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
I've used this keyboard which was pretty

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.280 
I've used this keyboard which was pretty
good<00:04:17.979> on<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.250> epic<00:04:18.519> 4g<00:04:18.870> another<00:04:19.870> Android

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
good on the epic 4g another Android

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.860 
good on the epic 4g another Android
device<00:04:20.590> this<00:04:21.430> really<00:04:21.970> is<00:04:22.240> not<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.540> best

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
device this really is not the best

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.830 
device this really is not the best
keyboard<00:04:23.610> it's<00:04:24.610> decent<00:04:24.940> you<00:04:25.360> can<00:04:25.510> definitely

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
keyboard it's decent you can definitely

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.680 
keyboard it's decent you can definitely
get<00:04:25.960> used<00:04:26.110> to<00:04:26.290> it<00:04:26.410> and<00:04:26.590> if<00:04:27.250> you<00:04:27.400> really

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
get used to it and if you really

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.180 
get used to it and if you really
practiced<00:04:28.690> a<00:04:28.780> lot<00:04:28.960> you<00:04:29.650> could<00:04:29.800> get<00:04:29.979> much

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
practiced a lot you could get much

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.030 
practiced a lot you could get much
faster<00:04:30.580> than<00:04:30.700> any<00:04:30.820> virtual<00:04:31.210> qwerty<00:04:31.810> board<00:04:32.040> but

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
faster than any virtual qwerty board but

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.950 
faster than any virtual qwerty board but
with<00:04:33.190> swype<00:04:33.550> I<00:04:33.729> think<00:04:33.970> it<00:04:34.150> really<00:04:34.330> matches<00:04:34.660> the

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
with swype I think it really matches the

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.750 
with swype I think it really matches the
speed<00:04:35.260> the<00:04:35.680> top<00:04:35.860> speed<00:04:36.190> that<00:04:36.340> you<00:04:36.460> could<00:04:36.610> get

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
speed the top speed that you could get

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.969 
speed the top speed that you could get
with<00:04:36.850> this<00:04:37.030> particular<00:04:37.260> keyboard<00:04:38.260> so<00:04:38.830> if

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
with this particular keyboard so if

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.980 
with this particular keyboard so if
you're<00:04:39.130> really<00:04:39.280> a<00:04:39.460> heavy<00:04:39.760> messenger<00:04:40.389> and<00:04:40.600> you

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
you're really a heavy messenger and you

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.840 
you're really a heavy messenger and you
really<00:04:41.440> are<00:04:41.530> looking<00:04:41.830> for<00:04:42.040> a<00:04:42.070> top-notch

keyboard you know you may get this just

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.250

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
it's just decent it does a pretty good

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.129 
it's just decent it does a pretty good
job<00:04:54.340> again<00:04:54.760> if<00:04:54.880> you<00:04:54.970> get<00:04:55.120> used<00:04:55.330> to<00:04:55.419> it<00:04:55.479> but<00:04:55.990> it's

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
not the best and of course before I

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.230 
not the best and of course before I
forget<00:05:01.500> this<00:05:02.500> really<00:05:02.830> isn't<00:05:03.010> typing<00:05:03.610> but<00:05:04.090> you

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240
