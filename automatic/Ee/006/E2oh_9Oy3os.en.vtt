00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 how to turn your smartphone into a 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:09.809
 homemade 3d hologram 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.420
 pingping to start putting together our 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.460
 3d hologram we will need these 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.670
 simple articles that you will find 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.580
 under your bed graph paper one 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.689
 box of cid and adhesive tape down 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:28.199
 scissors a smartphone razor a ruler 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.060
 to measure and a cuticle well for 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.730
 start let's create a mold with the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.250
 squared sheet and a rule like I do not 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.140
 I have a rule to use the card of the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.809
 bank where I keep all the savings of 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.899
 my life the measurements are in base 6 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.320
 centimeters in height 3.5 centimeters 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.420
 and the top part one centimeter already 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.820
 that we have our mold to now 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.949
 we will move to remove the stage to the box 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.350
 of the cde and we will remove the edges 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.750
 be very careful not to break the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.270
 beggar because if they are not going to have 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.039
 to look for another stage now with the mold 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.680
 what we did previously with the sheet 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.380
 we went to mark the figure on the cover 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.420
 of the cde and then with the cutter 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.759
 the knife was cut to cut but 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.250
 be very careful not to cut yourself 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.530
 fingers because if not then they can not 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.560
 scratch your nose this we're going to cut 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.679
 four times the same figure and goes to 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.810
 to stay more or less like this we now go to 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:26.610
 paste the four figures that we cut into 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.189
 the cid box and can use 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.409
 adhesive glue or tape me 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.869
 I will use tape because I do not know how 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.380
 remove the glue from the glue has to 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:41.159
 be armed a pyramid like this if 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.280
 So I stay and you did wey 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.649
 now in following step we uncover the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.899
 cuticle and we give you a drink in the 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.330
 description I leave the link to a 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.060
 video that you can use to project 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.880
 the picture to your 3d hologram ending 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.409
 to create they put the pyramid in the middle of the mouth 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.409
 down and you're done 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.569
 now you just need to give him the web 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:12.349
 and this was all 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:16.569
