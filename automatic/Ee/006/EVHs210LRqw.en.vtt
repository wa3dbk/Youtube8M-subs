amazing<00:01:15.069> protein<00:01:15.700> powder<00:01:16.000> and<00:01:16.390> proteins<00:01:16.810> so

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
amazing protein powder and proteins so

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.480 
amazing protein powder and proteins so
important<00:01:17.440> to<00:01:17.560> get<00:01:17.649> good<00:01:17.890> energy

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
important to get good energy

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.639 
important to get good energy
so<00:01:19.030> there's<00:01:19.330> combined<00:01:19.840> with<00:01:20.050> the<00:01:20.140> tri<00:01:20.319> seeds

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649
