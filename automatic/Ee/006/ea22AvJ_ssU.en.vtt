00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.790
 the first game of ascension relegation 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.010
 to climb into the third Bundesliga 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.540
 is completed in one 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.869
 gripping encounter sat down at the end 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.940
 the lions rudel earned through with 28 22 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.500
 and has such a good starting position 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.660
 for the return match in Cologne chorweiler 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.400
 provides besides the sporty one 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.520
 fairness of the duel should be above all else 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.760
 over 1350 spectators for a worthy 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.760
 frame 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.989
 The lions caught in the proppevoll 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.210
 gothaer street a lightning start 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.070
 after just a minute it is 2 0 for 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.230
 the hosts micro helfrich met in 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.350
 counter-attack after fine play by arthur 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.350
 Giela 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.370
 Little impressed here by showed up 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.440
 However, the sc the answer followed 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.280
 the foot turned four hits in succession 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.270
 the initial phase in favor of the guests 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.460
 also because the impartial 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.070
 early punishment against the pack 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.020
 imposed in the always fair hand 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.790
 example, probably a total of nine times the 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.690
 lions only thrice the sc on the 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.420
 punishable 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:18.160
 In addition, the home team got one of 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.160
 Gast awarded nine punishments 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.590
 at 6 6, both teams had teams 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.660
 the initial nervousness dropped the 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.820
 intensity remained high and it showed 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.869
 that the sg better this task 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.270
 could handle 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.830
 a lot invested but now came 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.690
 clearly harder to score 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.820
 his part with two held 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.770
 seven-meter wore in this phase jens 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.229
 Grote Lions Schlusemann showed 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.820
 on friday evening a strong performance the 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.950
 Hall stood upside down and showed clearly 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.320
 that the helm on support of the 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.030
 ranks could count over nine to seven 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.340
 and twelve to eight fought for the 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.390
 host so the 14 9 halftime 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.950
 After the break, it quickly became clear 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.409
 that the lions are far from full 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.450
 were 20 to 13 after 40 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.880
 the most obvious player in the game 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.290
 was now marcel mÃ¼ller in a phase 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.119
 in which it no longer ran properly 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.600
 Responsibility took over and prudent 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.600
 acted 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.940
 the power wear was still 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.170
 noticeably easier mistakes sneaked 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.120
 play in the lion game 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.220
 but also the guests not much 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.370
 had to put on the sg 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.350
 continue to settle and at 28 20 a 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.640
 minute before the end was a clearer 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.780
 in the hope we have already with 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.880
 a full hall 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.260
 that is, first of all, it would have been so full 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.820
 I dreamed in advance and only 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.830
 second and much more 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.480
 important the spectators were full 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.650
 behind us and have for a real 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.810
 home theater atmosphere taken care of 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.430
 just cool describes player and 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.210
 manager bastian schlierkamp the mood 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.210
 in gothaer street 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.900
 but it came out differentlyich I punished 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.269
 the simplest fault of the host ice cold 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.269
 and shortened to 28 22 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.269
 honestly i am pissed off 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.709
 we have a lot to do in the final minutes 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.209
 easily given the things that you 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.220
 then it hurts when you consider that 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.780
 each gate is one of our waiting the 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.349
 Saturday is the toughest game of the 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.730
 season 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.560
 That must be clear to all and so 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.239
 certainly no room for any kind 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.980
 Satisfaction so obvious 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.609
 angry richard ratka directly 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.530
 after the final whistle 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.909
 He will certainly be his boys in 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.480
 the coming training week on it 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.480
 to adjust 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.880
 si
