painting you put it where it's in the
right<00:05:47.860> position<00:05:48.070> for<00:05:48.640> you<00:05:48.730> to<00:05:48.850> reach<00:05:49.030> like

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
right position for you to reach like

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.310 
right position for you to reach like
this<00:05:49.830> not<00:05:50.830> too<00:05:51.100> high<00:05:51.310> or<00:05:51.790> not<00:05:52.000> too<00:05:52.210> low<00:05:52.450> the

this not too high or not too low the
right<00:05:53.560> where<00:05:53.740> your<00:05:53.890> arm<00:05:54.040> is<00:05:54.220> comfortable<00:05:55.410> then

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
right where your arm is comfortable then

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:02.240 
right where your arm is comfortable then
you<00:05:56.560> can<00:05:56.740> actually<00:05:59.040> paint<00:06:00.040> out<00:06:00.280> like<00:06:00.580> this<00:06:00.880> on

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
you can actually paint out like this on

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.480 
you can actually paint out like this on
this<00:06:03.250> side<00:06:03.550> go<00:06:04.510> back<00:06:04.750> in<00:06:05.080> and<00:06:05.950> you<00:06:06.130> have<00:06:06.280> that

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
this side go back in and you have that

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.950 
this side go back in and you have that
same<00:06:06.880> reach<00:06:08.820> on<00:06:09.820> the<00:06:10.090> other<00:06:10.240> side<00:06:10.660> it's

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
same reach on the other side it's

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.610 
same reach on the other side it's
approximately<00:06:11.710> about<00:06:11.920> like<00:06:12.490> this<00:06:13.410> where<00:06:14.410> your

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
approximately about like this where your

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.710 
approximately about like this where your
reaches

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.540 

and<00:06:18.720> you<00:06:18.810> can<00:06:18.960> actually<00:06:19.169> just<00:06:19.560> your<00:06:19.919> span<00:06:20.280> is

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
and you can actually just your span is

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.250 
and you can actually just your span is
very<00:06:20.790> very<00:06:21.090> far<00:06:22.730> like<00:06:23.730> this<00:06:24.000> and<00:06:24.750> you<00:06:24.930> can<00:06:25.080> hold

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:25.260 
very very far like this and you can hold

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.530 
very very far like this and you can hold
on<00:06:25.440> to<00:06:25.470> the<00:06:25.680> ladder<00:06:25.889> the<00:06:26.370> whole<00:06:26.580> time<00:06:26.880> your

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.540 
on to the ladder the whole time your

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.510 
on to the ladder the whole time your
feet<00:06:27.780> are<00:06:27.930> positioned<00:06:28.110> right<00:06:29.100> there<00:06:29.400> in

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
feet are positioned right there in

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.330 
feet are positioned right there in
between<00:06:29.820> your<00:06:30.030> hill<00:06:30.800> you're<00:06:31.800> locked<00:06:32.070> in

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
between your hill you're locked in

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.490 
between your hill you're locked in
you're<00:06:32.850> safe<00:06:35.750> then<00:06:36.750> you<00:06:36.870> have<00:06:37.050> that<00:06:37.260> much

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500
