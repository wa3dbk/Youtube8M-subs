00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
ActionScript panel and start typing in

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.540 
ActionScript panel and start typing in
some<00:00:48.270> ActionScript<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.649> what<00:00:50.070> we're<00:00:50.219> gonna<00:00:50.280> do

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
some ActionScript so what we're gonna do

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.520 
some ActionScript so what we're gonna do
is<00:00:50.670> we're<00:00:50.850> gonna<00:00:50.940> call<00:00:51.239> our<00:00:51.390> circle<00:00:51.840> instance

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
is we're gonna call our circle instance

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.229 
is we're gonna call our circle instance
and<00:00:53.489> we're<00:00:53.850> gonna<00:00:53.969> set<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.480> enter<00:00:54.870> frame

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
and we're gonna set the on enter frame

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.150 
and we're gonna set the on enter frame
and<00:00:57.500> that's<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.710> function<00:01:00.590> so<00:01:01.590> every<00:01:01.770> time<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
and that's a function so every time the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.859 
and that's a function so every time the
circle<00:01:02.670> enters<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.180> frame<00:01:03.449> we<00:01:04.019> want<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.350> set

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
circle enters the frame we want to set

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.070 
circle enters the frame we want to set
the<00:01:06.869> circles<00:01:07.670> x-coordinate<00:01:08.670> position<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.960> be

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
the circles x-coordinate position to be

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.830 
the circles x-coordinate position to be
equal<00:01:10.409> our<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.549> x<00:01:11.939> position<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.479> our<00:01:12.600> mouse

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
equal our the x position of our mouse

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.530 
equal our the x position of our mouse
now<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.520> key<00:01:14.729> word<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:15.060> use<00:01:15.210> for<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.479> is

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
now the the key word we use for that is

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.310 
now the the key word we use for that is
underscore<00:01:16.530> X<00:01:17.689> Mouse<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.610> that's<00:01:20.610> just<00:01:20.880> a

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
underscore X Mouse and that's just a

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.560 
underscore X Mouse and that's just a
designated<00:01:22.320> keyword<00:01:23.009> for<00:01:23.460> for<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> x

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
designated keyword for for the x

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.530 
designated keyword for for the x
position<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.470> our<00:01:25.560> mouse<00:01:26.090> and<00:01:27.090> we're<00:01:27.420> gonna

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
position of our mouse and we're gonna

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.260 
position of our mouse and we're gonna
want<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.780> do<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.049> same<00:01:28.290> thing<00:01:28.560> for<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:30.000> Y

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
want to do the same thing for the Y

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.410 
want to do the same thing for the Y
position<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:31.020> our<00:01:31.439> movie<00:01:31.740> clip<00:01:31.979> we<00:01:32.970> said<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.240> so

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
position of our movie clip we said it so

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.600 
position of our movie clip we said it so
why<00:01:33.630> not<00:01:35.060> now<00:01:36.060> if<00:01:36.119> we<00:01:36.329> test<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:37.220> you<00:01:38.220> can<00:01:38.400> see

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
why not now if we test this you can see

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.359 
why not now if we test this you can see
that<00:01:38.640> our<00:01:39.090> movie<00:01:39.390> clip<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:40.189> following<00:01:41.189> our

that our movie clip is following our

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.850 
that our movie clip is following our
mouse<00:01:41.610> now<00:01:42.479> you'll<00:01:42.659> notice<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.079> it's<00:01:43.530> not

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
mouse now you'll notice that it's not

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.060 
mouse now you'll notice that it's not
quite<00:01:44.250> at<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.610> center<00:01:45.090> of

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
quite at the center of

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.990 
quite at the center of
our<00:01:46.159> mouse<00:01:46.700> cursor<00:01:47.080> that's<00:01:48.080> because<00:01:48.710> if<00:01:49.670> we<00:01:49.850> go

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
our mouse cursor that's because if we go

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.450 
our mouse cursor that's because if we go
to<00:01:50.060> our<00:01:50.210> movie<00:01:50.659> clip<00:01:50.930> you'll<00:01:51.920> notice<00:01:52.250> that

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
to our movie clip you'll notice that

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.810 
to our movie clip you'll notice that
this<00:01:52.729> little<00:01:53.060> cross<00:01:53.510> crosshairs<00:01:54.440> here<00:01:54.830> that

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
this little cross crosshairs here that

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.380 
this little cross crosshairs here that
is<00:01:56.120> the<00:01:56.420> that<00:01:57.080> is<00:01:57.260> the<00:01:57.410> zero<00:01:57.650> point<00:01:57.890> of<00:01:58.520> of<00:01:59.210> our

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
is the that is the zero point of of our

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.290 
is the that is the zero point of of our
movie<00:01:59.720> clip<00:01:59.930> so<00:02:00.590> if<00:02:00.650> we<00:02:00.740> wanted<00:02:01.040> to<00:02:01.100> have<00:02:01.970> our

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.150 
movie clip so if we wanted to have our
movie<00:02:02.450> clip<00:02:02.780> at<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.170> center<00:02:03.710> of<00:02:03.830> our<00:02:03.920> Mouse

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
movie clip at the center of our Mouse

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.630 
movie clip at the center of our Mouse
I'd<00:02:04.700> have<00:02:04.850> to<00:02:04.940> go<00:02:05.060> into<00:02:05.090> this<00:02:05.540> movie<00:02:05.869> clip<00:02:06.110> and

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
I'd have to go into this movie clip and

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.100 
I'd have to go into this movie clip and
reposition<00:02:07.640> our<00:02:07.759> shape<00:02:08.030> so<00:02:08.420> that<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.929> is

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
reposition our shape so that it is

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.949 
reposition our shape so that it is
centered<00:02:09.560> on<00:02:09.709> that<00:02:09.950> cross<00:02:10.369> right<00:02:10.700> there<00:02:10.959> so

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
centered on that cross right there so

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
closed brackets here we go mouse dot

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.790 
closed brackets here we go mouse dot
hide<00:02:36.970> you'll<00:02:37.970> see<00:02:38.239> that<00:02:38.450> our<00:02:38.630> cursor<00:02:39.260> is<00:02:39.590> no

hide you'll see that our cursor is no
longer<00:02:40.100> visible<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:41.470> it's<00:02:42.470> almost<00:02:42.739> as<00:02:42.950> if

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
longer visible and it's almost as if

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.670

that object the movie clip table object

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.040 
that object the movie clip table object
is<00:02:45.950> our<00:02:46.370> cursor<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:47.150> that's<00:02:47.300> a<00:02:47.420> that's<00:02:47.690> a<00:02:47.840> cool
