00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.890
 hello my love is out here 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.340
 again the other shame on kv tv 

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:12.240
 this time scripture book presentation 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:15.299
 it's about a book that means clothes 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.980
 and weapons of the early and stronghold of 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:22.050
 1150 to 1320 was written by 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.830
 ulrich lehner and has appeared 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.840
 Whole in sparkle Yes, the time is publishing 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.929
 k sparkle probably know one or the other 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.160
 others but really good to get started 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.700
 I just find this book just short 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.030
 called loan has why find us 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.680
 I like it because I like one 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.390
 get a good overview 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.059
 for a certain period of time the close 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.760
 hatch is a few meaningful 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.000
 to have an approach like my clothes 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.039
 Together she shoemakers around in 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.320
 this time fits because the middle ages 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.350
 has 1000 years and i can somehow 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.180
 the eighth with the late 15th century 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.680
 I mix my mine very hard 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.630
 Unfortunately, there are more than enough people 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.000
 but it does not make sense 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.010
 I have a rough idea with this book 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.450
 Overview It is not the highest now 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.689
 scientifically that's what you have to say 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.909
 yes I recommend it for the cuts 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.310
 which does not mean that that 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.610
 Sewing patterns in it are how you look at them 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.780
 knows the burda folder or something 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.750
 but actually rather schematic 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.600
 presentation that make you clear how 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.130
 one has tailored that one has 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.509
 namely , has saved a lot of fabric 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.560
 so if i tried one out 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.780
 Material web really the optimum 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.560
 get out as little waste as possible 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.360
 to have 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.500
 nowadays where stuff is not quite like that anymore 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.840
 you can afford a lot 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.670
 that you cut a bit dirt 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.460
 At that time you really tried each one 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.770
 to use fitzelchen what I in here 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.360
 I think it's extremely good how you describe it 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.909
 everything made basic as to 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.369
 For example, how do I make a last hole 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.500
 How do I make a buttonhole as are 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.619
 the various historical sewed the 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.680
 one has overcome that of the one 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.840
 Sting up to the broken if that for 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.670
 you spanish villages are writing 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.229
 drug if you want me to do that 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.030
 explain to my own video 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.670
 go whole nights write in the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.290
 comments otherwise that's in the book 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.049
 explained anyway and really a lot 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.299
 with pictures so you get that much 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.739
 easy I got it yes and me 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.200
 do not necessarily come from the 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.950
 tailor family so my mother has 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.420
 unfortunately completely hated so quote my 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.709
 mother if you need that for one 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.170
 knight is then next itself good 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.959
 this book is as i said in the fight around 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.340
 the publisher appeared and should 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.220
 to be available 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.299
 if not just look on ebay 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.609
 or various stock exchanges where you can do that 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.920
 maybe still needed the 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.540
 Books are a complete series so 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.239
 I believe there are four or at the moment 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.190
 five pieces of it each time for one 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.599
 other time period I would be sure 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.090
 to drive that three imagine everything 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.099
 because I have everything at home with me 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.359
 What's later is a time for me 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.739
 not so interested now 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.000
 I do not have you at home either 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.950
 Of course I also have others 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.450
 We won you books 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.220
 to introduce incoming time 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.720
 if your interest it has 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.019
 or somehow interest 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.730
 a very specific time period 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.269
 dusty this down in the comments me 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.859
 hope this book tip has helped you 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.090
 Isbn number and the whole tail there 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.069
 it then also below in the video 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.519
 description and maybe one 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:35.370
 link to where to get the book now 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.230

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.829
 you can always do it at k sparkle 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.290
 Requests 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.000
 Of course this book is not just for 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.769
 written people are now the

 want to do business because we have so 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.620
 not just women and men with the 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.840
 clot in it but of course at 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.470
 his part mainly for men 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.049
 thought to wait at that time because it is 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.810
 namely that there are the weapons and 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.410
 of course, the firearms as well 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.489
 padded weapon skirt chain mail helmet 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.799
 armor parts that were just as common 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.940
 everyone will be here in this book 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.370
 described 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.930
 This part is for many a 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.660
 maybe not interesting because of me 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.900
 but fights as I said the successes part 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.519
 with all the articles too 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.919
 fabric selection fabric types that existed and 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.290
 so on and so on so it is 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.670
 Pure information me 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.650
 is on the gold scale as I said 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.750
 is not a scientific work though 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.670
 to go in for a perfect book 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.500

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.930

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.440
 Otherwise, of course, I'm glad that 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.750

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.450
 to give the middle ages as not only 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.820
 always instruments and tailoring and 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.530
