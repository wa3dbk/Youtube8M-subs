00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
get this bit this jump carefully because

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.410 
get this bit this jump carefully because
we<00:02:45.280> want<00:02:45.520> to<00:02:45.580> make<00:02:45.670> sure<00:02:45.820> we're<00:02:46.180> back<00:02:46.390> in

control before we take this section here
the<00:02:49.240> real<00:02:49.420> trick<00:02:49.690> is<00:02:49.870> if<00:02:49.990> you<00:02:50.110> can<00:02:50.350> to<00:02:50.560> break

the real trick is if you can to break
now<00:02:51.070> and<00:02:51.400> then<00:02:51.930> slide<00:02:52.930> up<00:02:53.170> over<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.740> top<00:02:53.920> and

now and then slide up over the top and

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.590 
now and then slide up over the top and
back<00:02:54.400> around<00:02:54.700> again<00:02:54.820> there<00:02:55.210> that<00:02:55.330> was<00:02:55.420> done

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
back around again there that was done

perfectly they're done lost a little bit

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.430 
perfectly they're done lost a little bit
of<00:02:57.430> time<00:02:57.700> looks<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.270> Lunger<00:02:58.690> made<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:58.870> mess<00:02:59.200> of<00:02:59.230> it

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
of time looks a Lunger made a mess of it

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.720 
of time looks a Lunger made a mess of it
at<00:02:59.650> behind<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:00.100> is<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.280> good<00:03:00.430> sign<00:03:00.700> for

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
at behind it is a good sign for

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.270 
at behind it is a good sign for
ourselves<00:03:01.440> good<00:03:02.440> jump<00:03:02.770> there<00:03:04.710> and<00:03:05.710> someone's

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
ourselves good jump there and someone's

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.590 
ourselves good jump there and someone's
trying<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.550> take<00:03:06.700> your<00:03:06.790> shortcut<00:03:07.270> it's<00:03:07.420> not

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
trying to take your shortcut it's not

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.280 
trying to take your shortcut it's not
going<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:07.840> work<00:03:09.630> stay<00:03:10.630> flight<00:03:10.900> across<00:03:11.170> the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
going to work stay flight across the

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.460 
going to work stay flight across the
road<00:03:12.270> will<00:03:13.270> just<00:03:13.480> rip<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.840> track<00:03:14.080> order<00:03:14.350> to

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
road will just rip the track order to

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.420 
road will just rip the track order to
say<00:03:14.650> it's<00:03:15.160> not<00:03:15.220> much<00:03:15.459> of<00:03:15.490> a<00:03:15.670> row<00:03:15.850> down<00:03:16.090> here<00:03:16.390> but

say it's not much of a row down here but

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.339 
say it's not much of a row down here but
so<00:03:19.150> again<00:03:19.420> we<00:03:19.569> start<00:03:19.750> making<00:03:19.930> our<00:03:20.170> way<00:03:20.319> back
