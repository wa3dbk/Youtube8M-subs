00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.929
 it seems to me that we are facing a result for me and not expected one 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.840
 extraordinary we felt affection and a great climate towards us 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.210
 we told you from the assembly 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:28.529
 do not pass translates s not 46% of not 46% proud proud on which the fiat 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.280
 should think about why they are workers and workers who ask for 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.999
 work with their rights 

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:36.900
 to do a good job 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.890
 and to do it with dignity 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.730
 moreover it is a new yes that passes with the decisive vote and employees of the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.750
 body 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.290
 which are mainly corporate hierarchy that is 300 carpi 40 names of the 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.000
 staff structures 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.260
 and therefore we say it is an umberto and on which I was marchionne you will reflect a lot 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.340
 in the use of the negative vote of the assembly line workers 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.220
 those on which the bulk of the fatigue burden is charged 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.110
 Marchionne 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.170
 I believe that a proof of freedom has been given today 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.220
 gods and I thank workers Mirafiori 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.220
 the fi-cgil alone with their airaudo technical theme 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.560
 no need the technical signature they gave to those who vote the workers 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.960
 technically much more important in my mind what to do the trial will continue 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.030
 to represent them to many writings he has made others in these days until 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.389
 i was writing i was union we were i living inside with the factory 

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:43.979
 if you serve we will also permanently stand in front of this factory 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.450
 we will verify in the registered offices re 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.960
 if all the rules have been respected all the contracts, however, I am convinced 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.530
 that this is a country 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.950
 it must also make the gates of the factory cross democracy and this must 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.200
 to take into account also a multinational a little less Italian as today the fiat 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.010
 it would be done by the regulations alone helps the Rome we are alone arrived 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.769
 and for the other 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.769
 hello times a 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:14.849
 to
