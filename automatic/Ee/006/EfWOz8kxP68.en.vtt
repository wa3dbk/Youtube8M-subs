00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
with the p99 akimbo and then we're

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.270 
with the p99 akimbo and then we're
moving<00:02:35.549> on<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:35.940> mp4<00:02:36.629> 12<00:02:36.930> Rex<00:02:37.260> which<00:02:37.560> takes

moving on to the mp4 12 Rex which takes
two<00:02:38.549> shots<00:02:38.849> obviously<00:02:39.060> these<00:02:39.659> are<00:02:39.720> probably

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
two shots obviously these are probably

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.800 
two shots obviously these are probably
your<00:02:40.260> best<00:02:40.500> option<00:02:41.069> or<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.489> magnums<00:02:42.180> or<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.569> D

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
your best option or the magnums or the D

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.330 
your best option or the magnums or the D

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
goals because of their high amount of

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.970 
goals because of their high amount of
damage<00:02:44.730> in<00:02:44.909> comparison<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:46.079> the<00:02:46.109> other<00:02:46.590> guns<00:02:46.859> I

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980
