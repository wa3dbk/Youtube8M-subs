00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:02.350
 Hello 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.230
 This video is attached to the main 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.010
 Oscar-based systems capabilities 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.369
 go to the site Chepetzka dot com 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:12.799
 on the right there is from for customers 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.759
 we carry out go getting them a list 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:17.789
 your objects 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.980
 choose us 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.039
 reporting object 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.279
 and watching the mashuk movement 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.279
 given 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.290
 right parties represented 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.830
 basic system capabilities 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.900
 first payment show last 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.900
 days with on location 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.180
 the system identifies and shows us on 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.310
 last known map 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.310
 object location 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.830
 next payment enable mode 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.830
 auto tracking 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.370
 system updating data from all with 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.350
 at one minute intervals as well as possible 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.590
 this mode 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.590
 change select five minutes ten minutes 15 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.580
 for comfort 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.950
 viewing to the party have the opportunity 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.950
 changes 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.910
 on the right there is the possibility of our 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.910
 scaling maps 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.640
 here we see the system has updated data 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.640
 coming from the device 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.240
 using this data we can see 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.079
 big traffic of our transportation 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:16.609
 if the system remains in it 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.359
 mode us at intervals 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.239
 every minute will update and 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.009
 show last locations 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:25.849
 car of this system is about 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.849
 online surveillance 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:34.139
 the next decline is the displacement channel 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:37.139
 of objects 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:47.679
 we have the opportunity to choose 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:50.679
 before the burden that interests us 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.239
 click load points to display 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.589
 the golden army that is transferred to sports 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:03:01.009
 acting that kids 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:03.259
 apparently baku show the whole route on the map 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:05.949
 right away 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:08.879
 system traced 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.529
 the entire history of moving objects 

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:12.949
 for this period of time 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:15.949
 for convenience, a large-scale project 

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:22.349
 them 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.249
 march upa which our object has gone 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:27.459
 if the interests of the genes although the object 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.109
 certain 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.109
 In front of them 

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:36.059
 and when 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:37.859
 this time is of our interest 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:38.979
 time 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:42.079
 and some 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.689
 the system shows where was underway 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:45.819
 an object 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:47.439
 while 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:50.439
 choose a friend 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.849
 genocide objects at this time 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.159
 object reports 

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:09.009
 this item goals 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:10.899
 This feature allows you to do 

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:12.139
 report 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.859
 by distance 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:17.669
 in speed mode 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.389
 NdPi time and your idle time 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.389
 vehicle 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.319
 you take nabi equal to the time period for 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:36.419
 which danes need to do 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.419
 click generate reports 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:44.509
 the system gives the price information on this 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:46.999
 object moving time 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:49.580
 idle time loupe them the number of stops 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.080
 the shortest time of parking is May 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.710
 long distance 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.710
 but basic information on 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.729
 this object 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.550
 daily report on the object this report 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.550
 lets make 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:12.159
 report for each 

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:16.999
 for every day 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.259
 and it is not difficult report 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:21.680
 and see 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.960
 every day the system made a report 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.569
 idle average time while driving 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:28.699
 maximum speed 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.699
 speed covered distance 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:33.689
 apparently what 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:36.189
 what distance was the object 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:39.529
 for every day 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:41.219
 below the total traversed 

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:44.219
 distance 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:53.560
 here are the main features given 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.560
 system 

00:05:57.809 --> 00:05:58.599
 Thanks for attention
