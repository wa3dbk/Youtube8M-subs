now that's buddleia david ige which has
been<00:00:10.740> under<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:10.980> lot<00:00:11.190> of<00:00:11.219> scrutiny<00:00:11.400> in<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:11.940> last

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
been under a lot of scrutiny in the last

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.169 
been under a lot of scrutiny in the last
few<00:00:12.480> years<00:00:12.740> the<00:00:13.740> reason<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.400> because<00:00:14.700> the

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
few years the reason is because the

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.870 
few years the reason is because the
species<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.260> plant<00:00:16.590> along<00:00:17.250> with<00:00:17.520> some<00:00:17.760> of

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
species of the plant along with some of

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.510 
species of the plant along with some of
the<00:00:18.000> varieties<00:00:18.539> seen<00:00:19.320> very<00:00:19.710> heavily<00:00:20.160> and

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
the varieties seen very heavily and

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.519 
the varieties seen very heavily and
they've<00:00:20.850> been<00:00:21.060> getting<00:00:21.180> into<00:00:21.510> waterways<00:00:21.990> and

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
they've been getting into waterways and

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.980 
they've been getting into waterways and
into<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:23.070> lot<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.400> natural<00:00:24.029> areas<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.689> just

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
into a lot of natural areas and just

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.950 
into a lot of natural areas and just
creating<00:00:25.500> huge<00:00:26.010> swaths<00:00:26.599> so<00:00:27.599> they've<00:00:27.840> been

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
creating huge swaths so they've been

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.810 
creating huge swaths so they've been
putting<00:00:28.199> them<00:00:28.349> on<00:00:28.500> noxious<00:00:29.010> plant<00:00:29.460> lists

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
putting them on noxious plant lists

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.470 
putting them on noxious plant lists
invasive<00:00:30.570> plant<00:00:30.900> lists<00:00:31.439> every<00:00:32.309> area<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:33.180> gonna

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
invasive plant lists every area is gonna

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.870 
invasive plant lists every area is gonna
be<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> little<00:00:33.930> different<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.530> my<00:00:34.739> region<00:00:35.040> the

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
be a little different in my region the

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.630 
be a little different in my region the
species<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.600> on<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.930> noxious<00:00:37.410> plant<00:00:37.770> list<00:00:38.070> but

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
species is on the noxious plant list but

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.369 
species is on the noxious plant list but
a<00:00:38.670> lot<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.059> varieties<00:00:39.570> are<00:00:39.780> still<00:00:40.110> being

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
a lot of the varieties are still being

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.150 
a lot of the varieties are still being
studied<00:00:40.890> now<00:00:41.309> what<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.030> have<00:00:42.420> here<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.200> black

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
studied now what I have here is black

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.360 
studied now what I have here is black
night<00:00:44.579> which<00:00:45.329> has<00:00:45.600> really<00:00:46.079> super<00:00:46.649> dark<00:00:46.890> purple

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
night which has really super dark purple

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.940 
night which has really super dark purple
flowers<00:00:47.879> now<00:00:48.539> it's<00:00:48.750> been<00:00:48.930> sitting<00:00:49.289> here<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.800> my

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
flowers now it's been sitting here in my

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.889 
flowers now it's been sitting here in my
garden<00:00:50.190> for<00:00:50.610> at<00:00:50.670> least<00:00:50.760> 10<00:00:51.120> years<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.780> I've

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
garden for at least 10 years and I've

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.709 
garden for at least 10 years and I've
never<00:00:52.170> had<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.530> seedling<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.789> chances<00:00:54.300> are<00:00:54.480> this

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
never had a seedling so chances are this

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.389 
never had a seedling so chances are this
is<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.930> variety<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.469> will<00:00:55.739> probably<00:00:56.250> be

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
is a variety that will probably be

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.819 
is a variety that will probably be
okayed<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.090> long<00:00:57.360> run<00:00:57.629> what<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.559> want<00:00:58.739> to

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
okayed in the long run what you want to

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.069 
okayed in the long run what you want to
do<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.160> look<00:00:59.430> at<00:00:59.579> your<00:00:59.760> butterfly<00:01:00.239> bush<00:01:00.539> if<00:01:00.809> it

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
do is look at your butterfly bush if it

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.930 
do is look at your butterfly bush if it
has<00:01:01.289> seedlings<00:01:01.859> coming<00:01:02.100> up<00:01:02.430> around<00:01:02.699> your

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
has seedlings coming up around your

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.820 
has seedlings coming up around your
garden<00:01:03.390> then<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.140> know<00:01:04.320> you've<00:01:04.530> got<00:01:04.559> an

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
garden then you know you've got an

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.450 
garden then you know you've got an
invasive<00:01:05.280> plant<00:01:06.260> otherwise<00:01:07.260> chances<00:01:08.040> are<00:01:08.250> any

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
invasive plant otherwise chances are any

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.280 
invasive plant otherwise chances are any
that<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.850> would<00:01:09.000> find<00:01:09.210> at<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.510> nurseries<00:01:10.020> now

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
that you would find at the nurseries now

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.920 
that you would find at the nurseries now
have<00:01:10.619> already<00:01:10.920> been<00:01:11.310> okayed<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.600> can<00:01:12.810> go

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
have already been okayed and you can go

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.359 
have already been okayed and you can go
ahead<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.170> plant<00:01:13.590> them<00:01:13.799> because<00:01:14.189> they've

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
ahead and plant them because they've

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.730 
ahead and plant them because they've
pulled<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.850> ones<00:01:15.060> away<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.990> are<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> problem

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
pulled the ones away that are a problem

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.580 
pulled the ones away that are a problem
in<00:01:16.860> at<00:01:17.100> least<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.460> North<00:01:17.670> America<00:01:18.270> now<00:01:18.560> what<00:01:19.560> I

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
in at least in North America now what I

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.770 
in at least in North America now what I
did<00:01:19.950> because<00:01:20.250> mine<00:01:20.670> got<00:01:20.700> really<00:01:21.360> really<00:01:21.570> big

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
did because mine got really really big

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.920 
did because mine got really really big
is<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.530> tried<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.890> keep<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.460> under<00:01:23.610> control<00:01:23.930> what

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
is I tried to keep it under control what

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.950 
is I tried to keep it under control what
happened<00:01:25.380> was<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:26.189> ended<00:01:26.939> up<00:01:27.060> dying<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.780> lot

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
happened was it ended up dying in a lot

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.260 
happened was it ended up dying in a lot
of<00:01:27.990> areas<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.979> still<00:01:29.369> putting<00:01:29.759> off<00:01:29.939> some

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
of areas and still putting off some

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.530 
of areas and still putting off some
really<00:01:30.720> really<00:01:31.290> tall<00:01:31.740> shoots<00:01:32.159> now<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.360> can

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
really really tall shoots now you can

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.450 
really really tall shoots now you can
see<00:01:33.780> here<00:01:34.079> it's<00:01:34.229> getting<00:01:34.590> ready<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.950> produce

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
see here it's getting ready to produce

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.319 
see here it's getting ready to produce
flowers<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:37.159> regardless<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.520> what<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.790> do<00:01:38.939> this

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
flowers and regardless of what I do this

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.719 
flowers and regardless of what I do this
is<00:01:39.390> gonna<00:01:39.720> be<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> really<00:01:40.380> tall<00:01:40.710> plant<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.610> if

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
is gonna be a really tall plant so if

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.219 
is gonna be a really tall plant so if
you're<00:01:41.850> gonna<00:01:42.060> plant<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.509> butterfly<00:01:42.689> bush

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
you're gonna plant a butterfly bush

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.780 
you're gonna plant a butterfly bush
unless<00:01:43.799> it's<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.130> dwarf

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
unless it's a dwarf

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.380 
unless it's a dwarf
expect<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.869> be<00:01:46.020> 10<00:01:46.320> or<00:01:46.350> 12<00:01:46.740> feet<00:01:46.979> tall<00:01:47.390> put

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
expect it to be 10 or 12 feet tall put

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.120 
expect it to be 10 or 12 feet tall put
it<00:01:48.509> out<00:01:48.720> where<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.079> has<00:01:49.229> plenty<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.890> room<00:01:50.100> to

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
it out where it has plenty of room to

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.760 
it out where it has plenty of room to
grow<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.909> yeah<00:01:51.810> even<00:01:52.140> though<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.320> have<00:01:52.590> to
