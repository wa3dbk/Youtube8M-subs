00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
not want to create this batch file

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.040 
not want to create this batch file
manually<00:01:01.000> you<00:01:01.210> can<00:01:01.390> go<00:01:01.570> ahead<00:01:01.660> and<00:01:01.930> download

manually you can go ahead and download

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.020 
manually you can go ahead and download
it<00:01:02.320> from<00:01:02.500> there

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030
