00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:38.719 
me a while to complete it but then when

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:40.029 
me a while to complete it but then when
I<00:01:38.750> realized<00:01:38.960> that<00:01:39.259> you<00:01:39.320> could<00:01:39.469> like<00:01:39.619> ride

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
I realized that you could like ride

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:41.800 
I realized that you could like ride
these<00:01:40.280> crystal<00:01:40.729> towers<00:01:41.119> I<00:01:41.270> was<00:01:41.390> like<00:01:41.539> whoa<00:01:41.780> I

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
these crystal towers I was like whoa I

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.010 
these crystal towers I was like whoa I
gotta<00:01:42.200> try<00:01:42.500> this<00:01:42.880> so<00:01:43.880> I<00:01:44.979> came<00:01:45.979> up<00:01:46.039> here<00:01:46.490> and

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
gotta try this so I came up here and

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.620 
gotta try this so I came up here and
then<00:01:48.020> it<00:01:48.500> was<00:01:48.649> spawned<00:01:49.369> so<00:01:49.670> I'd<00:01:49.729> put<00:01:50.420> it<00:01:50.539> on

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
then it was spawned so I'd put it on

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.649 
then it was spawned so I'd put it on
YouTube<00:01:53.649> I've<00:01:54.649> never<00:01:54.979> actually<00:01:55.280> landed<00:01:56.270> on<00:01:56.479> to

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
YouTube I've never actually landed on to

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.660 
YouTube I've never actually landed on to
here<00:01:56.840> though<00:01:56.990> it's<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.770> hardest<00:01:58.130> thing<00:01:58.369> to<00:01:58.399> do

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
here though it's the hardest thing to do

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.230 
here though it's the hardest thing to do
and<00:01:59.439> if<00:02:00.439> it<00:02:00.619> was<00:02:00.710> easier<00:02:01.070> I<00:02:01.429> would<00:02:01.490> so<00:02:01.939> do<00:02:02.210> it

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
and if it was easier I would so do it

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.050 
and if it was easier I would so do it
but<00:02:02.960> you<00:02:03.649> get<00:02:03.770> so<00:02:04.130> much<00:02:04.310> speed<00:02:04.609> by<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:04.789> time

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
but you get so much speed by the time

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.969 
but you get so much speed by the time
you're<00:02:05.210> getting<00:02:05.329> down<00:02:05.630> there<00:02:05.899> that<00:02:06.170> you<00:02:06.560> can't

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
you're getting down there that you can't

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.600 
you're getting down there that you can't
even<00:02:08.110> like<00:02:09.110> think<00:02:09.830> of<00:02:09.979> trying<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.310> land<00:02:10.610> it's

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
even like think of trying to land it's

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.710 
even like think of trying to land it's
are<00:02:13.610> they<00:02:13.790> I'm<00:02:13.880> gonna<00:02:14.030> shot<00:02:14.210> I'm<00:02:14.390> gonna<00:02:14.540> try<00:02:14.660> to

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
are they I'm gonna shot I'm gonna try to

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.550 
are they I'm gonna shot I'm gonna try to
do<00:02:14.870> it<00:02:14.990> this<00:02:15.080> time

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
do it this time

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.410 
do it this time
how<00:02:16.160> do<00:02:16.310> like<00:02:16.520> a<00:02:16.550> little<00:02:16.790> least<00:02:17.030> amount<00:02:17.300> of

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
how do like a little least amount of

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:24.760 
how do like a little least amount of
speed<00:02:17.720> possible<00:02:20.890> so<00:02:21.890> even<00:02:22.340> that<00:02:22.490> like
