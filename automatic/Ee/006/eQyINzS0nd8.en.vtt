00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 Hello everyone today, I decided all the same 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.069
 make detailed videos about how 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.740
 make leaven and do i mean you 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.139
 leaven start with officials today 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.599
 the first day is everything so the process they us 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.180
 need 2 tablespoons of rye flour 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.609
 and some water 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:34.579
 that is, I just put two canteens 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:39.840
 spoons even add about 70 grams 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:42.690
 water so here such consistency should 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.140
 get sourdough to me there in the back 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.750
 the background is probably difficult TV 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.629
 voltages here such as consistency 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.410
 in which sour cream is not very liquid but they 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.539
 very thick even be here still plaguing 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.420
 but it is very important to you 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.370
 This leaven must be left for a day. 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.290
 who is evening now 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.770
 then I will be her tomorrow night 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.150
 feed leave in a warm place 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.100
 me in the kitchen is warm therefore on me 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.040
 just standing in the kitchen and so can 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.140
 put in the microwave and put 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.040
 a glass of hot this water up there either 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.979
 the same thing that's in the oven so all I 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:28.049
 and now I will cover loosely with something 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:32.189
 for example, you can cover tightly to 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.860
 It gives what is this bird reserve flour 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.320
 we need such a rye peeled then 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.390
 there is 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.119
 whole grain ie grain sheath 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.299
 because it is there are those 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.549
 the bacteria are the yeasts that we need all 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.090
 Now we are waiting for tomorrow to see what 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.640
 we got 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.340
 so on the second day you should have leaven 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.560
 look like this way she is 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.319
 how such a mess 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.039
 maybe you will have bubbles from me 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:07.490
 little bubbles appeared and it smells 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:09.890
 so defeated all that we are today 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.620
 do it will need to throw half 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.530
 and add that two more tablespoons 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.370
 flour and water again to achieve here 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.080
 such a consistency third day sourdough 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.610
 look this is how I have it 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.230
 acquired a lot of bubbles 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.560
 you may not have to 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.959
 bubbles it's not scary she smells 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.549
 this ferment is unpleasant now as if 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.060
 not starter this is just the initial 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.489
 stage 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.549
 and here today is the third 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.620
 day i can either half throw out either 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:44.209
 leave the whole amount and 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.190
 and u add here white flour today we 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.280
 add white flour to those 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:53.170
 yeast that are here they are like 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.880
 would now start to eat white flour and 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.980
 deal flour able to recycle only 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.680
 the yeast we need is all me 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.560
 add add 4 tablespoons because 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.389
 that I won't throw half the case in 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.170
 that if you throw out half of you 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:10.819
 just less flour will need white but 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.060
 you can throw it out you can not throw it out 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.400
 In principle, I think not scary, I decided 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.069
 leave as is just add here 4 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.090
 tablespoons of white thread and water david 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:26.019
 Here is such a consistency so 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:31.370
 It should be such a plan dough 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:34.069
 yeast consistency such is all 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:41.480
 leave the same I leave here 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:43.099
 I do not close tightly with the lid so that 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.269
 he doesn't even have air here 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:49.790
 I leave everything for a day and tomorrow again 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:53.190
 I will remove half and add more 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.220
 white wheat flour 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.870
 this is our fourth day and 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.540
 so I pulled in half left 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.300
 literally two two three tablespoons 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.690
 leaven and now i will add here 2 with 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.660
 knoll 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.610
 tablespoons of white flour and water and up 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.410
 Here is the consistency of sour cream 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.960
 Well, so here we are now just 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.180
 we cover and clean athena day by the way 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.430
 saying dishes choose such that she 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.440
 was large enough in relation 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.710
 leaven because paint can grow 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.190
 wasps and run away all leave her for a day 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.080
 under the lid and so on the fifth day by them 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.310
 leaven looks like this she is very 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.620
 strongly ferment my everything on 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:39.180
 strong enough at night anyway 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.010
 she is not ready until the end when you look 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.590
 by its leaven if you uslug you whom 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.470
 such foam and bubbly smell good 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:49.320
 it should sour enough smell here 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.890
 then it means you can in this 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.690
 day half throw feed up and 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.310
 the next 3-4 days twice a day 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.270
 feed a good evening 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:03.270
 example also half throw out and 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:05.130
 feed further here if you have it 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.680
 not very much perry wandered then you can 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.500
 throw in half add more flour 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.690
 as usual and the next day look 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.240
 there already later 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:18.360
 the next 3-4 days to feed two 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.220
 I have it good times a day 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.580
 condition so now I will pull out 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.380
 half can even pull out more 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.880
 to feed a small amount 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.780
 twice a day otherwise very much 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.910
 will accumulate 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:34.950
 that's all and put it another day before 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.300
 tomorrow and tomorrow I will 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.000
 feed 2 times 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.220
 now its basically already at this stage 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.480
 you can not throw it can start already 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:47.100
 how to save and film the next three 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.680
 four days you can not throw a 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:54.009
 just save in a jar but all now 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:56.729
 I throw it in half so to speak 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:58.749
 add two tablespoons of white flour and 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:59.889
 some water that's such a consistency 

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:02.680
 turned out 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:04.809
 and I will clean most of the day for me 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.180
 there is literally one tablespoon 

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:09.639
 since I only have 1 tablespoon 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.129
 leaven so I will feed 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:13.839
 one tablespoon sbu loud then 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:18.099
 have one tablespoon with tubercle 

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:19.689
 white ki and some water all if you 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:21.909
 want by a large amount 

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:25.689
 more temper skete then 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:28.180
 leave no more spare wheel 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:31.689
 and so much and feed up equal 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:35.169
 the amount of flour one to one that is 

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:37.719
 leaven water was my condition 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:39.669
 consistency sour cream all and tomorrow I already 

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:41.349
 were under feed two times so she 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:45.159
 I got stronger and so for 

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:47.499
 three to four days after that when you 

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:48.789
 will fall carmen 22 times a day in 

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:51.099
 for three to four days 

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:54.449
 then ferment can be fed one 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:58.360
 once a day in the same way one to one 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:07:00.129
 and I try to keep a little 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.550
 the amount is somewhere one tablespoon 

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:05.800

 I don't bake bread beforehand 

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:14.800
 I throw out half and add more 

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:17.349
 flour and as if breed ferment to 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.740
