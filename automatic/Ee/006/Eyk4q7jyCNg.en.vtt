00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:12.479
 Norman Trudel 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.640
 certainly surprised 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.369
 on individual mistakes 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.820
 strong of this logic 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.489
 philips from the site to see himself jogging 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:25.689
 the genome section 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.689
 so I'm optimistic 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:33.329
 this earthquake activism was for the context 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.050
 in the spirit we saw 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.050
 pickets 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.110
 for a few weeks it means something 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.500
 they are not rewarded for their group 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.140
 let's talk clear now we have five games left in Lille 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.690
 there are fifteen points left 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.050
 all the calculations done no which is sure it is that 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.690
 the right to error and d 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.110
 existing now it's true his whole 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.270
 100% success 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.150
 for sure it's pretty complicated with three away games and 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.040
 roof 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.040
 I have I am simply said m 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.430
 I count 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.430
 it is a very big disappointment of a partial poll 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.770
 at the end of the match 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.770
 I think it's part of the game 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.690
 the mentality that the club 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.680
 all we can do 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.050
 three people 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.890
 yes what remains the place to five games 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.480
 so what 15 points 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.480
 as long as you listen to his team as much as history 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.710
 open explain 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.360
 however complicated 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.930
 with two home games three games away 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.270
 football league 1 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.810
 there are so many things woven 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.240
 a pensum 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.280
 yet during the days 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.280
 after the campaign game continues 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.079
 to put body in body 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:13.379
 we will do everything to continue at the same time the responsibility 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.879
 in the slaughter
