which are back here now if you have a
baby<00:00:59.980> on<00:01:00.340> here<00:01:00.850> I<00:01:01.030> kind<00:01:01.600> of<00:01:01.719> like<00:01:01.899> something<00:01:02.230> I

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
baby on here I kind of like something I

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.950 
baby on here I kind of like something I
can<00:01:02.620> hit<00:01:02.800> here<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:04.149> you<00:01:04.239> have<00:01:04.479> to<00:01:04.570> push<00:01:04.750> it<00:01:04.780> back

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
can hit here so you have to push it back

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.569 
can hit here so you have to push it back
just<00:01:05.140> a<00:01:05.289> little<00:01:05.320> bit<00:01:05.530> farther<00:01:05.860> if<00:01:06.159> you<00:01:06.280> do<00:01:06.430> it

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:06.579 
just a little bit farther if you do it

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:08.399 
just a little bit farther if you do it
while<00:01:07.240> you're<00:01:07.360> changing<00:01:07.719> the<00:01:07.810> baby<00:01:07.990> which<00:01:08.260> I

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
while you're changing the baby which I

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.180 
while you're changing the baby which I
found<00:01:08.710> to<00:01:09.130> be<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:10.000> easiest<00:01:10.510> this<00:01:11.409> lining<00:01:12.070> is

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
found to be the easiest this lining is

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.980 
found to be the easiest this lining is
not<00:01:12.400> really<00:01:12.670> a<00:01:12.700> white<00:01:13.030> clean<00:01:13.360> because<00:01:13.810> it's

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
not really a white clean because it's

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.390 
not really a white clean because it's
the<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:15.310> polyester<00:01:15.790> too<00:01:16.150> so<00:01:16.900> the<00:01:17.260> pul<00:01:17.740> laminate

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
the is polyester too so the pul laminate

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.000 
the is polyester too so the pul laminate
is<00:01:18.520> in<00:01:18.700> between<00:01:19.030> these<00:01:19.150> two<00:01:19.420> layers<00:01:19.570> so<00:01:20.049> you

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
is in between these two layers so you

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.830 
is in between these two layers so you
just<00:01:21.280> you<00:01:21.820> know<00:01:21.939> don't<00:01:22.119> want<00:01:22.210> to<00:01:22.330> use<00:01:22.479> it<00:01:22.659> if

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
just you know don't want to use it if

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.480 
just you know don't want to use it if
that<00:01:23.200> gets<00:01:23.409> wet<00:01:23.590> or<00:01:23.619> dirty<00:01:23.860> because<00:01:24.189> you<00:01:24.280> can't

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
that gets wet or dirty because you can't

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.980 
that gets wet or dirty because you can't
really<00:01:24.670> wipe<00:01:24.909> it<00:01:25.060> clean<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:27.220> this<00:01:27.369> is<00:01:27.610> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
really wipe it clean and this is the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.219 
really wipe it clean and this is the
medium<00:01:28.990> size<00:01:29.020> so<00:01:29.530> they<00:01:29.650> have<00:01:29.799> multiple<00:01:30.040> sizes

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
medium size so they have multiple sizes

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.499 
medium size so they have multiple sizes
you<00:01:32.229> know<00:01:32.320> large<00:01:32.619> and<00:01:33.430> small<00:01:33.939> so<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:34.299> large

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
you know large and small so the large

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:35.789 
you know large and small so the large
actually<00:01:34.780> even<00:01:35.080> be<00:01:35.200> larger<00:01:35.409> than<00:01:35.619> this<00:01:35.740> and

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
actually even be larger than this and

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.179 
actually even be larger than this and
