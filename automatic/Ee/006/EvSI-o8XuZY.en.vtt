00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello friends with you alexey now i'm 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.490
 I will teach you a little cheat week 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.340
 is in card tricks in card 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.830
 Games x can be used not so 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.900
 small cheats but these cheats 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.520
 the chips are not us not so powerful to 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.160
 straight apply them in a poker game 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.439
 serious poker games danseni with 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.240
 grandmother and that's it that's really on 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:29.460
 money so light that the Dummy 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.710
 can be used in Korea in the card 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.329
 Focus This is a false withdrawal deck 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.920
 false to weave there are two such 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.480
 unpretentious kind of falsely Stasov 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.710
 Well, let's move on to our usual 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.710
 format let's start 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:57.760
 I am asked if I applied all sorts of 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.489
 different tricks in territorial played in 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.980
 poker with fraudulent chips i will say that neither 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.170
 I've never cheated anyone in a poker game 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.900
 but I played cleanly so family circle yes 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.500
 seriously somehow not particularly played even 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.390
 I've ever had a little one 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.040
 Yesterday terribly afraid of these things, all 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.810
 slept then play will no longer be so then 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.440
 there will now be enough such 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.899
 Light versions of snag more serious 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.110
 probably then let's take that for 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.399
 little heart 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.119
 the heart will lie on top so we 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:37.149
 knew that we have this card to stand up 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:40.570
 that is, when removing the deck when we and 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:44.950
 remove the heart we stay here 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.259
 what happened just me enough 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.869
 In such a fraudulent way, I removed the deck 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:54.670
 have i take lessons decks get old and 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.479
 separating the top 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.910
 the bottom of here so take 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.069
 bottom part carefully the seal so 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.140
 as dividing the upper part I take to the left 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:08.229
 hand with my right hand I take the lower part about 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:13.410
 our her over the top like this 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:16.180
 I put it on the table and put it on top 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.610
 the top part that is absolutely not 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:24.880
 the arrangement of the cards in the deck changes 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:29.020
 so my heart is still in place 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:32.080
 once or a slightly different version like this 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:35.860
 that is, how then a person will see that you 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.690
 removed to a deck of cards but the card it will be 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.370
 look like someone really mine 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.260
 took off 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.360
 I basically have such a psychological 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.420
 trick work i mean me 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.880
 the feeling that I removed a deck of cards that is 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.770
 I fool myself with myself 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.930
 a feeling that I explained at the very 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.850
 really guys I took you as I do not 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.910
 rented 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:00.540
 from us is formed at the top like this 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.990
 the way this is so completely simple 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.600
 axes just snag now so here we have 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.760
 here now 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:13.980
 false hoody that is, we take a shuffle 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.690
 deck as usual here and here with us 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.960
 stays upstairs 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.420
 what happened ie notice 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.130
 unfortunately i have enough fig own a 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.090
 scoop and surely you managed to turn 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.250
 attention that something was not wrong but I 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.590
 I think that I will be able to convey to 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.130
 you yourself message first deliveries now 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.050
 I 'll show you closer like this 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.300
 notice i take more through 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.380
 deck like this is called a tusovka 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.530
 top down i mean i take 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.030
 I will pay it play part he is 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.940
 unplanned situation here we have 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.220
 is here I take put the top 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.890
 part of the deck here and at the same time 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.220
 grab this ace so he can lie 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:02.340
 along with less happiness deck in hand 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.200
 so calmly shuffling here in this way 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.930
 until this one ends with me 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.270
 the part that can not 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.560
 control sweat and ease itch on 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:16.830
 put an ouzo on top that's all that is 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.410
 the hardest thing to take here 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:22.160
 the way you see how the figure turned out 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.720
 have you have to simultaneously put this 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.590
 100 cards cost at the same time 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:32.760
 grab the bottom with the ace and the bottom 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:35.550
 parts upper part former upper part 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.110
 Decks with a hand, that is, we take it like that 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.760
 warehouse with the feeling that nothing is 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.950
 happens actually happens 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.080
 quite a lot and 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:46.920
 that is, if we have prepared a deck already 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.500
 by ourselves here we take this part which 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.300
 fell already prepared 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.060
 so here we take her answer as she has 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.680
 keeps me like this 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.930
 instead of owl waem and just put on top 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.480
 when it ends the cards that we 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.760
 from that owl wali that's all if we 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.979
 want to control the ace top if we 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.169
 want to move it down we just 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.900
 take it 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:13.539
 such a hand we take the whole deck of an ace 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:17.900
 Leave a hand owl cyst plunger card 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:20.120
 here we move down further if 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:24.889
 we want to go save him down we 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:27.879
 take and shuffle the cards but capture ace 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.879
 with these fingers 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:42.349
 that is, it happens like this 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:43.729
 absolutely stupid perspective here and so 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:46.699
 all I wanted to say about 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:48.080
 cheating tricks they are quite so easy 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:50.839
 quite basic 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:54.080
 that is, I would not say that very much 

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:57.349
 useful in order to separate them 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.270
 to show that they want to apply 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:02.900
 more suited to apply here in 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:06.529
 complex that is, you can remove all the decks 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.180
 or on the table is rather complex something 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:09.830
 should happen because 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.219
 Separately looks enough Polina 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:16.370
 To be honest, therefore, such basic 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:19.189
 elements with advise to combine together what 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.080
 so they are like magic tricks. Yes you 

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:23.180
 show some trick not 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.210
 show one trick please not for 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:29.930
 that showing one trick is such a hoax and 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.520
 man especially when you have a column 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.680
 already prepared that is there is 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.069
 double shirt then there are such moments 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.529
 double shirt man immediately 

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:42.949
 swelling you see you have not 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:45.800
 I enter further the occupation of elements and you 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:49.490
 scorch show a few tricks and 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:51.740
 while showing tricks 5 last should 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.880
 to be what else when you can 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:58.870
 show him a deck 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:00.670
 that's the man and you can't handle it 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.510
 such more complex element is the same 

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.470
 most here 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:07.000
 when you show what when you 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.860
 I advise you to do at least a deceitful trick 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.560
 still doing it in a complex of reasons 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:14.200
 don't do it separately then in person 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:17.080
 then all of a sudden a few movements that 

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:19.900
 already here combining here you can remove those 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.750
 deck and man creates a feeling 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:25.260
 that just about you are doing something he's already 

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:29.350
 You will not have to replace whatever you do 

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:31.230
 psychology works works from so in 

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:34.240
 general, thank you for watching the video 

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:35.680
