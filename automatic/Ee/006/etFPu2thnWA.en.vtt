00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:15.179
 hi everyone today is salty complete 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.320
 typical of Roman cuisine and that is the 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.320
 bacon and egg 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.490
 I had already made a recipe at the beginning 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.949
 who had opened the canal 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.130
 but honestly I am now 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.630
 perfected and just heard this 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.760
 version I do now 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.870
 I always propose it again so I decided to 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.059
 present it again if you want to see precisely 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.469
 how to prepare the very good carbonara 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.469
 in summer then after the initials 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:52.399
 for two people needing three eggs 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.629
 this is because I use again in 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:59.860
 more than how many people will eat 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:03.170
 then three eggs about 80 grams of 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:07.729
 pillow and better if not bacon 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.290
 smoked a drizzle of Parmesan oil 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.680
 abundantly after we will go to see 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.860
 precisely how much weight veil in direct 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:22.070
 salt just enough for both the recipe and 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:25.580
 to cook the pasta and came to taste 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.520
 and about 250 grams of pasta the one that 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.929
 prefer spaghetti rigatoni what 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:36.170
 I like it better then first 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:38.000
 take a pan right now is 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.920
 a little smaller this type of come of 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.590
 usually broader however by voices 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.140
 turn the dough inside comfortably 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:56.410
 take a pan put a thread in it 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:56.410
 oil the bacon or bacon 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.190
 and bring everything to brown on the fire 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.130
 inter la rosola pancetta mourned 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.340
 put the water to boil with the salt 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.820
 now in a dish in a bowl 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.450
 we are going to beat the eggs ie a 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.450
 break the eggs 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:36.680
 and we are going to break it with a fork 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:44.420
 we respect begin to add the 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:48.560
 Parmesan cheese about three 20 30 grams 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.430
 in short and begin to slam the 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.430
 Parmesan with eggs 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.270
 then turned the bacon every now and then 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.430
 yes rose 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.460
 I put out the fire, it goes from the figures well 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.590
 browned with egg mixture e 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:15.460
 Parmesan now I add 34 pinches 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:17.820
 of salt 34 baby salt then became 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:23.410
 also from your tastes 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:25.330
 then pepper abound because it is one 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.520
 characteristic of the carbonara is precisely 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.890
 the pepper however always depends on yours 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:34.140
 right if you like more weight less pepper it 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.140
 put on and slam accordingly 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.750
 The water is boiling 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.989
 then we go to throw the pasta into the 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:47.280
 pan or re-ignite very low heat e 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:52.770
 now let's go and drain the pasta 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.770
 directly in the fried bacon 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:03.430
 let's mix see a quick stir 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:08.440
 so much for the line stirred 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:21.310
 then we go to add the mixture of 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:25.120
 eggs and let's always mix with the 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.740
 very low flame until the 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.510
 consistency of the new year reach 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.370
 what you like in the sense of me 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.100
 neither like nor too liquid man either 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:39.550
 too 8 so a better consistency 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:45.840
 now I'll show you see it starts 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:53.370
