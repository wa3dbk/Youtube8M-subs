on<00:01:48.079> the<00:01:48.380> suction<00:01:48.859> side<00:01:48.889> of<00:01:49.189> the<00:01:49.490> bottle<00:01:50.299> on

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:51.109 
on the suction side of the bottle on

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:53.440 
on the suction side of the bottle on
this<00:01:51.319> one<00:01:51.560> it's<00:01:51.709> black<00:01:52.009> and<00:01:52.310> then<00:01:53.119> we'll<00:01:53.240> take

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
this one it's black and then we'll take

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.379 
this one it's black and then we'll take
the<00:01:53.630> tool<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:54.700> putting<00:01:55.700> it<00:01:55.819> up<00:01:55.939> in<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.209> air

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:56.389 
the tool and putting it up in the air

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:59.889 
the tool and putting it up in the air
will<00:01:56.749> start<00:01:56.990> to<00:01:57.219> pump<00:01:58.219> fluid<00:01:58.759> through<00:01:59.749> the

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
will start to pump fluid through the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:08.870 
will start to pump fluid through the
line<00:02:00.139> and<00:02:00.819> will<00:02:01.819> go<00:02:01.969> all<00:02:02.329> the<00:02:02.630> way

to inject any air into our system so a

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.500 
to inject any air into our system so a
quick<00:02:17.190> tech<00:02:17.460> tip<00:02:17.490> before<00:02:17.850> you<00:02:18.120> get<00:02:18.240> started

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
quick tech tip before you get started

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.480 
quick tech tip before you get started
make<00:02:19.050> sure<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.290> place<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.680> cap<00:02:19.890> back<00:02:19.920> on<00:02:20.370> the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
make sure you place the cap back on the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.970 
make sure you place the cap back on the
reservoir<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.840> pressure<00:02:22.140> from<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.530> tool<00:02:22.740> can

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
reservoir the pressure from the tool can

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.770 
reservoir the pressure from the tool can
cause<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.460> squirt<00:02:23.760> up<00:02:23.910> just<00:02:24.330> place<00:02:24.570> it

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
cause it to squirt up just place it

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.570 
cause it to squirt up just place it
don't<00:02:24.960> screw<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.350> down<00:02:25.500> what<00:02:26.040> we<00:02:26.160> want<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.400> do

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
don't screw it down what we want to do

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.060 
don't screw it down what we want to do
is<00:02:26.820> we<00:02:27.510> take<00:02:27.690> our<00:02:27.750> tool<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.140> we<00:02:28.380> just<00:02:28.620> squeeze

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
is we take our tool and we just squeeze

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.050 
is we take our tool and we just squeeze
it<00:02:29.280> just<00:02:30.270> enough<00:02:30.920> till<00:02:31.920> fluid<00:02:32.370> starts<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.850> come

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
it just enough till fluid starts to come

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.690 
it just enough till fluid starts to come
in<00:02:33.270> and<00:02:33.450> then<00:02:34.170> we'll<00:02:34.320> put<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.650> right<00:02:34.830> back<00:02:35.400> on

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
in and then we'll put it right back on

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:43.040 
in and then we'll put it right back on
to<00:02:36.450> our<00:02:37.340> bleeder<00:02:38.340> screw<00:02:38.460> and<00:02:39.620> then<00:02:41.930> holding<00:02:42.930> it

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
to our bleeder screw and then holding it

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.020 
to our bleeder screw and then holding it
there<00:02:43.290> we'll<00:02:43.530> just<00:02:43.710> take<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.250> we'll<00:02:44.850> loosen

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
there we'll just take and we'll loosen

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.130 
there we'll just take and we'll loosen
up<00:02:45.300> our<00:02:45.450> bleeder<00:02:45.720> screw<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:47.810> then<00:02:48.810> we'll<00:02:48.960> just

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
up our bleeder screw and then we'll just

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:59.290 
up our bleeder screw and then we'll just
slowly<00:02:51.890> start<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:53.100> inject<00:02:53.550> our<00:02:53.760> fluid

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.080 

here's<00:03:00.170> another<00:03:00.290> tech<00:03:00.740> tip<00:03:01.010> it's<00:03:01.790> called

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
here's another tech tip it's called

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.690 
here's another tech tip it's called
pulse<00:03:02.360> generation<00:03:02.900> and<00:03:03.320> what<00:03:04.220> you<00:03:04.310> do<00:03:04.460> is<00:03:04.610> you

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
pulse generation and what you do is you

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.040 
pulse generation and what you do is you
take<00:03:04.880> and<00:03:05.090> you<00:03:05.120> squeeze<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.570> handle<00:03:05.930> like

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
take and you squeeze the handle like

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.740 
take and you squeeze the handle like
this<00:03:06.290> ever<00:03:06.590> so<00:03:06.860> slightly<00:03:07.190> to<00:03:07.550> cause<00:03:08.120> pulses<00:03:08.630> in

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
this ever so slightly to cause pulses in

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.660 
this ever so slightly to cause pulses in
the<00:03:08.780> fluid<00:03:09.080> that<00:03:09.350> assists<00:03:09.740> removing<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.460> air

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
the fluid that assists removing the air

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.420 
the fluid that assists removing the air
out<00:03:10.910> of<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.120> system<00:03:11.570> and<00:03:12.260> now<00:03:12.800> at<00:03:12.950> this<00:03:13.100> point

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
out of the system and now at this point

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.590 
out of the system and now at this point
we<00:03:13.490> want<00:03:13.640> to<00:03:13.700> go<00:03:13.820> ahead<00:03:13.940> and<00:03:14.120> fill<00:03:14.510> the

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
we want to go ahead and fill the

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.050 
we want to go ahead and fill the
reservoir<00:03:14.780> halfway<00:03:15.620> full<00:03:15.920> if<00:03:16.430> we're<00:03:16.700> doing<00:03:16.850> a

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
reservoir halfway full if we're doing a

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.610 
reservoir halfway full if we're doing a
dual<00:03:17.270> caliper<00:03:17.780> system<00:03:18.170> we<00:03:18.260> want<00:03:18.440> to<00:03:18.500> go<00:03:18.590> a

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
dual caliper system we want to go a

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.620 
dual caliper system we want to go a
quarter<00:03:18.920> of<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:19.130> way<00:03:19.280> before<00:03:19.820> moving<00:03:20.300> to<00:03:20.510> the

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
quarter of the way before moving to the

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.990 
quarter of the way before moving to the
other<00:03:20.780> side<00:03:20.960> but<00:03:21.860> since<00:03:22.130> this<00:03:22.340> is<00:03:22.400> a<00:03:22.520> single

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
other side but since this is a single

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.880 
other side but since this is a single
caliper<00:03:23.420> system<00:03:23.810> we<00:03:24.290> can<00:03:24.410> go<00:03:24.530> ahead<00:03:24.620> and

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
caliper system we can go ahead and

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.980 
caliper system we can go ahead and
tighten<00:03:25.070> up<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.490> bleed<00:03:25.700> screw<00:03:25.880> now<00:03:26.660> that<00:03:26.870> we

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
tighten up the bleed screw now that we

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.100 
tighten up the bleed screw now that we
have<00:03:27.200> 99%<00:03:27.710> of<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.220> air<00:03:28.370> out<00:03:28.670> of<00:03:28.700> our<00:03:28.910> system<00:03:29.360> so

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
have 99% of the air out of our system so

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.930 
have 99% of the air out of our system so
as<00:03:30.230> I<00:03:30.350> mentioned<00:03:30.710> earlier<00:03:30.860> now<00:03:31.640> that<00:03:31.820> we've

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
as I mentioned earlier now that we've

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.000 
as I mentioned earlier now that we've
done<00:03:32.120> this<00:03:32.300> we've<00:03:32.480> got<00:03:32.630> 99%<00:03:33.530> of<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.650> air<00:03:33.800> out

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
done this we've got 99% of the air out

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.640 
done this we've got 99% of the air out
of<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.190> system<00:03:34.370> to<00:03:35.030> get<00:03:35.150> that<00:03:35.330> other<00:03:35.480> 1%<00:03:35.870> and

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
of the system to get that other 1% and

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.490 
of the system to get that other 1% and
to<00:03:37.340> get<00:03:37.490> the<00:03:37.610> firmest<00:03:38.180> brake<00:03:38.510> lever<00:03:38.810> possible

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
to get the firmest brake lever possible

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.760 
to get the firmest brake lever possible
we<00:03:39.920> need<00:03:40.040> to<00:03:40.190> move<00:03:40.430> fluid<00:03:41.120> in<00:03:41.300> two<00:03:41.540> directions

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
we need to move fluid in two directions

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.410 
we need to move fluid in two directions
so<00:03:42.770> in<00:03:42.890> order<00:03:43.160> to<00:03:43.280> do<00:03:43.460> that<00:03:43.610> I've<00:03:43.850> taken<00:03:44.090> my

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
so in order to do that I've taken my

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.980 
so in order to do that I've taken my
reverse<00:03:45.140> brake<00:03:45.800> lighter<00:03:46.100> here<00:03:46.460> and<00:03:46.660> I<00:03:47.660> have

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
reverse brake lighter here and I have

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.250 
reverse brake lighter here and I have
switched<00:03:48.830> from<00:03:49.580> this<00:03:49.850> side<00:03:50.150> pulling<00:03:50.750> out<00:03:51.050> of

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
switched from this side pulling out of

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.590 
switched from this side pulling out of
my<00:03:51.380> reservoir<00:03:51.980> to<00:03:52.490> this<00:03:53.090> side<00:03:53.360> that<00:03:53.450> was

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
my reservoir to this side that was

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.540 
my reservoir to this side that was
pushing<00:03:54.050> I've<00:03:54.230> reversed<00:03:54.830> them<00:03:55.160> so<00:03:55.370> that<00:03:55.520> I

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
pushing I've reversed them so that I

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.910 
pushing I've reversed them so that I
could<00:03:55.790> cause<00:03:56.000> a<00:03:56.030> vacuum<00:03:56.410> so<00:03:57.410> what<00:03:57.590> I<00:03:57.620> want<00:03:57.860> to

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
could cause a vacuum so what I want to

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.690 
could cause a vacuum so what I want to
do<00:03:58.100> is<00:03:58.340> put<00:03:59.090> it<00:03:59.210> on<00:03:59.360> my<00:03:59.750> bleeder<00:04:00.340> pop<00:04:01.340> it<00:04:01.550> open

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
do is put it on my bleeder pop it open

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.230 
do is put it on my bleeder pop it open
again<00:04:02.000> and<00:04:02.560> then<00:04:03.560> I<00:04:03.590> just<00:04:03.830> want<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.160> pump<00:04:04.400> to
