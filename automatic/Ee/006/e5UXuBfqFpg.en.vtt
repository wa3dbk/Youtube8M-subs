00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.240 
kind of tank and I guess pretty much
something<00:01:40.290> up<00:01:40.470> with<00:01:40.650> so

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
something up with so

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.580 
something up with so
it's<00:01:41.970> basically<00:01:42.330> a<00:01:42.450> great<00:01:42.750> farming<00:01:43.260> machine

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
it's basically a great farming machine

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.220 
it's basically a great farming machine
on<00:01:43.860> general<00:01:44.370> found<00:01:45.060> most<00:01:45.300> the<00:01:45.480> spots<00:01:45.810> there

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
on general found most the spots there

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.470 
on general found most the spots there
are<00:01:46.320> defined<00:01:46.800> social<00:01:47.670> incorporating

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
are defined social incorporating

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.390 
are defined social incorporating
vehicles<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.200> what<00:01:49.350> not<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.560> make<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.040> even

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
vehicles and what not to make it even

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.100 
vehicles and what not to make it even
easier<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:51.090> mean<00:01:51.240> essentially<00:01:51.630> if<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.960> can

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
easier I mean essentially if you can

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.310 
easier I mean essentially if you can
just<00:01:52.140> pull<00:01:52.800> the<00:01:53.010> trigger<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.960> shoot<00:01:54.960> and

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
just pull the trigger and shoot and

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.160 
just pull the trigger and shoot and
that's<00:01:56.220> that's<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.090> get<00:01:57.270> n<00:01:57.510> grams<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.050> you

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
that's that's it you get n grams and you

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.580 
that's that's it you get n grams and you
get<00:01:58.380> whatever<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.340> need<00:01:59.400> out<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.820> it<00:02:00.000> that's

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
get whatever you need out of it that's

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.990 
get whatever you need out of it that's
probably<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.710> best<00:02:01.950> way<00:02:02.160> to<00:02:02.280> do<00:02:02.550> it<00:02:02.580> so

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
probably the best way to do it so

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.270 
probably the best way to do it so
definitely<00:02:03.869> going<00:02:04.050> to<00:02:04.110> be<00:02:04.200> kind<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.890> sticking

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
definitely going to be kind of sticking

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.919 
definitely going to be kind of sticking
with<00:02:05.550> that<00:02:05.580> more<00:02:06.150> or<00:02:06.300> less<00:02:06.330> but<00:02:08.240> anyway<00:02:09.240> I'm

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
with that more or less but anyway I'm

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.070 
with that more or less but anyway I'm
almost<00:02:10.350> there<00:02:10.500> just<00:02:10.679> got<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.100> keep<00:02:11.250> on<00:02:11.459> going

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
almost there just got to keep on going

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.670 
almost there just got to keep on going
almost<00:02:13.080> there<00:02:14.480> no<00:02:15.480> it's<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.720> long<00:02:15.959> drive<00:02:16.320> but

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
almost there no it's a long drive but

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.410 
almost there no it's a long drive but
it's<00:02:16.890> definitely<00:02:17.220> worth<00:02:17.640> especially<00:02:18.239> what

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
it's definitely worth especially what

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.970 
it's definitely worth especially what
you're<00:02:18.600> gonna<00:02:18.750> going<00:02:18.959> this<00:02:19.440> is<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.709> kind<00:02:19.920> of

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
you're gonna going this is the kind of

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.800 
you're gonna going this is the kind of
thing<00:02:20.070> you<00:02:20.220> can<00:02:20.550> just<00:02:20.910> hold<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.270> trigger<00:02:21.480> and

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
thing you can just hold the trigger and

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.040 
thing you can just hold the trigger and
just<00:02:22.380> go<00:02:23.010> see<00:02:23.580> it<00:02:23.700> appear<00:02:24.030> but<00:02:24.630> we're<00:02:24.810> here

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
just go see it appear but we're here

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.740 
just go see it appear but we're here
this<00:02:25.290> is<00:02:25.470> what<00:02:25.620> we're<00:02:25.770> looking<00:02:25.980> for<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.750> for

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
this is what we're looking for and for

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.090 
this is what we're looking for and for
the<00:02:27.870> sake<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.080> video<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.470> killed<00:02:28.770> everything

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
the sake of video I killed everything

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.070 
the sake of video I killed everything
more<00:02:29.640> or<00:02:29.760> less<00:02:29.820> because<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.390> took<00:02:30.810> some<00:02:30.989> money

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
more or less because I took some money

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.080 
more or less because I took some money
takes<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.860> vehicle<00:02:32.280> start<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.550> die<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.760> i

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
takes the vehicle start to die and i

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.910 
takes the vehicle start to die and i
started<00:02:33.480> thinking<00:02:33.660> yeah<00:02:34.290> this<00:02:34.590> isn't<00:02:34.770> gonna

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
started thinking yeah this isn't gonna

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.190 
started thinking yeah this isn't gonna
last<00:02:35.100> much<00:02:35.310> longer<00:02:35.370> your<00:02:36.270> should<00:02:36.540> blast<00:02:36.900> well

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
last much longer your should blast well

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.390 
last much longer your should blast well
I<00:02:37.230> mean<00:02:37.350> I<00:02:37.560> did<00:02:37.739> this<00:02:37.830> for<00:02:37.890> an<00:02:38.040> hour<00:02:38.220> straight

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
I mean I did this for an hour straight

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.600 
I mean I did this for an hour straight
and<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:39.030> had<00:02:39.180> no<00:02:39.360> problems<00:02:39.870> but<00:02:40.830> once<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.489> get

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
and I had no problems but once you get

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.190 
and I had no problems but once you get
here<00:02:41.820> gonna<00:02:41.970> back<00:02:42.270> up<00:02:42.480> in<00:02:42.600> between<00:02:42.900> these<00:02:42.989> two

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
here gonna back up in between these two

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.050 
here gonna back up in between these two
roxas<00:02:43.709> embrace<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.190> spawn<00:02:44.430> for<00:02:44.670> just<00:02:44.940> the

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
roxas embrace the spawn for just the

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.390 
roxas embrace the spawn for just the
backs<00:02:45.299> you<00:02:46.200> want<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.440> start<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.739> shoot<00:02:46.950> rating

backs you want to start to shoot rating
like<00:02:47.519> he<00:02:47.700> gonna<00:02:48.090> start<00:02:48.299> doing<00:02:48.570> it<00:02:48.660> probably<00:02:49.049> a

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
like he gonna start doing it probably a

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.440 
like he gonna start doing it probably a
little<00:02:49.170> bit<00:02:49.380> before<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.860> did<00:02:50.250> try<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:50.910> work<00:02:51.209> out

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
little bit before I did try to work out

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.750 
little bit before I did try to work out
you<00:02:51.570> want<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.810> get<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.049> towards<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.950> top<00:02:53.280> right

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
you want to get it towards the top right

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.020 
you want to get it towards the top right
corner<00:02:54.200> say<00:02:55.200> spawn<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.620> them<00:02:55.799> right<00:02:55.980> then<00:02:56.850> they

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
corner say spawn of them right then they

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.420 
corner say spawn of them right then they
walk<00:02:57.330> up<00:02:57.540> for<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:57.900> bow<00:02:58.080> maybe<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:59.010> get<00:02:59.160> five

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
walk up for a bow maybe and you get five

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.880 
walk up for a bow maybe and you get five
or<00:02:59.459> six<00:03:00.000> shots<00:03:00.090> tops<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:01.080> that<00:03:01.260> game<00:03:01.530> you're

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
or six shots tops and that game you're

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.580 
or six shots tops and that game you're
doing<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.250> perfectly<00:03:02.640> that<00:03:03.420> is<00:03:03.660> just<00:03:04.170> enough

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
doing it perfectly that is just enough

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.410 
doing it perfectly that is just enough
to<00:03:04.799> kill<00:03:05.040> every<00:03:05.580> one<00:03:05.610> of<00:03:05.880> them<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:06.209> worst

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
to kill every one of them that worst

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.810 
to kill every one of them that worst
case<00:03:06.630> scenario<00:03:07.049> the<00:03:07.200> Minotaur<00:03:07.590> will<00:03:07.799> flash<00:03:08.549> up

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
case scenario the Minotaur will flash up

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.699 
case scenario the Minotaur will flash up
1<00:03:09.060> i'll<00:03:09.390> still<00:03:09.690> be<00:03:09.810> at<00:03:09.930> range<00:03:10.140> to<00:03:10.320> get<00:03:10.440> hit<00:03:10.560> by<00:03:10.680> a

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
1 i'll still be at range to get hit by a

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.699 
1 i'll still be at range to get hit by a
rock<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.160> so<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:12.060> can<00:03:12.299> do<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.720> just<00:03:12.959> holding

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
rock and so you can do it just holding

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.590 
rock and so you can do it just holding
the<00:03:13.799> trigger<00:03:14.120> fortunately<00:03:15.120> i<00:03:15.180> don't<00:03:15.390> get<00:03:15.570> the

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
the trigger fortunately i don't get the

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.080 
the trigger fortunately i don't get the
perfect<00:03:16.049> shot<00:03:16.260> of<00:03:16.590> that<00:03:16.620> is<00:03:16.890> video<00:03:17.310> vehicle

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
perfect shot of that is video vehicle

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.539 
perfect shot of that is video vehicle
was<00:03:18.299> a<00:03:18.329> start<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:18.930> dying<00:03:19.170> so<00:03:19.620> he<00:03:19.799> takes<00:03:20.010> over

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
was a start of dying so he takes over

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.040 
was a start of dying so he takes over
rough<00:03:20.940> ground

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050

certain<00:03:26.040> number<00:03:26.280> of<00:03:26.310> steps<00:03:26.610> and<00:03:26.940> that<00:03:27.600> number

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
certain number of steps and that number

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.710 
certain number of steps and that number
of<00:03:27.990> steps<00:03:28.170> is<00:03:28.410> pretty<00:03:29.100> small<00:03:29.400> but<00:03:30.390> other<00:03:30.540> way

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
of steps is pretty small but other way

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.010 
of steps is pretty small but other way
that<00:03:30.960> is<00:03:31.290> basically<00:03:31.920> how<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.970> farm<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.750> VEX

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
that is basically how to farm the VEX

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.620 
that is basically how to farm the VEX
from<00:03:34.260> here<00:03:34.500> I<00:03:34.680> recommend<00:03:35.610> backing<00:03:35.940> up<00:03:36.210> to<00:03:36.450> it

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
from here I recommend backing up to it

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.610 
from here I recommend backing up to it

got a headache but once you get it down
it's<00:03:50.490> good<00:03:50.700> another<00:03:51.450> way<00:03:51.570> to<00:03:51.600> do<00:03:51.810> it<00:03:51.960> is<00:03:52.110> to

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
it's good another way to do it is to

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.830 
it's good another way to do it is to
fart<00:03:52.470> both<00:03:53.090> it's<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.150> little<00:03:54.420> more<00:03:54.510> complicated

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840

fart both it's a little more complicated
I<00:03:55.230> wouldn't<00:03:55.590> so<00:03:55.950> much<00:03:55.980> recommend<00:03:56.610> it<00:03:56.730> unless

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880
