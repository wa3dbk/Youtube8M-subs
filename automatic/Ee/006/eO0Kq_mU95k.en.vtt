going<00:00:37.399> to<00:00:37.460> teach<00:00:37.579> us<00:00:37.760> once<00:00:38.000> we<00:00:38.180> catch<00:00:39.050> a

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
going to teach us once we catch a

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.410 
going to teach us once we catch a
specimen<00:00:39.559> and<00:00:39.890> investigate<00:00:40.820> what<00:00:40.969> its<00:00:41.090> makeup

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
specimen and investigate what its makeup

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.270 
specimen and investigate what its makeup
is<00:00:43.960> what's<00:00:44.960> incredible<00:00:45.290> phenomenon<00:00:46.010> whatever

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
is what's incredible phenomenon whatever

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.130 
is what's incredible phenomenon whatever
these<00:00:46.400> things<00:00:46.460> are<00:00:46.880> they've<00:00:47.120> mastered<00:00:47.450> the

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
these things are they've mastered the

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.350 
these things are they've mastered the
ability<00:00:48.260> to<00:00:48.860> travel<00:00:49.340> to<00:00:49.579> both<00:00:49.790> means<00:00:50.090> if

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
ability to travel to both means if

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.480 
ability to travel to both means if
there's<00:00:50.750> nothing<00:00:50.930> really<00:00:51.380> there<00:00:51.500> just<00:00:52.370> like

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:52.490 
there's nothing really there just like

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.160 
there's nothing really there just like
traveling<00:00:52.850> through<00:00:53.030> dimensions<00:00:55.870> the<00:00:56.870> rods

traveling through dimensions the rods

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.270 
traveling through dimensions the rods
are<00:00:57.470> just<00:00:57.980> one<00:00:58.640> part<00:00:58.670> of<00:00:59.590> an<00:01:00.590> enormous

are just one part of an enormous
panorama<00:01:02.150> of<00:01:02.420> life<00:01:03.159> that<00:01:04.159> is<00:01:04.610> veiled<00:01:05.000> from

extremely fast shutter you could slow

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:13.860 
extremely fast shutter you could slow

by something that would otherwise elude

by something that would otherwise elude
the<00:01:16.480> photographic<00:01:17.080> process<00:01:17.500> but<00:01:18.370> that

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
the photographic process but that

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.520 
the photographic process but that
doesn't<00:01:18.880> mean<00:01:19.030> that<00:01:19.060> they're<00:01:19.270> not<00:01:19.390> bear<00:01:19.690> that

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
doesn't mean that they're not bear that

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.040 
doesn't mean that they're not bear that
just<00:01:20.800> means<00:01:21.010> that<00:01:21.160> you<00:01:21.400> need<00:01:21.640> a<00:01:21.880> device<00:01:22.690> an

just means that you need a device an

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.310 
just means that you need a device an
apparatus<00:01:23.740> that<00:01:24.160> will<00:01:24.400> remove<00:01:24.850> an<00:01:25.840> optical

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.240 
the microscope because the microscope
intensifies<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:35.260> power<00:01:35.470> of<00:01:35.710> human<00:01:35.860> sight

intensifies the power of human sight

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.030 
intensifies the power of human sight
without<00:01:37.120> it<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:37.510> role<00:01:38.110> of<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.380> micro<00:01:38.800> would

without it the role of the micro would
not<00:01:39.220> exist<00:01:40.050> but<00:01:41.050> that<00:01:41.290> wouldn't<00:01:41.560> alter<00:01:41.830> the

upper<00:01:58.030> border<00:01:58.390> of<00:01:58.720> nature<00:02:01.440> but<00:02:02.440> I<00:02:02.470> realized

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
upper border of nature but I realized

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.240 
upper border of nature but I realized
this<00:02:03.430> point<00:02:03.790> that<00:02:04.150> it's<00:02:04.300> very<00:02:04.930> secret<00:02:05.590> that<00:02:05.950> it

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
this point that it's very secret that it

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.700 
this point that it's very secret that it
was<00:02:06.370> kept<00:02:06.610> secret<00:02:06.820> because<00:02:07.150> I<00:02:07.360> asked<00:02:07.900> him<00:02:08.110> what

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
was kept secret because I asked him what

does is give you a sort of cosmic ruler

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.589 
does is give you a sort of cosmic ruler
by<00:05:28.050> which<00:05:28.349> you<00:05:28.650> can<00:05:28.680> get<00:05:29.430> an<00:05:29.729> idea<00:05:30.030> in<00:05:30.389> an

down<00:05:34.800> there<00:05:35.070> now<00:05:35.910> when<00:05:36.120> you<00:05:36.240> see<00:05:36.510> them<00:05:36.720> go

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
down there now when you see them go

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.600 
down there now when you see them go
behind<00:05:37.590> the<00:05:37.919> tether<00:05:39.350> that<00:05:40.350> means<00:05:40.680> that<00:05:41.430> you

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
behind the tether that means that you

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.330 
behind the tether that means that you
can<00:05:41.850> use<00:05:42.060> that<00:05:42.300> tether<00:05:42.660> like<00:05:43.590> a<00:05:43.620> ruler<00:05:44.130> to

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.939 
can use that tether like a ruler to
measure<00:05:44.910> their<00:05:45.180> diameter<00:05:45.810> and<00:05:45.960> those<00:05:46.560> things

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:46.949 
measure their diameter and those things

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:49.310 
measure their diameter and those things
that<00:05:47.280> are<00:05:47.460> down<00:05:47.910> there<00:05:47.940> going<00:05:48.840> behind<00:05:49.020> the
