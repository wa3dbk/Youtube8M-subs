hey everybody has a certain Pope and
here's<00:00:14.849> my<00:00:15.000> unboxing<00:00:15.210> video<00:00:15.630> for<00:00:16.220> let's<00:00:17.220> see

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
here's my unboxing video for let's see

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.840 
here's my unboxing video for let's see
ya<00:00:17.960> AMD<00:00:19.039> phenom<00:00:20.039> 2<00:00:21.050> 6<00:00:22.050> core<00:00:22.289> not<00:00:23.070> sure<00:00:23.340> exactly

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
ya AMD phenom 2 6 core not sure exactly

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.109 
ya AMD phenom 2 6 core not sure exactly
I'm<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.119> member<00:00:24.420> but<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:25.730> guess<00:00:26.730> that'll<00:00:26.970> be<00:00:27.060> in

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
I'm a member but I guess that'll be in

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.609 
I'm a member but I guess that'll be in
the<00:00:27.210> title<00:00:27.570> actually<00:00:28.019> here's<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.289> slip

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
the title actually here's the slip

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.250 
the title actually here's the slip
there's<00:00:29.490> goose<00:00:29.730> he's<00:00:30.630> like<00:00:30.779> what<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.080> heck's

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
there's goose he's like what the heck's

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.580 
there's goose he's like what the heck's
going<00:00:31.500> on<00:00:31.560> i'll<00:00:31.740> see<00:00:31.980> ya<00:00:32.130> let's<00:00:32.940> see<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.239> a

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
going on i'll see ya let's see it's a

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.150 
going on i'll see ya let's see it's a
1035<00:00:34.590> t<00:00:35.480> so<00:00:36.480> it's<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.780> six<00:00:37.200> core<00:00:37.469> 2.6

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
1035 t so it's the six core 2.6

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.190 
1035 t so it's the six core 2.6
gigahertz<00:00:38.510> it's<00:00:39.510> kind<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.809> worried<00:00:40.020> about

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
gigahertz it's kind of worried about

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.900 
gigahertz it's kind of worried about
maybe<00:00:40.590> it's<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.920> little<00:00:40.980> bit<00:00:41.190> too<00:00:41.399> low<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:41.879> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
maybe it's a little bit too low in the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.660 
maybe it's a little bit too low in the
gigahertz<00:00:42.469> but<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.500> hopefully<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.129> six<00:00:44.430> core

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
gigahertz but I hopefully the six core

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.410 
gigahertz but I hopefully the six core
will<00:00:44.789> help<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.090> out<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:46.100> nine<00:00:47.100> megabyte<00:00:48.059> total

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
will help it out and nine megabyte total

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.439 
will help it out and nine megabyte total

button<00:01:06.000> down<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.330> camera<00:01:09.229> okay<00:01:10.229> let's<00:01:10.610> do

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
button down the camera okay let's do

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.420 
button down the camera okay let's do
something<00:01:12.049> I'm<00:01:13.049> sure<00:01:13.380> pretty<00:01:14.100> much<00:01:14.250> all

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
something I'm sure pretty much all

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.460 
something I'm sure pretty much all
processor<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.150> boxing<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.689> are<00:01:15.990> probably

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
processor in boxing is are probably

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.960 
processor in boxing is are probably
similar<00:01:16.770> least<00:01:17.759> all<00:01:17.939> AMD<00:01:18.240> videos<00:01:18.689> cuz<00:01:18.990> their

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
similar least all AMD videos cuz their

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.499 
similar least all AMD videos cuz their
processors<00:01:20.970> don't<00:01:21.180> really<00:01:21.360> look<00:01:21.450> that

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
processors don't really look that

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.990 
processors don't really look that
different<00:01:21.979> although<00:01:22.979> they<00:01:23.220> perform<00:01:23.700> how<00:01:23.970> a

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
different although they perform how a

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.120 
different although they perform how a
lot<00:01:24.330> different<00:01:24.750> see<00:01:25.530> that's<00:01:25.770> what<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:25.979> looks

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
lot different see that's what it looks

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.520 
lot different see that's what it looks
like<00:01:26.600> it's<00:01:27.600> kind<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.810> hard<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.020> read<00:01:28.170> off<00:01:28.320> their

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
like it's kind of hard to read off their

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.100 
like it's kind of hard to read off their
bit<00:01:28.770> too<00:01:28.920> well<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.549> got<00:01:29.700> stuck<00:01:29.880> for<00:01:30.060> two<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.450> love

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
bit too well I got stuck for two I love

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.200 
bit too well I got stuck for two I love
those<00:01:31.200> fucking<00:01:31.560> stickers<00:01:33.020> then<00:01:34.020> let's<00:01:34.590> see

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
those fucking stickers then let's see

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.690 
those fucking stickers then let's see
like<00:01:36.210> instructions<00:01:36.810> which<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:38.250> instructions

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
like instructions which the instructions

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.800 
like instructions which the instructions
are<00:01:38.850> we<00:01:38.970> shit<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:40.040> processor<00:01:41.040> installing<00:01:44.810> and

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
are we shit for processor installing and

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.370 
are we shit for processor installing and
then<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.200> fan<00:01:46.409> heatsink<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:47.070> soon<00:01:49.970> let's<00:01:50.970> see

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
then the fan heatsink I soon let's see

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.359 
then the fan heatsink I soon let's see
looks<00:01:52.380> like<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:52.710> one<00:01:52.860> will<00:01:52.979> actually<00:01:53.040> work

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
looks like this one will actually work

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.760 
looks like this one will actually work
nice<00:01:53.909> thing<00:01:54.149> cuz<00:01:54.360> imma<00:01:54.509> make<00:01:55.470> sure<00:01:55.619> going<00:01:55.710> to

nice thing cuz imma make sure going to
keep<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.070> quad<00:01:56.250> core<00:01:56.460> on<00:01:56.549> this<00:01:56.700> day<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:56.909> have

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
keep the quad core on this day I have

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.120 
keep the quad core on this day I have
but<00:01:57.390> I'm<00:01:57.479> up<00:01:57.570> with<00:01:57.689> some<00:01:57.930> HP<00:01:58.610> so<00:01:59.610> I<00:02:00.860> assume<00:02:01.860> has

paste whatever how they call it but that
nice<00:02:10.590> fan<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:10.950> look<00:02:11.430> at<00:02:11.550> that

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
nice fan I look at that

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.900 
nice fan I look at that
look<00:02:13.540> we<00:02:13.660> gotta<00:02:13.810> work<00:02:14.280> if<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.430> doesn't<00:02:15.490> help<00:02:15.790> us

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
look we gotta work if it doesn't help us

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.540 
look we gotta work if it doesn't help us
find<00:02:16.270> an<00:02:16.390> adapter<00:02:16.570> or<00:02:16.870> something<00:02:17.200> good<00:02:17.550> looks

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
find an adapter or something good looks

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.160 
find an adapter or something good looks
pretty<00:02:18.820> nice<00:02:19.000> nice<00:02:19.960> fan<00:02:20.500> heatsink<00:02:20.800> and

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
pretty nice nice fan heatsink and

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.440 
pretty nice nice fan heatsink and
processor<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.290> sticker<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:24.450> destructions

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
processor and sticker and destructions

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.370 
processor and sticker and destructions
that's<00:02:25.690> pretty<00:02:25.900> much<00:02:25.960> it<00:02:26.520> pretty<00:02:27.520> simple<00:02:27.760> but

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
that's pretty much it pretty simple but

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.980 
that's pretty much it pretty simple but
hopefully<00:02:29.380> six<00:02:29.740> core<00:02:29.980> will<00:02:30.100> mean<00:02:30.630> six<00:02:31.630> times

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
hopefully six core will mean six times

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.520 
hopefully six core will mean six times
the<00:02:32.320> fun<00:02:32.820> or<00:02:33.820> six<00:02:34.420> times<00:02:34.480> actual<00:02:35.020> performance

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
the fun or six times actual performance

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.490 
the fun or six times actual performance
or<00:02:35.650> anything<00:02:36.750> so<00:02:37.750> I<00:02:37.780> hope<00:02:38.050> you<00:02:38.200> guys<00:02:38.230> found

this video to be helpful enjoyable or
idiotic<00:02:42.700> i<00:02:42.940> guess<00:02:43.120> i<00:02:43.240> don't<00:02:43.300> know<00:02:43.480> it's<00:02:43.720> not

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
idiotic i guess i don't know it's not

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.240 
idiotic i guess i don't know it's not
really<00:02:44.050> idiotic<00:02:44.230> it's<00:02:44.560> just<00:02:44.710> in<00:02:44.800> a<00:02:44.860> box<00:02:45.040> video
