00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:11.820
 good and so they have to do their two 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.280
 turtle legs 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.369
 now we have to lock the little leg of the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.400
 turtle that closing it in gray 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:24.960
 then I'm going to close this gray here what 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.300
 I'm going to lower one a double thread there is and 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.279
 now I'm going to upload this gray that's left 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.500
 here in the middle of the leg I'm going to 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.559
 go up to the gray that has to pass 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.650
 now yes that by three threads then one 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.660
 two three and I'm going 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.829
 first thread 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.829
 second thread 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.190
 and 3rd and what would be the gray and the 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.280
 together and then there must be one thing left 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.280
 A) Yes 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.190
 such a thing to start doing the 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.700
 turtle belly we're going to start 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.920
 from here from the head 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.950
 from the two black threads that we 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.170
 they are in the middle 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:10.370
 let's start like this let's do the 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.880
 florecita I begin by this thread the 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:16.670
 on the left side I do it up 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.250
 and the left knot and then I knot 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.979
 right that is down and then I'm going 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.480
 the other to the other black thread that is at 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.870
 side 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.020
 same with the gray I'm going to press it towards 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.469
 above 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.400
 and down and the two here together 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:37.090
 blacks 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.470
 here the points 1 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.430
 and 2 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:46.490
 now the black of the little leg I'm going to give 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:50.630
 one down the black of this little foot 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.940
 I'm going to give it down and one towards 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:58.060
 up and in the middle part I'm going to 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.060
 do exactly the same thing up 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.700
 and down and I go to the other side are 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.340
 pure goings and comebacks is not that hard 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.229
 I grab the leg the thread of the paw 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.900
 there I'm going to give you down with the gray 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.260
 I will weave down and then to 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.260
 above 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.430
 now in the middle part 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.950
 I will do what I did the other 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.410
 side I'm going halfway up 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.390
 and then down 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.970
 and I'm left with the two blacks 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:35.250
 I'm going there together to tie the two 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.650
 points of your two knots 12 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.730
 and now here comes a little more 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.730
 complicated this is the hardest thing I'm going to 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.510
 grab this thread here from the little foot and 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.930
 I'll give it up 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.879
 and then down and then with this 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.189
 same and I'm going to grab the gray that 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:03:00.020
 is here next to me and I'm going to give it to 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:03.170
 down and then up 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.170
 now I'm going to take this black thread that 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.180
 it was up to the top that it is the last and 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.880
 there I will join with my white that 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.350
 I would be the one below, I'm going to give you one 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.830
 down and one up 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.750
 that is, I return it to its place 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:24.170
 like the black one that stays down here and 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.510
 I give up and down 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.110
 and now on the other side I'm going to do 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.180
 exactly the same 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:35.750
 I'm going to start with the thread that is in the 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:39.860
 patita I'm going to start it up 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:42.320
 and then I return it down 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:47.160
 now I'm going to grab the gray I'm going to give 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:50.520
 I'm going to fill in the gray I'm going down 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.760
 and then up 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.400
 same as the last black that I left here 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:00.340
 I'm going to interweave it with the one with 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.680
 be below him I give him one down 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.760
 and now I return it again to its 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.519
 place up and down him 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.600
 is the black there I will close it is 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.030
 up 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.569
 and then down 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.500
 now 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:22.109
 since we have in the middle part 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.870
 we have a thing like that the same here in 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.139
 we're going to make the little flower that 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.960
 let's knit with this with this gray 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:33.810
 up and then down 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:37.030
 come back and on the other side we're going to do what 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.880
 same up 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.480
 up first and then I return it 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.940
 again down 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.580
 and the together 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.030
 I'm going to put the two points together 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.740
 blacks one 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.650
 and 2 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:59.000
 now this black that is up here 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:02.120
 of the gray here is one down and then 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.949
 one up 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.949
 and on the other side I'm going to do the same 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:12.720
 is this 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:15.120
 down and then up and now 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.560
 in the middle part we do the 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.510
 same that we have been doing since 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:25.350
 the beginning up down and 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:28.180
 then on the other side the other thread 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:32.919
 up 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:35.139
 and down and here we finally go 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.569
 to join the two blacks 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:39.789
 it's not that difficult, nothing else is to find 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:42.159
 the thread cycle how it goes but always 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:45.460
 goes back and forth and we have 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:47.919
 mean half turtle now we go to this 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.900
 let's move on to the next one that would be 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:53.550
 already terminals the legs to finish 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.550
 already with the east with the baby turtle
