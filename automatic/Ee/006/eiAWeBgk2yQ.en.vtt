00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
European competitive cars and you also

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.810 
European competitive cars and you also
got<00:04:37.169> a<00:04:37.229> car<00:04:37.500> that<00:04:37.680> wasn't<00:04:37.889> really<00:04:38.130> competitive

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
got a car that wasn't really competitive

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.909 
got a car that wasn't really competitive
when<00:04:39.000> it<00:04:39.030> came<00:04:39.270> to<00:04:39.509> performance<00:04:40.110> but<00:04:40.500> this<00:04:40.710> new

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
when it came to performance but this new

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.830 
when it came to performance but this new
s60<00:04:41.580> as<00:04:41.699> I<00:04:41.729> mentioned<00:04:42.150> off<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:42.419> beginning

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
s60 as I mentioned off the beginning

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.570 
s60 as I mentioned off the beginning
really<00:04:43.349> is<00:04:43.590> going<00:04:43.860> to<00:04:43.919> be<00:04:44.039> the<00:04:44.190> lion's<00:04:44.550> share

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
really is going to be the lion's share

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.020 
really is going to be the lion's share
of<00:04:44.729> sales<00:04:45.120> for<00:04:45.509> Volvo<00:04:45.719> in<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.110> sedan<00:04:46.320> class

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
of sales for Volvo in the sedan class

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.420 
of sales for Volvo in the sedan class
and<00:04:47.210> it<00:04:47.510> also<00:04:47.960> competes<00:04:48.440> with<00:04:48.680> those<00:04:48.830> cars<00:04:49.160> now

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
and it also competes with those cars now

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.610 
and it also competes with those cars now
so<00:04:49.850> you<00:04:49.910> get<00:04:50.180> a<00:04:50.210> price<00:04:50.720> reduction<00:04:50.930> it's<00:04:51.410> less

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
so you get a price reduction it's less

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.680 
so you get a price reduction it's less
expensive<00:04:51.890> as<00:04:52.340> we<00:04:52.490> mentioned<00:04:52.910> but<00:04:53.180> it<00:04:53.330> has<00:04:53.480> the

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
expensive as we mentioned but it has the

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.630 
expensive as we mentioned but it has the
power<00:04:53.870> it<00:04:54.260> has<00:04:54.530> the<00:04:54.740> handling<00:04:55.160> it<00:04:55.310> has<00:04:55.460> the

power it has the handling it has the

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.090 
power it has the handling it has the
looks<00:04:55.910> now<00:04:56.090> and<00:04:56.450> it<00:04:56.690> also<00:04:56.840> has<00:04:57.170> a<00:04:57.200> fabulously
