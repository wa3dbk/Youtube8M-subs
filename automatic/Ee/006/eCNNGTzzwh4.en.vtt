modes normal and squash
I'll<00:00:27.789> show<00:00:27.970> you<00:00:28.029> normal<00:00:28.480> first<00:00:29.070> there<00:00:30.070> are<00:00:30.099> two

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
I'll show you normal first there are two

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.249 
I'll show you normal first there are two
light<00:00:30.640> sources<00:00:30.910> that<00:00:31.359> actually<00:00:31.750> affect<00:00:32.140> the

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
light sources that actually affect the

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.890 
light sources that actually affect the
attack<00:00:32.619> you<00:00:33.100> have<00:00:33.280> led<00:00:33.580> which<00:00:34.360> is<00:00:34.540> a<00:00:34.570> fast

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
attack you have led which is a fast

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.650 
attack you have led which is a fast
attack<00:00:35.140> a<00:00:35.680> lamp<00:00:36.490> which<00:00:36.790> is<00:00:36.820> a<00:00:36.970> slower<00:00:37.300> attack

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
attack a lamp which is a slower attack

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.720 
attack a lamp which is a slower attack
I'll<00:00:37.870> show<00:00:38.050> you<00:00:38.110> the<00:00:38.260> led<00:00:38.710> first<00:00:39.070> in<00:00:39.370> normal

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
I'll show you the led first in normal

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.300 
I'll show you the led first in normal
mode<00:00:40.060> and<00:00:40.390> I'll<00:00:40.990> start<00:00:41.320> with<00:00:41.590> a<00:00:41.620> disengaged

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.310 
mode and I'll start with a disengaged

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.660 
mode and I'll start with a disengaged
which<00:00:42.730> is<00:00:42.880> true<00:00:43.180> bypass

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
which is true bypass

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.819 

and<00:00:46.300> you'll<00:00:46.450> see<00:00:46.660> it<00:00:46.809> enhances<00:00:47.380> the<00:00:47.559> guitar

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
and you'll see it enhances the guitar

00:00:47.829 --> 00:01:02.030 
and you'll see it enhances the guitar
beautifully

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.880 

okay<00:01:03.040> here<00:01:03.310> is<00:01:03.460> the<00:01:03.640> lamp<00:01:03.880> position<00:01:04.740> which<00:01:05.740> is

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
okay here is the lamp position which is

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.580 
okay here is the lamp position which is
a<00:01:05.920> slower<00:01:06.250> attack<00:01:06.490> in<00:01:07.030> this<00:01:07.420> setting<00:01:07.780> works

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
a slower attack in this setting works

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.400 
a slower attack in this setting works
out<00:01:08.770> really<00:01:08.980> well<00:01:09.130> for<00:01:09.310> recording<00:01:09.970> vocals<00:01:10.410> or

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
out really well for recording vocals or

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:17.000 
out really well for recording vocals or
keyboards<00:01:14.010> there<00:01:15.010> it<00:01:15.100> is<00:01:15.190> disengaged<00:01:15.610> the

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
keyboards there it is disengaged the

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.280 
keyboards there it is disengaged the
back<00:01:18.010> in<00:01:18.280> here<00:01:19.150> how<00:01:19.270> much<00:01:19.450> it<00:01:19.600> enhances<00:01:20.140> the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
back in here how much it enhances the

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:33.740 
back in here how much it enhances the
tone

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.960 

next<00:01:34.750> is<00:01:34.900> the<00:01:35.110> squash<00:01:35.440> position<00:01:36.130> which<00:01:36.550> really

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
next is the squash position which really

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.550 
next is the squash position which really
gives<00:01:37.210> you<00:01:37.360> a<00:01:37.390> high<00:01:37.600> compression<00:01:37.870> but<00:01:38.410> as

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
gives you a high compression but as

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.130 
gives you a high compression but as
you'll<00:01:38.740> see<00:01:38.950> it<00:01:39.130> is<00:01:39.250> very<00:01:39.610> smooth<00:01:40.060> very<00:01:40.900> nice

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
you'll see it is very smooth very nice

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:56.080 
you'll see it is very smooth very nice
quality<00:01:41.680> to<00:01:41.920> compression

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.620 

you

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.930 

it's<00:02:01.350> nice<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.590> smooth<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.370> don't<00:02:02.520> get<00:02:02.700> any

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
it's nice and smooth you don't get any

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.000 
it's nice and smooth you don't get any
of<00:02:03.150> that<00:02:03.180> step-up<00:02:03.960> effect<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.620> you<00:02:04.770> find

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
of that step-up effect that you find

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.530 
of that step-up effect that you find
with<00:02:05.250> cheaper<00:02:05.550> compressors

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.180 

the<00:02:11.540> black<00:02:11.780> finger<00:02:12.170> works<00:02:12.410> really<00:02:12.740> well<00:02:13.040> with

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
the black finger works really well with

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.030 
the black finger works really well with
acoustic<00:02:13.670> guitar<00:02:14.170> it's<00:02:15.170> great<00:02:15.380> for<00:02:15.560> recording

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
acoustic guitar it's great for recording

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.020 
acoustic guitar it's great for recording
because<00:02:16.160> it<00:02:16.340> has<00:02:16.460> a<00:02:16.490> very<00:02:16.790> high

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
because it has a very high

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.030 
because it has a very high
signal-to-noise<00:02:17.570> ratio<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:18.710> it's<00:02:18.830> very

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
signal-to-noise ratio and it's very

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.850 
signal-to-noise ratio and it's very
smooth<00:02:19.460> and<00:02:19.580> transparent<00:02:20.300> and<00:02:20.480> it's<00:02:21.170> really

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
smooth and transparent and it's really

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.950 
smooth and transparent and it's really
exceptional<00:02:22.160> for<00:02:22.640> live<00:02:22.820> use<00:02:23.240> when<00:02:23.840> you're

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
exceptional for live use when you're

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.780 
exceptional for live use when you're
using<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.410> bridge<00:02:24.650> transducer<00:02:25.520> style

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790
