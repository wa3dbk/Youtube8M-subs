00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:08.150
 good guys let's see a little bit 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.680
 the sequential lever upon request 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.970
 some guys from OlavarrÃ­a make you 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.850
 virtual 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.780
 I still do not put it like this like that anymore or 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.640
 unless I show you how it is armed 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.670
 here it is 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.699
 this is the sequential lever completely 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.220
 homemade the truth that spends a little and 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:31.210
 no silver to make it so 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.210
 just stay a little bit 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:40.060
 wait that shows it better as they see 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:43.120
 tab is a stereo male tab 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.950
 of three contacts yes because we are going to 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.350
 need only three contacts three 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.350
 cables we're going to need the negative or 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.320
 the neutral and then what will be the 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.870
 two contacts of the two cams for 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.510
 go down and to upload the changes 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.329
 the lever itself the part where we 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.079
 let's grab in this case I what 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.439
 I did was put 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:10.600
 a shame how this key is called the 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.600
 he knows cricket but the pipe wrench 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.950
 that I cut the tip was actually 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.990
 broken so the only thing I did was 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.540
 get the tip and leave it with nothing is 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.720
 quite heavy is good and good 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.630
 totally rigid the truth does not move 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.390
 use a central axis that is where I have the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:35.760
 big toe this central axis goes up 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.980
 this handle is this handle that 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.770
 I put is a handle with butterfly 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.890
 iron that you buy it in any 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.680
 hardware store in this case to me it came out 10 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.710
 weights so the truth that up here 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.620
 I'm spending 10 pesos this good lever 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.630
 It was broken so I do not cost nothing 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.310
 I put push buttons now I'm going to 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.660
 show how does the contact of the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:05.250
 lever and they will see that you do not use 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.560
 pushbuttons what use because the subject of 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.380
 the push buttons is that they make noise 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.450
 generally I do not like them the 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.660
 noise from the push buttons 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.370
 out there if you are driving at night 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.140
 when there are people sleeping that's why a 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.420
 little annoying 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.700
 I 'll show you to see if you can see 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:28.000
 well how does it work 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.730
 in this case they will see there is a little tip 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.450
 that makes contact when it goes down is this 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.599
 puntita at once here it says to see if the 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.690
 can see well here there are both 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:43.740
 where he makes contact 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.690
 and this I did it in an easy way 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.060
 the bottom part is the black wire 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.240
 you will come in the neutral and the tip of 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.770
 up the one that touches on that neutral is 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.540
 in this case the change of descent 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.480
 obviously you can program it later and 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.110
 what I use to make contact is a 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.290
 of those clamps once is now 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.019
 it will be that it has screws 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.210
 that fits with screws and contacts 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.660
 he put it on the tip 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.790
 I brought the cables back here I put a 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.150
 contact to the tip of the clamp 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.720
 from above in the colo than another clamp 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.030
 under 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.890
 and with the other cable change their 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.890
 life makes the contact down there 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.459
 remember that a cable goes to both 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.830
 contacts and here we have the change of 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:42.800
 down and the red wire is the change of 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.800
 your life under the change I raise the change 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.989
 good I'll take it with another hour too 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:51.200
 yield to a third base clamp for 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.520
 hold the lever to this axis to all 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.370
 this axis 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.560
 I put nuts 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.920
 and for you to come and go use these 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.739
 Springs also had them actually 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.130
 I took it out I think I do not remember what 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.050
 apparatus 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.690
 so do not even buy them 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.700
 you can also use some rubber 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:16.910
 elastic those type serum 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:21.350
 or any other spring always look 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.760
 go testing the grip with 35 common 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.100
 so the truth that is not going is almost 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.310
 nothing the cable also had the 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:31.639
 are left aside and 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.980
 it connects very easy and the truth that is 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.080
 very rigid is very rigid and moves the 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.350
 lever is more like you see all the 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.660
 desk but the lever does not move 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.480
 so good now I'm going to leave photos 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.980
 and a tutorial on how to connect it to 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.780
 flyers and I'm going to leave all the 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.700
 steering wheel connections the photos and how 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.220
 have to do to connect it in this 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.610
 case in the steering wheel is a connection here 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.529
 from the side a female stereo input 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:02.249
 the typical one that is 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:03.359
 in good audio equipment I hope that 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:08.239
 I have served anything 

00:05:03.359 --> 00:05:08.239
 they ask and I tell them the boys
