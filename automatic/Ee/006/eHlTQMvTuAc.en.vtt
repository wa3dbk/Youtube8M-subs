here here and here so with these two
buckets<00:01:38.359> of<00:01:38.450> water<00:01:38.479> you<00:01:39.109> can<00:01:39.259> make<00:01:39.439> a<00:01:39.469> infinite

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
buckets of water you can make a infinite

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.440 
buckets of water you can make a infinite
source<00:01:40.389> so<00:01:41.389> then<00:01:41.569> want<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:41.899> dig<00:01:42.109> up<00:01:42.289> to<00:01:43.450> from

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
source so then want to dig up to from

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.699 
source so then want to dig up to from
this<00:01:44.749> second<00:01:45.259> place<00:01:45.590> that<00:01:45.859> you've<00:01:45.979> dug<00:01:46.159> in

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:47.709 
this second place that you've dug in

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:55.959 
this second place that you've dug in
then<00:01:48.999> on<00:01:49.999> a<00:01:50.060> dig<00:01:51.429> more<00:01:52.429> out<00:01:52.639> three<00:01:53.450> out<00:01:54.349> I<00:01:54.969> mean

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
then on a dig more out three out I mean

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:04.530 
then on a dig more out three out I mean
in<00:01:56.090> one<00:01:56.299> sorry<00:02:00.369> that

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.780 

then<00:02:05.540> insider<00:02:06.020> you<00:02:06.170> want<00:02:06.320> to<00:02:06.380> dig<00:02:06.619> one<00:02:07.130> down<00:02:07.490> at

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
then insider you want to dig one down at

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.850 
then insider you want to dig one down at
back<00:02:10.300> then<00:02:11.300> you<00:02:11.360> just<00:02:11.510> dig<00:02:11.720> your<00:02:11.840> tunnel<00:02:12.200> like

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
back then you just dig your tunnel like

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:21.729 
back then you just dig your tunnel like
so<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:17.660> this<00:02:17.870> tunnel<00:02:19.480> will<00:02:20.480> lead<00:02:20.510> to<00:02:21.500> with<00:02:21.709> a

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
so and this tunnel will lead to with a

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:31.540 
so and this tunnel will lead to with a
lever<00:02:22.069> lever<00:02:23.030> is<00:02:23.390> going<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.630> be<00:02:23.690> placed<00:02:30.550> so

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
lever lever is going to be placed so

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.640 
lever lever is going to be placed so
there<00:02:31.700> we<00:02:31.790> go<00:02:32.110> obviously<00:02:33.110> you<00:02:33.170> want<00:02:33.350> to<00:02:33.410> build

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
there we go obviously you want to build

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.390 
there we go obviously you want to build
inside<00:02:34.010> here<00:02:34.870> can<00:02:35.870> I<00:02:35.989> got<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.680> piston<00:02:37.100> area

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
inside here can I got the piston area

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.610 
inside here can I got the piston area
ready<00:02:37.640> so<00:02:38.450> what<00:02:38.600> you<00:02:38.720> want<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:38.959> do<00:02:39.080> you<00:02:39.290> want<00:02:39.500> to

underneath<00:04:25.610> leaks<00:04:26.270> at<00:04:26.570> least<00:04:27.070> three<00:04:28.070> deep<00:04:28.990> and

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
underneath leaks at least three deep and

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:37.270 
underneath leaks at least three deep and
then<00:04:30.260> build<00:04:30.770> it<00:04:31.690> outwards<00:04:32.950> 3<00:04:33.950> 4<00:04:34.580> 5<00:04:35.420> 6<00:04:36.140> 7<00:04:36.350> least

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
then build it outwards 3 4 5 6 7 least

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.210 
then build it outwards 3 4 5 6 7 least
seven<00:04:37.580> so<00:04:37.730> you're<00:04:37.880> plenty<00:04:38.030> of<00:04:38.180> room<00:04:39.070> then<00:04:40.070> in

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
seven so you're plenty of room then in

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.160 
seven so you're plenty of room then in
the<00:04:40.340> center<00:04:40.780> you<00:04:42.160> cut<00:04:43.160> it<00:04:43.280> out<00:04:43.400> to<00:04:44.150> make<00:04:45.110> sure

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
the center you cut it out to make sure

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.710 
the center you cut it out to make sure
you<00:04:45.350> curve<00:04:45.500> by<00:04:45.860> three<00:04:46.130> and<00:04:46.460> then<00:04:47.330> we<00:04:47.480> want<00:04:47.660> to

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720
