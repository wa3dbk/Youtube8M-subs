00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello youtube friends today I bring you 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.990
 a new texture bread called chrome 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.059
 here I use something like that and xdddd good these 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.450
 are some blocks of this peaceful texture 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.719
 it's almost real pity that my pc is 32 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.730
 bits and this texture is for 64-bit xd 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.400
 that's why it looks weird but 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.230
 you will work perfectly 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.900
 this texture was released as it makes a 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.880
 week or something like that you can use it 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.380
 as for your minecraft series or 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.939
 just to play 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.190
 the point is that it is perfectly 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:39.110
 great everything is real and in hd takes shot 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.110
 those those xd 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.630
 the water is almost real below the water 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.630
 it looks super clear 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:50.179
 and well, friends, I'll stop doing 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.069
 bullying or the villagers hehehe and we're going to 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.229
