00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
around on the plane there's DPJ easy now

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:01.520 
around on the plane there's DPJ easy now
i<00:00:51.930> think<00:00:52.530> i<00:00:52.559> saw<00:00:52.710> wife<00:00:52.980> just<00:00:53.309> then

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:31.129 
really freaking weird like it felt like
you<00:06:29.369> were<00:06:29.550> falling<00:06:30.029> off<00:06:30.449> the<00:06:30.719> edge<00:06:30.749> it<00:06:31.050> was

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 
you were falling off the edge it was

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:32.809 
you were falling off the edge it was
like<00:06:31.289> kind<00:06:31.589> of<00:06:31.679> tilted<00:06:32.249> the<00:06:32.309> whole<00:06:32.519> building

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:32.819 
like kind of tilted the whole building

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:35.809 
like kind of tilted the whole building
felt<00:06:33.719> like<00:06:33.869> it<00:06:34.050> was<00:06:34.199> tipping<00:06:34.860> over<00:06:35.069> so

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:35.819 
felt like it was tipping over so

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:37.909 
felt like it was tipping over so
freaking<00:06:36.209> creepy<00:06:36.569> also<00:06:37.259> I<00:06:37.319> was<00:06:37.439> gonna<00:06:37.589> film

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 
freaking creepy also I was gonna film

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:39.469 
freaking creepy also I was gonna film
off<00:06:38.129> the<00:06:38.279> edge<00:06:38.399> but<00:06:38.759> there's<00:06:39.059> no<00:06:39.239> like

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 
off the edge but there's no like

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:41.089 
off the edge but there's no like
railings<00:06:40.319> or<00:06:40.439> anything<00:06:40.709> so<00:06:40.860> you<00:06:40.889> could

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:41.099 
railings or anything so you could

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:42.769 
railings or anything so you could
literally<00:06:41.429> just<00:06:41.669> drop<00:06:42.029> your<00:06:42.209> phone<00:06:42.479> right<00:06:42.659> at

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:42.779 
literally just drop your phone right at

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:44.029 
literally just drop your phone right at
the<00:06:42.869> edge<00:06:42.959> I<00:06:43.080> didn't<00:06:43.319> even<00:06:43.409> want<00:06:43.499> to<00:06:43.679> hold<00:06:43.830> it

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.039 
the edge I didn't even want to hold it

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:45.829 
the edge I didn't even want to hold it
like<00:06:44.519> above<00:06:44.789> my<00:06:44.969> neck<00:06:45.179> just<00:06:45.449> in<00:06:45.539> case<00:06:45.659> I

00:06:45.829 --> 00:06:45.839 
like above my neck just in case I

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:47.499 
like above my neck just in case I
dropped<00:06:46.110> it<00:06:46.229> but<00:06:46.379> I<00:06:46.439> took<00:06:46.529> some<00:06:46.800> awesome

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:47.509 
dropped it but I took some awesome

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:49.549 
dropped it but I took some awesome
panoramic<00:06:48.509> shots<00:06:48.809> of<00:06:48.989> the<00:06:49.079> whole<00:06:49.199> thing<00:06:49.439> as

00:06:49.549 --> 00:06:49.559 
panoramic shots of the whole thing as

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:50.929 
panoramic shots of the whole thing as
you<00:06:49.679> can<00:06:49.800> see<00:06:49.949> here<00:06:50.219> and<00:06:50.369> you<00:06:50.459> can<00:06:50.550> see<00:06:50.759> why<00:06:50.789> I

00:06:50.929 --> 00:06:50.939 
you can see here and you can see why I

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:52.369 
you can see here and you can see why I
didn't<00:06:51.269> really<00:06:51.389> want<00:06:51.659> to<00:06:51.719> hold<00:06:51.989> my<00:06:52.139> phone

00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:52.379 
didn't really want to hold my phone

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:54.079 
didn't really want to hold my phone
quite<00:06:52.860> high<00:06:53.039> because<00:06:53.249> I<00:06:53.369> would<00:06:53.579> drop<00:06:53.789> it<00:06:53.969> but

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:54.089 
quite high because I would drop it but

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:55.429 
quite high because I would drop it but
then<00:06:54.269> yeah<00:06:54.449> that<00:06:54.689> was<00:06:54.779> the<00:06:54.809> last<00:06:55.079> day<00:06:55.289> it

00:06:55.429 --> 00:06:55.439 
then yeah that was the last day it

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:56.809 
then yeah that was the last day it
didn't<00:06:55.619> really<00:06:55.709> film<00:06:56.069> anything<00:06:56.339> on<00:06:56.579> the<00:06:56.699> way
