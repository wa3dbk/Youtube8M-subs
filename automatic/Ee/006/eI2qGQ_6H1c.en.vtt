00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:08.670
 hi to all then to repair mine 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.519
 nor mx 5 you need your e 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.980
 25 if the meat is to be cut 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.560
 you need a set of who it was 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.789
 before you can get in 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.310
 any haberdashery inside you will find a 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.289
 very fine needle that made like a half 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.890
 moon 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:31.160
 which you will need to sew some parts 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:37.280
 then the glue attack is used here 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:40.339
 which is flexible and then sealant of 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.540
 sigil which is a liquid one 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:43.540
 I show the 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.100
 and lots of patience 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:05.129
 then how I told you about the use of needles 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.760
 then you have to if you have a tear like 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.760
 I have it 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.690
 on the side so I have so many must 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:16.520
 to dose that being then rice first half 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:19.370
 because the only way to enter 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.200
 unfortunately not only of the outside only 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.610
 in the hood then doing this 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.470
 work comes and goes 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.180
 I recommend always doing a seam 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.400
 cross 15 go in one direction and come back 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.830
 in immediate book that brings so raga 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.120
 when it is intention it does not force on 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.270
 seam a continuous tear but 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.250
 therefore it supports the second repair 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.550
 lake is this that has a needle from 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.550
 upholstery 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.250
 which gave to the sense party the 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.869
 lake is wider than the tip of the tra da 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.479
 so this will allow you to work 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:05.539
 quickly and this makes it very 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:09.799
 particular when in three fora does not make a 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:11.930
 wolf but makes a kind of crack and then 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:14.480
 in short , you will see it when you go to 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.489
 cold I recommend overlapping 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.280
 that is where the tear is 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:22.370
 overlap the shopping bag do not worry 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.330
 to take anyone because then you can 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.190
 decorate the slow-moving hood 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.050
 ok 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:35.470
 Russian attak glue 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:39.850
 I used it after leaving o 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:45.550
 stuccoed from the outside with the 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:48.640
 flexible glue all the light into 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.480
 so that in any case in support of 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.730
 spinneret 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.710
 before putting the sealant 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.810
 you can also put on silicone 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.610
 inside I don't know there was money 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.600
 will have to try to wet it 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:07.200
 I ca n't predict if we hope that 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.200
 everything's fine 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.210
 then repair of the sunroof 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.940
 mx 5 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:20.480
 as you can see there is a long tear 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:24.500
 the whole width 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:27.500
 here I started with the cordonetto Ã¨ 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.640
 flanked the two edges but now the 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.150
 difficult part will be to fix all the 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.150
 cut 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:44.409
 but as you can see here I did 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:47.219
 topstitching with drawstring competitions e 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:50.799
 here he started with the silicone part 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:54.010
 but I don't know if going on 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:56.760
 certainly the tearing of the heavy we see 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.760
 a little I can do 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:08.510
 then after repairing the hood in 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:15.150
 a rather particular way to do that holds 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:19.220
 do however there is mail and it is shiny 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.220
 because it still needs to dry the glue 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:33.550
 the seams seem to have disappeared but 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.560
 you have to see if it will hold up then 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.040
 repair 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.440
 this is 24 hours later in the paste again 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:45.060
 he remains lucid I believe he needs 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:48.040
 a dryer over 48 hours 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.930
 however let's say that being the period 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.270
 winter coat that you can't 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.550
 replace 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.280
 let's say that you should like rocco 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.460
 go ahead my car is beautiful e 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.070
 he sees us very well 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:07.410
 this beautiful mx 5 of 98 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.410
 import masterpiece of aesthetics
