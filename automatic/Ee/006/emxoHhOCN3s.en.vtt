give<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.220> ramp<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.700> think<00:02:12.510> 256mb

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
give it a ramp I think 256mb

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.780 
give it a ramp I think 256mb
anyway<00:02:14.250> it's<00:02:14.400> just<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.790> mobile<00:02:15.630> distro<00:02:16.080> so<00:02:16.790> it

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
anyway it's just a mobile distro so it

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.370 
anyway it's just a mobile distro so it
doesn't<00:02:18.120> need<00:02:18.209> much<00:02:18.480> so<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:19.140> will<00:02:19.260> go<00:02:19.349> to

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
doesn't need much so you will go to

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.380 
doesn't need much so you will go to
create<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.069> you<00:02:20.220> had<00:02:20.430> this<00:02:20.610> because<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.209> need

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
create and you had this because you need

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.080 
create and you had this because you need
a<00:02:21.420> hard<00:02:21.660> disk<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.989> install<00:02:22.050> that<00:02:22.349> on<00:02:22.670> with<00:02:23.670> next

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
a hard disk to install that on with next

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.550 
a hard disk to install that on with next
and<00:02:24.270> in<00:02:25.170> this<00:02:25.319> step<00:02:25.620> so<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.790> can<00:02:26.910> choose

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
and in this step so you can choose

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.380 
and in this step so you can choose
dynamically<00:02:28.560> expanding<00:02:28.860> storage<00:02:29.250> but<00:02:29.819> I<00:02:30.000> say

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
dynamically expanding storage but I say

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.080 
dynamically expanding storage but I say
used<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.170> fixed<00:02:31.380> size<00:02:31.800> storage<00:02:32.099> because

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
used to the fixed size storage because

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.589 
used to the fixed size storage because
you'll<00:02:33.780> need<00:02:33.989> that<00:02:34.640> because<00:02:35.640> cell<00:02:36.360> phones

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
you'll need that because cell phones

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.509 
you'll need that because cell phones
obviously<00:02:37.260> come<00:02:37.410> with<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.590> fixed<00:02:37.830> storage<00:02:38.280> and

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
obviously come with a fixed storage and

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.490 
obviously come with a fixed storage and
it<00:02:38.849> doesn't<00:02:39.180> matter<00:02:39.330> much<00:02:39.599> you<00:02:40.230> won't<00:02:40.440> need

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
it doesn't matter much you won't need

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.509 
it doesn't matter much you won't need
8gb<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.849> think<00:02:42.650> well<00:02:43.650> for<00:02:43.980> will<00:02:44.190> be<00:02:44.340> enough

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
8gb and I think well for will be enough

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.229 
8gb and I think well for will be enough
so<00:02:45.180> I'll<00:02:45.269> give<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.480> 4<00:02:45.750> GB<00:02:46.049> subspace<00:02:47.000> hit<00:02:48.000> next

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
so I'll give it 4 GB subspace hit next

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.259 
so I'll give it 4 GB subspace hit next
hit<00:02:48.660> finish<00:02:49.250> so<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.459> will<00:02:50.580> take<00:02:50.730> some<00:02:50.850> time<00:02:50.910> to

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
hit finish so it will take some time to

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.430 
hit finish so it will take some time to
create<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:52.019> hard<00:02:52.230> disk<00:02:53.209> so<00:02:54.209> that's<00:02:54.480> it<00:02:54.720> you

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
create the hard disk so that's it you

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.289 
create the hard disk so that's it you
hit<00:02:55.950> finish<00:02:56.900> now<00:02:57.900> if<00:02:57.959> you<00:02:58.319> have<00:02:58.709> an<00:02:59.130> Android<00:02:59.340> OS

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
hit finish now if you have an Android OS

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.210 
hit finish now if you have an Android OS
running<00:03:00.660> over<00:03:00.930> here<00:03:01.080> now<00:03:01.410> after<00:03:01.860> this<00:03:02.010> you

running over here now after this you

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.120 
running over here now after this you
have<00:03:02.880> you<00:03:03.540> have<00:03:03.569> the<00:03:04.049> virtual<00:03:04.560> box<00:03:04.739> selected

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
have you have the virtual box selected

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.820 
have you have the virtual box selected
