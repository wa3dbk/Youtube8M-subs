 templor temper and here I am going to 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:05.119
 describe 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.980
 the first as we all know this 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.290
 porte is the 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.050
 which also has this title 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.780
 new album the second song is death 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.180
 to the world and more declared that run that 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.340
 this song was written by him and chris 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.700
 jericho who is the singer of the band 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.650
 fox and recently chris claimed via 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.860
 twitter that they had written a 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.510
 song together and clarified that it will be a 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.360
 song as fresh but of certain 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.270
 dark way the third song is 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.610
 title breaking point and in it 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.070
 edition that never revealed that title 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.980
 saying that it is one of the most 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.830
 heavy of this album since it has part 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.870
 group and after more reports that this 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.350
 song rescues what was the influence 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.659
 or rather the experience of axs 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.640
 world that is the new band of mad then 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.619

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.159
