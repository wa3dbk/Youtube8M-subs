again do it accordingly

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.340 
again do it accordingly
next<00:02:34.440> scan<00:02:34.680> we<00:02:35.040> have<00:02:35.220> two<00:02:35.519> values<00:02:35.850> here<00:02:36.230> one<00:02:37.230> of

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
next scan we have two values here one of

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.710 
next scan we have two values here one of
these<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.920> right<00:02:38.430> value<00:02:39.030> so<00:02:39.330> what<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.569> can

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
these is the right value so what you can

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.070 
these is the right value so what you can
do<00:02:39.900> is<00:02:40.170> pick<00:02:41.069> one<00:02:41.130> I'll<00:02:42.030> try<00:02:42.209> this<00:02:42.360> one<00:02:42.569> change

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
do is pick one I'll try this one change

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.979 
do is pick one I'll try this one change
it<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.350> 10<00:02:45.110> go<00:02:46.110> back<00:02:46.260> in<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.530> game<00:02:46.560> here<00:02:47.989> see

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
it to 10 go back in the game here see

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.090 
it to 10 go back in the game here see
how<00:02:49.170> it's<00:02:49.380> just<00:02:49.470> randomly<00:02:50.750> changing<00:02:52.100> that

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
how it's just randomly changing that

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.690 
how it's just randomly changing that
value<00:02:53.519> that's<00:02:53.910> not<00:02:54.150> our<00:02:54.660> right<00:02:54.930> value<00:02:55.319> so

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
value that's not our right value so

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.410 
value that's not our right value so
let's<00:02:56.700> delete<00:02:56.850> that<00:02:57.000> one<00:02:58.069> and<00:02:59.069> then<00:02:59.640> this<00:03:00.239> is

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
let's delete that one and then this is

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.110 
let's delete that one and then this is
the<00:03:00.540> one<00:03:00.720> here<00:03:01.230> should<00:03:01.680> be<00:03:01.829> the<00:03:01.920> one<00:03:02.070> so<00:03:02.970> let's

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
the one here should be the one so let's

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.819 
the one here should be the one so let's
change<00:03:03.299> this<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.600> ten<00:03:04.610> all<00:03:05.610> right<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.709> see<00:03:07.709> how

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
change this to ten all right and see how

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.800 
change this to ten all right and see how
it<00:03:07.950> says<00:03:08.130> own<00:03:08.430> five<00:03:08.880> let's<00:03:09.360> go<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.600> my

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
it says own five let's go to my

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.099 
it says own five let's go to my
portfolio<00:03:11.209> refresh<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.390> page<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:12.900> there<00:03:12.989> we

portfolio refresh the page and there we

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:13.490 
portfolio refresh the page and there we
go

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
go

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.910 
go
onde<00:03:13.700> 10<00:03:14.700> so<00:03:15.540> now<00:03:15.570> we<00:03:15.780> can<00:03:16.170> change<00:03:16.380> our<00:03:16.620> number

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
onde 10 so now we can change our number

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.630 
onde 10 so now we can change our number
of<00:03:16.950> stocks<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:18.980> let's<00:03:19.980> go<00:03:20.070> about<00:03:20.190> cheat<00:03:20.459> engine

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
of stocks to let's go about cheat engine

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.400 
of stocks to let's go about cheat engine
here<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:21.570> could<00:03:21.720> change<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:22.079> to<00:03:22.170> something

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
here you could change it to something

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.460 
here you could change it to something
like<00:03:22.560> you<00:03:22.980> know<00:03:23.720> nine<00:03:24.720> nine<00:03:24.930> nine<00:03:24.959> nine<00:03:25.170> nine

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
like you know nine nine nine nine nine

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.220 
like you know nine nine nine nine nine
nine<00:03:28.730> portfolio

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
nine portfolio

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.990 
nine portfolio
BAM<00:03:32.230> so<00:03:32.680> then<00:03:32.830> what<00:03:32.950> you<00:03:33.069> would<00:03:33.190> do<00:03:33.340> is<00:03:33.489> go<00:03:33.550> sell

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
BAM so then what you would do is go sell

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.770 
BAM so then what you would do is go sell
and<00:03:34.269> then<00:03:34.810> sell<00:03:35.110> all<00:03:35.409> and<00:03:36.220> then<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.269> value<00:03:37.629> of

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
and then sell all and then the value of

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.220 
and then sell all and then the value of
all<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.110> stocks<00:03:38.489> would<00:03:39.489> translate<00:03:39.879> into<00:03:40.230> cold

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
all the stocks would translate into cold

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.089 
all the stocks would translate into cold
hard<00:03:41.819> infinite<00:03:42.819> cash<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:44.260> that's<00:03:44.799> pretty<00:03:45.010> much

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
hard infinite cash so that's pretty much

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.539 
hard infinite cash so that's pretty much
it

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
it

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.460 
it
