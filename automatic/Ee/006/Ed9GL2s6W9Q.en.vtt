00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.250
 bush in this new video we are going to present the monitors of the city 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.269
 with aesthetic defects without dead official screen spots 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:20.710
 The realization of this edition is due to the great demand received by 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.470
 part of our clients do that kind of screen 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.650
 and we hope to clarify any doubts that may arise about the quality of the 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:28.880
 same 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.270
 in hypochondria that we receive all week without large amounts of 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.030
 monitors tft 15 17 19 points of occasion we catalog that ingrate 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.860
 activity where 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.610
 the monitor monitors abuse the monitors in perfect condition tell us 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.990
 where are the monitors with some aesthetic defect in the housing with 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.670
 spots on the screen 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.250
 example cracked housings brought 2 brand touched light shaded points or 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.250
 with whitish or darker tone 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.700
 3 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.700
 two 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.070
 because some monitors present this type of defect 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.370
 it's very simple then monitors come from large companies that 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.510
 they change their computer equipment periodically 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.390
 those that arrive with some aesthetic defect in the housing is clear that 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.950
 It is due to bad handling 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.930
 the white or darker spots of a monitor usually appears on the 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.170
 tft screens 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.040
 due to excessive pressure when cleaning it during transport of the 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.620
 same 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.950
 By pressing the screen, the inner children are 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.870
 Affordable spots appear these spots can not be cleaned because it is a 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.250
 failure 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.540
 but neither that prevent the use pemex 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.270
 it also represents 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:16.510
 2 little commercial of a company can be used 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:19.119
 this type of monitor 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:23.489
 thinking that it is only used by company personnel does not affect the 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.489
 time to work with him in this way the company saves money 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:30.929
 the only Spanish companies and we discussed the fertilization of that 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:31.929
 concept 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:36.579

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:41.099
 with photography colleges or those that they use facing the public 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:46.029
