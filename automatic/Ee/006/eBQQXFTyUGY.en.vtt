 set in velizy this weekend with 32 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.400
 teams a sanctioned tournament call of 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.020
 duty league and I'm in company for 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.789
 this cavs player interview en 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.560
 where does the captain of this team 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.329
 who just qualified for the final 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.619
 of the winner bracket in foreign currency already I 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.329
 will ask to submit quickly 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.070
 for those who would not know a 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.419
 hello to all so me is they 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.270
 would make vision I carry this tag 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.940
 since now to a doubling of where I have 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.020
 did my first so there I talked 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.100
 how to say it was pretty bad last 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.050
 we will say like one like first 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.719
 experience and so let's say I'm a 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.920
 former stage plays and the 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.230
 times stop playing just by 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.370
 function of the game if I like it or that me 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.670
 please do not believe it all 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.140
 just so very well then for you 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.850
 said an ag paris it was bad 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.109
 spent for your first lan today 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.190
 it's a little better but 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.629
 meyer is what you can talk to us a 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.760
 little bit of the course in this tournament of 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.019
 your team quite at my course ya 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.790
 in fact we were if you know 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.840
 to start the blade so I was a 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.280
 little disappointed I thought we were going to be 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.350
 better if but after to win it 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.940
 must play everyone so we know 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.990
 we do not know how to focus on that 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.190
 took the opponents one after the 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.460
 others in our hen we had played on 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.170
 had the wonder after two teams 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.520
 that I do not know in fact I know 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.020
 just a player in a team so we have 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.210
 easily won the three matches 2 0 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.260
 after we knew we would go into 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.850
 second round winner and that the 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.560
 comments an ounce again on sunday 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.940
 so that's the big big matches at 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.220
 the arrival thereafter in fact everything 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.540
 simply yes so in the first round of 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.670
 beacon in the second round of the winner bracket 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.570
 you played the considered sk gaming 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.170
 like a very big European team 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.500
 the best German team not 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.880
 reported an ahmed of leaks in 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.710
 second turn one hour then chained 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.810
 leave so we had trouble precisely on 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.950
 in fact we are our enemy it's us 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.080
 same is because we have a style of 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.130
 hyper aggressive game we set up 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.990
 since the beginning of the game acquired enormously 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.310
 training actually if it's based around 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.170
 rotations and three quarters because 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.580
 that few equipped do in fact on time 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.960
 current level and do that that's what 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.580
 allows us to win 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.560
 dominations to situate the problem its 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.760
 defenses of the range too fast 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.960
 and sometimes we can not put 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.640
 place the team work that makes us win 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.899
 in fact just one particular 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.069
 against the low cost countries you have had 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.090
 a little bit of difficulty and then 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.019
 then you chained the stopovers 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.849
 it was a big win you got it 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.130
 felt how stopovers actually 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.960
 was surprised because 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.340
 when we play we play we play a little 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.480
 everyone at the french level me I 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.460
 really cares about the community 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.440
 European is interested in watching 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.120
 the streams 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.710
 but after wheat play it does not interest me 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.210
 so I put a child still level 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.860
 and so I knew that sk was a 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.270
 little bit of Italy's bÃªte noire that 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.890
 will frequently win at level 1 at 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.760
 level of the tournaments I meet and 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.040
 I finished so precisely 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.620
 so I was suspicious 2 knowing that there is 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.730
 always excused from the connection of 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.770
 guys who just win olivier tally 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.450
 tim lane are necessarily good to me 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.680
 so we arrive with a small 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.320
 apprehension anyway the taker and we 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.750
 put a slap on them October they 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.040
 take no point on both sides 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.540
 so we did not understand that at the beginning 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.150
 finally it was it was a limit match 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.860
 league actually right after on the web 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.240
 below that's how hard it is so high 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.980
 it's guys are who have a mental 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.090
 so are they managed to branoux 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.130
 Simon Gilles Break took the street 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.110
 searched behind so the bkx where we 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.210
 did not succeed in doing just our 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.920
 aggressive play based on singer coffee and 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.330
 after with the mind on april to domi 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.160
 because precisely their weak point 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.690
 it is the dominate and after we went on 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.790
 the last search where there have been 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.920
 clsh played beyond on behalf of my 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.450
 players on frey who who is how 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.600
 to say that they made us win tradi 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.490
 hakim is therefore a veto at the sleeve of 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.900
 5 2 so that we can finally win 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.630
 if actions like that it's really 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.620
 everyone participates for the 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.239
 well-being of the team and to win 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.530
 in a very good team 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.090
 actually as you speak I 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.440
 think I'd like to talk about it 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.550
 with you because I find that you 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.080
 are a team that illustrates well that 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.040
 you have a good individual level but 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.390
 you also have a good level 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.459
 collective as you say you have a game 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.600
 very aggressive often based on four 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.800
 tests but it seems almost game to 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.600
 the American in the end how do you 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.530
 are well understood the game is what you 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.330
 do talk to us a little more tone 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.560
 team and especially players that who 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.030
 are with you that we have no doubt we 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.370
 has not spoken at all yet 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.340
 finally actually me just a cat 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.630
 arrives and so on the bo2 season where I 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.980
 the unpretentious do makes a lot 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.780
 of the year in pick-up so I was looking for 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.340
 two days before all motivated for 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.830
 start syria in dodon I got 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.390
 headed first towards nani who was already 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.430
 in a team so I looked for 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.050
 following other players and so I'm 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.519
 am my second choice had started to 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.720
 to love dax so I asked them 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.220
 I would have proposed a project I told them 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.630
 said listen guys you're motivated 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.250
 I am with radia it is a player 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.830
 who is really not known but who is 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.299
 huge at gunfight level and the 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.830
 game vision is it that you 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.510
 interested in mounting a spring and 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.380
 then to participate in the lan for 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.760
 precisely proven has returned in 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.890
 in this noble goal it was the top 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.990
 3 en so here's to get into this top 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.720
 It was like that so we had 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:38.170
 started at May 6 after so I got souls 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.950
 and dax month finally credit to me sorry on 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.350
 is actually players that they are 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.880
 versatile my bigso modo I 'm going 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.710
 start with credit often played 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.720
 three weeks generate so radia it's 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.970
 the solar agree so he mouths but 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.550
 they do not move it's a bit of a 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.080
 little ilana style of play that me but in 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.700
 much more the passive so it makes a 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.070
 double blade and the brothers actually these 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.390
 two pairs split their storm and the 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.820
 brothers of an update to like dax who are 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.660
 we are going to say players who have made 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.890
 correct results 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.540
 amy who have their marks and the little 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.160
 payet to beat top teams style 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.260
 top qatar not the reins at what we have 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.420
 managed to carry with radio and I it's 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.380
 a nest of a game is a team work so 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.600
 for people who know me who is 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.920
 hyper aggressive ie it's not 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.480
 useful and if in the range it's me who 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.980
 decide and they have to 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.530
 actually do what I want him to do 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.150
 do I eat I do not know how to say 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.950
 I remove the pressure of the players I 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.110
 prefers actually who clears out of any 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.310
 pressure and who conceives a huge 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.910
 on his organ fight and their food 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.830
 quite simply 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.200
 so that's it's our roster works 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.910
 like that actually on a bed so he he 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.240
 is the lead that I'm taking it in 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.070
 charge 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.630
 but the four players communicate 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.950
 constantly that's what saves a 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.570
 team and all those all that 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.130
 I was explaining to people who 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.990
 start the decerto and want 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.640
 progress his cheeks in full team of 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.290
 good players it's simple you have to have 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.620
 an alchemy between gunfight between team 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.880
 work 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.730
 look at the radar because it's a 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.290
 information outlet listen stop his 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.060
 teammates and to read the game 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.310
 the opponent what happens to do that 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.750
 they will inevitably have results and 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.700
 players of this quality in France 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.570
 if there has there rarely 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.340
 actually actually and as you 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.710
 tell me your goal was to enter 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.940
 in this top fr stop prosperous it's done 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.960
 it's done with your victory 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.640
 against the guys manyaka the moment 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.630
 since you are going top 3 before you 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.460
 to leave I just wanted to ask you 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.920
 what do you think of the rest of the 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.820
 tournament is what you will try 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.930
 maybe to go even further 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.670
 now that you have filled your 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.230
 goal is to try to shake the 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.010
 vitaly that will vary what a lot 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.410
 of world see winners in this 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.139
 competition so the prints are vitaly 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.189
 which are and which hand win 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:29.099
 we will try to do the maximum 

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:30.960
 knowing hello plays without 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:32.699
 pressure finally often opponents 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.580
 in fact when I played vitality rise he 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:37.680
 plays with pressure so is losing it 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.840
 the goal is to take the match of the good 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.520
 butt and dad to tell himself that these snacks 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.389
 annoyed people like everyone they 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.180
 can they do bad 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:46.560
 say m so we aim or try to 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.180
 beat them and afterwards if we do not beat them 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.080
 try to go up the loser seeking 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.219
 that I thought of great chances 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.990
 we were playing what after I can 

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:53.879
 to deceive but I see them go back well 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.680

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:56.520
