next we load a key blade which we will
call<00:00:31.720> Julian<00:00:32.290> number<00:00:32.619> one<00:00:33.000> see<00:00:34.000> it's<00:00:34.870> a<00:00:35.080> blade

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
call Julian number one see it's a blade

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.890 
call Julian number one see it's a blade
and<00:00:35.500> a<00:00:35.620> sort<00:00:35.920> of<00:00:36.070> key<00:00:36.310> hence<00:00:36.820> the<00:00:37.090> name<00:00:37.240> key
