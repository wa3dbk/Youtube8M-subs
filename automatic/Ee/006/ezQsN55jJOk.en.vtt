00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.590 
then
this<00:03:34.120> one<00:03:34.740> this<00:03:35.740> one<00:03:35.850> even<00:03:36.850> don't<00:03:37.090> eat<00:03:37.360> that

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
this one this one even don't eat that

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.980 
this one this one even don't eat that
and<00:03:38.380> then<00:03:38.560> we<00:03:38.920> can<00:03:39.160> use<00:03:39.520> a<00:03:39.550> strategy<00:03:40.000> this

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
and then we can use a strategy this

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.820 
and then we can use a strategy this
strategy<00:03:41.290> is<00:03:42.130> being<00:03:42.460> that<00:03:42.730> evil<00:03:43.090> public<00:03:43.630> is

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
strategy is being that evil public is

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:53.370 
strategy is being that evil public is
keep<00:03:46.400> happy<00:03:46.820> just<00:03:47.120> one<00:03:47.300> big<00:03:47.810> one<00:03:48.680> brow

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.240 

and<00:03:54.380> he's<00:03:54.620> one

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.110 

so<00:03:58.410> selectively<00:03:59.410> first<00:03:59.860> two<00:04:00.310> should<00:04:00.550> be<00:04:00.730> 0<00:04:01.090> for

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
so selectively first two should be 0 for

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.900 
so selectively first two should be 0 for
3<00:04:01.510> fat<00:04:02.290> tip<00:04:02.650> with<00:04:03.100> 50<00:04:03.730> degree<00:04:04.120> and<00:04:04.420> then

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
3 fat tip with 50 degree and then

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.190 
3 fat tip with 50 degree and then
evolving

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.320 

we<00:04:11.200> can<00:04:11.410> change<00:04:11.650> it<00:04:11.860> later<00:04:12.040> is<00:04:12.790> what<00:04:13.000> we<00:04:13.150> also

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
we can change it later is what we also

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:19.139 
we can change it later is what we also
like<00:04:14.220> maximum<00:04:15.220> solar<00:04:15.700> power<00:04:16.600> okay

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:19.149

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:20.930
