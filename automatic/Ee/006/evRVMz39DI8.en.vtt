test of the EPL one external microphone

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.299 
test of the EPL one external microphone
seen<00:00:07.649> here<00:00:09.200> obviously<00:00:10.200> for<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.530> EPL<00:00:11.010> one<00:00:11.190> it

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
seen here obviously for the EPL one it

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.459 
seen here obviously for the EPL one it
has<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.580> external<00:00:11.940> microphone<00:00:12.389> jack<00:00:13.200> here

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
has the external microphone jack here

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.330 
has the external microphone jack here
which<00:00:13.679> also<00:00:14.089> will<00:00:15.089> be<00:00:15.570> used<00:00:16.080> for<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.410> XO<00:00:17.250> no

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
which also will be used for the XO no

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.429 
which also will be used for the XO no
viewfinder<00:00:17.580> as<00:00:17.940> well<00:00:18.090> but<00:00:18.990> for<00:00:19.230> today's

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
viewfinder as well but for today's

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.290 
viewfinder as well but for today's
purposes<00:00:19.650> we<00:00:20.160> don't<00:00:20.369> need<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.699> adapter<00:00:20.880> so

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
purposes we don't need the adapter so

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.599 
purposes we don't need the adapter so
we'll<00:00:21.390> take<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.689> off<00:00:22.220> obviously<00:00:23.220> here<00:00:23.460> now

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
we'll take that off obviously here now

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.200 
we'll take that off obviously here now
we're<00:00:23.820> exposing<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.510> standard<00:00:25.439> audio<00:00:26.430> jack

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
we're exposing the standard audio jack

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.890 
we're exposing the standard audio jack
and<00:00:27.510> today<00:00:28.470> we<00:00:28.650> will<00:00:28.920> also<00:00:29.130> be<00:00:29.369> using<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.900> the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
and today we will also be using it the

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.459 
and today we will also be using it the
extender<00:00:31.679> for<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.369> Jack<00:00:33.079> today<00:00:34.079> we're<00:00:34.320> going

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
extender for that Jack today we're going

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.799 
extender for that Jack today we're going
to<00:00:34.559> see<00:00:34.829> if<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.190> microphone<00:00:36.000> can<00:00:36.239> be<00:00:36.360> used<00:00:36.600> on

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
to see if this microphone can be used on

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.260 
to see if this microphone can be used on
another<00:00:37.350> camera<00:00:37.680> such<00:00:37.920> as<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.100> TTY<00:00:38.730> which<00:00:39.030> we

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
another camera such as a TTY which we

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:48.300 
another camera such as a TTY which we
are<00:00:39.420> recording<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:39.899> right<00:00:40.110> now

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.310 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.100 

one<00:00:48.940> of<00:00:49.060> the<00:00:49.180> things<00:00:49.330> that<00:00:49.480> people<00:00:49.810> do<00:00:49.990> not

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
one of the things that people do not

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.950 
one of the things that people do not
like<00:00:50.170> is<00:00:50.620> that<00:00:50.650> the<00:00:51.610> t2i<00:00:52.120> when<00:00:52.720> you're

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
like is that the t2i when you're

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.550 
like is that the t2i when you're
focusing<00:00:53.770> in<00:00:54.390> when<00:00:55.390> you<00:00:55.540> use<00:00:55.780> the<00:00:55.930> auto<00:00:56.110> focus

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.560 
focusing in when you use the auto focus

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.770 
focusing in when you use the auto focus
you<00:00:57.190> can<00:00:57.370> hear<00:00:57.580> the<00:00:57.760> noise<00:00:57.910> which<00:00:58.450> is<00:00:58.570> probably

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
you can hear the noise which is probably

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.049 
you can hear the noise which is probably
something<00:00:59.080> we<00:00:59.290> can<00:00:59.470> hear<00:00:59.680> right<00:00:59.800> now<00:01:03.059> very

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
something we can hear right now very

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.870 
something we can hear right now very
abrupt<00:01:04.540> sound<00:01:04.839> so<00:01:05.650> right<00:01:06.130> now<00:01:06.160> we're<00:01:06.460> going<00:01:06.730> to

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
abrupt sound so right now we're going to

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:19.500 
abrupt sound so right now we're going to
plug<00:01:07.060> in<00:01:07.300> your<00:01:08.080> microphone<00:01:08.620> jack<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:19.330> let's

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
plug in your microphone jack so let's

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.210 
plug in your microphone jack so let's
see<00:01:19.750> how<00:01:19.780> we<00:01:20.050> can<00:01:20.380> hear<00:01:20.590> that<00:01:20.770> now<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:24.070> now

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
see how we can hear that now so now

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.590 
see how we can hear that now so now
we're<00:01:24.400> autofocus<00:01:24.940> and<00:01:24.970> hopefully<00:01:25.390> we<00:01:25.510> were

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
we're autofocus and hopefully we were

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:34.770 
we're autofocus and hopefully we were
unable<00:01:25.780> to<00:01:26.050> hear<00:01:26.200> that<00:01:26.350> let's<00:01:26.619> take<00:01:27.190> a<00:01:27.250> walk<00:01:33.780> so

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
unable to hear that let's take a walk so

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.450 
unable to hear that let's take a walk so
right<00:01:34.960> now<00:01:34.990> we<00:01:35.170> are<00:01:35.500> walking<00:01:35.650> to<00:01:35.860> the<00:01:36.070> store<00:01:36.130> at

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
right now we are walking to the store at

take a walk outside and get some more

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.969 
take a walk outside and get some more
audio<00:01:43.290> obviously<00:01:44.290> like<00:01:44.440> mentioned<00:01:44.830> before

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
audio obviously like mentioned before

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.960 
audio obviously like mentioned before
you<00:01:45.520> can<00:01:45.850> hook<00:01:46.330> up<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:47.290> microphone<00:01:47.979> to<00:01:48.490> the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
you can hook up the microphone to the

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:55.060 
you can hook up the microphone to the
extender<00:01:49.509> cord<00:01:51.869> as<00:01:52.869> seen<00:01:53.140> here

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
extender cord as seen here

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.680
