I<00:02:03.820> mean<00:02:04.090> we<00:02:04.300> leaned<00:02:04.540> over<00:02:04.660> backwards<00:02:05.259> to<00:02:05.440> keep

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590

that<00:02:05.770> car<00:02:06.040> on<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.280> road<00:02:06.460> for<00:02:06.670> you<00:02:06.759> then<00:02:06.970> I

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
that car on the road for you then I

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.940

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
suggest you try leaning forwards you

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.080
