00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.880
 duration that has been andrea p been one 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.720
 of those responsible for the game who has 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.730
 spoken has wanted 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.810
 official figures of the duration of dior 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:14.700
 of 1886 based on internal data 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.500
 of ready at dawn collected during the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.360
 creation of the game therefore according to 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.860

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.720
 hours and a half 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.360
 it is possible but it implies doing it 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.900
 running and without stopping at all 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.690
 a current game or evidently 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.580
 with a normal difficulty because it has more 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.100
 duration we stop in more places 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.050
 it should last between eight and ten 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.150
 hours if we play in difficult mode what 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.650
 we take the opportunity to explore the world that 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.720

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.420
