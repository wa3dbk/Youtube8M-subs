all<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.970> submachine<00:00:18.300> guns<00:00:18.630> don't<00:00:18.869> lock<00:00:19.109> it

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
all the submachine guns don't lock it

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.279 
all the submachine guns don't lock it
honestly<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.189> don't<00:00:20.460> think<00:00:20.670> it's<00:00:20.760> worth<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.289> sky

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
honestly I don't think it's worth it sky

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:29.120 
honestly I don't think it's worth it sky
is<00:00:23.269> its<00:00:24.269> man<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:25.109> has<00:00:25.590> great<00:00:25.830> rate<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.130> fire<00:00:28.130> if

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
is its man it has great rate of fire if

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.470 
is its man it has great rate of fire if
you<00:00:29.279> can<00:00:29.400> get<00:00:29.519> your<00:00:29.640> sights<00:00:29.910> on<00:00:30.029> target<00:00:30.420> and

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
you can get your sights on target and

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.880 
you can get your sights on target and
start<00:00:30.660> firing<00:00:30.869> first<00:00:31.230> you're<00:00:31.439> most<00:00:31.650> likely

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
start firing first you're most likely

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.459 
start firing first you're most likely
gonna<00:00:32.070> kill<00:00:32.399> your<00:00:32.550> enemy<00:00:34.550> hipfire<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.730> decent

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
gonna kill your enemy hipfire is decent

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.340 
gonna kill your enemy hipfire is decent
nothing<00:00:37.469> too<00:00:37.770> extravagant<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:39.140> say<00:00:40.140> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
nothing too extravagant I say the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.840 
nothing too extravagant I say the
strongest<00:00:40.770> point<00:00:41.040> about<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.280> gun<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.550> its

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
strongest point about this gun is its

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.560 
strongest point about this gun is its
rate<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.270> fire<00:00:43.250> damage<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.670> not<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.270> great<00:00:45.450> but

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
rate of fire damage is not so great but

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.020 
rate of fire damage is not so great but
the<00:00:46.230> great<00:00:46.410> rate<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.680> fire<00:00:46.890> makes<00:00:47.640> up<00:00:47.820> for<00:00:48.000> that

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
the great rate of fire makes up for that

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.330 
the great rate of fire makes up for that
here's<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.629> ACOG<00:00:49.050> scope<00:00:51.590> it's<00:00:52.590> decent<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:53.160> mean

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
here's the ACOG scope it's decent I mean

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:04.690 
here's the ACOG scope it's decent I mean
it's<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.940> very<00:00:54.300> very<00:00:54.600> similar<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.160> PM<00:00:56.550> 63

as<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.240> saw<00:01:51.390> right<00:01:51.570> there<00:01:51.690> that's<00:01:51.870> a<00:01:51.960> tactic<00:01:52.290> i

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
as you saw right there that's a tactic i

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.830 
as you saw right there that's a tactic i
like<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.650> use<00:01:52.680> its<00:01:53.100> cold<00:01:53.370> doing<00:01:54.030> sprints<00:01:54.600> you

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
like to use its cold doing sprints you

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.750 
like to use its cold doing sprints you
run<00:01:55.080> back<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.440> forth<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.190> short<00:01:56.520> distance

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
run back and forth and a short distance

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.700 
run back and forth and a short distance
probably<00:01:57.540> about<00:01:57.750> 15<00:01:58.650> 20<00:01:58.890> feet<00:01:59.250> back<00:01:59.760> and<00:01:59.940> forth

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
probably about 15 20 feet back and forth

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.680 
probably about 15 20 feet back and forth
that<00:02:01.710> way<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:01.920> can<00:02:02.460> keep<00:02:02.640> an<00:02:02.790> eye<00:02:02.910> on<00:02:02.940> your

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
that way you can keep an eye on your

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.330 
that way you can keep an eye on your
radar<00:02:03.960> while<00:02:04.290> you're<00:02:04.500> moving<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.130> never

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
radar while you're moving and you never

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.030 
radar while you're moving and you never
staying<00:02:05.670> still<00:02:06.320> that<00:02:07.320> if<00:02:07.530> they<00:02:07.620> have<00:02:07.650> a<00:02:07.740> spy

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
staying still that if they have a spy

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.560 
staying still that if they have a spy
plane<00:02:08.070> up<00:02:08.490> then<00:02:08.670> your<00:02:08.820> flip<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.240> going<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.450> be

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
plane up then your flip is going to be

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.330 
plane up then your flip is going to be
bouncing<00:02:10.229> back<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.619> forth<00:02:10.680> to<00:02:11.010> keep<00:02:11.190> them

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
bouncing back and forth to keep them

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.180 
bouncing back and forth to keep them
guessing<00:02:11.990> so<00:02:12.990> keep<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.290> alive<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.590> hopefully

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190
