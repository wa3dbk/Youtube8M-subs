00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
in the Jersey and you know I think it

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.680 
in the Jersey and you know I think it
showed<00:05:52.670> in<00:05:52.790> the<00:05:52.850> game<00:05:53.000> but<00:05:53.180> it<00:05:53.240> was<00:05:53.270> scrappy

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
showed in the game but it was scrappy

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.420 
showed in the game but it was scrappy
moments<00:05:54.050> but<00:05:54.380> when<00:05:54.530> we<00:05:54.620> had<00:05:54.770> to<00:05:54.920> be<00:05:55.070> dug<00:05:55.250> deep

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
moments but when we had to be dug deep

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.340 
moments but when we had to be dug deep
and<00:05:55.700> yeah<00:05:56.300> obviously<00:05:56.690> got<00:05:56.810> the<00:05:56.840> result<00:05:57.170> now

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:57.350 
and yeah obviously got the result now

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:15.030 
and yeah obviously got the result now
and<00:05:57.530> the<00:05:58.220> fact<00:05:58.430> that<00:05:58.580> both<00:05:59.150> forwards<00:06:00.050> and<00:06:00.140> back

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.040 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.040 

ya<00:06:16.040> know<00:06:16.070> that<00:06:16.820> was<00:06:16.910> it<00:06:17.090> Phil's<00:06:17.390> philosophy<00:06:17.960> is

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
ya know that was it Phil's philosophy is

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.920 
ya know that was it Phil's philosophy is
he<00:06:18.170> wants<00:06:18.380> us<00:06:18.500> to<00:06:18.530> play<00:06:18.740> 1<00:06:19.190> to<00:06:19.310> 15<00:06:19.730> and<00:06:19.910> you<00:06:20.840> know

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
he wants us to play 1 to 15 and you know

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.360 
he wants us to play 1 to 15 and you know
it<00:06:21.050> wasn't<00:06:21.200> there<00:06:21.440> the<00:06:21.590> whole<00:06:21.620> game<00:06:21.950> but<00:06:22.250> at

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
it wasn't there the whole game but at

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:23.770 
it wasn't there the whole game but at
times<00:06:22.610> I<00:06:22.730> think<00:06:22.790> we<00:06:23.000> put<00:06:23.360> the<00:06:23.450> complete

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:23.780 
times I think we put the complete

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.410 
times I think we put the complete
performance<00:06:24.290> in<00:06:24.410> 1<00:06:24.590> to<00:06:24.710> 15<00:06:25.130> I'm<00:06:26.060> sure<00:06:26.270> that

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:26.420 
performance in 1 to 15 I'm sure that

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.730 
performance in 1 to 15 I'm sure that
