hey guys what's up its act and I Jake
and<00:00:20.630> today<00:00:21.220> I'm<00:00:22.220> gonna<00:00:22.520> be<00:00:22.640> unboxing<00:00:23.180> a<00:00:23.360> new

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
and today I'm gonna be unboxing a new

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.089 
and today I'm gonna be unboxing a new
processor<00:00:24.710> I<00:00:24.740> got<00:00:25.070> from<00:00:25.310> my<00:00:25.340> computer<00:00:25.939> and<00:00:27.099> so

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
processor I got from my computer and so

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.660 
processor I got from my computer and so
basically<00:00:28.250> I've<00:00:28.670> had<00:00:28.910> a<00:00:29.260> gaming<00:00:30.260> computer

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
basically I've had a gaming computer

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.000 
basically I've had a gaming computer
since<00:00:31.670> like<00:00:32.000> last<00:00:32.210> June<00:00:32.660> and<00:00:32.989> it<00:00:33.710> came<00:00:33.860> with

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
since like last June and it came with

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.200 
since like last June and it came with
the<00:00:34.100> crappy<00:00:34.309> processor<00:00:34.850> in<00:00:34.940> a<00:00:35.000> crappy

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
the crappy processor in a crappy

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.000 
the crappy processor in a crappy
graphics<00:00:35.449> card<00:00:35.900> so<00:00:36.230> I<00:00:36.260> upgrade<00:00:36.860> the<00:00:36.980> graphics

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
graphics card so I upgrade the graphics

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.280 
graphics card so I upgrade the graphics
card<00:00:37.580> and<00:00:37.820> it's<00:00:38.360> been<00:00:38.510> great<00:00:38.870> it's<00:00:39.050> been<00:00:39.140> an

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
card and it's been great it's been an

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.630 
card and it's been great it's been an
amazing<00:00:39.440> graphics<00:00:39.920> card<00:00:40.100> have<00:00:40.280> been<00:00:40.430> awesome

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
amazing graphics card have been awesome

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.340 
amazing graphics card have been awesome
frames<00:00:41.150> and<00:00:41.300> everything<00:00:41.570> except<00:00:42.320> the

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
frames and everything except the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.650 
frames and everything except the
processor<00:00:42.890> is<00:00:42.920> still<00:00:43.220> been<00:00:43.400> crappy<00:00:43.820> and<00:00:43.970> so

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
processor is still been crappy and so

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.750 
processor is still been crappy and so
it's<00:00:44.960> been<00:00:45.170> making<00:00:45.590> my<00:00:45.710> graphics<00:00:46.309> card<00:00:46.370> speeds

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
it's been making my graphics card speeds

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.310 
it's been making my graphics card speeds
not<00:00:47.000> as<00:00:47.210> good<00:00:47.360> as<00:00:47.449> they<00:00:47.540> could<00:00:47.690> be<00:00:47.840> so<00:00:48.050> I<00:00:48.080> went

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
not as good as they could be so I went

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.360 
not as good as they could be so I went
ahead<00:00:48.410> and<00:00:48.739> ordered<00:00:48.980> myself<00:00:49.280> a<00:00:49.670> brand-new<00:00:50.290> AMD

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
ahead and ordered myself a brand-new AMD

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.260 
ahead and ordered myself a brand-new AMD
fx-8350<00:00:53.890> eight-core<00:00:54.890> processor<00:00:54.920> so<00:00:55.760> this<00:00:56.120> is

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
fx-8350 eight-core processor so this is

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.639 
fx-8350 eight-core processor so this is
what<00:00:56.420> I<00:00:56.450> got<00:00:56.600> ordered<00:00:56.960> from<00:00:57.110> newegg<00:00:57.380> com

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
what I got ordered from newegg com

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.110 
what I got ordered from newegg com
Liga's<00:00:57.980> but<00:00:58.190> we<00:00:58.309> wrap<00:00:58.430> it<00:00:58.460> so<00:00:58.700> cool<00:00:58.910> I<00:00:59.059> love

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
you can just you know so there we go

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.590 
you can just you know so there we go
popping<00:01:07.700> them<00:01:07.789> again<00:01:08.060> I'm<00:01:08.210> gonna<00:01:08.360> leave<00:01:08.570> like

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
popping them again I'm gonna leave like

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.570 
popping them again I'm gonna leave like
two<00:01:08.780> of<00:01:09.080> them<00:01:09.200> that<00:01:09.500> I<00:01:09.530> pop<00:01:09.800> gotta<00:01:10.160> save<00:01:10.340> it<00:01:10.460> for

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
two of them that I pop gotta save it for

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.529 
two of them that I pop gotta save it for
later<00:01:10.700> man<00:01:10.970> come<00:01:11.210> on<00:01:11.330> um<00:01:12.170> anyway<00:01:13.180> so<00:01:14.180> I'm

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
later man come on um anyway so I'm

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:16.090 
later man come on um anyway so I'm
really<00:01:14.810> excited<00:01:14.930> to<00:01:15.229> install<00:01:15.530> this<00:01:15.680> I<00:01:15.860> don't

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
really excited to install this I don't

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.710 
really excited to install this I don't
think<00:01:16.220> I'm<00:01:16.369> gonna<00:01:16.460> video<00:01:16.759> myself<00:01:16.970> installing

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
think I'm gonna video myself installing

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.060 
think I'm gonna video myself installing
it<00:01:17.840> because<00:01:18.200> that's<00:01:18.380> gonna<00:01:18.500> take<00:01:18.680> a<00:01:18.740> long<00:01:18.860> time

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
it because that's gonna take a long time

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.590 
it because that's gonna take a long time
because<00:01:19.280> I've<00:01:19.430> never<00:01:19.460> done<00:01:19.729> this<00:01:19.910> before<00:01:20.180> and

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
because I've never done this before and

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.880 
because I've never done this before and
as<00:01:21.170> you<00:01:21.259> can<00:01:21.380> see<00:01:21.410> here's<00:01:21.649> the<00:01:21.709> actual

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
as you can see here's the actual

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.300 
as you can see here's the actual
processor<00:01:22.640> in<00:01:23.630> its<00:01:23.869> box<00:01:24.319> glorious<00:01:25.100> it's

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
processor in its box glorious it's

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.130 
processor in its box glorious it's
actually<00:01:25.580> really<00:01:25.789> small<00:01:26.149> video<00:01:26.750> I'm<00:01:26.990> not

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
actually really small video I'm not

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.900 
actually really small video I'm not
going<00:01:27.259> to<00:01:27.319> record<00:01:27.619> myself<00:01:27.770> because<00:01:28.700> if<00:01:28.819> it

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
going to record myself because if it

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.460 
going to record myself because if it
takes<00:01:29.060> too<00:01:29.149> long<00:01:29.179> to<00:01:29.330> edit<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:29.899> to<00:01:30.200> it<00:01:30.350> be<00:01:30.440> a

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
takes too long to edit and to it be a

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.809 
takes too long to edit and to it be a
super<00:01:30.770> long<00:01:30.860> video<00:01:31.130> of<00:01:31.190> me<00:01:31.310> installing<00:01:31.700> it

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:31.819 
super long video of me installing it

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:32.919 
super long video of me installing it
because<00:01:32.000> me<00:01:32.179> and<00:01:32.209> my<00:01:32.300> friend<00:01:32.509> are<00:01:32.599> learning

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
because me and my friend are learning

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:33.910 
because me and my friend are learning
how<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.080> do<00:01:33.200> it<00:01:33.319> we've<00:01:33.440> never<00:01:33.560> done<00:01:33.740> it<00:01:33.860> before

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
how to do it we've never done it before

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.980 
how to do it we've never done it before
so<00:01:34.340> there's<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.209> actual<00:01:35.420> processor<00:01:35.810> on<00:01:35.959> the

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
so there's the actual processor on the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.109 
so there's the actual processor on the
side<00:01:36.349> the<00:01:36.590> main<00:01:36.920> part<00:01:37.490> of<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.640> box<00:01:37.849> it's

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
side the main part of the box it's

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.779 
side the main part of the box it's
actually<00:01:38.330> really<00:01:38.450> heavy<00:01:38.690> is<00:01:38.899> the<00:01:39.590> cpu<00:01:40.310> cooler

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
actually really heavy is the cpu cooler

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:42.790 
actually really heavy is the cpu cooler
because<00:01:41.420> there's<00:01:41.690> a<00:01:41.750> cooler<00:01:42.140> inside<00:01:42.560> of<00:01:42.709> it

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
because there's a cooler inside of it

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.100 
because there's a cooler inside of it
too<00:01:42.979> of<00:01:43.280> course<00:01:43.520> cool<00:01:43.849> the<00:01:44.030> CPU<00:01:44.450> which<00:01:44.720> cpu

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
too of course cool the CPU which cpu

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.190 
too of course cool the CPU which cpu
means<00:01:45.380> processor<00:01:45.860> if<00:01:45.979> you<00:01:46.039> don't<00:01:46.190> know<00:01:46.340> that

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
means processor if you don't know that

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.219 
means processor if you don't know that
we're<00:01:48.200> go<00:01:48.259> ahead<00:01:48.380> open<00:01:48.590> her<00:01:48.800> up<00:01:49.119> and<00:01:50.119> okay<00:01:51.050> i

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
we're go ahead open her up and okay i

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.570 
we're go ahead open her up and okay i
have<00:01:51.410> some<00:01:51.590> trouble<00:01:51.770> here<00:01:51.920> opening<00:01:52.340> up<00:01:52.459> the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
feel when you open it and on the side

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.890 
feel when you open it and on the side
here<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.430> actual<00:02:26.760> expensive<00:02:27.270> part<00:02:27.510> is<00:02:27.720> what

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
here the actual expensive part is what

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.810 
here the actual expensive part is what
I'm<00:02:27.990> holding<00:02:28.170> which<00:02:28.470> is<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.650> computer<00:02:29.130> deceit

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
I'm holding which is a computer deceit

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.940 
I'm holding which is a computer deceit
at<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.150> computer<00:02:30.570> CPU<00:02:30.960> right<00:02:31.140> there<00:02:31.350> it's<00:02:31.890> a

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
at the computer CPU right there it's a

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.800 
at the computer CPU right there it's a
little<00:02:32.100> square<00:02:32.640> actually<00:02:33.090> but<00:02:33.240> it<00:02:33.330> does<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.480> lot

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
little square actually but it does a lot

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.460 
little square actually but it does a lot
of<00:02:33.870> stuff<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:35.030> it's<00:02:36.030> really<00:02:36.300> pretty<00:02:37.140> pretty

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
of stuff and it's really pretty pretty

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.410 
of stuff and it's really pretty pretty
cool<00:02:37.710> how<00:02:37.830> small<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.190> is<00:02:38.280> anyway<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.240> in<00:02:39.330> the

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
cool how small it is anyway and in the

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.320 
cool how small it is anyway and in the
big<00:02:39.630> box<00:02:39.840> inside<00:02:40.320> of<00:02:40.710> course<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.430> cpu

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
big box inside of course is the cpu

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.360 
big box inside of course is the cpu
cooler<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.080> that<00:02:43.680> there<00:02:43.920> is<00:02:44.070> just<00:02:44.250> some

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
cooler and that there is just some

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.530 
cooler and that there is just some
instructions<00:02:44.850> that<00:02:45.000> I'll<00:02:45.090> probably<00:02:45.270> never

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
instructions that I'll probably never

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.720 
instructions that I'll probably never
read<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:47.130> probably<00:02:47.340> caused<00:02:47.520> me<00:02:47.640> to

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
read and that probably caused me to

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.430 
read and that probably caused me to
break<00:02:47.850> it<00:02:48.030> but<00:02:48.150> whatever<00:02:48.390> i'm<00:02:48.870> gonna<00:02:49.110> watch

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
break it but whatever i'm gonna watch

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.880 
break it but whatever i'm gonna watch
some<00:02:49.680> videos<00:02:49.980> online<00:02:50.160> instead<00:02:50.820> anyway<00:02:51.780> so<00:02:52.680> as

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
some videos online instead anyway so as

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.200 
some videos online instead anyway so as
you<00:02:53.010> can<00:02:53.070> see<00:02:53.220> there's<00:02:53.460> like<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.760> little<00:02:53.970> fan

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
you can see there's like the little fan

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.000 
you can see there's like the little fan
on<00:02:54.450> top<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:54.960> it<00:02:55.020> that's<00:02:55.290> what<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:55.560> is<00:02:55.710> there

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
on top of it that's what that is there

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.070 
on top of it that's what that is there
i'm<00:02:56.610> gonna<00:02:56.760> open<00:02:57.120> her<00:02:57.240> up<00:02:57.270> here<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:57.660> just<00:02:57.900> take

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
i'm gonna open her up here and just take

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.180 
i'm gonna open her up here and just take
a<00:02:58.110> look<00:02:58.320> at<00:02:58.470> it<00:02:58.500> even<00:02:58.890> though<00:02:58.980> i'm<00:02:59.070> actually

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
a look at it even though i'm actually

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.950 
a look at it even though i'm actually
gonna<00:02:59.400> use<00:02:59.520> the<00:02:59.700> one<00:02:59.820> already<00:03:00.030> have<00:03:00.240> on<00:03:00.450> my<00:03:00.570> cpu

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
gonna use the one already have on my cpu

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.390 
gonna use the one already have on my cpu
because<00:03:01.410> it's<00:03:01.590> actually<00:03:01.710> I<00:03:01.890> think<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.220> better

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
because it's actually I think I better

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.880 
because it's actually I think I better
fan<00:03:02.760> than<00:03:03.030> this<00:03:03.120> one<00:03:03.360> my<00:03:04.350> friend<00:03:04.590> that<00:03:04.680> got<00:03:04.770> the

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
fan than this one my friend that got the

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.470 
fan than this one my friend that got the
same<00:03:05.010> processor<00:03:05.520> he's<00:03:05.730> actually<00:03:05.910> liquid

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
same processor he's actually liquid

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.770 
same processor he's actually liquid
cooling<00:03:06.810> his<00:03:07.050> but<00:03:07.440> I'm<00:03:07.680> going<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:08.280> go<00:03:08.370> with<00:03:08.400> the

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
cooling his but I'm going to go with the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.300 
cooling his but I'm going to go with the
old-fashioned<00:03:09.780> family<00:03:10.020> this<00:03:10.950> is<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.190> one

the one I have like I said I'm not going
to<00:03:14.100> use<00:03:14.190> it<00:03:14.220> so<00:03:14.370> pretty<00:03:14.730> cool<00:03:14.820> though<00:03:16.490> no<00:03:17.490> fan

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
to use it so pretty cool though no fan

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.050 
to use it so pretty cool though no fan
on<00:03:18.150> top<00:03:18.360> those<00:03:18.840> with<00:03:18.960> things<00:03:19.140> inside<00:03:19.440> or<00:03:19.620> clips

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
on top those with things inside or clips

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.100 
on top those with things inside or clips
spinning<00:03:21.060> it<00:03:21.150> around<00:03:21.180> there's<00:03:21.810> like<00:03:21.930> those

the<00:03:25.890> heat<00:03:26.310> out<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:26.730> there's<00:03:27.270> piping<00:03:27.690> on<00:03:27.810> the

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
the heat out and there's piping on the

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.900 
the heat out and there's piping on the
side<00:03:28.110> it<00:03:28.410> runs<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.800> heat<00:03:29.010> through<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.489> as<00:03:29.760> you

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
side it runs the heat through it as you

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.190 
side it runs the heat through it as you
can<00:03:30.030> see<00:03:30.150> there<00:03:30.360> it's<00:03:30.570> kind<00:03:30.720> of<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:30.840> bronze

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
can see there it's kind of a bronze

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.590 
can see there it's kind of a bronze
color<00:03:31.640> I'm<00:03:32.640> having<00:03:32.850> more<00:03:33.120> fun<00:03:33.180> just<00:03:33.570> playing
