00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.550
 It is from the side of the movie 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.729
 The actual market price is also a practice version 

00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:11.879
 It actually happened 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:13.940
 Nikkei average chart and 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.920
 It is made of eurozone leather 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.880
 It was strong 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.480
 It's a technique that comes out under certain rules, right? 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.180
 I want to tell you how it was actually 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.929
 I think 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:29.369
 It is the second half 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.730
 It is this scene It is 16,700 yen It breaks through to other schools It is around lol 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.740
 I considered it but 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.630
 Because it will be mar-de-6 chome and with 15,700 yen 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.900
 It will be wonderful 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.390
 It means that purchasing intention is high, but measures hand length this 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.740
 It has become 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.610
 It may be an urban rivalry last year, but the organization Hamas 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.250
 It becomes like this 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.020
 It is repurchase of adv 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.790
 Just as before 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.000
 Emo's width today 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.180
 Furthermore, the distribution of sales of bars in 10% 70 %% 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.740
 Each one can not make 16,200 yen 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.470
 That can not be 16,000 can not be 15,700 yen 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.330
 Will be 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.610
 In fact, I'm removing it more and more in the end 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.260
 Everything in Eco is buying back as expected 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.460
 There is a thing that 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.970
 Realization of 220,000 yen in front of egoma yen 70,10 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.750
 Previous work 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.800
 It means that it has become strong, so this can go 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.429
 I should not buy back but 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.810
 I received training and 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.860
 It's here 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.990
 In any case with apl we just make a positive profit 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.990
 We always aim at that 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.729
 The exchange rate of the Euro yen and the ruling party in English sounds like-x foreign exchange 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.230
 It has become 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.470
 Yes, this is what I say live from April to October 2008 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.610
 But 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.370
 It is 1234 work of effect well 67 It feels relieved with this 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.059
 Company employee 123 

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:12.289
 It became democrat 122 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:15.199
 It is the same as 7 days in middle of what I thought 

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:18.069
 I think of it from here to here 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.069
 It will be said 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:24.389
 Lol 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:28.229
 In case of special tie in parliament now, it is conservatory. 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:29.299
 When buying and selling 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:30.599
 It will be said 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.819
 If it is actually 130 yen, it is equivalent to 10,300,000 yen 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:35.320
 You 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.750
 It depends on whether you take a multiplayer because it is slightly different 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:41.910
 But still 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.480
 That the margin can be done with a fairly small amount of money 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.799
 Will be 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.140
 At a goal of 50% 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.569
 Total 10-15%-1.5% 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.829
 Henin defeats 70% of the target 30% 343 dedicated settlement 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:02.159
 Software for 37.2% compared with picture scroll imitation fortunately 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:05.989
 I mentioned earlier with points etc. 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.760
 The closer you are to the goal, the more you're going 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.529
 I think you should not contact 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:14.979
 It's not 54 here, but I'm doing 50 here first 

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:17.589
 100% example cultivation with less hits 

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:20.589
 I think it would be better to be released 

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:25.299
 The US doesn't spend much time 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.999
 First of all to talk about wanting to go to the station with the start here 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:31.139
 Our goal 172 out 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:36.569
 The pv assumption of esthetics is equivalent to 10% of 10% and 30% in this way 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.569
 But it is actually 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.569
 l106 people are planted without getting down a bit 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.469
 Just flip one wing and flip it 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:48.939
 Yes I want to lose because I have signed a goal 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:51.499
 Although withdrawal Masahiko foreign phase is the best 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:54.999
 It will be negative in the opposite way 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:00.639
 It's the final of the Denver team's practice but it looks like this 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.349
 is not it 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.759
 This is what I wrote in this book, but 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.250
 From 2006 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.140
 It is only until October 2009, but it is already before last finally 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.460
 Total realized revenue is now 21,221,000 units 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.570
 About 187,000 units were canceled from the position from that 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.439
 It is last month 

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:24.199
 It is in the dollar and yen because of its stability 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.250
 It was eco-friendly, but there is 329,000 yen same 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.389
 1,279,000 full of juice 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.159
 That is the Nikkei average 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:36.879
 Realized revenue is always positive every year, but 337 units 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:40.409
 If the position turns only isaf group 11% 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:44.330
 There is also a certain amount of shadows, but there aren't too many talks 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.050
 You 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.319
 Well still it's all about earning money 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:48.689
 Be able to 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:51.279
 Of course when we introduce air conditioner 

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:53.150
 This amount is 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.909
 It is a figure at the root of it 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:58.909
 s years ago perfect far far in the beginning 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:02.150
 2 Psychological field 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.400
 new mat 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.449
 In short 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:09.370
 I can not mind at all 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.050
 I want to do it on a monetary basis 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.090
 However, even if it dances, it is two ways Stork is 616 yen 63 yen 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.639
 Contributing to spring 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.080
 According to the three hundred fourteen yen 5 yen 5 yen 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.069
 I say 5.53 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:29.319
 Why are they so mistaken compared to riding items 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:30.370
 Is it not 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.150
 This is after all 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.240
 I do not do it in the calendar 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.710
 Incorrect 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.680
 For example, it is a good year to increase 600,000 people, so the calendar 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.199
 If you did 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:46.770
 The fact that scientific calculator with days excel can be done easily 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.349
 But of course there are calendars etc. 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:49.970
 But 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.560
 Calendar and so on 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.490
 Results 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.910
 So I'm calculating this for a long time and I have calculated dollar yen 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.110
 In the case of me I do in billions of months in 1973 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.559
 1730 

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:07.039

 What a floating exchange rate mark began but 

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:13.240
 It's from the same time 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.809
 We have a number of productions all 

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:17.119
 Therefore it is 

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:20.669
 In the case of tie, we adopt the one of floating market system transition 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.270
