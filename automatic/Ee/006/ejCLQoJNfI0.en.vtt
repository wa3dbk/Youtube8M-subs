00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
since we're cutting our lettuce

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.510 
since we're cutting our lettuce
frequently<00:01:34.479> we<00:01:35.200> really<00:01:35.560> need<00:01:35.860> to<00:01:36.040> feed<00:01:36.340> it

frequently<00:01:37.030> as<00:01:37.299> well<00:01:37.570> so<00:01:37.960> we're<00:01:38.170> feeding<00:01:38.500> with

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
frequently as well so we're feeding with

a seaweed spray in a hose end sprayer
about<00:01:42.100> every<00:01:42.369> two<00:01:42.610> weeks<00:01:42.990> we<00:01:43.990> do<00:01:44.140> have

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
about every two weeks we do have

problems with deer in our gardens here

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.800 
problems with deer in our gardens here
so<00:01:46.960> we<00:01:47.170> use<00:01:47.409> a<00:01:47.650> deer<00:01:48.549> netting<00:01:49.030> over<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:49.479> plants

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
so we use a deer netting over the plants

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.140 
so we use a deer netting over the plants
to<00:01:50.110> protect<00:01:50.500> them<00:01:50.710> we<00:01:51.189> make<00:01:51.400> hoops<00:01:51.729> out<00:01:52.030> of

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
to protect them we make hoops out of

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.630 
to protect them we make hoops out of
three-eighths<00:01:52.659> rebar<00:01:53.320> and<00:01:53.680> then<00:01:54.130> clip<00:01:54.610> the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
three-eighths rebar and then clip the

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.630 
three-eighths rebar and then clip the
deer<00:01:55.479> netting<00:01:55.900> to<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.350> hoops<00:01:56.619> with<00:01:57.250> a<00:01:57.280> small

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
deer netting to the hoops with a small

deer netting to the hoops with a small
spring<00:01:58.119> clamp<00:01:58.540> we<00:01:59.290> utilize<00:01:59.500> those<00:02:00.040> same<00:02:00.430> hoops

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
spring clamp we utilize those same hoops

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.450 
spring clamp we utilize those same hoops
for<00:02:01.240> our<00:02:01.360> row<00:02:01.630> cover<00:02:01.960> so<00:02:02.500> on<00:02:02.649> cold<00:02:02.950> nights<00:02:03.070> we

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
for our row cover so on cold nights we

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.179 
for our row cover so on cold nights we
use<00:02:03.610> a<00:02:03.640> lightweight<00:02:04.180> row<00:02:04.420> cover<00:02:04.720> and<00:02:04.960> on<00:02:05.259> much

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
use a lightweight row cover and on much

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.339 
use a lightweight row cover and on much
colder<00:02:06.520> nights<00:02:06.909> we'll<00:02:07.210> use<00:02:07.509> a<00:02:07.689> heavier<00:02:08.110> weight

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
colder nights we'll use a heavier weight

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.710 
colder nights we'll use a heavier weight
and<00:02:08.649> sometimes<00:02:09.250> we'll<00:02:09.489> use<00:02:09.729> both<00:02:10.060> row<00:02:10.329> covers

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
and sometimes we'll use both row covers

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.390 
and sometimes we'll use both row covers
if<00:02:10.899> it's<00:02:11.019> going<00:02:11.230> to<00:02:11.319> be<00:02:11.409> extremely<00:02:11.769> cold<00:02:12.159> and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
if it's going to be extremely cold and

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.699 
if it's going to be extremely cold and
just<00:02:12.819> connect<00:02:13.239> them<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.659> the<00:02:13.689> rebar<00:02:14.319> with<00:02:14.559> the

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
just connect them to the rebar with the

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.190 
just connect them to the rebar with the
same<00:02:14.950> spring<00:02:15.430> clamps<00:02:15.849> we're<00:02:16.629> not<00:02:16.779> growing

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
same spring clamps we're not growing

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.350 
same spring clamps we're not growing
lettuce<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:18.010> harvest<00:02:18.489> whole<00:02:18.790> head

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
lettuce to harvest whole head

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.750 
lettuce to harvest whole head
of<00:02:19.480> lettuce<00:02:19.840> although<00:02:20.110> you<00:02:20.170> could<00:02:20.560> do<00:02:20.830> that<00:02:21.070> we

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
of lettuce although you could do that we

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.390 
of lettuce although you could do that we
actually<00:02:22.000> plant<00:02:22.570> lettuce<00:02:22.870> in<00:02:23.380> October<00:02:24.070> and<00:02:24.220> we

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
actually plant lettuce in October and we

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.520 
actually plant lettuce in October and we
harvest<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:24.940> same<00:02:25.300> lettuce<00:02:25.720> plants<00:02:26.170> until

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
harvest the same lettuce plants until

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.580 
harvest the same lettuce plants until
March<00:02:26.920> weather<00:02:27.700> permitting<00:02:27.820> and<00:02:28.470> what<00:02:29.470> we're

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
March weather permitting and what we're

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.500 
March weather permitting and what we're
doing<00:02:29.620> is<00:02:29.950> taking<00:02:30.220> off<00:02:30.640> some<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.240> leaves

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
doing is taking off some of the leaves

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.720 
doing is taking off some of the leaves
around<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.230> base<00:02:32.440> of<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.740> plant<00:02:32.980> first<00:02:33.400> and

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
around the base of the plant first and

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.640 
around the base of the plant first and
then<00:02:34.150> as<00:02:34.240> the<00:02:34.360> plants<00:02:34.690> get<00:02:34.840> larger<00:02:35.200> we<00:02:35.350> cut<00:02:35.530> out

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
then as the plants get larger we cut out

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.350 
then as the plants get larger we cut out
the<00:02:35.830> Centers<00:02:36.160> of<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.370> plants<00:02:36.730> with<00:02:36.910> scissors

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
the Centers of the plants with scissors

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.960 
the Centers of the plants with scissors
so<00:02:38.080> we'll<00:02:38.320> just<00:02:38.590> cut<00:02:38.890> some<00:02:39.400> of<00:02:39.490> the<00:02:39.580> larger

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
so we'll just cut some of the larger

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.910 
so we'll just cut some of the larger
leaves<00:02:40.180> you<00:02:40.750> don't<00:02:40.900> want<00:02:41.020> to<00:02:41.080> over<00:02:41.350> harvest

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
leaves you don't want to over harvest

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.820 
leaves you don't want to over harvest
one<00:02:42.250> plant<00:02:42.700> so<00:02:43.240> make<00:02:43.840> sure<00:02:43.870> you<00:02:44.260> take<00:02:44.470> off<00:02:44.650> just

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
one plant so make sure you take off just

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.500 
one plant so make sure you take off just
a<00:02:45.040> few<00:02:45.280> leaves<00:02:45.490> off<00:02:45.790> of<00:02:45.820> each<00:02:46.240> plant<00:02:48.360> since<00:02:49.360> we

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
a few leaves off of each plant since we

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.720 
a few leaves off of each plant since we
planted<00:02:49.900> a<00:02:49.990> mixture<00:02:50.380> of<00:02:50.500> lettuces<00:02:51.190> together

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
planted a mixture of lettuces together

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.970 
planted a mixture of lettuces together
once<00:02:52.450> we<00:02:52.600> get<00:02:52.750> finished<00:02:53.110> with<00:02:53.230> cutting<00:02:53.650> half<00:02:53.830> a

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
once we get finished with cutting half a

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.680 
once we get finished with cutting half a
bed<00:02:54.130> we<00:02:54.340> got<00:02:54.490> a<00:02:54.550> beautiful<00:02:55.060> mix<00:02:55.209> in<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.540> bowl

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
bed we got a beautiful mix in the bowl

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:08.900 
bed we got a beautiful mix in the bowl
and<00:02:56.080> sometimes<00:02:56.500> I'll<00:02:56.680> just<00:02:56.830> break<00:02:57.070> these<00:02:57.310> off

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.610 

we<00:03:09.910> like<00:03:10.060> to<00:03:10.180> pick<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.510> lettuce<00:03:10.840> fresh<00:03:11.170> every

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
we like to pick the lettuce fresh every

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.040 
we like to pick the lettuce fresh every
morning<00:03:11.650> and<00:03:12.190> wash<00:03:13.060> it<00:03:13.300> and<00:03:13.450> then<00:03:13.600> it<00:03:13.750> served

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
morning and wash it and then it served

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.470 
morning and wash it and then it served
on<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.350> salad<00:03:14.709> bar<00:03:14.890> that<00:03:15.250> same<00:03:15.640> day<00:03:16.000> so<00:03:16.060> you

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
on the salad bar that same day so you

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.250 
on the salad bar that same day so you
can't<00:03:16.870> get<00:03:17.110> much<00:03:17.290> fresher<00:03:17.560> than<00:03:17.950> that
