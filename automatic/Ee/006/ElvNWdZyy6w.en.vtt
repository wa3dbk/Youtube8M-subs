something<00:02:11.279> you<00:02:11.430> can<00:02:11.579> get<00:02:11.760> void<00:02:12.150> pipe<00:02:12.480> avoid

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
something you can get void pipe avoid

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.410 
something you can get void pipe avoid
type<00:02:13.639> transport<00:02:14.639> pipe

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
type transport pipe

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.270 
type transport pipe
and<00:02:16.080> hook<00:02:16.380> that<00:02:16.440> on<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.280> side<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:19.280> then

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
and hook that on to the side and then

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.089 
and hook that on to the side and then
you<00:02:20.459> can<00:02:20.640> get<00:02:21.170> whatever<00:02:22.170> items<00:02:22.830> you<00:02:23.069> don't

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
you can get whatever items you don't

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.059 
you can get whatever items you don't
want<00:02:23.880> it<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.120> pick<00:02:24.330> up<00:02:24.540> like<00:02:25.500> if<00:02:25.770> you<00:02:25.980> don't

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
want it to pick up like if you don't

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.830 
want it to pick up like if you don't
want<00:02:26.370> Kabul<00:02:27.090> if<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.510> don't<00:02:27.690> want<00:02:27.810> your

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
want Kabul if you don't want your

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.040 
want Kabul if you don't want your
barrels<00:02:28.200> feel<00:02:28.410> Kabul<00:02:29.250> or<00:02:29.580> any<00:02:30.330> of<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.660> stuff

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
barrels feel Kabul or any of that stuff

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.360 
barrels feel Kabul or any of that stuff
just<00:02:32.060> do<00:02:33.060> what<00:02:33.239> I'm<00:02:33.360> doing<00:02:33.390> here<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:35.190> void

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
just do what I'm doing here so the void

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.190 
just do what I'm doing here so the void
pipe<00:02:35.640> basically<00:02:35.880> just<00:02:36.330> takes<00:02:36.569> things<00:02:36.840> and

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
pipe basically just takes things and

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.260 
pipe basically just takes things and
gets<00:02:37.500> rid<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.709> them<00:02:37.890> just<00:02:38.220> like<00:02:38.850> throwing

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
gets rid of them just like throwing

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.080 
gets rid of them just like throwing
stuff<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.660> lava<00:02:39.810> so<00:02:40.470> besides<00:02:40.950> blue<00:02:41.550> so<00:02:42.030> you

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
stuff and lava so besides blue so you

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.970 
stuff and lava so besides blue so you
want<00:02:42.360> it<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.540> go<00:02:42.690> through<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.019> blue<00:02:43.380> side<00:02:43.620> so

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
want it to go through the blue side so

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.309 
want it to go through the blue side so
we<00:02:44.069> can<00:02:44.220> put<00:02:44.400> this<00:02:44.580> dirt<00:02:44.880> on<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.269> blue<00:02:45.480> one<00:02:45.660> so

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
we can put this dirt on the blue one so

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.800 
we can put this dirt on the blue one so
now<00:02:46.470> any<00:02:46.739> dirt<00:02:47.069> that<00:02:47.580> will<00:02:48.300> go<00:02:48.450> through<00:02:48.720> the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
now any dirt that will go through the

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.400 
now any dirt that will go through the
pipe<00:02:49.550> through<00:02:50.550> this<00:02:50.670> pipe<00:02:51.000> will<00:02:51.870> go<00:02:52.050> into<00:02:52.260> the

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
pipe through this pipe will go into the

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.150 
pipe through this pipe will go into the
void<00:02:52.560> pipe<00:02:52.860> okay<00:02:53.780> cool<00:02:54.780> so<00:02:55.319> now<00:02:55.830> what<00:02:56.040> you're

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
void pipe okay cool so now what you're

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.620 
void pipe okay cool so now what you're
going<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.400> want<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.730> do<00:02:56.880> is<00:02:57.090> color<00:02:57.360> these

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
well so now both these ender chest on

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.819 
well so now both these ender chest on
same<00:03:21.090> so<00:03:21.329> when<00:03:21.480> I<00:03:21.600> open<00:03:21.959> one<00:03:22.109> you<00:03:22.320> can<00:03:22.440> see<00:03:22.470> that

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
same so when I open one you can see that

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.060 
same so when I open one you can see that

one opens too okay so now you're going
to<00:03:26.130> want<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.340> filter<00:03:26.640> and<00:03:27.060> I<00:03:27.269> think<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:28.170> have

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
to want to filter and I think you have

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.300 
to want to filter and I think you have
to<00:03:28.350> stay<00:03:28.769> in<00:03:28.920> like<00:03:29.160> this<00:03:29.579> and<00:03:29.970> place<00:03:30.480> it<00:03:30.720> down

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
to stay in like this and place it down

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.750 
to stay in like this and place it down
yeah<00:03:32.310> then<00:03:33.060> you<00:03:33.209> get<00:03:33.359> a<00:03:33.390> timer<00:03:34.370> hook<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.519> timer

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
yeah then you get a timer hook the timer

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.509 
yeah then you get a timer hook the timer
up<00:03:36.030> like<00:03:36.209> that<00:03:36.420> it's<00:03:37.350> good<00:03:37.620> at<00:03:37.739> two<00:03:37.920> seconds

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
up like that it's good at two seconds

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.170 
up like that it's good at two seconds
you<00:03:38.670> don't<00:03:38.850> have<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.150> change<00:03:39.420> it<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:41.090> let<00:03:42.090> me

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
you don't have to change it and let me

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.050 
you don't have to change it and let me

let's try this out I'm just going to use

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.280 
let's try this out I'm just going to use
this<00:06:08.340> because<00:06:08.520> this<00:06:08.820> is<00:06:09.150> one<00:06:09.600> of<00:06:09.630> the<00:06:09.780> fastest

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.290 
this because this is one of the fastest

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.630 
this because this is one of the fastest
things<00:06:10.590> there<00:06:10.920> is<00:06:10.950> oh<00:06:11.400> I<00:06:11.670> need<00:06:11.970> a<00:06:12.000> wrench

things there is oh I need a wrench
wrench<00:06:14.640> and<00:06:16.250> pow<00:06:17.420> okay<00:06:18.420> so<00:06:18.870> that<00:06:19.620> will<00:06:20.160> start

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
wrench and pow okay so that will start

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:26.420 
wrench and pow okay so that will start
to<00:06:21.000> build<00:06:23.840> okay<00:06:24.840> so<00:06:24.900> well<00:06:25.680> that's<00:06:25.920> building

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
to build okay so well that's building

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.280 
to build okay so well that's building
guess<00:06:27.150> there's<00:06:27.360> nothing<00:06:27.480> you<00:06:27.750> can<00:06:27.870> really<00:06:27.900> do

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
guess there's nothing you can really do

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.010 
guess there's nothing you can really do
that's<00:06:28.770> very<00:06:28.860> let<00:06:29.190> it<00:06:29.280> build<00:06:29.430> and<00:06:30.390> then<00:06:30.900> I'll

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
that's very let it build and then I'll

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.170 
that's very let it build and then I'll
start<00:06:31.290> go<00:06:31.470> really<00:06:31.950> fast<00:06:32.340> once<00:06:32.640> this<00:06:32.820> is<00:06:32.970> build

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
start go really fast once this is build

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.090 
start go really fast once this is build
this<00:06:33.360> is<00:06:33.540> probably<00:06:33.870> the<00:06:34.020> fastest<00:06:34.500> method<00:06:34.680> for

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.100 
this is probably the fastest method for

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.810 
this is probably the fastest method for
a<00:06:35.130> quarry<00:06:35.520> and<00:06:35.700> feed<00:06:35.910> the<00:06:36.030> beast<00:06:37.400> okay<00:06:38.400> so<00:06:38.460> as

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
a quarry and feed the beast okay so as

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:39.980 
a quarry and feed the beast okay so as
you<00:06:39.000> see<00:06:39.240> it's<00:06:39.480> just

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
you see it's just

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.920 
you see it's just
flying<00:06:40.890> and<00:06:41.340> all<00:06:41.730> you<00:06:42.210> can't<00:06:42.450> even<00:06:42.540> see<00:06:42.780> it<00:06:42.840> in

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:42.930 
flying and all you can't even see it in

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.330 
flying and all you can't even see it in
the<00:06:43.020> tube<00:06:43.200> but<00:06:43.350> all<00:06:43.500> the<00:06:43.650> dirt<00:06:43.830> in<00:06:43.980> there<00:06:44.190> is

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 
the tube but all the dirt in there is

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.600 
the tube but all the dirt in there is
going<00:06:45.030> out<00:06:45.600> through<00:06:46.170> the<00:06:46.230> void<00:06:46.500> pipe<00:06:46.910> and<00:06:48.470> yeah

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
going out through the void pipe and yeah

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.380 
going out through the void pipe and yeah
and<00:06:50.610> you<00:06:50.760> can<00:06:50.910> see<00:06:51.060> the<00:06:51.090> barrels<00:06:51.570> the<00:06:52.140> or<00:06:53.390> all

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:54.390 
and you can see the barrels the or all

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.650 
and you can see the barrels the or all
that<00:06:54.720> oops<00:06:54.960> I<00:06:55.200> did<00:06:55.920> it<00:06:55.950> wrong<00:06:56.190> so<00:06:56.640> this<00:06:56.880> lap<00:06:57.480> is

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 
that oops I did it wrong so this lap is

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.510 
that oops I did it wrong so this lap is
that<00:06:57.840> actually<00:06:58.260> not<00:06:58.770> going<00:06:59.040> to<00:06:59.100> go<00:06:59.220> in<00:06:59.370> there

00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 
that actually not going to go in there

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.480 
that actually not going to go in there
because<00:06:59.790> it's<00:06:59.940> not<00:07:00.090> an<00:07:00.240> or<00:07:00.540> but<00:07:01.200> all<00:07:01.830> the

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490 
because it's not an or but all the

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.030 
because it's not an or but all the
random<00:07:02.730> stuff<00:07:03.180> is<00:07:03.390> going<00:07:03.600> to<00:07:03.690> go<00:07:03.840> into<00:07:04.170> the

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:05.040 
random stuff is going to go into the

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.420 
random stuff is going to go into the
chest<00:07:06.170> so<00:07:07.170> I<00:07:07.200> think<00:07:07.350> that<00:07:07.710> just<00:07:07.740> about<00:07:08.070> wraps

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.430
