00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.670
 and that's ok 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.430
 It's good to take a quick boxing vote. 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.430
 here in my memories right? 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:33.300
 the processor has arrived in a size today 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:36.440
 and show that the open process in which 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.590
 the seller sent it in the 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.590
 motherboard 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:58.489
 he already came here without that paper inside 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:01:08.760
 of the kitchen is not common box is like it 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:11.640
 come here but at least there my 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:17.689
 processor that is one I know is going 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.689
 get to catch it but it's 17 37 70 ka 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:26.490
 ka ka shing ligia 1155 is not a 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.189
 processor anyone that box 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.189
 always the same does not make memory and tobago 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:51.670
 for who is sporting is not that the module 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:55.280
 memory of the people who sniper model 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:59.930
 18 g 24 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:08.660
 it has a tendency to series 9 999 24.5 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:09.950
 volts brothel where very nice but it is 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.150
 There is not much more to show there. 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.500
 one 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:21.010
 these memories that are sÃ£o paulo with 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:24.770
 my virgin soft by the way I 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:30.410
 I want it cheaper around 50 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.100
 so it is better for the 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.970
 rock 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.970
 if you put the memories is better 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:46.239
 make the cut in memories but hits a 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.930
 I decide to do it there then it's a 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:54.050
 problem I 'm guaranteed but that's it 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.750
 Then have a look at my 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:00.440
 mounted machine and is compatible with already 17 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:05.180
 67 there is also no deviation from the way I 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.100
 26 showed in a look here for more 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.510
 right there on my mounted machine that 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:13.640
 I'm going to do some culture tests. 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:17.590
 memory with 1kg current I got 1 7850 more 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.590
 that's it, that's ok
