what<00:03:36.010> I'm<00:03:36.099> saying<00:03:36.370> so<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:36.880> biggest<00:03:37.209> downfall

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
what I'm saying so the biggest downfall

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.539 
what I'm saying so the biggest downfall
mistake<00:03:37.989> I<00:03:38.200> see<00:03:38.230> is<00:03:38.650> that<00:03:38.799> people<00:03:39.160> set<00:03:39.370> these

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
mistake I see is that people set these

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.879 
mistake I see is that people set these
unrealistic<00:03:40.180> short-term<00:03:40.989> goals<00:03:41.319> that<00:03:41.859> are

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
also their long-term goal and they

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.059 
also their long-term goal and they
expect<00:03:43.989> to<00:03:44.109> see<00:03:44.260> those<00:03:44.440> results<00:03:44.590> happen

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.069 
expect to see those results happen
overnight<00:03:45.519> and<00:03:45.849> when<00:03:46.329> they<00:03:46.450> don't<00:03:46.660> they<00:03:46.810> give

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
overnight and when they don't they give

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.800 
overnight and when they don't they give
up<00:03:47.290> and<00:03:47.500> then<00:03:47.980> they<00:03:48.130> stop<00:03:48.430> bodybuilding<00:03:49.389> or

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
up and then they stop bodybuilding or
