dice<00:00:26.820> haven't<00:00:27.210> announced<00:00:27.420> what<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.349> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
dice haven't announced what this is the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.019 
dice haven't announced what this is the
this<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.220> first<00:00:29.460> time<00:00:29.760> I've<00:00:29.910> actually

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
this is the first time I've actually

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.139 
this is the first time I've actually
heard<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.750> gun<00:00:30.960> master<00:00:31.380> as<00:00:31.500> well<00:00:31.790> what<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:32.820> think

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
heard of gun master as well what I think

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.690 
heard of gun master as well what I think
it<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.630> think<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.950> gun<00:00:35.219> game<00:00:35.460> mode

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
it is I think that that is gun game mode

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.270 
it is I think that that is gun game mode
for<00:00:35.940> Barfield<00:00:36.719> three<00:00:36.989> if<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.010> don't<00:00:38.040> know

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
for Barfield three if you don't know

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.740 
for Barfield three if you don't know
what<00:00:38.399> gun<00:00:38.640> game<00:00:38.850> mode<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.510> was<00:00:39.719> a

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
what gun game mode is it was a

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.979 
what gun game mode is it was a
counter-strike<00:00:40.290> mod<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:41.670> was<00:00:41.989> released

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
counter-strike mod that was released

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.400 
counter-strike mod that was released
years<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.920> years<00:00:44.129> ago<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.450> idea<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:46.020> you

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
years and years ago and the idea is you

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.590 
years and years ago and the idea is you
go<00:00:46.770> through<00:00:46.800> all<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.670> weapons<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.390> get

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
go through all of the weapons so you get

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.060 
go through all of the weapons so you get
a<00:00:48.629> kill<00:00:48.870> with<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> weapon<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.739> then<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.920> gives

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
a kill with a weapon and then it gives

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.549 
a kill with a weapon and then it gives
you<00:00:50.190> another<00:00:50.460> weapon<00:00:50.719> until<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.840> get<00:00:52.020> down<00:00:52.230> to

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
you another weapon until you get down to

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.520 
you another weapon until you get down to
the<00:00:52.680> knife<00:00:53.539> whichever<00:00:54.539> player<00:00:54.809> gets<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
the knife whichever player gets the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.229 
the knife whichever player gets the
knife<00:00:55.739> kill<00:00:56.039> first<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.760> winner<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
knife kill first is the winner of the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.630 
knife kill first is the winner of the
round<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:58.590> cycle<00:00:59.219> through<00:00:59.250> all<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
round so you cycle through all the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.250 
round so you cycle through all the
weapons<00:01:00.059> do<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.210> get<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> knife<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.170> then

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
weapons do you get to the knife and then

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.579 
weapons do you get to the knife and then
boom<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.800> game's<00:01:02.039> over<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:03.260> you<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.439> play

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
boom the game's over and you can play

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.410 
boom the game's over and you can play
this<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:04.949> team<00:01:05.220> deathmatch<00:01:05.489> or<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.090> can<00:01:06.240> play

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
this in team deathmatch or you can play

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.100 
this in team deathmatch or you can play
in<00:01:06.570> free-for-all<00:01:07.110> mode<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.790> think<00:01:09.479> free

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
in free-for-all mode so I think free

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.530 
in free-for-all mode so I think free
floor<00:01:10.320> mode<00:01:10.560> probably<00:01:11.010> works<00:01:11.189> better<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.970> gun

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
floor mode probably works better in gun

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.030 
floor mode probably works better in gun
game<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.020> saw<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> plane<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.770> your<00:01:13.799> own

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
game so you saw a plane on your own

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.950 
game so you saw a plane on your own
rather<00:01:14.310> than<00:01:14.460> with<00:01:14.820> competing<00:01:15.360> against<00:01:15.780> your

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
rather than with competing against your

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.690 
rather than with competing against your
team<00:01:16.200> you're<00:01:16.439> literally<00:01:16.710> competing<00:01:17.280> against

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
team you're literally competing against

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.880 
team you're literally competing against
everyone<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.570> then<00:01:18.930> getting<00:01:19.229> both<00:01:19.350> April

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
everyone and then getting both April

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.359 
everyone and then getting both April
which<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.909> really<00:01:21.689> really<00:01:21.960> good<00:01:22.320> fun<00:01:22.560> gun<00:01:23.130> game

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
which is really really good fun gun game

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.039 
which is really really good fun gun game
Odie's<00:01:23.700> probably<00:01:24.030> one<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.180> my<00:01:24.330> favorite<00:01:24.840> game

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
Odie's probably one of my favorite game

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.830 
Odie's probably one of my favorite game
modes<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.470> multiplayer<00:01:25.979> gaming<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.689> if<00:01:27.689> you

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
modes and multiplayer gaming and if you

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.440 
modes and multiplayer gaming and if you
haven't<00:01:27.990> played<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.320> then<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.520> think<00:01:30.060> they<00:01:30.240> have

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
haven't played it then I think they have

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.210 
haven't played it then I think they have
it<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:31.009> black<00:01:32.009> ops<00:01:32.310> as<00:01:32.850> well<00:01:33.799> but<00:01:34.799> if<00:01:35.009> you've

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
it in black ops as well but if you've

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.770 
it in black ops as well but if you've
got<00:01:35.250> counter-strike<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.390> counter-strike

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
got counter-strike of counter-strike

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.499 
got counter-strike of counter-strike
sauce<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.470> can<00:01:37.500> play<00:01:37.799> in<00:01:37.950> there<00:01:38.189> as<00:01:38.700> well<00:01:39.000> it

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
sauce you can play in there as well it

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.230 
sauce you can play in there as well it
was<00:01:39.630> actually<00:01:39.900> accounts<00:01:40.470> like<00:01:40.619> mod<00:01:40.829> first<00:01:41.240> so

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
was actually accounts like mod first so

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.600 
was actually accounts like mod first so
yeah<00:01:42.540> gun<00:01:42.869> game<00:01:43.079> mode<00:01:43.290> but<00:01:43.799> possibly<00:01:44.310> in

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
yeah gun game mode but possibly in

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.569 
yeah gun game mode but possibly in
battlefield<00:01:45.390> 3<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.530> really<00:01:47.100> really<00:01:47.430> like

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
battlefield 3 and I really really like

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.850 
battlefield 3 and I really really like
the<00:01:47.729> sound<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:49.229> throws<00:01:49.409> up<00:01:49.649> some

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
the sound of that and it throws up some

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.319 
the sound of that and it throws up some
questions<00:01:50.070> though<00:01:50.520> because<00:01:50.880> there<00:01:51.060> are<00:01:51.180> like

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
questions though because there are like

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.219 
questions though because there are like
70<00:01:52.250> to<00:01:53.250> 73<00:01:53.970> weapons<00:01:54.540> in<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.840> game<00:01:54.990> at<00:01:55.140> the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
70 to 73 weapons in the game at the

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.270 
70 to 73 weapons in the game at the
moment<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.680> course<00:01:55.799> there's<00:01:56.040> going<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.219> be

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
moment of course there's going to be

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.270 
moment of course there's going to be
more<00:01:56.549> when<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.850> DLC<00:01:57.299> comes<00:01:57.540> out<00:01:57.689> as<00:01:57.869> well<00:01:58.280> so

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
more when the DLC comes out as well so

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.490 
more when the DLC comes out as well so
I'm<00:01:59.610> not<00:02:00.030> sure<00:02:00.240> if<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.719> good<00:02:01.079> game<00:02:01.290> mode

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
I'm not sure if it is good game mode

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.080 
I'm not sure if it is good game mode
would<00:02:01.710> they<00:02:01.920> go<00:02:02.130> through<00:02:02.430> all<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.790> those

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
would they go through all of those

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.330 
would they go through all of those
weapons<00:02:03.360> or<00:02:04.140> would<00:02:04.409> they<00:02:04.560> select<00:02:04.950> from<00:02:05.130> like<00:02:05.310> a

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
weapons or would they select from like a

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.660 
weapons or would they select from like a
pool<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.700> say<00:02:06.149> 30<00:02:06.540> weapons<00:02:07.079> because<00:02:07.979> if<00:02:08.489> you

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
pool of say 30 weapons because if you

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.660 
pool of say 30 weapons because if you
went<00:02:08.819> through<00:02:08.910> 70s

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
went through 70s

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.240 
went through 70s
that<00:02:09.880> would<00:02:10.000> take<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.209> long<00:02:10.420> time<00:02:10.479> maybe<00:02:11.470> it's

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
that would take a long time maybe it's

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.620 
that would take a long time maybe it's
good<00:02:12.459> it's<00:02:12.640> going<00:02:12.880> to<00:02:13.000> be<00:02:13.090> like<00:02:13.240> a<00:02:13.270> server

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
good it's going to be like a server

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.460 
good it's going to be like a server
setting<00:02:14.110> so<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:15.819> admin<00:02:16.150> can<00:02:16.480> pick<00:02:16.810> how<00:02:17.440> many

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
setting so the admin can pick how many

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.339 
setting so the admin can pick how many
weapons<00:02:17.830> he<00:02:18.160> wants<00:02:18.430> in<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.640> game<00:02:18.849> and<00:02:19.349> yeah

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
weapons he wants in the game and yeah

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.410 
weapons he wants in the game and yeah
maybe<00:02:20.709> it<00:02:20.920> maybe<00:02:21.580> it<00:02:21.730> would<00:02:21.819> work<00:02:21.849> better<00:02:22.300> that

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
maybe it maybe it would work better that

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.020 
maybe it maybe it would work better that
way<00:02:22.890> but<00:02:23.890> either<00:02:24.010> way<00:02:24.190> I'm<00:02:24.400> pretty<00:02:24.670> excited

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
way but either way I'm pretty excited

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.729 
way but either way I'm pretty excited
for<00:02:25.360> that<00:02:25.510> I<00:02:25.660> think<00:02:25.900> gun<00:02:26.110> game<00:02:26.319> mode<00:02:26.530> is

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
for that I think gun game mode is

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.130 
for that I think gun game mode is
fantastic<00:02:27.520> and<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:27.760> would<00:02:27.850> be<00:02:28.000> brilliant<00:02:28.209> in

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
fantastic and it would be brilliant in

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.820 
fantastic and it would be brilliant in
battlefield<00:02:29.620> 3<00:02:29.709> and<00:02:30.220> also<00:02:31.209> it<00:02:31.870> throws<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.319> is

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
battlefield 3 and also it throws a is

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.530 
battlefield 3 and also it throws a is
there<00:02:33.190> gonna<00:02:33.310> be<00:02:33.430> free-for-all<00:02:34.090> deathmatch

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
there gonna be free-for-all deathmatch

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.509 
there gonna be free-for-all deathmatch
mode<00:02:34.810> now<00:02:35.020> in<00:02:35.170> battlefield<00:02:35.590> 3<00:02:35.620> because<00:02:36.400> if

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
mode now in battlefield 3 because if

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.910 
mode now in battlefield 3 because if
they<00:02:36.640> have<00:02:36.760> free-for-all<00:02:37.300> gun<00:02:37.630> game<00:02:37.900> why<00:02:38.890> not

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
they have free-for-all gun game why not

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.660 
they have free-for-all gun game why not
have<00:02:39.280> free<00:02:39.519> fall<00:02:39.790> deathmatch<00:02:40.660> as<00:02:41.110> well<00:02:41.319> and

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
have free fall deathmatch as well and

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.570 
have free fall deathmatch as well and
free<00:02:42.670> fall<00:02:42.880> deathmatch<00:02:43.300> is<00:02:43.600> really<00:02:43.930> fun<00:02:44.580> it's

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
free fall deathmatch is really fun it's

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.009 
free fall deathmatch is really fun it's
something<00:02:45.730> that<00:02:46.000> battlefield<00:02:46.390> 3<00:02:46.600> doesn't

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
something that battlefield 3 doesn't

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.059 
something that battlefield 3 doesn't
have<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.970> doesn't<00:02:49.299> need<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:49.540> but<00:02:50.319> it<00:02:50.890> would

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
have and it doesn't need it but it would

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.710 
have and it doesn't need it but it would
just<00:02:51.100> be<00:02:51.370> a<00:02:51.400> nice<00:02:51.580> little<00:02:51.760> extra<00:02:52.180> choice<00:02:52.360> for

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
just be a nice little extra choice for

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.270 
just be a nice little extra choice for
for<00:02:53.290> those<00:02:53.410> players<00:02:53.650> that<00:02:53.890> really<00:02:53.920> like

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
for those players that really like

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.660 
for those players that really like
playing<00:02:54.459> deathmatch<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.890> tend<00:02:56.890> to<00:02:56.980> stay<00:02:57.640> away

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
playing deathmatch and tend to stay away

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.240 
playing deathmatch and tend to stay away
from<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.269> conquest<00:02:58.750> of<00:02:58.840> rush<00:02:59.049> game<00:02:59.319> types<00:02:59.620> so

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
from the conquest of rush game types so

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.059 
from the conquest of rush game types so
