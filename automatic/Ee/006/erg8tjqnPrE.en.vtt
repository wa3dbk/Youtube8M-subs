00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.540 
what can happen when you get on the
floor<00:01:00.480> personally<00:01:01.440> I'm<00:01:01.649> most<00:01:02.100> excited<00:01:02.219> for

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
floor personally I'm most excited for

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.609 
floor personally I'm most excited for
bars<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.239> confident<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:04.140> always<00:01:04.409> been

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
bars and confident that it's always been

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.010 
bars and confident that it's always been
my<00:01:04.799> favorite<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.549> I've<00:01:06.119> always<00:01:06.299> had<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.720> lot<00:01:06.990> of

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
my favorite and I've always had a lot of

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.320 
my favorite and I've always had a lot of
confidence<00:01:07.380> on<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.799> event<00:01:08.130> but<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.760> think<00:01:09.180> as

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
confidence on that event but I think as

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.109 
confidence on that event but I think as
a<00:01:09.360> team<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:09.810> think<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.590> most<00:01:11.520> confident<00:01:12.060> i'd

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
a team I think a most confident i'd

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.670 
a team I think a most confident i'd
probably<00:01:12.420> say<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.780> most<00:01:13.110> coming<00:01:13.380> down<00:01:13.470> bars

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
probably say the most coming down bars

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.850 
probably say the most coming down bars
too<00:01:13.920> i<00:01:14.100> think<00:01:14.310> typically<00:01:15.200> UCLA<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.320> known<00:01:16.530> for

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
too i think typically UCLA is known for

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.130 
too i think typically UCLA is known for
floor<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.759> our<00:01:17.909> floor<00:01:18.210> performance<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.049> our

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
floor and our floor performance and our

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.260 
floor and our floor performance and our
dance<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.680> choreography<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.520> as<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.909> team<00:01:21.240> I

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
dance and choreography so as a team I

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.450 
dance and choreography so as a team I
think<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.930> we<00:01:22.439> kind<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.740> let<00:01:22.979> loose<00:01:23.009> and

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
think that we kind of let loose and

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.020 
think that we kind of let loose and
enjoy<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.630> most<00:01:24.869> on<00:01:25.200> floor<00:01:25.619> but<00:01:26.280> my<00:01:26.700> favorite

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
enjoy the most on floor but my favorite

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.030 
enjoy the most on floor but my favorite
event<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.330> being<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.049> will<00:01:28.409> always<00:01:28.680> look

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.010 
event and you know people of saying that
we<00:01:38.820> struggled<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.299> beam<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.630> past<00:01:39.840> couple

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
we struggled on beam in the past couple

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.270 
we struggled on beam in the past couple
years<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.500> don't<00:01:40.710> think<00:01:40.890> that's<00:01:41.009> going<00:01:41.220> to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
years but I don't think that's going to

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.859 
years but I don't think that's going to
be<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.460> problem<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.939> year<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.420> just<00:01:42.689> think

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
be a problem this year and I just think

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.050 
be a problem this year and I just think
we're<00:01:43.079> we're<00:01:43.530> ready<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.860> all<00:01:43.979> four<00:01:44.189> events<00:01:44.310> we

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
we're we're ready on all four events we

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.910 
we're we're ready on all four events we
have<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.450> much<00:01:45.600> potential<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.170> all<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.590> events

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.770 
have so much potential in all the events
that<00:01:47.040> I'm<00:01:47.189> not<00:01:47.610> sure<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:47.970> we've<00:01:48.090> shown<00:01:48.420> yet

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
that I'm not sure that we've shown yet

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.149 
that I'm not sure that we've shown yet
in<00:01:49.049> our<00:01:49.229> events<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.340> get<00:01:50.850> more<00:01:52.159> adrenaline
