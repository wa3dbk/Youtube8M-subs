00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
pains to point out that this means it

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.410 
pains to point out that this means it
doesn't<00:00:37.680> cross<00:00:38.070> unfriendly<00:00:38.700> borders<00:00:39.120> which

doesn't cross unfriendly borders which

doesn't cross unfriendly borders which
of<00:00:39.629> course<00:00:39.660> was<00:00:40.020> what<00:00:40.170> Gary<00:00:40.410> Powers<00:00:40.649> have<00:00:40.860> done

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
of course was what Gary Powers have done

instead<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.450> TR<00:00:42.750> 1a<00:00:42.960> uses<00:00:43.410> its<00:00:43.559> altitude

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
instead the TR 1a uses its altitude

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.549 
instead the TR 1a uses its altitude
about<00:00:44.399> 70,000<00:00:45.270> feet<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.930> look<00:00:46.110> into<00:00:46.440> an

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
about 70,000 feet to look into an

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.459 
about 70,000 feet to look into an
unfriendly<00:00:47.039> country<00:00:47.489> from<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.789> outside<00:00:48.469> but

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
unfriendly country from the outside but

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.869 
unfriendly country from the outside but
it's<00:00:49.620> similar<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.129> u2<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.760> it's

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
it's similar to the u2 in that it's

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.819 
it's similar to the u2 in that it's
really<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.180> big<00:00:51.420> glider<00:00:51.780> with<00:00:52.320> an<00:00:52.410> engine<00:00:52.710> to

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
really a big glider with an engine to

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.470 
really a big glider with an engine to
get<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.010> up<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.160> height<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.940> like<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> glider

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
get it up to height and like a glider

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.080 
get it up to height and like a glider
it's<00:00:55.050> only<00:00:55.230> got<00:00:55.440> two<00:00:55.739> wheels<00:00:56.070> both<00:00:56.820> on<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
it's only got two wheels both on the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.680 
it's only got two wheels both on the
fuselage<00:00:57.480> centerline

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.930 

when<00:01:02.260> it<00:01:02.379> takes<00:01:02.559> off<00:01:02.769> it<00:01:03.280> has<00:01:03.399> another<00:01:03.640> little

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
when it takes off it has another little

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.399 
when it takes off it has another little
wheel<00:01:04.089> under<00:01:04.390> each<00:01:04.510> wing<00:01:04.540> but<00:01:05.019> it<00:01:05.110> leaves<00:01:05.260> them

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
wheel under each wing but it leaves them

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.950 
wheel under each wing but it leaves them
on<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:05.650> runway<00:01:05.979> so<00:01:06.360> what<00:01:07.360> does<00:01:07.450> it<00:01:07.540> do<00:01:07.690> when<00:01:07.720> it

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
on the runway so what does it do when it

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.289 
on the runway so what does it do when it
lands<00:01:08.350> well<00:01:09.310> there<00:01:09.790> has<00:01:09.880> to<00:01:10.000> be<00:01:10.030> a<00:01:10.119> lot<00:01:10.270> of

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
lands well there has to be a lot of

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:39.030 
lands well there has to be a lot of
rushing<00:01:10.690> about<00:01:10.810> by<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.259> ground<00:01:11.560> crew

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.590 

and<00:01:40.040> there<00:01:40.400> they<00:01:40.430> are<00:01:40.700> fixing<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.360> little

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
and there they are fixing the little

00:01:41.600 --> 00:02:14.180 
and there they are fixing the little
wheels<00:01:41.840> on<00:01:42.110> again

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.860 

now<00:02:14.730> you'd<00:02:14.880> think<00:02:15.090> wouldn't<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:15.750> in

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
now you'd think wouldn't you that in

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.600 
now you'd think wouldn't you that in
their<00:02:16.050> world<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.500> amazing<00:02:17.040> sophistication

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
their world of amazing sophistication

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.370 
their world of amazing sophistication
the<00:02:18.030> Americans<00:02:18.420> would<00:02:18.570> have<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.750> slightly<00:02:19.080> less

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
the Americans would have a slightly less

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:42.210 
the Americans would have a slightly less
comical<00:02:19.920> way<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.190> doing<00:02:20.460> this

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.360 

so<00:02:42.910> rushing<00:02:43.660> about<00:02:43.750> complete<00:02:44.320> now<00:02:44.860> he<00:02:44.920> can<00:02:45.220> get

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
so rushing about complete now he can get

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.880 
so rushing about complete now he can get
clear<00:02:45.640> of<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.850> runway

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.010 

in<00:02:51.400> fact<00:02:51.640> you<00:02:51.790> can<00:02:51.940> see<00:02:52.150> there<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.540> other<00:02:52.720> main

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
in fact you can see there the other main

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.440 
in fact you can see there the other main
difference<00:02:53.470> between<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.130> u2<00:02:54.640> and<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:54.910> TR<00:02:55.209> one

difference between the u2 and the TR one

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.260 
difference between the u2 and the TR one
a<00:02:55.569> those<00:02:56.530> great<00:02:56.860> pods<00:02:57.280> under<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.760> wings<00:02:57.940> are

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
a those great pods under the wings are

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.870 
a those great pods under the wings are
packed<00:02:58.690> with<00:02:58.870> reconnaissance<00:02:59.290> sensors<00:02:59.980> but

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
packed with reconnaissance sensors but

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.820 
packed with reconnaissance sensors but
more<00:03:01.060> than<00:03:01.120> that<00:03:01.270> the<00:03:01.600> USAF<00:03:02.290> doesn't<00:03:02.590> want<00:03:02.709> to

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
more than that the USAF doesn't want to

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:27.660 
more than that the USAF doesn't want to
say<00:03:03.010> about<00:03:03.160> them

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.180 

but<00:03:28.209> that's<00:03:28.360> drawback<00:03:28.990> from<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.560> murky<00:03:29.800> world

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
but that's drawback from the murky world

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.540 
but that's drawback from the murky world
