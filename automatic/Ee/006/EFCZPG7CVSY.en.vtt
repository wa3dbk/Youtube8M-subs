I<00:00:38.970> built<00:00:39.970> the<00:00:40.090> studio<00:00:40.450> here<00:00:40.750> about<00:00:40.989> four<00:00:41.290> years

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
I built the studio here about four years

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.740 
I built the studio here about four years
ago<00:00:41.650> because<00:00:42.309> increasingly<00:00:43.210> I<00:00:43.330> would<00:00:43.600> get

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
ago because increasingly I would get

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.540 
ago because increasingly I would get
phone<00:00:43.930> calls<00:00:43.989> from<00:00:44.440> people<00:00:44.590> saying<00:00:44.800> can<00:00:45.520> you

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
phone calls from people saying can you

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.369 
phone calls from people saying can you
play<00:00:45.820> on<00:00:45.910> our<00:00:46.059> record<00:00:46.420> and<00:00:46.629> then<00:00:47.080> they<00:00:47.230> would

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
play on our record and then they would

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.410 
play on our record and then they would
follow<00:00:47.500> that<00:00:47.770> up<00:00:47.890> with<00:00:48.100> do<00:00:48.640> you<00:00:48.670> have<00:00:48.820> a<00:00:48.970> studio

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
follow that up with do you have a studio

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.180 
follow that up with do you have a studio
and<00:00:49.780> I<00:00:50.110> realized<00:00:50.470> at<00:00:50.620> that<00:00:50.680> point<00:00:50.770> with

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
and I realized at that point with

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.700 
and I realized at that point with
people's<00:00:51.550> budget<00:00:52.000> shrinking<00:00:52.540> that<00:00:52.840> setting

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
people's budget shrinking that setting

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.080 
people's budget shrinking that setting
up<00:00:53.770> my<00:00:53.920> own<00:00:54.040> studio<00:00:54.430> and<00:00:54.520> being<00:00:54.879> able<00:00:54.970> to

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
up my own studio and being able to

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.840 
up my own studio and being able to
record<00:00:55.479> from<00:00:55.690> my<00:00:55.839> own<00:00:55.960> space<00:00:56.199> would<00:00:56.500> be<00:00:56.680> a<00:00:57.309> good

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
record from my own space would be a good

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.259 
record from my own space would be a good
practical<00:00:58.300> thing<00:00:58.449> to<00:00:58.479> do<00:01:02.460> after<00:01:03.460> about<00:01:03.940> a<00:01:04.210> year

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
practical thing to do after about a year

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.030 
practical thing to do after about a year
of<00:01:04.540> recording<00:01:05.140> I<00:01:05.199> decided<00:01:05.590> that<00:01:05.740> I<00:01:05.920> really

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
of recording I decided that I really

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.920 
of recording I decided that I really
needed<00:01:06.340> to<00:01:06.729> upgrade<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:07.210> mic<00:01:07.390> freeze<00:01:07.630> in<00:01:07.810> my

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
needed to upgrade the mic freeze in my

needed to upgrade the mic freeze in my
studio<00:01:08.380> I<00:01:08.710> looked<00:01:09.370> online<00:01:09.580> to<00:01:10.000> try<00:01:10.210> and<00:01:10.299> get

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420
