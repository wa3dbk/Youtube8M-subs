00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.400
 welcome to the metabolism tv your source 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.970
 of correct information about the 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.610
 metabolism and health the eggs and the 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.220
 salmonella and ositrán suárez specialist 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.509
 in good obesity we have a friend here 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.180
 in metabolism tv that makes us a 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.850
 question is the friend Lazarus is 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.850
 asking the following says hey frank 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.980
 to my shake talking about the smoothies 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.649
 mexico they say liquefied to my shake 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.159
 I made him one or two eggs 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:49.399
 raw what is your opinion about consuming 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:52.370
 raw egg since they say it can give 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:55.300
 Salmonella, well, let's answer 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.829
 this to the friend this 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.329
 and let's start by saying that it's the 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:04.269
 Salmonella Salmonella is a bacterium 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.550
 is a bacterium that is very infectious and 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.680
 can kill a person 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.270
 you have all heard in the press or in 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.640
 radio on television have seen that it has 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:17.020
 there were Salmonella infections is not 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.280
 very associated with egg chicken and that 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.310
 kind of food but you can also 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.200
 pass in meats that are semi-raw or 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.229
 meats that have not been well frozen or 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.110
 well maintained in a clean environment 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.300
 that is free of bacteria I'm going to 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.060
 teach here in an image 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.369
 for example this an image of the 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.640
 Salmonella bacteria 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.550
 there is the bacterium 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.430
 and it's a bacterium that is very infectious 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.100
 so it's something that when the 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.150
 body 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.460
 It tends to irritate the body and 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.850
 dehydrate what and can the person up 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.580
 will begin to lose blood because it is 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.350
 pretty infectious look how 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.119
 that the human body defends itself from 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.500
 bacteria is that when you consume 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:09.350
 something the stomach acids destroys 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.789
 that bacterium or that the acids of the 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.610
 stomach plus they help you 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.890
 digest have the function that you 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.930
 they help as a barrier to protection 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.640
 the bacteria does not penetrate or that all 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.600
 bacteria that tries to pass through 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:26.300
 the food is going to be annihilated dead 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.470
 cleaned by stomach acids 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.200
 people who have digestive problems 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.700
 that do not produce enough acid 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.459
 may have infection problems with 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.019
 ease because digestion has two 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.459
 purposes once I said the 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.350
 food the other is that it protects from the 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.390
 entrance of the bacteria because the acid 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.060
 of the stomach the hydrofluoric acid is a 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.370
 deadly acid for the bacteria then 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.130
 since they see the bacteria we are going to talk a 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.930
 moment of the egg theme that we 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.590
 Ask the friend about the egg 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.550
 right here you have the egg 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.060
 look for an egg 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.890
 it's a perfect protein there are few 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.230
 proteins as perfect as the egg of 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.710
 made the American health department 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.740
 the department of agriculture sorry 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.570
 American uses the egg as the 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.950
 perfect protein to compare all 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.810
 the proteins that is when they are 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.000
 comparing any protein within the 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.190
 American nutritional system are 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.350
 comparing against the egg because there is 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.940
 no more than the complete protein 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.310
 egg think that an egg is so and so 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.900
 complete has so many vitamins and 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.640
 vitamin b12 has everything you need 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.550
 to see what a chicken did 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.270
 complete that is something self contained and 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.370
 It is completely complete 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.050
 in my book the power of metabolism go 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.520
 to see that I'm talking a lot about not 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.380
 there is no problem with the egg 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.970
 have cholesterol because cholesterol 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.210
 that the egg has cholesterol 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.210
 well it's not the bad one so eat eggs 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.530
 and there are studies that reflect it there in 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.840
 study for example that reflects that a 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.780
 person eats 14 eggs a week 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.900
 for a total of 14 weeks and the 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.060
 cholesterol does not rise this in fact 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.580
 would go up a lot if you combine it with 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.830
 bread or flour but if egg 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.690
 your cholesterol does not rise because egg 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.860
 which contains good cholesterol 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.650
 that is, the egg afterwards is a 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.510
 good protein but there is always the 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.790
 risk that if a person who is 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:22.140
 throwing a raw egg to a shake to a 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:26.370
 liquefied then really if you do not know the 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:30.750
 source of that egg the shell of the egg 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:34.440
 the shell can be infected by the 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.240
 Salmonella this if you know where 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.010
 their eggs come if they are of origin 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.760
 organic if it 's from a farm that you 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.500
 know where there is not much manipulation 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.300
 nor opportunities for it to be contaminated by 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.980
 you have no problem but I do not 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.050
 I would recommend a person who buying 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.450
 eggs wherever you lay eggs 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.210
 raw in his smoothie in his shake because 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.970
 if you can get infected with salmonella 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.889
 salmonella after entering if the 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.139
 stomach not stomach acid not 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.849
 manages to destroy it then it is a 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:06.360
 quite severe infection for example in 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:09.979
 USA are reported on average as a few 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:13.160
 142 thousand Salmonella infections per year 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:16.500
 luckily those do not die most 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.449
 die like 30 people in all of us the 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.030
 statistic is that they die like 30 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:23.430
 people a year although there are 142 thousand 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.680
 infections however you want it to be 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.570
 of the raw egg if you do not know the 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.490
 origin of that egg and the handling that 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:33.419
 He has given it to him because he can have something of 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:37.380
 danger but as such yes if the egg 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:41.490
 they cook it if it's fried and what 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:43.620
 salmonella boils does not survive the 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.389
 heat Salmonella can survive the 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.190
 cold that is a bacterium that 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.919
 it exists it puts it to the freezer to the freezer 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.300
 to the fridge because if you survive it and the 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:54.270
 Samana would still be alive and kicking 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:57.870
 there but if it heats up especially if 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:01.290
 heat for 30 or 40 minutes 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:04.020
 dies so if it's raw egg must 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:06.300
 be careful and know where that comes from 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.830
 egg and if it's being manipulated 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.630
 correctly so that you can 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.030
 throw and do not run danger by lying on your 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.040
 liquefied and this is what we discussed because 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.670
 the egg is a protein but the truth 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.670
 always triumphs
