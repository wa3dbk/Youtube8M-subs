I do tune in for the Japanese one but I

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.810 
I do tune in for the Japanese one but I
just<00:05:32.440> I'm<00:05:32.680> really<00:05:32.740> used<00:05:33.280> to<00:05:33.400> hearing<00:05:33.580> it<00:05:33.760> in

English<00:05:34.210> now<00:05:34.360> and<00:05:34.630> I<00:05:34.660> think<00:05:34.840> the<00:05:34.960> voice<00:05:35.080> actors

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470

have<00:05:35.620> really<00:05:35.890> found<00:05:36.040> their<00:05:36.280> place<00:05:36.430> and<00:05:36.910> I
