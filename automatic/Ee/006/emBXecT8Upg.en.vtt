00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.090
 minimalism yellow day 14 and 15 word 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.740
 summarized and that is that that 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.960
 Everything here once fourteen or fifteen 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.940
 parts and I go now halfway 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.279
 quickly through the 7 5 lipsticks the 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.480
 I either bought one or something 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.890
 are you doing here from my mother me 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.930
 come after you do not give her the color 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.090
 celebrated or so I'm even at all 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.529
 no lipstick lipstick type looks 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.320
 terrible with me I hate too 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.140
 lips and it is also very rare that 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.570
 Minister someone else likes 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.329
 lipsticks is simply nothing here 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.579
 then you should nail the pen white one 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.930
 Under Gnadenwald it makes you 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.230
 it has the skin on that but that's it 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.160
 also is total humbug 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.420
 These are the little pencils that I have 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.699
 sometime in the course of years 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.469
 have accumulated and all but not 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.449
 reasonable malawi know that for sure 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.930
 The woman among you would have such a thing 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.910
 a pen and the man not at all 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.739

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.739
 or you do not see this at all and 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.580

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.259

 So that as a manager, that's it 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.070
 gold powder that is almost full 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.540

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:18.190
 So blue so not my color 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:19.690

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:33.700
 but only the beautiful color is me 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:36.459
 not here eatgeld bright yellow tone that 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.570
 Parrots look just like us here 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:43.720
 in this bright jacket the limes 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:47.170
 Green Whatever is here is easy 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:51.299
 knows as a highlight but will 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.530
 never is a cream metal extreme 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.600
 do not know that the customers on each 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.120
 fall off that is awful out of the 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.100
 eye is so very scary then 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.310
 here is an orange yes you can tell 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:06.450
 have times his colors experimented but 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:10.090
 A hand on making is really great 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.350
 orange is also hardly used to me 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.269
 not that great so I'm just so 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:17.079
 So red doors bright red that I find 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:19.180
 really great as accents but the active ones 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:22.090
 comeback here is also quite a 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.590
 light cream tone is the highlight here 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.289
 a colorful palette 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.950
 since I also almost experimenting 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:33.070
 unused with me and I'm not 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.630
 find an absolute brown type and that 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.840
 are also browns somehow about it 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.940
 brown tones are simple in serum 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.280
 I do not look so bad 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.430

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.930
