00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
right thing to do I don't really have a

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.330 
right thing to do I don't really have a
business<00:04:43.030> plan<00:04:43.360> right<00:04:44.260> if<00:04:44.800> I<00:04:44.950> had<00:04:45.100> a<00:04:45.130> business

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
business plan right if I had a business

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.490 
business plan right if I had a business
plan<00:04:45.700> I'd<00:04:46.120> be<00:04:46.300> writing<00:04:46.570> it<00:04:46.780> every<00:04:46.990> six<00:04:47.230> months

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
plan I'd be writing it every six months

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.550 
plan I'd be writing it every six months
because<00:04:47.950> the<00:04:48.790> market<00:04:49.210> is<00:04:49.330> moving<00:04:49.900> so<00:04:50.290> fast

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
because the market is moving so fast

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.120 
because the market is moving so fast
that<00:04:52.380> literally<00:04:53.380> what<00:04:53.530> I<00:04:53.560> said<00:04:53.830> I<00:04:53.860> was<00:04:54.010> gonna

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
that literally what I said I was gonna

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.550 
that literally what I said I was gonna
do<00:04:54.340> 18<00:04:54.640> months<00:04:54.880> ago<00:04:54.970> would<00:04:55.570> be<00:04:55.600> invalid<00:04:56.080> right

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
do 18 months ago would be invalid right

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.800 
do 18 months ago would be invalid right
now<00:04:56.650> so<00:04:57.130> when<00:04:57.610> I<00:04:57.640> hear<00:04:57.820> people<00:04:57.880> spending

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
probably not I really try to focus on

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.170 
probably not I really try to focus on

things that drive the business and so

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.070 
things that drive the business and so
when<00:05:19.180> I<00:05:19.210> say<00:05:19.420> things<00:05:19.480> that<00:05:19.720> drive<00:05:19.960> the

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
when I say things that drive the

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.780 
when I say things that drive the
business<00:05:20.500> I<00:05:20.620> say<00:05:20.740> the<00:05:20.800> root<00:05:21.040> cause<00:05:21.190> of<00:05:21.220> success

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
I'm doing well I don't look at the

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.460 
I'm doing well I don't look at the
revenue<00:05:29.890> that<00:05:30.040> comes<00:05:30.220> in<00:05:30.520> as<00:05:30.720> a<00:05:31.720> benchmark<00:05:32.200> of

what whether the business is doing well

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.409 
what whether the business is doing well
I<00:05:34.720> look<00:05:35.230> at<00:05:35.380> what<00:05:35.590> percentage<00:05:36.130> of<00:05:36.250> people<00:05:36.419> tell

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
I look at what percentage of people tell

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.000 
I look at what percentage of people tell
me<00:05:37.450> that<00:05:37.660> they<00:05:38.169> would<00:05:38.320> definitely<00:05:38.860> recommend
