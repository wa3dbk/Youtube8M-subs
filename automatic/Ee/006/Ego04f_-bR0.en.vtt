00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
more I play with the site the slower my

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.040 
more I play with the site the slower my
site<00:00:22.650> seems<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.130> get<00:00:23.310> what<00:00:24.119> can<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.390> do<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.840> speed

site seems to get what can I do to speed

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.750 
site seems to get what can I do to speed
my<00:00:25.230> site<00:00:25.500> back<00:00:25.740> up<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:26.130> great<00:00:26.490> question

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
my site back up a great question

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.700 
my site back up a great question
actually<00:00:27.060> because<00:00:27.240> page<00:00:27.840> load<00:00:28.080> times<00:00:28.380> are

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
actually because page load times are

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.990 
actually because page load times are
important<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.400> we<00:00:29.490> should<00:00:29.699> be<00:00:29.820> paying

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
important and we should be paying

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.999 
important and we should be paying
attention<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.480> them<00:00:30.630> right<00:00:30.779> slow<00:00:31.439> sites<00:00:31.769> not

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
attention to them right slow sites not

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.700 
attention to them right slow sites not
only<00:00:32.279> aggravate<00:00:32.820> your<00:00:33.090> visitors<00:00:33.780> but<00:00:34.500> they're

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
only aggravate your visitors but they're

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.500 
only aggravate your visitors but they're
also<00:00:34.890> bad<00:00:35.550> for<00:00:35.579> search<00:00:36.000> engines<00:00:36.329> because

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
also bad for search engines because

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.000 
also bad for search engines because
search<00:00:36.780> engines<00:00:36.870> take<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> look<00:00:37.500> at<00:00:37.620> page<00:00:37.800> load

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
search engines take a look at page load

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.549 
search engines take a look at page load
times<00:00:38.250> now<00:00:38.460> as<00:00:38.670> part<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.690> their<00:00:39.870> search<00:00:40.170> engine

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
times now as part of their search engine

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.220 
times now as part of their search engine
ranking<00:00:40.980> algorithms<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.719> know<00:00:42.840> when<00:00:43.079> we

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
ranking algorithms so you know when we

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.500 
ranking algorithms so you know when we
talk<00:00:43.469> about<00:00:43.530> slow<00:00:44.340> page<00:00:44.640> load<00:00:44.879> times<00:00:45.120> really

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
talk about slow page load times really

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.970 
talk about slow page load times really
what<00:00:45.629> we're<00:00:45.750> talking<00:00:46.140> about<00:00:46.200> inefficiencies

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
what we're talking about inefficiencies

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.090 
what we're talking about inefficiencies
and<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:48.510> can<00:00:48.660> either<00:00:48.809> be<00:00:48.930> an<00:00:49.140> inefficiency<00:00:49.739> at

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
and it can either be an inefficiency at

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.220 
and it can either be an inefficiency at
the<00:00:50.579> server<00:00:50.850> level<00:00:51.180> or<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:52.050> be<00:00:52.079> an

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
the server level or it can be an

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.040 
the server level or it can be an
inefficiency<00:00:52.770> at<00:00:53.100> your<00:00:53.699> website<00:00:54.030> level<00:00:54.570> so

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
inefficiency at your website level so

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.260 
inefficiency at your website level so
with<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.829> server<00:00:56.070> level<00:00:56.370> especially<00:00:56.730> if<00:00:57.120> you

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
with the server level especially if you

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.970 
with the server level especially if you
are<00:00:57.449> on<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> shared<00:00:58.350> hosting<00:00:58.800> environment

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
are on a shared hosting environment

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.189 
are on a shared hosting environment
which<00:00:59.399> most<00:00:59.640> people<00:00:59.820> are<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.270> know<00:01:00.390> Bluehost

which most people are you know Bluehost

which most people are you know Bluehost
or<00:01:01.440> GoDaddy<00:01:01.890> or<00:01:02.190> hostgator<00:01:03.030> or<00:01:03.180> one<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.359> those

or GoDaddy or hostgator or one of those

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.270 
or GoDaddy or hostgator or one of those
those<00:01:04.290> are<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.500> little<00:01:04.619> more<00:01:04.799> difficult<00:01:04.979> to

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
those are a little more difficult to

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.469 
those are a little more difficult to
troubleshoot<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.970> know<00:01:06.060> you're<00:01:06.210> really<00:01:06.299> need

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
troubleshoot you know you're really need

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.000 
troubleshoot you know you're really need
to<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:06.689> somebody<00:01:06.930> that's<00:01:07.170> got<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.409> decent

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
to have somebody that's got a decent

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.070 
to have somebody that's got a decent
level<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.729> experience<00:01:09.180> it's<00:01:09.810> got<00:01:09.960> some

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
level of experience it's got some

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.750 
level of experience it's got some
programming<00:01:10.560> experience<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.159> those<00:01:11.340> types<00:01:11.610> of

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
programming experience so those types of

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.219 
programming experience so those types of
issues<00:01:11.909> are<00:01:12.180> usually<00:01:12.510> more<00:01:12.659> expensive<00:01:12.720> so

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
issues are usually more expensive so

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.270 
issues are usually more expensive so
we're<00:01:13.380> not<00:01:13.500> going<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.710> talk<00:01:13.890> about<00:01:14.040> those

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
we're not going to talk about those

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.890 
we're not going to talk about those
right<00:01:14.490> now<00:01:14.520> what<00:01:15.390> we're<00:01:15.509> really<00:01:15.630> going<00:01:15.780> to

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
right now what we're really going to

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.940 
right now what we're really going to
talk<00:01:16.049> about<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.380> we're<00:01:16.470> going<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.650> talk<00:01:16.799> about

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
talk about is we're going to talk about

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.340 
talk about is we're going to talk about
page<00:01:17.310> efficient<00:01:17.729> season<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.990> reason<00:01:19.140> why

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
page efficient season and the reason why

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.300 
page efficient season and the reason why
we're<00:01:19.470> going<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.650> talk<00:01:19.830> about<00:01:20.009> page

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
we're going to talk about page

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.160 
we're going to talk about page
efficiencies<00:01:20.939> or<00:01:21.090> inefficiencies<00:01:21.479> as<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
efficiencies or inefficiencies as the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.710 
efficiencies or inefficiencies as the
case<00:01:22.320> may<00:01:22.530> be<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.920> because<00:01:23.850> they're<00:01:24.360> easy<00:01:24.540> to

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
case may be is because they're easy to

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.170 
case may be is because they're easy to
find<00:01:24.930> there<00:01:25.740> are<00:01:25.920> relatively<00:01:26.430> easy<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.880> fix

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
find there are relatively easy to fix

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.030 
find there are relatively easy to fix
and<00:01:27.509> they're<00:01:27.600> simple<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.619> take<00:01:28.799> care<00:01:28.979> of

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
and they're simple to to take care of

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.179 
and they're simple to to take care of
without<00:01:29.189> any<00:01:29.490> extra<00:01:29.909> tools<00:01:30.119> or<00:01:31.189> experiences

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
without any extra tools or experiences

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.249 
without any extra tools or experiences
okay<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.030> there<00:01:33.509> are<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> lot<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.140> different

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
okay so there are a lot of different

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.530 
okay so there are a lot of different
places<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:35.100> your<00:01:35.250> web<00:01:35.490> pages<00:01:35.850> or<00:01:36.390> your

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
places that your web pages or your

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.929 
places that your web pages or your
website<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.259> become<00:01:37.619> inefficient<00:01:38.250> or<00:01:38.700> start

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
website can become inefficient or start

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.999 
website can become inefficient or start
leaking<00:01:39.119> performance<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.259> first<00:01:40.500> cop
