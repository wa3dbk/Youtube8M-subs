00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.470
 Prize draw from the optical fine 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.480
 Kate yes I have you a big mistake 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.730
 I can always do it myself 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.050
 drive head beat I do not know 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.940
 why it is I have just that 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.929
 already picked up and have 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.660
 also drawn a winner of course 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.820
 However , I only have the sound 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.270
 or audio file saved 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.320
 and the video file is somehow gone 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.519
 no idea where that is if the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.350
 have been saved if the disappeared 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.029
 what happened to them is who the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.099
 has no idea 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.240
 In any case, there is the winner gala 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.250
 place which I have already 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.390
 written hello gala places cape 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.610
 and that's why I need it now 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:41.790
 times a love in the name blablabla 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.540
 greetings simon I have unfortunately no 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.059
 video of it 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.010
 that is, if you just say it now 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.100
 Of course, the winner can flex now 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.199
 suggest you paint the gala play 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.280
 a friend of yours or of the 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.960
 pay off or he he has all 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.899
 offers made 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.530
 it was not like that, but I know it 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.180
 is very important in a contest 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.700
 to make that transparency means 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.990
 that everyone should see how the winner 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.490
 has come about and I think so too 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.840
 very awful when I 'm in the backlash 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.040
 join in and win in the end 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.270
 someone and I do not know why he 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.640
 I think that's what I've actually won 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.560
 still really stupid shit 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.820
 and because I think that's shit 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.080
 and because that's a shit, too 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.299
 I have now found this 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.140
 Determined a second whether the campaigns 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.450
 giving away 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.890
 that is the first ferry winner little 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.840
 but I did not solve it correctly 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.159
 gala place he has recorded 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.600
 every case whether won the fed cup and 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.520
 Now I'm going to release another 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.320
 winner and how exactly do that 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.710
 I explain to you so there are 7779 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.960
 comments yes all by watching 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.159
 would be inhumane but really that can 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.259
 I never run through the life of the 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.970
 industry ten hours 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.110
 however there are 16 pages that I have 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.399
 I then on the very first page, the 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.979
 so it was written on the last one 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.540
 So on where yes where the first 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.969
 comment is here I asked 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.030
 first counter would be convenient because it is complete 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:07.110
 below is glp then the 234 comes 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.869
 when 16 comes 1 is cvp the winner 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.430
 So there are 116 pages that I then 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.110
 can trigger that is is first 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.710
 make a trip of 116 to the 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.720
 page 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.260
 and then there's 500 more per page 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:27.560
 comments sugar resp 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:32.730
 5 comments and yes that means I will 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.960
 now on rank 116 and then always 1 500 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.040
 and then look 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.140
 ok, we often see each other strange and brock again 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.630
 so now we go from 1 to 16 1 around the 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.490
 page to determine 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:54.060
 page 8 good the page 8 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:03:00.620
 that's exactly half and then you are like that 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:03.330
 often focus updated page times 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:08.420
 so then go up to 1 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:12.240
 500 one for the winner 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:15.750
 50 a smooth 50 okay so we count 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.090
 together from page 850 high nick 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.580
 endgame exasperation late i want that 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.650
 would be cool and so on unfortunately you are 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:27.830
 the number one and not the 50 so 1 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:35.630
 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:41.370

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.270
 have lived so many messages so 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.440
 people if you send me the private message 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.400

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.830
 Do not write back if we too 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.900

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.330

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.840
 I answer as you very rarely see 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.880
 So the last message I have here 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.310
 sent on the twentieth and picked up since 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.630
 the 23rd 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:59.130
 that's why yes I answer unfortunately 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.290
 currently on a few messages because I 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:04.370
 do not have so much time and war 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:06.540
 for that much too much news 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.710
 so feel with which answers 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.790
 I can try in the comments like that 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.200
 a lot to answer as it is 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.800
 write your questions and everything in the 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.240
 Comments 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.340
 I really try in the comments 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.810
 as much as I can answer 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.360
 I'll tell what I do on many videos 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.920
 so asked but all questions yes 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.960
 writing back it does not work that way 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.410
 he will say congratulations 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:29.390
 The two winners and then say quiet 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.390
 until the next video
