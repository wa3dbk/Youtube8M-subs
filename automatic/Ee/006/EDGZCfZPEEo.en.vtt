the<00:00:01.079> principle<00:00:01.650> advantage<00:00:02.550> of<00:00:02.820> a<00:00:03.000> reflex

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
the principle advantage of a reflex

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.230 
the principle advantage of a reflex
camera<00:00:03.929> is<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:04.500> flexibility<00:00:05.190> of<00:00:05.879> being<00:00:05.940> able
