00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
to focus it was re-released in 2004 and

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.170 
to focus it was re-released in 2004 and
still<00:00:46.739> have<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.950> instructions<00:00:47.520> for<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.910> here

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
still have the instructions for it here

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.690 
still have the instructions for it here
and<00:00:48.500> it's<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.590> two<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:49.860> one<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.399> can<00:00:50.550> build

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
and it's a two in one so you can build

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.160 
and it's a two in one so you can build
the<00:00:50.820> one<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.149> I've<00:00:51.239> got<00:00:51.270> built<00:00:51.750> there<00:00:52.020> and

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
the one that I've got built there and

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.160 
the one that I've got built there and
you<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.620> also<00:00:52.739> build<00:00:53.160> like<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.370> go-cart<00:00:54.170> so

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
you can also build like a go-cart so

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.670 
you can also build like a go-cart so
old-school<00:00:55.739> instructions<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:57.469> mean<00:00:58.469> look<00:00:58.649> how

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
old-school instructions I mean look how

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.980 
old-school instructions I mean look how
the<00:01:03.350> none<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.500> parts<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.189> stuff<00:01:05.990> much

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the none of the parts and stuff much

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.429 
the none of the parts and stuff much
different<00:01:07.409> than<00:01:07.920> today<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.990> then<00:01:09.990> still<00:01:10.290> have

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
different than today and then still have

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.690 
different than today and then still have
