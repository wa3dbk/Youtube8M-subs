yeah same thing like last year

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.440 
yeah same thing like last year
a little<00:00:51.370> bit<00:00:51.460> of<00:00:51.520> a<00:00:51.580> fresh<00:00:51.820> it<00:00:52.000> coming<00:00:52.330> in

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
a little bit of a fresh it coming in

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.600 
a little bit of a fresh it coming in
it'll<00:00:52.630> bring<00:00:52.780> the<00:00:52.840> river<00:00:53.110> up<00:00:53.350> six<00:00:54.160> inches<00:00:54.430> or
