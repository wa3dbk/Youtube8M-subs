 book that can be purchased at the bookstore 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.990

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:02.430
 its 80 there is a lot out there that stay 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:06.269
 passes in space or in the past of age 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.670
 average or the chimpanzee versions themselves 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.040
 and it is especially for stories that do not 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.600
 happens in our time there are 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.970
 modern versions 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.870
 only when I say that Samsung is you 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.260
 hearing would have a rock suite would be 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.900
 surface 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.230
 it is inclusive however denied 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.660
 improvement makes fantastic assemblies that 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.390

 Ansa children of the company take over at last 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.620
 not viable but our super creative 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.989
 again you have to have a lot of history 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.569
 original you have turned into a 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.340
 other environment they make sense and I 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.560
 I do not know you as knowing but 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.900

 Dracula the invisible man all a 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.700
 great story that goes on in the 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.829
 present 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.900
 This is not being a stick with the 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.750
 classic exotic characters in the 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.229

 I had shared and shoulders 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:30.930
 which is beneficial if it is not made by sound 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.820
 if you do not know what the kiss depends on 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.449
 is here in the description understands with this 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.280
 wonderful series everyone and the weather 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:40.380

 today is actually with writers of the other 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:48.960
 I'm at the hotel's mosque street tennis 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.419
 inclusive 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.669
 just watch a video that you're mocking 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.639
 complimenting him that he does not complain of 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:59.070
 Coffins because he writes a confection 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.560
 there to live a couple of years ago 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.760
 over white new symposium in college 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.229
 and the work of a teacher called there 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.840
 extraordinary profession joão moura e 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.760
 he said he started working on 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.210
 extraordinary classroom and then 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.970
 pick up the required yearbooks and 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.520
 ask students to write Spanish 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.400
 on top of those black guy wrote 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.370
 yesterday joão casmurro and this not only 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.610
 encourage creative writing for students 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.380
 with an exercise of analysis an exercise 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.020
 text comprehension because the point 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:37.169
 main of a think the mouth stays 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.139
 that you can recognize the 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.270
 elements 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.310
 those of the main story that is already 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.259
 becoming a research subject already has a 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.789
 a lot of studies on this 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:48.419
 mainly a feature already 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:51.909
 are revolted they think that all estimating 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:54.610
 continuation adaptation parody is nothing 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:57.759
 there is a very large difference 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:00.729
 between an adaptation a continuation an 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:03.460
 tribute to a parody opash rain throat 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:06.069
 one of these differences is the degree of use of the 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:09.550
 original stuff what I'm 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:12.069
 wanting to do here is to provoke you 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.919
 to think a little that first teaching 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:17.800
 Today we have this pulp name 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:21.759
 today but the idea was already there for one 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:25.000
 bit of time and second with our 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:27.580
 reception changes according to the way 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.169
 that the material is delivered to trust 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.529
 me because because she is not 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:34.810
 authorized series that modernize 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:36.310
 classic story is good because the water 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.009
 that it is being produced by 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.110
 studio, this is not for you, we are more 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:43.360
 smart that there is a stigma 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.520
 very strong of which was the fic is 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.919
 adolescent fan full of pride 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.979
 Fado, there's plenty of lying around, it 's just a 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:53.020
 Sorry you think that if you catch this one. 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:55.360
 something criticized by the readers themselves 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.479
 that the son who say they have a lot of 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.029
 fixed pb that has not half the 

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:03.759
 views that stay that is 

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:06.219
 contagion of fan same cultural program 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:09.639
 yesterday both of bad thing that makes 

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:12.879
 succeeds and has 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:14.319
 then passes on are almost creating 

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:17.080
 an original story and only needs 

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:19.960
 cut the last loop to play in the 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.539
 world in pine forests that the whole screenwriter 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:25.060
 so I leave here one last appeal 

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:27.699
 video you that have much custom of law 

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:31.419
 He is accompanied to be assiduously 

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:33.879
 the engine assiduously gives feedback and i 

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:36.069
 neither are they to cut his story 

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:39.249
 because it's true we do not know who 

00:07:36.069 --> 00:07:40.599
 will be the new writers writers of 

00:07:39.249 --> 00:07:43.599
 next generations 

00:07:40.599 --> 00:07:46.330
 and this incentive may be essential for 

00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:48.279
 a lot of good things on the market and 

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.319
 now wants to know about you than you 

00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:52.060
 think about it is time 

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:55.029
 cool but we take it more seriously 

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:56.949
 we will be seeing several series and 

00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:59.590
 movies that are nothing more than they were 

00:07:56.949 --> 00:08:01.659
 fixed made jewelry because everyone 

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:04.020
 believed fifa since until the next 

00:08:01.659 --> 00:08:04.020
 video
