three<00:00:36.680> access<00:00:37.100> accelerometers<00:00:38.260> so<00:00:39.260> each

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:39.589 
three access accelerometers so each

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:43.090 
three access accelerometers so each
accelerometer<00:00:40.249> has<00:00:40.280> an<00:00:40.550> XY<00:00:40.909> and<00:00:41.089> Z<00:00:41.390> and<00:00:42.100> you

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
accelerometer has an XY and Z and you

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.529 
accelerometer has an XY and Z and you
can<00:00:43.309> think<00:00:43.519> of<00:00:43.609> the<00:00:43.729> accelerometers<00:00:44.359> as<00:00:44.510> a

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
can think of the accelerometers as a

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.529 
can think of the accelerometers as a
tilt<00:00:44.929> sensor<00:00:45.350> with<00:00:46.129> respect<00:00:46.579> to<00:00:46.699> gravity<00:00:46.850> so

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
tilt sensor with respect to gravity so

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.169 
tilt sensor with respect to gravity so
as<00:00:47.690> my<00:00:47.839> finger<00:00:48.139> tilts<00:00:48.649> with<00:00:49.089> respect<00:00:50.089> to

00:00:50.169 --> 00:00:50.179 
as my finger tilts with respect to

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:53.049 
as my finger tilts with respect to
gravity<00:00:50.569> that<00:00:51.039> axis<00:00:52.039> of<00:00:52.249> the<00:00:52.370> accelerometer

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
gravity that axis of the accelerometer

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.889 
gravity that axis of the accelerometer
is<00:00:53.769> being<00:00:54.769> used<00:00:55.010> to<00:00:55.510> capture<00:00:56.510> that<00:00:56.629> finger

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
is being used to capture that finger

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.750 
is being used to capture that finger
movement<00:00:57.319> and<00:00:57.469> then<00:00:57.829> translate<00:00:58.399> it<00:00:58.489> into<00:00:58.579> the

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
movement and then translate it into the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.930 
movement and then translate it into the
robotic<00:00:59.149> command<00:01:00.309> the<00:01:01.309> sensors<00:01:01.639> can<00:01:01.729> be

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
robotic command the sensors can be

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.430 
robotic command the sensors can be
programmed<00:01:02.359> to<00:01:02.510> record<00:01:02.929> changes<00:01:03.289> in

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
programmed to record changes in

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.120 
programmed to record changes in
proportional<00:01:03.979> positions<00:01:04.430> force<00:01:05.000> or<00:01:05.269> velocity

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
proportional positions force or velocity

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.230 
proportional positions force or velocity
so<00:01:07.130> this<00:01:07.280> is<00:01:07.430> how<00:01:07.549> we're<00:01:07.700> able<00:01:07.729> to<00:01:07.970> capture

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
so this is how we're able to capture

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.410 
so this is how we're able to capture
static<00:01:09.200> and<00:01:09.350> dynamic<00:01:09.440> hand<00:01:10.310> signals<00:01:10.760> but
