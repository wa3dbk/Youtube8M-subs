00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.830
 do not 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.830
 percent 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:29.499
 learn to repair 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.200
 in the video and 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.260
 let's unclog the pipes is completely saturated 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.070
 As you can see, the time that enters 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.090
 is getting lost in the meetings of the symphonic group that is also in 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.090
 disrepair 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.159
 the first thing we are going to do 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:54.910
 is to disassemble the siphon 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.120
 to have access to the gas pipeline 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.120
 of course before continuing we have to verify that the siphon is not 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.540
 causer of the atlantean 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.060
 in this case we have programmed all the side piece of their daughters 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.200
 now we are going to use with amia pasacables although obviously it is not 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.200
 own plumbing tool 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.200
 will perform well with the function we need 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.940
 we introduce it through the pipe 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.940
 to make it reach the point where it goes forward 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.900
 we do not want that we have reached that point because the idea already enters with certain 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.970
 difficulty 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.540
 there we have to hit hard in order to destroy as much as 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.259
 possible 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.259
 what is plugging the pipe 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.020
 to take life we ​​have to take into account that the pipes are housed in 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.200
 inside a lot of dirt 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.780
 and if we do not have it not with the hand that's why it's convenient that this fear 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.179
 gloves or an end at least but keep in mind because 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:52.300
 the amount of dirt is amazing 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.490
 that comes out of the inside of a pipe 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.430
 We assemble of tasks and font, paying special attention to all the 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.500
 together are properly sealed and we passed to the final part of the 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.040
 repair 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.099
 now with the help of a plunger we are going to try to dissolve completely 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.479
 what will end your day 

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:15.569
 in this case we are going to use a plunger 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:19.179
 they are much more effective than conventional promotion posts 

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:22.539
 empty hundred of your time is far superior 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.630
 this we do as many times as necessary 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.390
 until he checked that he was effectively swallowing water more fluently 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.249
 if we have done the installation 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:43.249
 we have that the siphon does not lose a drop of water 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:48.509
 to finish we will apply a liquid plunger 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:50.809
 following the manufacturer's instructions 

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:54.189
 that will allow us to take a more exhaustive control of the state of 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:55.779
 pipelines 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:59.379
 applying a small dose periodically we can keep it in good 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.379
 been the drain pipes 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:07.659
 and that's it with this we have our perfectly functioning 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:07.979
 challenge
