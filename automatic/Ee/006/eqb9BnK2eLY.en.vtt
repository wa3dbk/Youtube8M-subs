00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:06.439
 hello and welcome to this news 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:09.830
 video for installing a server 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:11.690
 feed the beast with a crab server 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.539
 teams which allows the variation of 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.369
 plugins in this all to nothing so get 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.900
 will go through three stages so first 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.580
 step downloads of different 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.080
 easter modes 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.970
 so here to start let's go 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.670
 on the site of feed the beast so well 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.170
 sure i master url to description 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:31.490
 in the loud part you click 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:34.280
 on our server server you 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.079
 choose a puck in 1.5 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.760
 so that's a point that corresponds to the 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.620
 version of minecraft that will run 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.019
 behind so there today 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.539
 you have 3 I take the first so 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.100
 there without a fall of course I 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.480
 hated with the 10-wheel version and 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.359
 no worries for now I have 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.649
 really no worries with all those dead 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:53.690
 while some charges going on 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.300
 render on central portal mc by a 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.569
 link url serene link in section 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.309
 news and after seems so good 

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:03.920
 select the right version that is 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.810
 compatible with your server so the 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.680
 live a word of easter in 1-5 I take the 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.870
 server version in 1.5 after we go 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.000
 go 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.230
 we will go down a bit and after you 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.240
 have a link that sends you directly 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:22.060
 to the good good service not so good 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.660
 service for to download so there we 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.390
 go know you and then so on the vote 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.240
 jenkins you will have to choose one that 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.410
 is recommended so one with a star 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.060
 so see for example this one this is 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:42.820
 the 25.1 version of July 25th so 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:45.520
 hop I download it and hop it would target 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.870
 so if not something else that also needs to be 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.590
 sometimes checked this is a version 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.480
 compatible with the forges version 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.220
 if you have a version of 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.480
 force that is too evolved compared to 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.910
 the version of your customers you can 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.970
 have a concern so now that everything 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.160
 is downloaded we will start to 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.180
 do the part 1 server room have 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.420
 at first we will 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.700
 unzip the 1 all the files from the 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.710
 server in the ftp server folder on 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:17.790
 the office that as usual by 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:22.780
 security we select everything to extract 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:27.610
 have chosen the office and we see in the 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:31.950
 folder flavors feed the beast and hop on 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.599
 to get it out 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.050
 after the second step is to copy 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:39.420
 so our server in the folder so 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:45.450
 our knowledge of the kit in the folder sa 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:49.709
 vast feed the beast so that's so 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.569
 I live in the folder here after so 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.140
 I'm going to say it and then that's at 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.260
 your choice 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.200
 but considering that after times I tend 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.090
 to move the servers there maybe 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.930
 linselles and the preparation is a 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.640
 linux system I am changing both the 2 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.470
 bat that allows us to get started so 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.470
 we will get the start of the order 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.739
 and we will paste the file name or that 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.120
 the file one I made a click 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.640
 right on it I made renault but I 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.410
 copied and like that it allows me to keep 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.110
 and the first ning game there comments 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.140
 always keep a history like that 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.099
 it lets you know everything is connected 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.780
 if you have not made a mistake what 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.709
 if you squash right away you do not 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.290
 know you 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.840
 it can annoy you if if you have a 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.049
 doubt so I do the same with the 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.440
 pointing which is a shortened lure 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.790
 to launch on a linux server 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.350
 you see that's going pretty fast because the 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.590
 line it's exactly the same and I 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:50.959
 comments the first line like 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.069
 flat and save 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.630
 after that we will be able to launch our 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.810
 server so we grateful towards 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.010
 sara windows we will launch the bat point 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.540
 of course if you are a linux server 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:06.380
 you can launch the 11 o'clock point 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:09.540
 other information 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.739
 there is often in the last previous 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.680
 the video often asked me the question 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.819
 compared to accommodation because 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.250
 some hosts 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:20.539
 you do not have the opportunity 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.400
 to choose your own 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:25.080
 your environment 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.240
 you have to see after about one 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.360
 childbirth at her your accommodation which 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.460
 allows to specify a packs mode 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.200
 specific 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.800
 so here I'm doing a little sql server 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.880
 you saw leave to load ok so there 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.780
 I can see that I am trying to 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:45.510
 connect all patients with local flavor 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.520
 no worries good the first load 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.020
 is always a bit long which is all 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.600
 in fact normal what are going the charges the 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.130
 map in addition I also loose on the go 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.560
 it's a very small virtual server 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:59.100
 that's the election that have a little time to 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.810
