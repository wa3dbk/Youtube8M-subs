mentally<00:00:00.719> and<00:00:00.900> physically<00:00:01.439> I'm<00:00:01.709> probably<00:00:02.040> the

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
mentally and physically I'm probably the

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:18.370 
mentally and physically I'm probably the
least<00:00:02.610> flexible<00:00:03.270> person<00:00:03.720> you'll<00:00:03.840> ever<00:00:03.959> meet

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.200 

my<00:00:19.380> shtick<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.099> be<00:00:20.250> sort<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.730> preachy<00:00:21.000> and

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
my shtick is to be sort of preachy and

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.000 
my shtick is to be sort of preachy and
judgmental<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.110> what's<00:00:22.320> more<00:00:22.500> preachy<00:00:22.830> and

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
judgmental and what's more preachy and

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.550 
judgmental and what's more preachy and
judgmental<00:00:23.460> than<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.570> Bible<00:00:24.989> and<00:00:25.110> religion

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
judgmental than the Bible and religion

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.950 
judgmental than the Bible and religion
so<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:27.230> so<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.380> seemed<00:00:28.560> like<00:00:28.739> the<00:00:28.800> right

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
so so so it seemed like the right

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.139 
so so so it seemed like the right
structure<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.079> apply<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.279> book<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.060> the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
structure to apply to the book and the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.819 
structure to apply to the book and the
right<00:00:33.300> tone<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.810> take<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:35.060> it's<00:00:36.060> I<00:00:36.720> guess<00:00:37.620> it's

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
right tone to take and it's I guess it's

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.940 
right tone to take and it's I guess it's
a<00:00:37.920> little<00:00:38.100> bit<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.989> sad<00:00:39.989> tired<00:00:40.290> in<00:00:40.800> that

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
a little bit of a sad tired in that

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.040 
a little bit of a sad tired in that
sense<00:00:41.480> but<00:00:42.680> it's<00:00:43.680> also<00:00:44.510> it<00:00:45.510> just<00:00:45.720> gives<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:45.960> a

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
sense but it's also it just gives it a

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.260 
sense but it's also it just gives it a
tone<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.500> gives<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.860> kind<00:00:47.040> of<00:00:47.190> mock<00:00:47.430> gravity

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.900 
days I was I was more into the racing so
I<00:02:30.180> definitely<00:02:31.050> had<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.470> mindset<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.610> lot<00:02:32.790> of

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.790 
I definitely had that mindset a lot of
people<00:02:33.150> have<00:02:33.360> we're<00:02:33.630> like<00:02:33.930> oh<00:02:34.140> well<00:02:34.680> this

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
people have we're like oh well this

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.770 
people have we're like oh well this
isn't<00:02:35.040> real<00:02:35.340> riding<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:36.090> I'm<00:02:36.209> just<00:02:36.420> going<00:02:36.690> to

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
isn't real riding that I'm just going to

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.080 
isn't real riding that I'm just going to
work<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.290> then<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:38.190> real<00:02:38.370> riding<00:02:38.850> only

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
work and then the real riding only

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.940 
work and then the real riding only
counts<00:02:39.540> when<00:02:39.600> you're<00:02:39.900> kid<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.260> out<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.769> you're

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
counts when you're kid it out and you're

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.160 
counts when you're kid it out and you're
you<00:02:41.760> know<00:02:41.880> you're<00:02:42.090> putting<00:02:42.269> in<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.540> miles<00:02:42.989> or

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
you know you're putting in the miles or

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.710 
you know you're putting in the miles or
you're<00:02:43.290> racing<00:02:43.709> or<00:02:43.830> something<00:02:44.250> like<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.720> and

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
you're racing or something like that and

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.330 
you're racing or something like that and
I<00:02:45.810> was<00:02:45.989> until<00:02:46.320> I<00:02:46.350> was<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:46.620> little<00:02:46.920> older<00:02:47.130> that

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
I was until I was a little older that

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.900 
I was until I was a little older that
that<00:02:50.340> went<00:02:50.640> away<00:02:51.950> probably<00:02:52.950> my<00:02:53.130> 30s<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:53.790> know

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
that went away probably my 30s you know

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.470 
that went away probably my 30s you know
I<00:02:53.940> started<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.540> kind<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:54.959> realize<00:02:55.320> that<00:02:56.480> that

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
I started to kind of realize that that

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.630 
I started to kind of realize that that
that<00:02:57.720> commuting<00:02:58.320> right<00:02:58.530> practical<00:02:59.280> riding

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
that commuting right practical riding

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.350 
that commuting right practical riding
that<00:02:59.760> is<00:02:59.970> so<00:03:00.980> enjoyable<00:03:01.980> unto<00:03:02.579> itself<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.209> is

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
that is so enjoyable unto itself and is

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.039 
that is so enjoyable unto itself and is
a<00:03:03.500> different<00:03:04.500> thing<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:05.630> something<00:03:06.630> you<00:03:06.870> can

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
a different thing and something you can

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.319 
a different thing and something you can
really<00:03:07.200> integrate<00:03:07.799> in<00:03:08.010> your<00:03:08.370> life<00:03:08.850> in<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.180> way
