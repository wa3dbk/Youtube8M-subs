okay<00:00:01.500> I<00:00:02.810> want<00:00:03.810> to<00:00:03.870> do<00:00:04.170> a<00:00:04.589> video<00:00:04.950> on<00:00:06.589> how<00:00:07.589> to

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
okay I want to do a video on how to

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.150 
okay I want to do a video on how to
catch<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.910> box<00:00:09.780> turtle<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:12.410> it<00:00:13.410> really<00:00:13.769> took<00:00:13.950> me

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
catch a box turtle and it really took me

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.279 
catch a box turtle and it really took me
a<00:00:14.400> long<00:00:14.730> time<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:15.150> figure<00:00:15.839> out<00:00:17.990> how<00:00:18.990> nature

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
a long time to figure out how nature

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.040 
a long time to figure out how nature
works<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:21.170> you<00:00:22.170> can't<00:00:22.529> really<00:00:23.630> go<00:00:24.630> out<00:00:24.660> and

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
works and you can't really go out and

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.210 
works and you can't really go out and
just<00:00:25.500> find<00:00:26.130> one<00:00:27.650> you<00:00:28.650> have<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.920> be<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
just find one you have to be in the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.519 
just find one you have to be in the
right<00:00:29.429> place<00:00:29.699> at<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.210> right<00:00:30.539> time<00:00:30.779> and

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
right place at the right time and

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.160 
right place at the right time and
there's<00:00:32.430> different<00:00:32.700> techniques<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.809> I'll<00:00:33.899> go

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
there's different techniques so I'll go

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.799 
there's different techniques so I'll go
over<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.440> few<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:35.040> them<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.670> I'll<00:00:36.030> go<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.570> way

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
over a few of them and I'll go the way

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.889 
over a few of them and I'll go the way
that<00:00:37.290> works<00:00:37.469> for<00:00:37.770> me

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
that works for me

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.420 
that works for me
one<00:00:39.899> way<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.649> do<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> hole<00:00:41.809> in<00:00:42.890> a<00:00:43.890> wooded<00:00:44.250> area

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
one way is to do a hole in a wooded area

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.729 
one way is to do a hole in a wooded area
that<00:00:45.390> looks<00:00:45.600> like<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.200> would<00:00:46.289> have<00:00:46.469> some

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
that looks like it would have some

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:47.840 
that looks like it would have some
turtles<00:00:47.129> around<00:00:47.280> it

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
turtles around it

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.720 
turtles around it
do<00:00:48.420> your<00:00:48.570> hole<00:00:48.719> that's<00:00:48.930> about<00:00:49.340> two<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.520> three

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
do your hole that's about two to three

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.319 
do your hole that's about two to three
feet<00:00:50.910> deep<00:00:51.350> then<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:52.590> about<00:00:53.030> two<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.149> three

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
feet deep then it's about two to three

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.840 
feet deep then it's about two to three
feet<00:00:54.539> wide<00:00:54.829> with<00:00:55.829> about<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> 1/2<00:00:56.670> foot<00:00:56.969> diameter

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
feet wide with about a 1/2 foot diameter

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.410 
feet wide with about a 1/2 foot diameter
maybe<00:00:59.850> two<00:01:00.210> three<00:01:00.480> maybe<00:01:00.899> two<00:01:01.079> feet<00:01:01.289> diameter

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
maybe two three maybe two feet diameter

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.440 
maybe two three maybe two feet diameter
so<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.539> want<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.750> make<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.019> hole<00:01:05.270> to<00:01:06.270> where

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
so you want to make this hole to where

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.950 
so you want to make this hole to where
if<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.930> box<00:01:07.170> turtle<00:01:07.729> comes<00:01:08.729> over<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.330> he'll

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
if the box turtle comes over it he'll

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.160 
if the box turtle comes over it he'll
fall<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:10.710> like<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.890> trap<00:01:11.840> you<00:01:12.840> can<00:01:12.990> either

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
fall in it's like a trap you can either

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.780 
fall in it's like a trap you can either
put<00:01:13.439> leaves<00:01:13.680> over<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.369> cover<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.760> with

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
put leaves over it and cover it with

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.640 
put leaves over it and cover it with
sticks<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.270> stuff<00:01:15.540> or<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.259> can<00:01:16.409> leave<00:01:16.619> it

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
sticks and stuff or you can leave it

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.039 
sticks and stuff or you can leave it
open<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.280> put<00:01:17.460> bait<00:01:17.729> down<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> bottom<00:01:18.750> I

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
open and put bait down in the bottom I

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.630 
open and put bait down in the bottom I
have<00:01:20.009> caught<00:01:20.610> them<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:21.299> way<00:01:21.590> but<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:23.460> have

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
have caught them that way but you have

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.870 
have caught them that way but you have
to<00:01:23.820> be<00:01:24.409> very<00:01:25.409> skilled<00:01:25.799> at<00:01:25.979> thinking<00:01:26.250> holes<00:01:26.549> and

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
to be very skilled at thinking holes and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.350 
to be very skilled at thinking holes and
they<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.320> be<00:01:28.439> in<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.770> area<00:01:29.270> so<00:01:30.270> that's

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
they have to be in that area so that's

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.830 
they have to be in that area so that's
one<00:01:30.810> way<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.140> catch<00:01:31.560> um<00:01:32.270> another<00:01:33.270> way<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.570> catch

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
one way to catch um another way to catch

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.069 
one way to catch um another way to catch
a<00:01:33.930> mr.<00:01:34.200> by<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> trap<00:01:35.119> any<00:01:36.119> kind<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.479> trap<00:01:36.750> will<00:01:36.930> do

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
a mr. by a trap any kind of trap will do

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.660 
a mr. by a trap any kind of trap will do
like<00:01:37.470> raccoon<00:01:38.430> trap<00:01:39.710> possum<00:01:40.710> trap<00:01:40.920> pretty

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
like raccoon trap possum trap pretty

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.530 
like raccoon trap possum trap pretty
much<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.939> same<00:01:42.090> thing

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
much the same thing

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.520 
much the same thing
stick<00:01:43.200> some<00:01:43.590> worms<00:01:43.920> or<00:01:44.340> something<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:45.000> has<00:01:45.390> a

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
stick some worms or something that has a

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.370 
stick some worms or something that has a
nice<00:01:46.530> smell<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.990> box<00:01:49.200> turtle

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
nice smell to it and the box turtle

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.859 
nice smell to it and the box turtle
should<00:01:49.740> be<00:01:49.860> attracted<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.700> they<00:01:51.450> should<00:01:51.630> find

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
should be attracted and they should find

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:52.730 
should be attracted and they should find
their<00:01:52.049> way<00:01:52.170> in

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
their way in

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.359 
their way in
the<00:01:52.860> cage<00:01:53.990> and<00:01:54.990> then<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.680> way<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.040> works<00:01:56.250> for

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
the cage and then the way that works for

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.749 
the cage and then the way that works for
me<00:01:56.700> which<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.540> last<00:01:58.530> reason<00:01:58.829> I'm<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.520> last

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
me which is the last reason I'm the last

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.210 
me which is the last reason I'm the last
way<00:02:00.060> I'm<00:02:00.210> going<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.479> show<00:02:00.630> tell<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:03.890> get<00:02:04.890> up<00:02:05.100> at

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
way I'm going to show tell you get up at

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.949 
way I'm going to show tell you get up at
about<00:02:06.289> 8:30<00:02:07.289> maybe<00:02:08.190> 9:00<00:02:08.550> that's<00:02:09.450> fine<00:02:09.720> you

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
about 8:30 maybe 9:00 that's fine you

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.130 
about 8:30 maybe 9:00 that's fine you
can<00:02:09.989> get<00:02:10.170> up<00:02:10.319> at<00:02:10.500> 6:30<00:02:11.069> or<00:02:11.370> 7:00<00:02:11.700> but<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:12.140> would

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
can get up at 6:30 or 7:00 but I would

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.589 
can get up at 6:30 or 7:00 but I would
rather<00:02:13.319> just<00:02:13.650> wait<00:02:13.920> in<00:02:14.250> drive<00:02:15.150> around<00:02:15.420> a

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
rather just wait in drive around a

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.160 
rather just wait in drive around a
little<00:02:15.690> bit<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:16.790> found<00:02:17.790> them<00:02:18.030> in<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.480> spring

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
little bit I found them in the spring

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.960 
little bit I found them in the spring
time<00:02:19.440> late<00:02:19.769> spring<00:02:20.220> early<00:02:20.580> summer<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:22.140> then

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
time late spring early summer and then

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.120 
time late spring early summer and then
they'll<00:02:23.970> be<00:02:24.180> migrating<00:02:24.840> late<00:02:25.440> summer<00:02:25.799> early

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
they'll be migrating late summer early

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.750 
they'll be migrating late summer early
fall<00:02:26.600> so<00:02:27.600> those<00:02:28.440> are<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.709> best<00:02:29.130> times<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.670> look

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
fall so those are the best times to look

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.070 
fall so those are the best times to look
for<00:02:30.090> them<00:02:30.269> I<00:02:30.540> would<00:02:30.989> go<00:02:31.200> anywhere<00:02:32.069> from<00:02:32.760> about

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
for them I would go anywhere from about

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.120 
for them I would go anywhere from about
6:30<00:02:34.080> when<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.470> starts<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.769> get<00:02:34.920> light<00:02:35.160> out<00:02:35.390> to

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
6:30 when it starts to get light out to

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.449 
6:30 when it starts to get light out to
10:00<00:02:38.510> but<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.690> best<00:02:40.110> time<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.709> find<00:02:40.950> them<00:02:41.220> I

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
10:00 but the best time to find them I

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.940 
10:00 but the best time to find them I
would<00:02:42.239> say<00:02:42.510> would<00:02:42.750> be<00:02:42.900> about<00:02:45.049> 8:30<00:02:46.049> that<00:02:46.709> would

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
would say would be about 8:30 that would

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.150 
would say would be about 8:30 that would
be<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.819> time<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.360> would<00:02:48.480> go<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:49.739> those<00:02:50.040> are

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
be the time that I would go so those are

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.880 
be the time that I would go so those are
just<00:02:50.220> some<00:02:50.700> of<00:02:51.569> the<00:02:51.660> possible<00:02:52.230> ways<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.470> can

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
just some of the possible ways you can

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.160 
just some of the possible ways you can
catch<00:02:53.069> a<00:02:53.130> box<00:02:53.370> turtle<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:54.030> looked<00:02:54.510> on<00:02:54.660> YouTube

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
catch a box turtle I looked on YouTube

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.590 
catch a box turtle I looked on YouTube
because<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.310> was<00:02:56.489> trying<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.850> find<00:02:57.150> one<00:02:57.390> and

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
because I was trying to find one and

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.300 
because I was trying to find one and
there<00:03:00.600> weren't<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:01.109> lot<00:03:01.380> of<00:03:01.440> videos<00:03:02.040> that

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
there weren't a lot of videos that

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.099 
there weren't a lot of videos that
really<00:03:02.430> told<00:03:03.239> you<00:03:03.540> how<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:04.320> find<00:03:04.680> one<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:06.109> I

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
really told you how to find one and I

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.289 
really told you how to find one and I
think<00:03:07.410> I'll<00:03:07.590> make<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.769> video<00:03:07.950> later<00:03:08.430> on<00:03:08.820> about

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
think I'll make a video later on about

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.750 
think I'll make a video later on about
actually<00:03:10.260> hunting<00:03:10.769> them<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.280> I'll<00:03:11.489> be

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
actually hunting them and I'll be

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.660 
actually hunting them and I'll be
hunting<00:03:12.450> them<00:03:12.690> at<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:13.109> time<00:03:13.459> but<00:03:14.459> this<00:03:14.609> is

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
hunting them at that time but this is

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.020 
hunting them at that time but this is
just<00:03:15.000> one<00:03:15.450> video<00:03:16.350> that<00:03:16.590> I<00:03:16.620> make<00:03:16.980> that<00:03:17.340> I<00:03:17.820> made

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
just one video that I make that I made

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.680 
just one video that I make that I made
just<00:03:19.019> to<00:03:19.200> tell<00:03:19.380> you<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.859> few<00:03:20.190> different<00:03:20.370> ways<00:03:20.690> to

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
just to tell you a few different ways to

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.370 
just to tell you a few different ways to
hunt<00:03:22.200> them<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:23.720> when<00:03:24.720> you're<00:03:24.840> hunting

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
hunt them and when you're hunting

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.710 
hunt them and when you're hunting
whether<00:03:26.280> it's<00:03:26.459> on<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.760> road<00:03:28.010> in<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:30.090> trap<00:03:30.420> or

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
whether it's on the road in the trap or

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:39.699 
whether it's on the road in the trap or
in<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:32.220> hole<00:03:34.730> they're<00:03:35.730> all<00:03:35.910> good<00:03:36.359> ways<00:03:37.880> but

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
in the hole they're all good ways but

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.910 
in the hole they're all good ways but
it's<00:03:40.709> not<00:03:40.920> really<00:03:41.220> fair<00:03:41.459> to<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.760> animal<00:03:42.359> if

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
it's not really fair to the animal if

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.309 
it's not really fair to the animal if
you<00:03:43.920> mistreat<00:03:44.489> it<00:03:44.519> when<00:03:44.940> you<00:03:45.090> get<00:03:45.269> it<00:03:45.329> so

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
you mistreat it when you get it so

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.620 
you mistreat it when you get it so
please<00:03:47.130> try<00:03:47.519> to<00:03:47.579> take<00:03:47.790> care<00:03:48.090> of<00:03:48.269> your<00:03:48.420> box

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
please try to take care of your box

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
turtles and don't kill them that'd be my

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.180 
turtles and don't kill them that'd be my
number<00:03:53.700> one<00:03:53.880> priority<00:03:54.650> that's<00:03:55.650> about<00:03:55.950> it<00:03:56.160> just
