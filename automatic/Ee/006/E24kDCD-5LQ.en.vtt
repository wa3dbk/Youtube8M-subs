00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
it's not really a particularly heavy

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.060 
it's not really a particularly heavy
coverage<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.809> if<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:40.170> want<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.649> heavier

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
coverage and if you want a heavier

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.040 
coverage and if you want a heavier
coverage<00:00:41.309> do<00:00:41.850> have<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.239> sort<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.480> build<00:00:42.660> upon

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
coverage do have to sort of build upon

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.470 
coverage do have to sort of build upon
it<00:00:43.079> but<00:00:43.649> if<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:44.250> build<00:00:44.520> upon<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.090> it's

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
it but if you build upon it is it's

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.970 
it but if you build upon it is it's
excellent<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.079> mean<00:00:46.200> I've<00:00:46.320> got<00:00:46.530> front<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:46.890> it

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
excellent I mean I've got front but it

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.680 
excellent I mean I've got front but it
on<00:00:47.100> today<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:48.090> I've<00:00:48.239> got<00:00:48.480> freckles<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.379> I

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
on today and I've got freckles and I

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.350 
on today and I've got freckles and I
think<00:00:51.690> it's<00:00:51.840> covered<00:00:52.199> most<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.710> them<00:00:52.920> off<00:00:53.039> and

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
think it's covered most of them off and

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.790 
think it's covered most of them off and
but<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.449> just<00:00:54.629> gives<00:00:54.870> some<00:00:55.020> really<00:00:55.260> nice<00:00:55.410> glow

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
but it just gives some really nice glow

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.319 
but it just gives some really nice glow
as<00:00:56.010> well<00:00:56.250> particularly<00:00:56.760> if<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.030> use<00:00:57.180> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
as well particularly if you use the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.990 
as well particularly if you use the
powder<00:00:57.539> with<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.949> that's<00:00:59.670> factual

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
powder with it so that's factual

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.090 
powder with it so that's factual
foundation<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:02.960> find<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.559> best<00:01:04.769> way<00:01:04.979> I've

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
foundation I find and the best way I've

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.920 
foundation I find and the best way I've
actually<00:01:05.250> putting<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.510> either<00:01:06.659> use

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
actually putting it on is to either use

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.300 
actually putting it on is to either use
a<00:01:07.229> beauty<00:01:07.890> blender<00:01:08.400> or<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.630> sponge<00:01:10.380> wetting

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
a beauty blender or a sponge wetting

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.700 
a beauty blender or a sponge wetting
slightly<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.180> then<00:01:12.210> stipple<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.170> onto<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
slightly and then stipple it onto the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.570 
slightly and then stipple it onto the
skin<00:01:14.570> advance<00:01:15.570> on<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.020> off<00:01:16.140> stiffly<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.070> it

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
skin advance on and off stiffly and it

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.570 
skin advance on and off stiffly and it
gives<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.880> nice<00:01:18.060> glow<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.920> all<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.220> other<00:01:20.340> way

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
gives a nice glow and all the other way

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.340 
gives a nice glow and all the other way
and<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.390> do<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.720> with<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:21.990> particular

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
and to do it with this particular

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.289 
and to do it with this particular
foundation<00:01:23.100> because<00:01:23.220> it's<00:01:23.460> quite<00:01:23.670> runic<00:01:24.060> is

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
foundation because it's quite runic is

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.780 
foundation because it's quite runic is
to<00:01:24.720> put<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.830> back<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.009> your<00:01:26.220> hand<00:01:26.430> and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
to put it on the back of your hand and

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.630 
to put it on the back of your hand and
then<00:01:27.390> get<00:01:27.659> your<00:01:27.770> implantation<00:01:28.770> brush<00:01:29.250> and

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
then get your implantation brush and

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.179 
then get your implantation brush and
again<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:30.479> stipple<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.079> on<00:01:31.229> as<00:01:31.590> opposed<00:01:32.040> to

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
again just stipple it on as opposed to

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.730 
again just stipple it on as opposed to
Dragon<00:01:32.579> II<00:01:32.700> don't<00:01:33.659> like<00:01:33.869> putting<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.290> on<00:01:34.470> my

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
Dragon II don't like putting this on my

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.789 
Dragon II don't like putting this on my
fingers<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.840> just<00:01:36.840> find<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.110> doesn't<00:01:37.439> quite<00:01:37.590> go

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
fingers I just find it doesn't quite go

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.950 
fingers I just find it doesn't quite go
on<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> same<00:01:38.220> way<00:01:38.490> but<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:39.150> personal<00:01:39.720> choice

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
on the same way but it's personal choice

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.109 
on the same way but it's personal choice
and<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:43.380> only<00:01:43.619> drawback<00:01:44.100> with<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.909> should

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
and the only drawback with it you should

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.080 
and the only drawback with it you should
do<00:01:45.240> get<00:01:45.479> some<00:01:45.990> my<00:01:46.170> stitch<00:01:46.530> because<00:01:46.909> you<00:01:47.909> have

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
do get some my stitch because you have

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.609 
do get some my stitch because you have
to<00:01:48.240> put<00:01:48.450> obviously<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.110> have<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.350> put<00:01:49.500> onto

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
to put obviously you have to put onto

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.319 
to put obviously you have to put onto
the<00:01:49.770> back<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:49.950> your<00:01:50.189> hands<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.909> get<00:01:51.030> defined

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
the back of your hands to get defined

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.840 
the back of your hands to get defined
ionized<00:01:51.990> because<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.100> got<00:01:53.250> no<00:01:53.490> sort<00:01:53.790> of

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
ionized because it's got no sort of

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.609 
ionized because it's got no sort of
company<00:01:54.780> or<00:01:54.990> anything<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.700> then

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
company or anything and then

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.570 
company or anything and then
obviously<00:01:59.619> you<00:01:59.680> have<00:01:59.799> to<00:01:59.950> work<00:02:00.070> quickly<00:02:00.159> then

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
obviously you have to work quickly then

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.130 
obviously you have to work quickly then
because<00:02:00.850> it's<00:02:01.000> absorbing<00:02:01.450> to<00:02:01.689> your<00:02:01.780> skin<00:02:02.080> on

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
because it's absorbing to your skin on

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.420 
because it's absorbing to your skin on
the<00:02:02.259> back<00:02:02.380> of<00:02:02.560> your<00:02:02.650> hand<00:02:02.860> you<00:02:03.009> don't<00:02:03.159> know<00:02:03.250> why

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
the back of your hand you don't know why

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.630 
the back of your hand you don't know why
state<00:02:03.909> so<00:02:04.810> that's<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.770> only<00:02:05.830> drawback<00:02:06.399> that<00:02:06.430> I

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
state so that's the only drawback that I

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.749 
state so that's the only drawback that I
find<00:02:06.939> with<00:02:07.180> it<00:02:07.240> if<00:02:07.420> you<00:02:07.540> could<00:02:07.720> do<00:02:07.960> is<00:02:08.759> there's

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
find with it if you could do is there's

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.449 
find with it if you could do is there's
a<00:02:09.819> pump<00:02:10.420> on<00:02:10.690> it<00:02:10.720> but<00:02:11.290> having<00:02:11.590> said<00:02:11.770> that<00:02:11.830> lights

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
a pump on it but having said that lights

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.520 
a pump on it but having said that lights

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
of some of the mats and foundations

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.830 
of some of the mats and foundations
don't<00:02:14.950> have<00:02:15.100> pumps<00:02:15.459> on<00:02:15.640> them<00:02:15.880> unless<00:02:16.569> you<00:02:16.690> buy

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
don't have pumps on them unless you buy

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.750 
don't have pumps on them unless you buy
them<00:02:17.020> separately<00:02:17.290> but<00:02:18.220> as<00:02:18.340> it's<00:02:18.489> like<00:02:18.610> that's

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
them separately but as it's like that's

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.920 
them separately but as it's like that's
that's<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.270> only<00:02:19.510> only<00:02:20.020> drawback<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:20.470> that

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
that's the only only drawback to that

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.110 
that's the only only drawback to that
apart<00:02:22.930> from<00:02:23.050> that<00:02:23.200> absolutely<00:02:23.860> love<00:02:24.069> it<00:02:24.250> it's

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
apart from that absolutely love it it's

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.400 
apart from that absolutely love it it's
my<00:02:25.209> next<00:02:25.569> favorite<00:02:26.019> to<00:02:26.200> mark<00:02:27.630> an<00:02:28.630> X<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:29.019> shared

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
my next favorite to mark an X the shared

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.440 
my next favorite to mark an X the shared
life<00:02:29.620> foundation<00:02:30.069> but<00:02:30.850> it<00:02:30.970> does<00:02:31.150> give<00:02:31.330> you<00:02:31.420> a

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
life foundation but it does give you a

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.660 
life foundation but it does give you a
bit<00:02:31.630> of<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:31.780> globe<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:33.040> don't<00:02:33.310> need<00:02:33.489> a<00:02:33.550> lot

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
bit of a globe you don't need a lot

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.570 
bit of a globe you don't need a lot
that's<00:02:34.030> that's<00:02:34.330> another<00:02:35.050> thing<00:02:35.319> a<00:02:35.650> little

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
that's that's another thing a little

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:44.090 
that's that's another thing a little
goes<00:02:36.730> along<00:02:37.150> why<00:02:37.450> it<00:02:38.200> tends<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:41.640> cover<00:02:42.640> sort<00:02:42.970> of

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
goes along why it tends to cover sort of

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.759 
goes along why it tends to cover sort of
better<00:02:45.100> than<00:02:45.970> some<00:02:46.239> foundations<00:02:47.080> that's

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
better than some foundations that's

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:48.870 
better than some foundations that's
probably<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.160> wrong<00:02:48.280> way<00:02:48.489> to<00:02:48.549> put<00:02:48.850> it

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
probably the wrong way to put it

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.440 
probably the wrong way to put it
actually<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.920> just<00:02:50.980> got<00:02:51.430> a<00:02:51.730> best<00:02:52.209> to<00:02:52.299> cut

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
actually it just got a best to cut

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.180 
actually it just got a best to cut
although<00:02:52.660> it's<00:02:52.810> not<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:52.959> heavy<00:02:53.170> coverage<00:02:53.709> it's

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
although it's not a heavy coverage it's

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.770 
although it's not a heavy coverage it's
got<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.430> better<00:02:54.670> coverage<00:02:55.209> with<00:02:55.450> a<00:02:55.480> small

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
got a better coverage with a small

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.390 
got a better coverage with a small
amount<00:02:55.810> if<00:02:56.319> that<00:02:56.470> makes<00:02:56.680> sense<00:02:56.950> in<00:02:57.220> other

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
amount if that makes sense in other

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.490 
amount if that makes sense in other
words<00:02:58.260> less<00:02:59.260> is<00:02:59.440> better<00:02:59.650> I<00:03:01.350> Stanley<00:03:02.350> Park

expensive<00:04:42.800> products<00:04:43.800> I<00:04:44.100> mean<00:04:44.280> Rick<00:04:45.030> slammed

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
expensive products I mean Rick slammed

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.810 
expensive products I mean Rick slammed
for<00:04:45.510> these<00:04:46.230> two<00:04:46.770> products<00:04:47.460> the<00:04:49.820> foundation

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
for these two products the foundation

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.730 
for these two products the foundation
and<00:04:51.030> the<00:04:51.060> powder<00:04:51.360> will<00:04:52.320> set<00:04:52.560> you<00:04:52.710> back

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.750 
something in the region of sort of 50
pounds<00:04:56.150> so<00:04:57.150> they're<00:04:57.870> not<00:04:58.080> cheap<00:04:58.740> products<00:04:59.250> but

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
pounds so they're not cheap products but

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.140 
pounds so they're not cheap products but
the<00:04:59.880> thing<00:05:00.120> is<00:05:00.150> they<00:05:00.810> last<00:05:01.050> such<00:05:01.260> a<00:05:01.290> long<00:05:01.560> time

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
the thing is they last such a long time

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.270 
the thing is they last such a long time
like<00:05:03.150> I<00:05:03.360> some<00:05:03.660> all<00:05:03.780> you<00:05:03.930> mentioned<00:05:04.410> the<00:05:04.590> powder

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
like I some all you mentioned the powder

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.160 
like I some all you mentioned the powder
although<00:05:05.790> you<00:05:05.850> think<00:05:06.180> you<00:05:06.300> more<00:05:06.540> that's<00:05:06.930> so

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
although you think you more that's so

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.650 
although you think you more that's so
much<00:05:07.350> money<00:05:07.730> it's<00:05:08.730> such<00:05:08.940> a<00:05:08.970> night<00:05:09.210> like<00:05:09.450> you

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
much money it's such a night like you

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.780 
much money it's such a night like you
tease<00:05:09.930> but<00:05:10.320> you<00:05:10.920> haven't<00:05:11.280> going<00:05:11.430> to<00:05:11.490> buy<00:05:11.610> any

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790

more<00:05:11.970> power<00:05:12.240> in<00:05:12.450> there<00:05:12.630> for<00:05:12.810> not<00:05:12.900> is<00:05:13.650> because

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
more power in there for not is because

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.800 
more power in there for not is because
it<00:05:15.270> just<00:05:16.020> lasts<00:05:16.830> and<00:05:16.950> less<00:05:17.100> than<00:05:17.370> that<00:05:17.580> and<00:05:18.120> the

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
it just lasts and less than that and the

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.630 
it just lasts and less than that and the
simons<00:05:19.230> foundation<00:05:19.290> because<00:05:20.040> you<00:05:20.190> don't<00:05:20.400> use

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
simons foundation because you don't use

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.720 
simons foundation because you don't use
a<00:05:20.670> lot<00:05:20.850> I<00:05:21.450> mean<00:05:22.050> I've<00:05:22.590> been<00:05:22.650> using<00:05:23.190> this<00:05:23.460> knife

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
a lot I mean I've been using this knife

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.990 
a lot I mean I've been using this knife
probably<00:05:24.330> about<00:05:24.690> the<00:05:24.870> last<00:05:24.900> month<00:05:25.410> and<00:05:25.830> as<00:05:26.730> you

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
probably about the last month and as you

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.570 
probably about the last month and as you
can<00:05:27.180> see<00:05:27.210> I<00:05:27.720> mean<00:05:28.200> it<00:05:28.860> hasn't<00:05:29.100> even<00:05:29.280> gone

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
can see I mean it hasn't even gone

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.250 
can see I mean it hasn't even gone
behind<00:05:29.970> even<00:05:30.180> see<00:05:30.480> a<00:05:30.510> mark<00:05:30.780> where<00:05:30.900> it's<00:05:31.050> gone

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
behind even see a mark where it's gone

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.050 
behind even see a mark where it's gone
down

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
down

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.470 
down
so<00:05:33.040> yes<00:05:34.040> it<00:05:34.190> is<00:05:34.370> a<00:05:34.400> quite<00:05:34.760> a<00:05:34.820> big<00:05:35.060> initial

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
so yes it is a quite a big initial

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.690 
so yes it is a quite a big initial
outlay<00:05:35.840> to<00:05:36.500> sort<00:05:37.130> of<00:05:37.340> spent<00:05:37.610> to<00:05:38.000> spend<00:05:38.810> but<00:05:39.700> it

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
outlay to sort of spent to spend but it

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.610 
outlay to sort of spent to spend but it
lasts<00:05:41.060> a<00:05:41.120> long<00:05:41.240> time<00:05:41.300> so<00:05:41.870> really<00:05:42.200> I<00:05:42.230> suppose

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
lasts a long time so really I suppose

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.379 
lasts a long time so really I suppose
you<00:05:43.040> can<00:05:43.220> say<00:05:43.280> it's<00:05:43.580> cost<00:05:43.790> effective<00:05:43.970> for

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389 
you can say it's cost effective for

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:47.710 
you can say it's cost effective for
yourself<00:05:45.050> in<00:05:45.260> that<00:05:45.410> way<00:05:46.090> so<00:05:47.090> anyway<00:05:47.660> i'm

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720
