00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:07.089
 I like what I want today x after 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:10.769
 he converts when leaving the iphone the 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:13.719
 iphone 6 and were with six seats is 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.670
 welcome watching the art series and those who 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:19.630
 they have leaked from the internet but not 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:23.360
 I really know that it is also but the 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:27.350
 page of this article 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:30.740
 It is sider business and has been for 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.780
 time and they are very vibrant in the 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.780
 information that they can as it has 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.440
 sources very close to information 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:43.220
 Well the point is that I want to mention 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.040
 I 'm looking at this article 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.120
 it was quite frustrating to see that many 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:53.300
 of those of the 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:56.140
 Product news on iPhone 6 is 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.440
 they saw in past mind in 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.170
 in 24 then the title of this 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.370
 article caught my attention 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.220
 they say dear 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:10.479
 iphone 6 users welcome to 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:13.090
 2012 as the one who tries to insinuate us of 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:18.000
 that we are going backwards and already because 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:20.320
 feels like stuck without ideas and this 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.210
 can bring consequences to the brand 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.880
 but let's look at the civility is the 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.740
 similarities forgiveness that has the nexus 4 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:33.830
 and the iphone 6 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:37.910
 according to this source says that the screen 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.800
 the iphone 6 is 4.7 inches equal in 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.110
 the nexus 4 we find that for the 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.580
 screen 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:52.570
 we have is a resolution of 750 pixels 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:56.500
 and lexus 4 has 760 much better has 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:02:00.870
 nfs payments equally the lexus 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.870
 4 notification 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.459
 they have the same characteristics 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.159
 have writing suggestions 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.610
 also the two beniqueis processes 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:20.780
 jones 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:27.300
 communication applications both 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:29.790
 they have servers in the database 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:34.670
 for servers about photos 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:37.100
 equally the two have materi stats 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.860
 they have the news 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.250
 details of the information of the 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.630
 bacteria that means all this is 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:51.100
 It makes me very curious so many similarities 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:54.560
 on the android with them and it's because 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.740
 has always been characterized by thinking and 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.950
 think differently and do things more 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.010
 sophisticated and not be as common as the 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.930
 Android system but here we see that it 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.760
 backs down a little bit good 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:14.720
 point is that we hope that the 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:17.870
 facing a lack of character versus 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.799
 to innovation because now 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.099
 two years since he died two years and 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:28.190
 two years since steve jobs died and 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:30.379
 it seems that they are attacked and samsung 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.409
 nexus are brands that are evolving 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:36.890
 very fast you know about sam's in the year 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:39.170
 past took almost three devices in a 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.629
 year it took almost two years for 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.180
 innovate and come up with something that they have already 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.010
 gone from the android system then a 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.600
 point of view these are the similarities 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:54.610
 I should have them 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:56.710
 careful to keep its use suddenly 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.560
 what has made it different and what 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:02.640
 that has made him sell both his 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:07.330
 originality then friends I want 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.760
 conclude is news that I want to mention 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.110
 in this in this channel and in some way 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.700
 sarcastic is this source mention has 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.970
 I have similarities and it calls me a lot 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.250
 attention that I have left it 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.170
 is showing these characteristics in 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:27.460
 this device that I had been waiting for 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:30.370
 then let's hope that at levels are 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:33.639
 guards at the productivity level be 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:37.539
 much more efficient cellular and what 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:39.939
 may have other benefits to the 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:44.199
 that we have already seen physically compared 

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:47.800
 with the nexus 4 then basically this 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:49.210
 I wanted to share them with you and I hope that 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.090
 has attracted attention 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.460
 I go to the bottom part so they can read 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.419

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.780

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.409

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.599
 about 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:17.409
 new information that calls me the 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:23.559
 Attention 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:27.099
