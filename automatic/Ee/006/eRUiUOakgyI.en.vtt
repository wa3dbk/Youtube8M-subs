00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
it turns out just the opposite is true

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.300 
it turns out just the opposite is true
and<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.319> reason<00:01:58.470> that<00:01:58.649> has<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.130> lace

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
and and the reason that has the lace

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.190 
and and the reason that has the lace
like<00:01:59.550> leaves<00:01:59.910> is<00:02:00.360> because<00:02:00.569> it<00:02:00.750> grows<00:02:00.959> in<00:02:01.140> a

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
like leaves is because it grows in a

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.669 
like leaves is because it grows in a
heavy<00:02:01.410> river<00:02:01.920> flowing<00:02:03.080> with<00:02:04.080> a<00:02:04.110> lot<00:02:04.349> of<00:02:04.470> water

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
heavy river flowing with a lot of water

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.820 
heavy river flowing with a lot of water
and<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:06.330> lace<00:02:06.539> leaves<00:02:06.840> allow<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.259> leaves<00:02:07.590> to

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
and the lace leaves allow the leaves to

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.710 
and the lace leaves allow the leaves to
move<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.250> current<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.819> not<00:02:09.119> be<00:02:09.360> ripped

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
move in the current and not be ripped

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.380 
move in the current and not be ripped
away<00:02:09.899> from<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.379> plant<00:02:10.619> itself

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
away from the plant itself

away from the plant itself

gonna flourish for a while and then when

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.039 
gonna flourish for a while and then when
you<00:02:53.670> start<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:54.060> see<00:02:54.209> it<00:02:54.299> go<00:02:54.480> back<00:02:54.689> where<00:02:54.930> it's

some of the people nowadays they're

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.009 
some of the people nowadays they're
actually<00:02:56.939> taking<00:02:57.299> them<00:02:57.450> out<00:02:57.569> of<00:02:57.719> the<00:02:57.780> tank

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019

to go completely dormant for a month or

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.440 
to go completely dormant for a month or
two<00:03:04.889> and<00:03:05.430> then<00:03:05.489> they'll<00:03:05.730> replant<00:03:06.180> them<00:03:06.269> back

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
two and then they'll replant them back

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.479 
two and then they'll replant them back
into<00:03:06.659> the<00:03:06.840> water<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.379> they<00:03:08.040> start<00:03:08.370> to

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
into the water and they start to

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.550 
into the water and they start to
flourish<00:03:08.849> and<00:03:09.060> grow<00:03:09.090> all<00:03:09.450> over<00:03:09.480> again<00:03:09.870> now

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
flourish and grow all over again now

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.920 
flourish and grow all over again now
typically<00:03:11.040> we<00:03:11.340> think<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.700> highlight<00:03:12.359> plants

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
typically we think of highlight plants

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.509 
typically we think of highlight plants
as<00:03:13.049> being<00:03:13.319> difficult<00:03:13.530> because<00:03:14.099> many<00:03:14.310> people

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
as being difficult because many people

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.089 
as being difficult because many people
don't<00:03:14.849> want<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.269> buy<00:03:15.389> the<00:03:15.450> more<00:03:15.750> expensive

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
don't want to buy the more expensive

Brandon<00:03:22.139> says<00:03:22.409> not<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:23.239> it's<00:03:24.239> got<00:03:24.389> the<00:03:24.540> deeper

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
Brandon says not so it's got the deeper

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.170 
Brandon says not so it's got the deeper
green<00:03:25.139> leaves<00:03:25.500> so<00:03:25.769> it<00:03:25.889> can<00:03:26.010> tolerate<00:03:26.159> a<00:03:26.459> lower

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
green leaves so it can tolerate a lower

green leaves so it can tolerate a lower
amount<00:03:27.389> of<00:03:27.719> light<00:03:27.930> you<00:03:28.889> can<00:03:29.069> get<00:03:29.189> away<00:03:29.280> with<00:03:29.549> a

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
amount of light you can get away with a

amount of light you can get away with a

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:31.439 
load of medium light you can also go a

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:34.399 
load of medium light you can also go a
little<00:03:31.620> bit<00:03:31.799> higher<00:03:31.980> if<00:03:32.219> you<00:03:32.280> need<00:03:32.519> to<00:03:33.169> as<00:03:34.169> far

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409

now<00:03:45.900> Brandon<00:03:46.409> says<00:03:46.620> this<00:03:46.889> plant<00:03:47.189> does<00:03:47.729> need

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
now Brandon says this plant does need

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.990 
now Brandon says this plant does need
fertilizer<00:03:48.750> you<00:03:49.470> could<00:03:49.680> put<00:03:49.829> a<00:03:49.859> tab<00:03:50.159> in<00:03:50.579> around

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
fertilizer you could put a tab in around

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.429 
fertilizer you could put a tab in around
the<00:03:51.120> roots<00:03:51.359> and<00:03:51.629> that<00:03:51.750> would<00:03:51.900> be<00:03:51.989> an<00:03:52.109> easy<00:03:52.290> way

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:52.439 
the roots and that would be an easy way

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:53.929 
the roots and that would be an easy way
to<00:03:52.560> get<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:52.949> higher<00:03:53.129> dose<00:03:53.430> as<00:03:53.609> a<00:03:53.639> fertilizer

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
to get the higher dose as a fertilizer

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.569 
to get the higher dose as a fertilizer
for<00:03:54.449> that<00:03:54.569> plant<00:03:55.019> and<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.829> lace<00:03:56.009> plant<00:03:56.340> does

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
for that plant and the lace plant does

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.849 
for that plant and the lace plant does
cost<00:03:56.879> a<00:03:57.090> bit<00:03:57.269> more<00:03:57.299> than<00:03:57.540> others<00:03:57.780> typically<00:03:58.739> it

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
cost a bit more than others typically it

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.030 
cost a bit more than others typically it
sells<00:03:59.129> online<00:03:59.370> for<00:03:59.939> five<00:04:00.180> to<00:04:00.419> ten<00:04:00.629> dollars<00:04:01.040> it

is<00:04:02.069> more<00:04:02.370> expensive<00:04:02.579> most<00:04:03.269> of<00:04:03.419> the

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:03.509 
is more expensive most of the

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:05.119 
is more expensive most of the
applications<00:04:04.019> are<00:04:04.139> more<00:04:04.379> expensive<00:04:04.739> just

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
applications are more expensive just

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:06.949 
applications are more expensive just
because<00:04:05.370> they're<00:04:05.879> hard<00:04:06.090> to<00:04:06.150> find<00:04:06.239> you<00:04:06.659> have<00:04:06.810> to

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
because they're hard to find you have to

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.569 
because they're hard to find you have to
bring<00:04:07.199> them<00:04:07.319> in<00:04:07.439> from<00:04:07.560> Madagascar<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:08.459> then
