 skill games 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.880
 because poker is not a lottery p it is not like scoring goals from a non-half field 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.009

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.009

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.310
 it is not that the sixth place changed a lot from where you are on the fifth quarter 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.630
 third time mind 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.710
 note the difference for me to have been to win by not giving prison line 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.310
 just for that of the pike to say therefore it is not that it recriminates really 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.090
 success on pallosu fourth place that I could hold because I didn't curious the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.510

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.509
 ditch 'past 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.509

 we'll see, we'll see it on TV 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.880

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.290
 it is also the beautiful and the ugly but also beautiful of the few famous people you are 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.650
 characters we professionals really won't be able to campaign so let's hope 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.060
