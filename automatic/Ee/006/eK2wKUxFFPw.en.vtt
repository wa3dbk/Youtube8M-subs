00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 and we are going to display today the first 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.710
 report of a special series on the 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.899
 star neymar 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.730
 which will be coming so skillfully and 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:15.059
 that he can invent in the world 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:17.699
 let's see what he does the way 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.130
 does it turned into out of series 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.340
 I think it's because hardly 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.580
 he repeats the same move neymar name 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.760
 inherited from the father the slim boy 66 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.820
 kilos one meter and seventy -two of 19 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.040
 years and qualities that make it 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.350
 be the biggest revelation of football 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:44.340
 Brazilian of recent times 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:48.420
 he is a player well continues 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.430
 dribbling from dribbles but what the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.410
 neymar's secret because he can 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.680
 do things that almost no other 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:10.500
 player does where creativity comes from 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:12.720
 the speed you choose in 97 this 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.240
 futsal coach saw in a 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.460
 six year old child something very 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.220
 different when he got the ball through the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.650
 The first time I saw his skill 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.420
 the ball is a little 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.549
 which was different from the other 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.229
 girls the motives of neymar in 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.229
 the ears of the 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.880
 leaders of the saints quickly gave 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.150
 a way to take to the field 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.460
 in 2004 or through neymar football 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.439
 It was created in the saints football club 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.920
 pre-mirim and mirim category 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.890
 does not exist this category and was created 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.530
 to go to work for him and there 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.520
 gave a job for all of us not connected to 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.579
 none 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.280
 from there neymar received treatment 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.920
 I had special contract and salary 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.259
 It's all at 12 years old, this psychologist. 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.540
 followed his first steps in the 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.090
 And with her we went to try 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.849
 to understand the secret of neymar 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.400
 the neymar he had a 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.069
 productivity characteristic 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.409
 it has a feature of 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.930
 self-motivation he does not wait for the technician 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:21.150
 motivate it has it internally 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.280
 he made his professional debut in 2009 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.640
 in such a short career 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.150
 neymar already collects unforgettable goals 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.150
 of love 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.210
 the saint andré 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:45.660
 The Flemish léo Moor was 3 thousand years old. 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.900
 seeing here you will be able to pass in the middle of it 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.220
 I pulled the ball and managed to pass it 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.570
 saw borges 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:58.110
 I always do in 2012 based on him I 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.330
 I'm going to guess catches the ball came 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.150
 Renato was able to explore an 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:09.810
 little that moment was for now has 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:18.690
 past the half moon with michela here I go 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:20.459
 to play to be here yet all right but the 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.720
 that really moves the imagination of the 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.970
 Brazilian people when one thinks of 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.680
 neymar is not what he did but rather that 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.720
 Must do from now on. 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.360
 on the eve of the World Cup 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.940
 clubs the planet is about to meet 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.620
 the genius of the Santista boy and 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.860
 neymar ensures that you do not have just one 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.600
 letter on the sleeve but several if you have one 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:46.350
 group planning to do scene did not 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:49.620
 something different that you want 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:54.290
 save for both I do not know who 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:59.280
 sold the property are going to leave 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:01.200
 is training these videos in 3d you 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.320
 not wrong but it is something that the public does not 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.320
 knows no one's done yet will roll
