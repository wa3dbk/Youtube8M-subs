hi<00:00:11.130> I'm<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.580> lawn<00:00:11.700> Smith<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.300> in<00:00:12.599> this<00:00:12.750> video

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
hi I'm the lawn Smith and in this video

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.049 
hi I'm the lawn Smith and in this video
I'm<00:00:13.530> going<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.830> show<00:00:14.040> you<00:00:14.099> how<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.639> use<00:00:15.030> a

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
I'm going to show you how to use a

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.050 
I'm going to show you how to use a
spreader<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.660> fertilize<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.350> lawn<00:00:16.880> this<00:00:17.880> is

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
spreader to fertilize the lawn this is

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.609 
spreader to fertilize the lawn this is
the<00:00:18.180> spreader<00:00:18.420> I'm<00:00:18.600> going<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.930> use<00:00:19.199> which<00:00:19.500> is

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
the spreader I'm going to use which is

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.070 
the spreader I'm going to use which is
basically<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.369> rotary<00:00:21.090> spreader<00:00:21.330> just<00:00:21.900> like

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
basically a rotary spreader just like

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.500 
basically a rotary spreader just like
these<00:00:22.320> without<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.160> wheels<00:00:23.369> this<00:00:23.939> means<00:00:24.240> it's

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
these without the wheels this means it's

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.750 
these without the wheels this means it's
very<00:00:24.840> very<00:00:25.080> flexible<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.680> use<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.220> very<00:00:26.519> easy

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
very very flexible to use and very easy

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.410 
very very flexible to use and very easy
around<00:00:27.180> steps<00:00:27.570> slopes<00:00:28.289> shrubs<00:00:29.220> trees<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.939> any

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
around steps slopes shrubs trees and any

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.939 
around steps slopes shrubs trees and any
other<00:00:30.599> kind<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.960> obstacle<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.500> you've<00:00:31.710> got

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
other kind of obstacle that you've got

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.729 
other kind of obstacle that you've got
it's<00:00:32.520> also<00:00:32.700> great<00:00:33.090> for<00:00:33.149> an<00:00:33.660> area<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.230> anything

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
it's also great for an area of anything

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.840 
it's also great for an area of anything
from<00:00:34.890> two<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.489> two<00:00:35.670> thousand<00:00:36.149> square<00:00:36.239> meters

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
from two to two thousand square meters

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.670 
from two to two thousand square meters
when<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.879> apply<00:00:39.239> fertilizer<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:40.020> always<00:00:40.350> apply

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
when I apply fertilizer I always apply

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.520 
when I apply fertilizer I always apply
it<00:00:40.739> at<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.070> half<00:00:41.309> rate<00:00:41.700> which<00:00:42.329> means<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:43.050> when

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
it at a half rate which means that when

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.889 
it at a half rate which means that when
it's<00:00:43.710> applied<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.550> then<00:00:44.850> have<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.059> reapply<00:00:45.809> it

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
it's applied I then have to reapply it

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.959 
it's applied I then have to reapply it
from<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.350> different<00:00:46.530> direction<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.489> bring<00:00:47.850> it

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
from a different direction to bring it

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.180 
from a different direction to bring it
up<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.120> full<00:00:48.420> rate<00:00:48.690> now<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.410> can<00:00:49.649> do<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:50.010> one

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
up to full rate now you can do this one

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.130 
up to full rate now you can do this one
of<00:00:50.219> two<00:00:50.370> ways<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:51.030> can<00:00:51.210> do<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.570> lawn<00:00:51.780> as<00:00:52.020> you

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
of two ways you can do the lawn as you

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.439 
of two ways you can do the lawn as you
normally<00:00:52.620> would<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.039> then<00:00:53.640> go<00:00:53.820> crossways

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
normally would and then go crossways

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.029 
normally would and then go crossways
across<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.989> lawn<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.410> reapply<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
across the lawn and reapply the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.220 
across the lawn and reapply the
fertilizer<00:00:56.670> or<00:00:56.969> as<00:00:57.570> I'm<00:00:57.719> going<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.020> show<00:00:58.199> you

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
fertilizer or as I'm going to show you

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.310 
fertilizer or as I'm going to show you
in<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.859> video<00:00:59.239> the<00:01:00.239> procedure<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.960> going<00:01:01.050> to

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
in this video the procedure is going to

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.470 
in this video the procedure is going to
be<00:01:01.469> exactly<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.160> same<00:01:02.190> if<00:01:02.670> you're<00:01:02.879> using<00:01:03.239> a

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
be exactly the same if you're using a

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.050 
be exactly the same if you're using a
rotary<00:01:03.690> spreader<00:01:04.170> like<00:01:04.559> either<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.129> these<00:01:05.309> but

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
rotary spreader like either of these but

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.969 
rotary spreader like either of these but
unfortunately<00:01:06.689> if<00:01:06.840> you're<00:01:07.020> using<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.619> drop

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
unfortunately if you're using a drop

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.969 
unfortunately if you're using a drop
spreader<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:09.110> settings<00:01:10.110> don't<00:01:10.380> go<00:01:10.710> low

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
spreader the settings don't go low

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.240 
spreader the settings don't go low
enough<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.549> allow<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.470> do<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> half<00:01:13.920> rate

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
enough to allow you to do a half rate

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.550 
enough to allow you to do a half rate
spread<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.180> you're<00:01:15.390> going<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.350> use

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
spread so you're going to have to use

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.010 
spread so you're going to have to use
your<00:01:16.890> normal<00:01:17.130> procedure<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:18.090> just<00:01:18.540> do<00:01:18.720> one

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
your normal procedure and just do one

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.289 
your normal procedure and just do one
spread<00:01:19.500> it's<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.100> shame<00:01:20.369> because<00:01:20.670> these<00:01:21.119> are

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
spread it's a shame because these are

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.270 
spread it's a shame because these are
the<00:01:21.390> kind<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.720> spreaders<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.710> ultimately

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
the kind of spreaders that ultimately

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.039 
the kind of spreaders that ultimately
would<00:01:23.580> benefit<00:01:23.970> most<00:01:24.210> from<00:01:24.450> overlap

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
would benefit most from overlap

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.530 
would benefit most from overlap
spreading<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:26.159> let's<00:01:26.580> go<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.000> get<00:01:27.240> on<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
spreading so let's go and get on the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.819 
spreading so let's go and get on the
lawn<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.460> take<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.610> from<00:01:29.729> there<00:01:30.710> right<00:01:31.710> so

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
lawn and take it from there right so

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.679 
lawn and take it from there right so
here<00:01:31.979> we<00:01:32.070> are<00:01:32.100> on<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.430> lawn<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.850> normally

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
here we are on the lawn and normally

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.480 
here we are on the lawn and normally
you're<00:01:33.869> going<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.229> start<00:01:34.500> on<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.829> longest<00:01:35.310> or

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
you're going to start on the longest or

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.359 
you're going to start on the longest or
the<00:01:35.610> straightest<00:01:36.150> edge<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.840> your<00:01:37.200> lawn<00:01:37.470> but<00:01:38.250> in

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
the straightest edge on your lawn but in

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.160 
the straightest edge on your lawn but in
this<00:01:38.490> situation<00:01:38.939> because<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.780> want<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:39.990> show

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
this situation because I want to show

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.080 
this situation because I want to show
you<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.890> turns<00:01:41.250> which<00:01:41.820> are<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:41.970> most

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
you the turns which are the most

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.749 
you the turns which are the most
important<00:01:42.630> element<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:43.439> I'm<00:01:44.009> starting

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
important element of this I'm starting

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.819 
important element of this I'm starting
on<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.970> shortest<00:01:45.450> edge<00:01:45.689> now<00:01:46.320> when<00:01:46.710> the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
on the shortest edge now when the

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.560 
on the shortest edge now when the
fertilizer<00:01:47.280> comes<00:01:47.579> out<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:47.970> spread<00:01:48.270> it's

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
fertilizer comes out of this spread it's

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.620 
fertilizer comes out of this spread it's
going<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.960> land<00:01:49.259> as<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.950> can<00:01:50.250> see<00:01:50.460> about<00:01:51.240> two

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
going to land as you can see about two

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.300 
going to land as you can see about two
meters<00:01:51.990> away<00:01:52.079> from<00:01:52.200> me<00:01:52.649> two<00:01:52.799> meters<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.250> the

weed<00:02:13.370> killer<00:02:13.670> in<00:02:13.910> this<00:02:14.120> so<00:02:14.600> it's<00:02:14.720> not<00:02:14.840> going<00:02:14.990> to

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
weed killer in this so it's not going to

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.570 
weed killer in this so it's not going to

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
now I now need to position myself to go

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.350 
now I now need to position myself to go
back<00:02:20.300> down<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.720> lawn<00:02:20.870> now<00:02:21.140> normally<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:23.180> this

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
back down the lawn now normally and this

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.730 
back down the lawn now normally and this
is<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.690> edge<00:02:23.810> of<00:02:23.960> where<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.170> fertilizer

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
is the edge of where the fertilizer

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.160 
is the edge of where the fertilizer
landed<00:02:25.250> normally<00:02:25.850> you<00:02:26.480> would<00:02:26.630> go<00:02:26.780> further

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
landed normally you would go further

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.650 
landed normally you would go further
along<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.770> lawn<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:28.670> that<00:02:28.820> when<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.090> spread

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
along the lawn so that when you spread

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.410 
along the lawn so that when you spread
down<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.140> lawn<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.560> fertiliser<00:02:31.130> landed<00:02:31.880> up

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
down the lawn the fertiliser landed up

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.810 
down the lawn the fertiliser landed up
to<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.290> spread<00:02:33.650> that<00:02:33.950> you've<00:02:34.130> just<00:02:34.400> put<00:02:34.610> down

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
to the spread that you've just put down

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.720 
to the spread that you've just put down
but<00:02:35.720> we're<00:02:35.930> overlap<00:02:36.410> spreading<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:37.400> what<00:02:37.610> we

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
but we're overlap spreading so what we

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.640 
but we're overlap spreading so what we
need<00:02:37.880> to<00:02:38.000> do<00:02:38.090> now<00:02:38.300> is<00:02:38.450> actually<00:02:38.780> carry<00:02:39.140> on<00:02:39.350> down

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
need to do now is actually carry on down

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.340 
need to do now is actually carry on down
the<00:02:39.800> lawn<00:02:39.980> from<00:02:40.550> this<00:02:40.790> point<00:02:41.140> which<00:02:42.140> means
