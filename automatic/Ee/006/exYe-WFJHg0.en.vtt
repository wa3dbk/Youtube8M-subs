both to talk about that presumably you

both to talk about that presumably you
can<00:02:08.640> understand<00:02:09.000> those<00:02:09.149> concerns<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.780> every

can understand those concerns that every

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.490 
can understand those concerns that every
civilian<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.619> killed<00:02:11.430> creates<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.120> potential

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
civilian is killed creates a potential

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.080 
civilian is killed creates a potential
young<00:02:13.830> man<00:02:14.010> or<00:02:14.040> young<00:02:14.220> woman<00:02:14.670> who<00:02:14.790> becomes

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
young man or young woman who becomes

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.670 
young man or young woman who becomes
radicalized<00:02:17.270> absolutely<00:02:18.270> I<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:18.480> think<00:02:18.900> your

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
radicalized absolutely I I think your

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.140 
radicalized absolutely I I think your
your<00:02:19.950> your<00:02:20.280> guests<00:02:20.550> there<00:02:20.700> make<00:02:20.880> some<00:02:21.030> very

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
your your guests there make some very

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.870 
your your guests there make some very
valid<00:02:21.450> points<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:22.080> think<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:22.680> on<00:02:23.580> one<00:02:23.640> hand

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
valid points I think that on one hand

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.660 
valid points I think that on one hand
you<00:02:24.210> have<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.450> look<00:02:24.600> at<00:02:24.750> drones<00:02:25.050> as<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.920> method

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
you have to look at drones as a method

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.580 
you have to look at drones as a method
of<00:02:26.760> conducting<00:02:26.970> warfare<00:02:27.600> just<00:02:28.200> like<00:02:28.350> any

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
of conducting warfare just like any

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.230 
of conducting warfare just like any
other<00:02:28.710> method<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.400> conducting<00:02:29.550> warfare<00:02:30.120> and

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
other method of conducting warfare and

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.630 
other method of conducting warfare and
like<00:02:30.420> missiles<00:02:30.840> like<00:02:31.050> bombing<00:02:31.530> runs<00:02:31.740> like

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
like missiles like bombing runs like

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.280 
like missiles like bombing runs like
what<00:02:32.820> soldiers<00:02:33.209> would<00:02:33.390> do<00:02:33.540> directly<00:02:34.080> in

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
what soldiers would do directly in

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.560 
what soldiers would do directly in
person<00:02:34.709> so<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.550> is<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.700> method<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.120> warfare<00:02:36.270> and

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
person so it is a method of warfare and

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.850 
person so it is a method of warfare and
I<00:02:36.660> have<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.050> recognize<00:02:37.380> that's<00:02:37.590> what<00:02:37.740> we're

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
I have to recognize that's what we're

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.910 
I have to recognize that's what we're
engaged<00:02:38.190> in<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:39.000> second<00:02:39.600> however<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.230> are<00:02:40.709> we

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
engaged in the second however is are we

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.920 
engaged in the second however is are we
using<00:02:41.160> drones<00:02:41.640> in<00:02:41.880> ways<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.120> make<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.750> too

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
using drones in ways that make it too

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.840 
using drones in ways that make it too
easy<00:02:42.959> for<00:02:43.350> us<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.650> just<00:02:43.980> go<00:02:44.160> ahead<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.370> flip<00:02:44.700> a

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
easy for us to just go ahead and flip a

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.170 
easy for us to just go ahead and flip a
switch<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.270> do<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:45.750> are<00:02:46.350> we<00:02:47.180> insensitive

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
switch and do it and are we insensitive

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.870 
switch and do it and are we insensitive
to<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.810> consequences<00:02:49.500> that<00:02:49.920> we<00:02:50.310> are<00:02:50.459> creating

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
to the consequences that we are creating

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.310 
to the consequences that we are creating
through<00:02:51.239> these<00:02:51.420> strikes<00:02:51.720> such<00:02:51.989> as<00:02:52.140> those<00:02:52.290> that

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
through these strikes such as those that

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.050 
through these strikes such as those that
your<00:02:52.620> guests<00:02:52.830> mentioned<00:02:53.070> so<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.730> think<00:02:53.880> there's

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
your guests mentioned so I think there's

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.490 
your guests mentioned so I think there's
a<00:02:54.120> lot<00:02:54.300> more<00:02:54.360> we<00:02:54.810> should<00:02:54.840> be<00:02:55.140> doing<00:02:55.260> these

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
a lot more we should be doing these

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.620 
a lot more we should be doing these
United<00:02:55.920> States<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.370> get<00:02:56.940> control<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:57.450> this

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
United States to get control of this

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.030 
United States to get control of this
program<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.320> make<00:02:58.410> sure<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.800> what<00:02:58.890> we're

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
program and make sure that what we're

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.830 
program and make sure that what we're
doing<00:02:59.070> makes<00:02:59.459> sense<00:02:59.790> what<00:03:00.060> about<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.420> Aussies

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
doing makes sense what about the Aussies

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.720 
doing makes sense what about the Aussies
are<00:03:00.870> very<00:03:01.230> different<00:03:01.410> issues<00:03:01.800> you<00:03:02.459> asked<00:03:02.580> the

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
are very different issues you asked the

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.800 
are very different issues you asked the
question<00:03:02.760> but<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.239> didn't<00:03:03.420> really<00:03:03.510> give<00:03:03.630> us

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
question but you didn't really give us

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.300 
question but you didn't really give us
the<00:03:03.930> answer<00:03:04.350> do<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.590> think<00:03:04.860> America<00:03:05.280> is

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
the answer do you think America is

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.280 
the answer do you think America is
insensitive<00:03:05.910> to<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.150> consequences<00:03:06.570> of<00:03:06.930> drone

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
insensitive to the consequences of drone

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.400 
insensitive to the consequences of drone
strikes<00:03:08.480> well<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.510> think<00:03:09.690> we<00:03:09.989> are<00:03:10.140> not

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
strikes well I think we are not

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.410 
strikes well I think we are not
sensitive<00:03:10.709> enough<00:03:11.010> let's<00:03:11.459> put<00:03:11.610> it<00:03:11.700> that<00:03:11.730> way<00:03:11.850> I

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
sensitive enough let's put it that way I

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.660 
sensitive enough let's put it that way I
think<00:03:12.720> that<00:03:13.140> surely<00:03:13.620> President<00:03:14.100> Obama<00:03:14.310> others

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
think that surely President Obama others

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.010 
think that surely President Obama others
around<00:03:14.880> him<00:03:15.060> do<00:03:15.300> care<00:03:15.570> about<00:03:15.600> the

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
around him do care about the

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.780 
around him do care about the
consequences<00:03:16.220> but<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.250> don't<00:03:17.459> think<00:03:17.610> we've

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
consequences but I don't think we've

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.190 
consequences but I don't think we've
done<00:03:17.940> enough<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.420> really<00:03:18.660> get<00:03:18.930> our<00:03:19.049> arms

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
done enough to really get our arms

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.380
