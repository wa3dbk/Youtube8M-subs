00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.160
 National Guard of Ukraine 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.400
 Well 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.800
 ohrenet 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.870
 still decided my 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.490
 tonight as a result of tactical 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.050
 Army failures southeast lost 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.610
 control over key roadblock in

 Happiness area now line 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.910
 the front passes here a little closer to

 Lugansk to metalist village 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.990
 however this road is now absolutely 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.550
 decides nothing because the front line and 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.920
 National Guard under attack can go 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.840
 literally right or left where the fields are 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.500

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.960
 kilometers 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.820
 if you look at the map it becomes clear 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.560
 logic of punitive operation to Luhansk 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.690

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.900
 blockade of the movement of militants 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.460
 these roads are active and most likely

 Ministry of Defense of Ukraine after 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.630
