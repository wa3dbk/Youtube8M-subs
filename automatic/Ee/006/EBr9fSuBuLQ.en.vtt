00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
Neptune I've sent me this knife to

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.600 
Neptune I've sent me this knife to
sharpen<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.090> also<00:00:30.449> test<00:00:30.890> which<00:00:31.890> I've<00:00:32.070> tested

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
sharpen and also test which I've tested

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.490 
sharpen and also test which I've tested
and<00:00:33.110> did<00:00:34.110> pretty<00:00:34.290> well<00:00:34.969> so<00:00:35.969> since<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:37.020> cut<00:00:37.290> with

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
and did pretty well so since I cut with

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.700 
and did pretty well so since I cut with
it<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.010> sharpened<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:39.350> maybe<00:00:40.350> not<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
it and I sharpened it I maybe not the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.380 
it and I sharpened it I maybe not the
most<00:00:40.920> highly<00:00:41.129> qualified<00:00:41.370> person<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.180> do

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
most highly qualified person to do

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.760 
most highly qualified person to do
review<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.260> think<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:44.070> could<00:00:44.760> safely

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
review on it but I think I could safely

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.110 
review on it but I think I could safely
talk<00:00:46.770> about<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.190> what<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.370> like<00:00:47.579> about<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:48.000> when

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
talk about it what I like about it when

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.819 
talk about it what I like about it when
I<00:00:48.149> don't<00:00:48.710> it<00:00:49.730> is<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:51.270> think<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.690> folding<00:00:52.170> kukri<00:00:52.620> I

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
I don't it is I think a folding kukri I

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.350 
I don't it is I think a folding kukri I
think<00:00:53.579> Dave<00:00:54.829> described<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.949> as<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.250> first<00:00:57.120> of

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
think Dave described it as that first of

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.579 
think Dave described it as that first of
all<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.780> big-ass<00:00:58.109> knife<00:00:59.660> here's<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.719> ZT<00:01:01.140> 301

all it's a big-ass knife here's a ZT 301

paramilitary 2 and Leroux tactical Dillo
I<00:01:08.610> don't<00:01:08.820> know<00:01:08.909> if<00:01:09.030> any<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.330> guys<00:01:09.479> have

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
I don't know if any of you guys have

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.840 
I don't know if any of you guys have
this<00:01:09.960> but<00:01:10.290> if<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.890> order<00:01:11.159> gun<00:01:11.340> parts<00:01:11.700> from

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
this but if you order gun parts from

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.910 
this but if you order gun parts from
Leroux<00:01:12.299> tactical<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.960> always<00:01:13.500> get<00:01:13.710> one<00:01:13.830> of

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
Leroux tactical you always get one of

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.800 
Leroux tactical you always get one of
these<00:01:14.010> armadillos<00:01:14.420> it's<00:01:15.420> pretty<00:01:15.630> much<00:01:15.750> a

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
these armadillos it's pretty much a

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.109 
these armadillos it's pretty much a
bottle<00:01:16.229> opener<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:18.380> bottle<00:01:19.380> opener<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:20.189> a

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
bottle opener and a bottle opener and a

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.289 
bottle opener and a bottle opener and a
can<00:01:21.900> opener<00:01:22.170> right<00:01:22.710> here<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.009> think<00:01:23.369> now<00:01:24.150> it's

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
can opener right here I think now it's

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.120 
can opener right here I think now it's
another<00:01:24.509> bottle<00:01:24.840> opener<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.530> two<00:01:25.950> different

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
another bottle opener to two different

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.730 
another bottle opener to two different
bottle<00:01:26.610> openers<00:01:27.020> anyway<00:01:28.020> I'll<00:01:28.320> probably<00:01:28.350> do<00:01:28.710> a

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
bottle openers anyway I'll probably do a

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.130 
bottle openers anyway I'll probably do a
video<00:01:28.950> on<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.340> later<00:01:29.610> but<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.600> know<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.900> lot<00:01:31.110> of

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
video on this later but I know a lot of

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.590 
video on this later but I know a lot of
people<00:01:31.500> are<00:01:31.560> gun<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:32.070> lot<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.640> nice<00:01:32.880> people<00:01:33.150> are

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
people are gun a lot of nice people are

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.830 
people are gun a lot of nice people are
also<00:01:33.780> gun<00:01:34.170> people<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.770> figured<00:01:35.540> some<00:01:36.540> people

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
also gun people so I figured some people

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.770 
also gun people so I figured some people
might<00:01:37.020> have<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.729> anyway<00:01:38.729> they're<00:01:39.450> size

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
might have this anyway they're size

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.749 
might have this anyway they're size
comparisons<00:01:43.520> it<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> big<00:01:45.060> very<00:01:46.049> big<00:01:46.110> knife

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
comparisons it is a big very big knife

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.330 
comparisons it is a big very big knife
but<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:48.119> doesn't<00:01:48.600> weigh<00:01:48.899> all<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.649> much<00:01:49.890> I

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
but it doesn't weigh all that much I

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.179 
but it doesn't weigh all that much I
mean<00:01:50.790> it's<00:01:51.149> not<00:01:51.390> extremely<00:01:52.350> heavy<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:52.890> it

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
mean it's not extremely heavy but it

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.310 
mean it's not extremely heavy but it
does<00:01:53.340> have<00:01:53.549> some<00:01:53.729> heft<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.090> it

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
does have some heft to it

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.280 
does have some heft to it
the<00:01:55.619> jimping<00:01:56.159> is<00:01:56.850> really<00:01:57.450> good<00:01:57.689> something<00:01:58.229> I

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
the jimping is really good something I

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.859 
the jimping is really good something I
noticed<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.890> jimping<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.490> extremely<00:02:00.420> Griffey

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
noticed the jimping is extremely Griffey

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.889 
noticed the jimping is extremely Griffey
it's<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.860> almost<00:02:02.759> grippy<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.450> point<00:02:03.689> that

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
it's a almost grippy to the point that

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.490 
it's a almost grippy to the point that
it<00:02:04.020> can<00:02:04.049> be<00:02:04.320> uncomfortable<00:02:04.969> but<00:02:05.969> I<00:02:06.390> like<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.409> I

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
it can be uncomfortable but I like it I

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.130 
it can be uncomfortable but I like it I
tend<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.399> more<00:02:08.539> aggressive<00:02:09.539> jimping

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
tend to like the more aggressive jimping

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.600 
tend to like the more aggressive jimping
this<00:02:10.379> right<00:02:10.619> here<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.009> just<00:02:11.190> kind<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.430> dumb

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
this right here is just kind of dumb

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.220 
this right here is just kind of dumb
because<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.150> hurts<00:02:12.360> your<00:02:12.480> fingers

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
because it hurts your fingers

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.260 
because it hurts your fingers
but<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.890> gypping<00:02:14.220> on<00:02:14.310> thumb<00:02:14.580> ramp<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:14.970> really

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
but the gypping on thumb ramp is really

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.930 
but the gypping on thumb ramp is really
good<00:02:15.739> I'll<00:02:16.739> take<00:02:16.950> this<00:02:17.069> opportunity<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.730> do

good I'll take this opportunity to do

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.140 
good I'll take this opportunity to do
some<00:02:18.150> close-ups<00:02:18.750> of<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.379> knife<00:02:19.819> so<00:02:20.819> that<00:02:20.970> you

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
some close-ups of the knife so that you

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.320 
some close-ups of the knife so that you
can<00:02:21.330> see<00:02:22.519> see<00:02:23.519> what<00:02:23.670> it's<00:02:23.819> all<00:02:23.940> about

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
can see see what it's all about

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.009 
can see see what it's all about
there<00:02:24.660> they<00:02:25.019> are<00:02:25.050> wood<00:02:25.440> handles<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:27.720> can<00:02:27.870> see

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
there they are wood handles you can see

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.900 
there they are wood handles you can see
that<00:02:28.170> recurve<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:28.980> I've<00:02:29.069> already<00:02:29.489> sharpened

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
that recurve and I've already sharpened

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.370 
that recurve and I've already sharpened
it<00:02:30.150> for<00:02:30.180> him<00:02:30.450> already<00:02:30.599> did<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:30.900> video<00:02:31.050> on<00:02:31.260> that

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
it for him already did a video on that

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.729 
it for him already did a video on that
but<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.640> edge<00:02:32.760> is<00:02:33.000> now<00:02:33.150> 36<00:02:33.780> degrees<00:02:34.110> inclusive

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
but the edge is now 36 degrees inclusive

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.900 
but the edge is now 36 degrees inclusive
came<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.640> me<00:02:35.790> around<00:02:36.150> 42

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910

steel 13c i think but it's made by
bowler<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.500> it's<00:02:52.920> pretty<00:02:53.640> sure<00:02:53.790> it's<00:02:53.940> cross

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
bowler and it's pretty sure it's cross

rolled and everything like that it's a

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.640 
rolled and everything like that it's a
really<00:02:56.849> good<00:02:57.030> steel<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.720> did<00:02:57.900> very<00:02:57.930> well<00:02:58.200> in<00:02:58.380> my

test which my test isn't really
scientific<00:03:01.620> or<00:03:01.769> anything<00:03:01.920> so<00:03:02.840> you<00:03:03.840> see<00:03:04.319> the

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
mean I can't blame them he's testing the

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.069 
mean I can't blame them he's testing the
knife<00:03:16.500> so<00:03:17.060> he<00:03:18.060> wants<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.329> know<00:03:18.480> exactly<00:03:18.870> what

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
knife so he wants to know exactly what

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.110 
knife so he wants to know exactly what
it'll<00:03:19.290> do<00:03:20.030> uh<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.569> is<00:03:21.720> a<00:03:21.750> liner<00:03:22.049> lock<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:23.120> it

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
it'll do uh it is a liner lock and it

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.789 
it'll do uh it is a liner lock and it
has<00:03:24.239> a<00:03:24.269> safety<00:03:24.540> feature<00:03:24.930> back<00:03:25.319> here<00:03:25.590> you

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
has a safety feature back here you

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.490 
has a safety feature back here you
engage<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.459> safety<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.180> it<00:03:27.900> keeps<00:03:28.109> the<00:03:28.290> liner

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
engage the safety and it keeps the liner

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.160

for<00:03:28.769> being<00:03:28.950> pushed<00:03:29.190> over<00:03:29.400> I<00:03:29.989> personally<00:03:30.989> think

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
for being pushed over I personally think

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.440 
for being pushed over I personally think
that's<00:03:31.319> gimmicky<00:03:31.859> I<00:03:32.010> hate<00:03:32.700> safeties<00:03:33.239> on<00:03:33.389> the

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
that's gimmicky I hate safeties on the

that's gimmicky I hate safeties on the
knife<00:03:33.630> I<00:03:33.900> think<00:03:34.889> if<00:03:34.980> it's<00:03:35.160> built<00:03:35.430> well<00:03:35.639> it

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
knife I think if it's built well it

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.059 
knife I think if it's built well it
shouldn't<00:03:36.150> need<00:03:36.269> a<00:03:36.329> safety<00:03:36.630> but<00:03:37.260> it's<00:03:37.680> here<00:03:37.980> if

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
shouldn't need a safety but it's here if

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.690 
shouldn't need a safety but it's here if
you<00:03:38.160> need<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:39.680> he<00:03:40.680> has<00:03:40.859> beaten<00:03:41.160> on<00:03:41.340> this<00:03:41.489> knife

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
to the point where it has developed some

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.319 
to the point where it has developed some
serious<00:03:45.180> vertical<00:03:45.600> blade-play<00:03:46.100> but<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:48.120> lock

serious vertical blade-play but the lock
absolutely<00:03:49.200> will<00:03:49.410> not<00:03:49.590> fail<00:03:50.750> I've<00:03:51.750> tried<00:03:52.109> to

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
absolutely will not fail I've tried to

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.289 
absolutely will not fail I've tried to
make<00:03:52.410> it<00:03:52.530> fill<00:03:52.769> using<00:03:53.370> modern<00:03:53.819> methods<00:03:54.209> I

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
make it fill using modern methods I

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.660 
make it fill using modern methods I
don't<00:03:54.480> Spina<00:03:54.780> like<00:03:54.989> knives<00:03:55.200> but<00:03:55.620> I<00:03:55.859> put

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
don't Spina like knives but I put

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.390 
don't Spina like knives but I put
pressure<00:03:56.940> on<00:03:57.299> this<00:03:57.420> knife<00:03:57.660> and<00:03:58.019> as<00:03:58.410> you<00:03:59.220> can

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
pressure on this knife and as you can

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.470 
pressure on this knife and as you can
see<00:04:00.349> when<00:04:01.349> it's<00:04:01.500> over<00:04:02.010> like<00:04:02.400> that<00:04:02.670> it's<00:04:03.090> okay

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
see when it's over like that it's okay

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.180 
see when it's over like that it's okay
but<00:04:03.720> as<00:04:03.810> soon<00:04:03.989> as<00:04:04.049> you<00:04:04.170> put<00:04:04.380> pressure<00:04:04.620> on<00:04:04.889> it<00:04:04.920> it

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
but as soon as you put pressure on it it

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.970 
but as soon as you put pressure on it it
moves<00:04:05.489> over<00:04:05.940> but<00:04:06.840> it<00:04:06.989> will<00:04:07.349> not<00:04:07.530> go<00:04:07.769> any

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
moves over but it will not go any

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.000 
moves over but it will not go any
further<00:04:08.220> than<00:04:08.849> that<00:04:08.910> right<00:04:09.239> there<00:04:09.299> that<00:04:10.010> is

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
further than that right there that is

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.250 
further than that right there that is
absolutely<00:04:11.609> as<00:04:11.849> far<00:04:12.120> as<00:04:12.269> a<00:04:12.299> lot<00:04:12.510> more<00:04:12.540> will

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
absolutely as far as a lot more will

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.190 
absolutely as far as a lot more will
travel<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:13.919> it<00:04:14.579> stays<00:04:14.989> so<00:04:16.760> it<00:04:17.760> may<00:04:17.940> not<00:04:18.090> be<00:04:18.329> the

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
travel and it stays so it may not be the

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.670 
travel and it stays so it may not be the
most<00:04:19.349> solid<00:04:19.859> knife<00:04:20.070> but<00:04:20.669> it<00:04:21.500> it<00:04:22.500> won't

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
most solid knife but it it won't

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.580 
most solid knife but it it won't
disengage<00:04:23.099> on<00:04:23.520> you<00:04:23.640> accidentally<00:04:24.300> and<00:04:24.590> that's

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
disengage on you accidentally and that's

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.930 
disengage on you accidentally and that's
where

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
where

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.860 
where
something<00:04:27.190> the<00:04:28.190> handles<00:04:28.640> are<00:04:28.790> would<00:04:29.000> they

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
something the handles are would they

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.240 
something the handles are would they
have<00:04:30.020> a<00:04:30.050> nice<00:04:30.290> pattern<00:04:30.590> on<00:04:30.830> them<00:04:30.950> they're<00:04:31.130> not

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
have a nice pattern on them they're not

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.160 
have a nice pattern on them they're not
extremely<00:04:31.610> grippy<00:04:32.270> but<00:04:32.540> I<00:04:32.570> don't<00:04:32.870> think<00:04:33.050> you

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
extremely grippy but I don't think you

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.410 
extremely grippy but I don't think you
would<00:04:33.290> have<00:04:33.320> a<00:04:33.440> problem<00:04:33.680> with<00:04:34.010> it<00:04:34.190> the<00:04:35.030> pocket

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
would have a problem with it the pocket

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.600 
would have a problem with it the pocket
clip<00:04:35.540> is<00:04:35.810> nice<00:04:36.020> I<00:04:36.620> think<00:04:37.100> it<00:04:37.430> could<00:04:37.580> be

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
clip is nice I think it could be

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.180 
clip is nice I think it could be
improved<00:04:37.730> but<00:04:38.480> it<00:04:38.810> is<00:04:39.200> a<00:04:39.230> fairly<00:04:39.500> nice<00:04:39.740> pocket

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
improved but it is a fairly nice pocket

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.640 
improved but it is a fairly nice pocket
clip<00:04:40.400> so<00:04:40.790> it's<00:04:41.750> definitely<00:04:42.200> not<00:04:42.320> the<00:04:42.470> worst

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
clip so it's definitely not the worst

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.740 
clip so it's definitely not the worst
one<00:04:43.040> I've<00:04:43.370> seen<00:04:43.670> on<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:43.910> night<00:04:46.300> it<00:04:47.300> does<00:04:47.510> have

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
one I've seen on the night it does have

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.690 
one I've seen on the night it does have
a<00:04:47.780> flipper<00:04:48.260> but<00:04:48.650> the<00:04:48.740> way<00:04:48.890> this<00:04:49.070> knife<00:04:49.310> is<00:04:49.460> set

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
a flipper but the way this knife is set

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.320 
a flipper but the way this knife is set
up<00:04:49.850> right<00:04:50.060> now<00:04:50.240> it's<00:04:50.990> too<00:04:51.260> tight<00:04:52.090> it<00:04:53.090> won't

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
up right now it's too tight it won't

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.530 
up right now it's too tight it won't
flip<00:04:53.720> unless<00:04:54.080> you<00:04:54.260> really<00:04:55.040> give<00:04:55.250> it<00:04:55.370> a<00:04:55.540> hard

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
flip unless you really give it a hard

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.250 
flip unless you really give it a hard
flick<00:04:56.960> which<00:04:57.560> I'm<00:04:58.510> there<00:04:59.510> that's<00:04:59.960> what<00:05:00.170> it

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
flick which I'm there that's what it

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.870 
flick which I'm there that's what it
takes<00:05:00.410> to<00:05:00.560> get<00:05:00.710> it<00:05:00.830> to<00:05:00.890> flip<00:05:01.070> open<00:05:01.310> but<00:05:01.760> of

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
takes to get it to flip open but of

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.120 
takes to get it to flip open but of
course<00:05:02.090> you<00:05:02.300> could<00:05:02.480> adjust<00:05:03.140> that<00:05:03.560> out<00:05:03.620> and<00:05:03.980> let

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
course you could adjust that out and let

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.670 
course you could adjust that out and let
it<00:05:04.250> let<00:05:05.240> it<00:05:05.300> flip<00:05:05.600> fairly<00:05:06.020> easily<00:05:06.230> but<00:05:06.560> then

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
it let it flip fairly easily but then

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.860 
it let it flip fairly easily but then
you<00:05:06.800> would<00:05:06.920> have<00:05:06.950> played<00:05:07.280> play<00:05:07.580> I'm<00:05:08.450> not<00:05:08.510> sure

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
you would have played play I'm not sure

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.450 
you would have played play I'm not sure
that<00:05:08.900> it<00:05:09.290> would<00:05:09.380> be<00:05:09.440> that<00:05:09.680> way<00:05:09.890> on<00:05:10.160> the<00:05:10.280> knife

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
that it would be that way on the knife

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.180 
that it would be that way on the knife
that<00:05:10.670> hasn't<00:05:10.880> been<00:05:11.180> beaten<00:05:11.360> on<00:05:11.600> but<00:05:12.010> this<00:05:13.010> one

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
that hasn't been beaten on but this one

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.800 
that hasn't been beaten on but this one
has<00:05:13.340> played<00:05:13.580> play<00:05:13.820> if<00:05:14.000> you<00:05:14.120> loosen<00:05:14.450> the<00:05:14.510> pivot

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
has played play if you loosen the pivot

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.640 
has played play if you loosen the pivot
at<00:05:14.900> all<00:05:16.660> the<00:05:17.660> blade<00:05:17.900> is<00:05:18.050> still<00:05:18.230> centered

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
at all the blade is still centered

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.380 
at all the blade is still centered
despite<00:05:19.070> all<00:05:19.340> the<00:05:19.490> hell<00:05:19.670> that's<00:05:19.910> been<00:05:20.090> through

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
despite all the hell that's been through

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.840 
despite all the hell that's been through
so<00:05:21.380> that's<00:05:21.710> that's<00:05:22.670> saying<00:05:23.060> something

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
so that's that's saying something

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.400 
so that's that's saying something
everything<00:05:25.850> is<00:05:26.150> still<00:05:26.330> functional<00:05:27.050> on<00:05:27.290> the

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
everything is still functional on the

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.400 
everything is still functional on the
knife<00:05:27.620> so<00:05:28.070> that's<00:05:28.550> fairly<00:05:28.850> surprising<00:05:29.410> it

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
knife so that's fairly surprising it

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.360 
knife so that's fairly surprising it
came<00:05:30.620> to<00:05:30.770> me<00:05:30.890> really<00:05:31.100> dirty<00:05:31.430> and<00:05:32.260> indulge<00:05:33.370> it

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
came to me really dirty and indulge it

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.100 
came to me really dirty and indulge it
and<00:05:34.520> sharpened<00:05:34.940> it<00:05:35.060> and<00:05:35.270> I<00:05:35.390> think<00:05:35.750> Dave<00:05:35.930> will

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
and sharpened it and I think Dave will

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.370 
and sharpened it and I think Dave will
be<00:05:36.230> happy<00:05:36.530> with<00:05:36.710> it<00:05:36.830> when<00:05:36.980> he<00:05:37.010> gets<00:05:37.220> it<00:05:37.340> back

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
be happy with it when he gets it back

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.600 
be happy with it when he gets it back
overall<00:05:39.380> I<00:05:39.410> think<00:05:39.590> it's<00:05:39.860> a<00:05:39.950> good<00:05:40.100> knife<00:05:40.310> if<00:05:40.580> you

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
overall I think it's a good knife if you

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.190 
overall I think it's a good knife if you
can<00:05:40.850> find<00:05:41.090> it<00:05:41.300> and<00:05:41.450> you<00:05:41.750> like<00:05:41.900> the<00:05:42.050> way<00:05:42.080> it

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
can find it and you like the way it

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.060 
can find it and you like the way it
looks<00:05:42.560> I<00:05:44.200> think<00:05:45.200> you'll<00:05:45.320> be<00:05:45.470> happy<00:05:45.740> with<00:05:45.770> it

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
looks I think you'll be happy with it

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.909 
looks I think you'll be happy with it
the<00:05:46.190> steel<00:05:46.460> is<00:05:46.700> great<00:05:46.970> that<00:05:47.900> recurve<00:05:48.500> and<00:05:48.830> the

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
the steel is great that recurve and the

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:52.060 
the steel is great that recurve and the
in<00:05:49.220> the<00:05:49.370> blade<00:05:49.580> really<00:05:50.650> really<00:05:51.650> makes<00:05:51.830> it<00:05:51.950> a

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
in the blade really really makes it a

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.670 
in the blade really really makes it a
good<00:05:52.190> slicer<00:05:52.730> well<00:05:53.510> for<00:05:53.750> draw<00:05:53.960> cuts<00:05:54.230> at<00:05:54.470> least

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
good slicer well for draw cuts at least

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.930 
good slicer well for draw cuts at least
it<00:05:55.460> does<00:05:55.700> cut<00:05:55.940> rope<00:05:56.150> really<00:05:56.419> well<00:05:56.660> so<00:05:57.940> overall

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
it does cut rope really well so overall

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.700 
it does cut rope really well so overall
I<00:05:59.300> think<00:05:59.450> it's<00:05:59.720> a<00:05:59.810> good<00:05:59.960> knife<00:06:00.169> I<00:06:00.440> don't

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
I think it's a good knife I don't

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.159 
I think it's a good knife I don't
exactly<00:06:01.070> know<00:06:01.330> what<00:06:02.330> the<00:06:02.510> price<00:06:02.750> is<00:06:03.340> for<00:06:04.340> us<00:06:04.490> I

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169 
exactly know what the price is for us I

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:07.540 
exactly know what the price is for us I
should<00:06:06.169> probably<00:06:06.290> look<00:06:06.560> on<00:06:06.740> his<00:06:06.890> website<00:06:07.130> and

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
should probably look on his website and

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.820 
should probably look on his website and
see<00:06:07.640> if<00:06:07.730> he<00:06:07.820> has<00:06:07.940> it<00:06:08.090> listed<00:06:08.270> but<00:06:08.690> I<00:06:08.930> haven't

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
see if he has it listed but I haven't

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.420 
see if he has it listed but I haven't
done<00:06:09.950> that<00:06:10.010> yet<00:06:10.370> but<00:06:10.730> I<00:06:10.970> mean<00:06:11.600> if<00:06:11.720> it's<00:06:11.900> I

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
done that yet but I mean if it's I

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.620 
done that yet but I mean if it's I
actually<00:06:13.430> won't<00:06:13.820> say<00:06:14.030> what<00:06:14.210> I<00:06:14.240> think<00:06:14.360> it's

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
actually won't say what I think it's

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.130 
actually won't say what I think it's
your<00:06:14.750> calls<00:06:14.930> I<00:06:15.260> think<00:06:15.980> I<00:06:16.070> might<00:06:16.280> it<00:06:16.900> might<00:06:17.900> piss

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.140 
your calls I think I might it might piss

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.500 
your calls I think I might it might piss
somebody<00:06:18.560> off<00:06:18.890> I<00:06:19.280> don't<00:06:19.340> know<00:06:19.880> exactly<00:06:20.270> who

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.510 
somebody off I don't know exactly who

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.230 
somebody off I don't know exactly who
but<00:06:20.540> somebody<00:06:21.350> may<00:06:21.680> get<00:06:21.740> mad<00:06:22.040> I<00:06:22.310> don't<00:06:23.090> think

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
but somebody may get mad I don't think

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.190 
but somebody may get mad I don't think
it<00:06:23.330> would<00:06:23.450> be<00:06:23.480> Neptune<00:06:23.960> but<00:06:24.230> you<00:06:24.980> never<00:06:25.130> know<00:06:26.200> I

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.200 
it would be Neptune but you never know I

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.370 
it would be Neptune but you never know I
think<00:06:28.130> isn't<00:06:28.400> alright<00:06:28.790> knife<00:06:29.060> if<00:06:29.660> what<00:06:30.350> I

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:30.380 
think isn't alright knife if what I

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.659 
think isn't alright knife if what I
personally<00:06:30.740> buy<00:06:31.220> I<00:06:32.770> don't<00:06:33.770> think<00:06:34.130> so<00:06:34.370> just

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:34.669 
personally buy I don't think so just

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:36.250 
personally buy I don't think so just
because<00:06:34.760> it's<00:06:34.970> not<00:06:35.090> my<00:06:35.270> style<00:06:35.510> there's<00:06:36.050> really

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.260 
because it's not my style there's really

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.840 
because it's not my style there's really
nothing<00:06:36.800> wrong<00:06:37.460> with<00:06:37.880> a<00:06:37.910> knife<00:06:38.150> it's<00:06:38.690> just<00:06:39.020> not

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850 
nothing wrong with a knife it's just not

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.390 
nothing wrong with a knife it's just not
not<00:06:40.850> my<00:06:41.030> kind<00:06:41.180> of<00:06:41.330> taste<00:06:41.600> I<00:06:41.990> would<00:06:42.980> prefer

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.400 
not my kind of taste I would prefer

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.150 
not my kind of taste I would prefer
something<00:06:43.670> different<00:06:44.060> than<00:06:44.180> wood<00:06:44.360> and<00:06:45.160> I

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 
something different than wood and I

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.540 
something different than wood and I
wouldn't<00:06:47.090> want<00:06:47.240> to<00:06:47.270> be<00:06:47.480> to<00:06:47.900> be<00:06:48.020> so<00:06:48.230> big<00:06:48.530> and<00:06:49.190> I

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550 
wouldn't want to be to be so big and I

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.130 
wouldn't want to be to be so big and I
think<00:06:49.970> the<00:06:50.090> flipper<00:06:50.480> could<00:06:50.630> be<00:06:50.750> done<00:06:50.900> away

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:51.140 
think the flipper could be done away

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.770 
think the flipper could be done away
with<00:06:51.340> but<00:06:52.340> the<00:06:52.490> flipper<00:06:52.850> does<00:06:53.030> act<00:06:53.270> as<00:06:53.570> a

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:53.780 
with but the flipper does act as a

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:58.330 
with but the flipper does act as a
finger<00:06:54.200> choil<00:06:54.410> so<00:06:54.890> that's<00:06:55.550> a<00:06:55.670> nice<00:06:55.850> safety<00:06:57.340> I

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:58.340 
finger choil so that's a nice safety I

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.140 
finger choil so that's a nice safety I
think<00:06:59.120> that's<00:06:59.390> pretty<00:06:59.720> much<00:06:59.990> it<00:07:00.410> I<00:07:01.000> don't<00:07:02.000> know

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.150 
think that's pretty much it I don't know

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.210 
think that's pretty much it I don't know
if<00:07:02.270> I<00:07:02.330> mentioned<00:07:02.390> it<00:07:02.780> but<00:07:02.840> n690<00:07:03.560> steel<00:07:03.950> does

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:04.220 
if I mentioned it but n690 steel does

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.360 
if I mentioned it but n690 steel does
hold<00:07:04.430> an<00:07:04.520> edge<00:07:04.670> really<00:07:04.700> well<00:07:05.590> in<00:07:06.590> my<00:07:06.830> test<00:07:07.130> it

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:07.370 
hold an edge really well in my test it

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.630 
hold an edge really well in my test it
performed<00:07:08.380> very<00:07:09.380> very<00:07:09.500> well<00:07:09.770> a<00:07:10.190> lot<00:07:10.430> better

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:10.640 
performed very very well a lot better

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.980 
performed very very well a lot better
than<00:07:10.730> then<00:07:11.540> I<00:07:11.630> was<00:07:11.780> expecting<00:07:12.290> it<00:07:12.380> to<00:07:12.590> and<00:07:13.430> it's

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:13.990 
than then I was expecting it to and it's

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:19.300 
than then I was expecting it to and it's
extremely<00:07:14.990> stain<00:07:15.440> resistant<00:07:16.070> so<00:07:18.220> supposed<00:07:19.220> to

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:19.310 
extremely stain resistant so supposed to

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.280 
extremely stain resistant so supposed to
be<00:07:19.430> somewhere<00:07:19.760> along<00:07:19.970> the<00:07:20.120> lines<00:07:20.330> of<00:07:20.540> h1<00:07:20.990> as

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:21.290 
be somewhere along the lines of h1 as

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.530 
be somewhere along the lines of h1 as
far<00:07:21.530> as<00:07:21.650> stain<00:07:21.860> resistance<00:07:22.430> goes<00:07:22.640> I'm<00:07:23.240> not

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:23.540 
far as stain resistance goes I'm not

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.020 
far as stain resistance goes I'm not
sure<00:07:23.750> if<00:07:23.870> it's<00:07:24.050> to<00:07:24.230> that<00:07:24.410> extreme<00:07:24.890> or<00:07:25.370> not<00:07:25.610> but

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:26.030 
sure if it's to that extreme or not but

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.050 
sure if it's to that extreme or not but
it<00:07:26.300> is<00:07:26.330> very<00:07:26.690> very<00:07:26.810> sane<00:07:27.230> resistant<00:07:27.800> so<00:07:28.100> that's

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:29.060 
it is very very sane resistant so that's

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.930 
it is very very sane resistant so that's
another<00:07:29.330> plus<00:07:29.660> it<00:07:29.870> has<00:07:29.990> going<00:07:30.230> for<00:07:30.350> it<00:07:30.790> so<00:07:31.790> I'm

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:31.940 
another plus it has going for it so I'm

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.220 
another plus it has going for it so I'm
not<00:07:32.060> trying<00:07:32.330> to<00:07:32.360> sway<00:07:32.600> you<00:07:32.660> either<00:07:32.960> way<00:07:33.170> you

not trying to sway you either way you

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.900 
not trying to sway you either way you
could<00:07:33.620> like<00:07:33.800> the<00:07:33.950> knife<00:07:34.100> and<00:07:34.340> buy<00:07:34.460> it<00:07:34.520> or<00:07:34.880> you

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:34.910 
could like the knife and buy it or you

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.850 
could like the knife and buy it or you
could<00:07:35.150> hate<00:07:35.360> it<00:07:35.510> and<00:07:35.630> not<00:07:35.750> buy<00:07:35.960> it<00:07:36.020> I<00:07:36.410> just
