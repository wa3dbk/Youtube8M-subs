00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.820
 a negative premiere for the first time in 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.370
 this league season shoots the tsg 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.020
 in a game no goal happens but 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:23.730
 two goals and loses 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.080
 logically in augsburg had yesterday 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.310
 we do not perform well in the field 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.000
 brought and there is nothing 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.530
 whitewash 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.309
 I believe that you look for one 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.960
 defeat sky high exulting 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.670
 the area is running but that it's easy 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.670
 it is also about the matter to work up 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.469
 and after a victory you feel yourself 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.329
 sure to look better which ones 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.789
 Expectations have high expectations 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.690
 one also demanded so and the expectations 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.429
 it was not with us 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.559
 but it is hochhochjauchzend 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:51.659
 actually so that we already 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.629
 are aware that there is still a situation 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:56.010
 in which we are still looking for our position 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.989
 and if you look at the table then 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.789
 is it so that two-thirds of the league 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.989
 supposedly playing against the descent 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.180
 or contact to the back have 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.979
 lead more up to date but we 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.840
 so do not panic 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.430
 we do not work in this direction 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.530
 but we still want ours 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.060
 develop a young team and then 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.890
 rather to us the time to continue 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.439
 and then come play and that too 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.640
 setbacks come that is perfect 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.829
 normal in a development 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.259
 Oh, I think that's it 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.840
 So just much total was far too 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.280
 process also for the team that 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.020
 is also often times so 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.520
 easy wegzustecken if then so concise 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.310
 then maybe not win 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.259
 or negative decisions against 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.670
 you fail that all already has it 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.920
 contributed that the situation now 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.020
 straight as well as cute is but we need 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.640
 yes, nothing dramatize but 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.780
 it is crucial that we are at rest 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.759
 continue to work the team 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.560
 evolve and we will do that 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.270
 Overall it is so that I have no 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.429
 Satisfying situation if you are in each one 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.200
 get game goals and easy 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.049
 tried different things I think 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.270
 simply are also in demand as a coach 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.159
 that we continue to be courageous, too 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.780
 just try other things then 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.179
 what you have done so far still has 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.160
 not working so well afterwards 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.200
 often in every game 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.090
 most different mistakes that you never 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.220
 the same things happen the idea 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.349
 once the player is the player 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.690
 once standards are no matter what 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.519
 but always total and so that 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.440
 Of course we are also worried 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.329
 is ridiculous if we start now 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.849
 leave our way here and now 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:28.260
 all at once a turn around 180 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.760
 degree do not have it with us 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.140
 but we chose this one 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.250
 team also decided for this 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.390
 away and we will too 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.610
 go together and we see that too 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.099
 all totally convinced we know 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.959
 also that it is a difficult time there 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.560
 to get through and also stable to 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.360
 develop 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.910
 but in this phase we are and 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.489
 money distributor nothing is given it 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.280
 a hard stony way to stay away though 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.049
 We go on and on next week 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.730
 he leads the home game against Werder 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:58.760
 Bremen and on the following Tuesday 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.760
 for dfb pokal partie at FC Schalke 04
