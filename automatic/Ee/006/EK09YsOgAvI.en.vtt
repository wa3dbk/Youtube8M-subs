00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.640
 Hi, I want to share some tips 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:10.490
 to travel to thailand to the people 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.140
 attend now in april 2014 I had 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.740
 many questions why I decided to do 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:18.260
 this video the first thing that nothing is the 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.150
 high costs obviously if you check the 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.490
 disney website 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.100
 around 93 dollars for the 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.840
 ticket for a day for a park too 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.180
 what you can do if you go with several 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.090
 days is 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.770
 buy a ticket for each park 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.720
 for two different days because also 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.400
 they sell a ticket for the same day 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.930
 We entered two parks that you did not 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.540
 I recommend because you can barely 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.020
 go a one day open from 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:48.590
 8 o'clock in the morning you can enter with 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.510
 What is food in a backpack? 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.510
 working and I recommend that you take 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.900
 many waters little bottles of water 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.330
 many can take soda juices water 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.830
 you can fill it with water 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.070
 teas in the drinkers from there the 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.640
 park entering the park there are a few 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.800
 lakers that you get in 15 dollars the 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.570
 locro bigger and so they go down 8 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.580
 dollars the smallest and 10 dollars I think 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.500
 the medium the big we choose it 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.360
 us what we carry a backpack 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.490
 pretty big this 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.090
 I recommend that you say early they open to 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.090
 8 in the morning 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.690
 so that you reach to travel well the 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:33.400
 park and take comfortable clothes and tennis 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:35.530
 made ovens the most possible if possible 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.120
 comfortable do not go like you're going to a 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.310
 wedding because the truth you're going to give 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.190
 account and that people are going to fashion and 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.580
 you will not see failure but you already know the 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.340
 people who go then what vargas llosa 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.780
 the games if a little child carries me 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.760
 I recommend that you go out of the 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.500
 old or if it's the first time you 're going to 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.380
 travel I recommend you go first 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.150
 at 10 the old and the later 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.430
 the california adventure that is for more 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.610
 great because they are the cartoons 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.390
 of pixar the last house caudillo what 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:10.020
 that is understood in the old 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.810
 we had to use the fastpath that 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.150
 I also recommend that you use it 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.790
 this fast path allows you to make an appointment 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.390
 as if it were for a doctor for 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.270
 more games that fill more than is 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:29.250
 Pirates of the Caribbean splash mountain star 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:32.370
 wars space mountain on the map that you 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.440
 Disney's den shrink your LFP 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.300
 means then the fast path and you go to 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.180
 be able to attend with your entrance ticket 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.860
 from the park you're going to put it 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.300
 machine and the machine will say 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.120
 what time you can now 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.280
 attend that attraction this helped us 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.680
 much to us to be able to travel 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.900
 other attractions in what we knew that 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.290
 we could enter you can not use 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.780
 two blades immediately to the same 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.700
 machine is going to tell you only in the span 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.040
 of an hour or so because then for 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.750
 that people do not imagine I want 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.790
 funk logistics and truth then 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.860
 but if I recommend you use them 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.829
 this also the food inside is 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.049
 good good some but that's what they are 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.709
 some hamburgers that are stuck to the 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.959
 River 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:20.579
 to the water that are in the center of 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:22.890
 Disneyland in I think it's the land of 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.480
 the border something like that 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.890
 there you can eat more however if 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.750
 It has a sandwich and the guards 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.239
 core and so they are not downloading with you 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.360
 with your backpack all the way to the 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.610
 park then 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.670
 I recommend you also because outside 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:41.180
 the names there are 34 little tables is where 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.370
 you can eat at ease and if you want 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.890
 save a peso and it's the weight you can 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.810
 use to buy souvenirs 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.000
 Disney toys are really a lot 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.880
 cheaper there the disney inclusive 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.130
 here in mexico what if it is not 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.130
 economic for however it is 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.200
 essential to buy is a cap 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:03.620

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.470
