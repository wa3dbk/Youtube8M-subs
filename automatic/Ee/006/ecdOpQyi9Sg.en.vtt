up into them but I'm with you a lot of
waffle<00:02:05.219> we're<00:02:05.399> all<00:02:05.460> as<00:02:05.610> cobblestone<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.329> as

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
waffle we're all as cobblestone is as

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.850 
waffle we're all as cobblestone is as
we're<00:02:06.780> lava<00:02:07.020> was

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
we're lava was

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.660 
we're lava was
so<00:02:08.860> I<00:02:09.369> actually<00:02:10.209> turns<00:02:10.599> into<00:02:10.810> obsidian<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:12.370> and

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
so I actually turns into obsidian so and

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.240 
so I actually turns into obsidian so and
over<00:02:12.849> there<00:02:13.000> too<00:02:13.239> but<00:02:14.200> I<00:02:14.500> just<00:02:14.830> basically

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
over there too but I just basically

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.770 
over there too but I just basically
feathers<00:02:15.580> out<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:16.000> don't<00:02:16.569> worry<00:02:16.720> about

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
feathers out and don't worry about

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.300 
feathers out and don't worry about
diamonds<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.380> start<00:02:17.590> with<00:02:17.680> an<00:02:17.770> iron<00:02:17.920> pic<00:02:18.160> i

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
diamonds to start with an iron pic i

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.580 
diamonds to start with an iron pic i
think<00:02:18.520> this<00:02:18.819> only<00:02:19.330> caused<00:02:19.720> me<00:02:20.020> to<00:02:20.230> diamonds

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
think this only caused me to diamonds

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.460 
think this only caused me to diamonds
into<00:02:20.920> irons<00:02:21.630> is<00:02:22.630> he's<00:02:22.900> honoring<00:02:23.050> here<00:02:23.290> i'm<00:02:23.349> not

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
into irons is he's honoring here i'm not

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.740 
into irons is he's honoring here i'm not
in<00:02:23.560> collecting<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.010> but<00:02:24.640> out<00:02:25.090> of<00:02:25.150> all<00:02:25.420> this<00:02:25.569> I

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
in collecting it but out of all this I

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.390 
in collecting it but out of all this I
just<00:02:25.930> kept<00:02:26.080> doing<00:02:26.200> this<00:02:26.470> for<00:02:26.769> like<00:02:26.830> about<00:02:27.160> an

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
just kept doing this for like about an

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.339 
just kept doing this for like about an
hour<00:02:27.610> you<00:02:28.390> should've<00:02:28.660> basically<00:02:28.959> stay<00:02:29.170> in<00:02:29.230> the

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
hour you should've basically stay in the

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.960 
hour you should've basically stay in the
top<00:02:29.530> thing<00:02:29.800> for<00:02:29.920> 10<00:02:30.069> minutes<00:02:30.280> come<00:02:30.640> back<00:02:30.790> down

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
top thing for 10 minutes come back down

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.610 
top thing for 10 minutes come back down
but<00:02:31.569> if<00:02:31.690> you<00:02:31.750> only<00:02:31.930> get<00:02:32.140> more<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:32.349> a<00:02:32.410> higher

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
but if you only get more of a higher

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.440 
but if you only get more of a higher
chance<00:02:32.650> of<00:02:33.250> like<00:02:33.489> getting<00:02:33.730> slime<00:02:34.090> balls<00:02:34.300> to

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
chance of like getting slime balls to

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.210 
chance of like getting slime balls to
stay<00:02:34.599> down<00:02:34.750> that<00:02:34.959> I<00:02:34.989> stay<00:02:35.260> at<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.440> top<00:02:35.620> like<00:02:35.890> 30

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
stay down that I stay at the top like 30

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.570 
stay down that I stay at the top like 30
minutes<00:02:36.430> that's<00:02:37.420> how<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:37.599> do<00:02:37.750> it<00:02:37.780> so<00:02:38.530> but<00:02:39.519> they

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
minutes that's how you do it so but they

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.920 
minutes that's how you do it so but they
said<00:02:39.760> oh<00:02:39.790> there's<00:02:39.910> always<00:02:40.150> one<00:02:40.299> slime<00:02:40.600> job<00:02:40.810> I

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
said oh there's always one slime job I

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.570 
said oh there's always one slime job I
found<00:02:41.230> songs<00:02:41.530> all<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:41.830> way<00:02:41.920> down<00:02:42.069> there<00:02:42.310> in

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
found songs all the way down there in

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.720 
found songs all the way down there in
there<00:02:43.269> and<00:02:43.630> over<00:02:44.140> here<00:02:44.319> I<00:02:44.799> never<00:02:45.340> found<00:02:45.519> really

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
there and over here I never found really

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.309 
there and over here I never found really
in<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:45.940> middle<00:02:46.269> there<00:02:46.630> never<00:02:46.900> leaving<00:02:47.200> that

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
in the middle there never leaving that

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.220 
in the middle there never leaving that
as<00:02:47.470> pi<00:02:47.680> just<00:02:47.739> moved<00:02:48.220> over<00:02:48.400> from<00:02:48.610> over<00:02:49.209> here<00:02:49.269> so

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
as pi just moved over from over here so

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.259 
as pi just moved over from over here so
we'll<00:02:50.350> track<00:02:50.769> like<00:02:51.010> I<00:02:51.250> really<00:02:51.790> won't<00:02:51.910> track

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.500 
the torture so what I did was I did 21
every<00:04:31.740> wall<00:04:31.919> you<00:04:32.130> can<00:04:32.250> spam<00:04:32.639> them<00:04:32.790> all<00:04:33.030> over

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
every wall you can spam them all over

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.879 
every wall you can spam them all over
the<00:04:33.660> walls<00:04:33.870> and<00:04:34.229> slimes<00:04:34.530> won't<00:04:34.770> actually

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
the walls and slimes won't actually

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.400 
the walls and slimes won't actually
spawn<00:04:35.370> there<00:04:35.700> but<00:04:36.600> they<00:04:36.690> do<00:04:36.750> have<00:04:37.020> it<00:04:37.139> have<00:04:37.290> an

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
spawn there but they do have it have an

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.310 
spawn there but they do have it have an
air<00:04:37.590> space<00:04:37.889> and<00:04:38.370> I<00:04:38.729> think<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.320> torches

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
air space and I think the torches

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.170 
air space and I think the torches
technically<00:04:41.150> our<00:04:42.150> air<00:04:42.479> spaces<00:04:43.220> so<00:04:44.220> I<00:04:44.520> did<00:04:44.910> two

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
technically our air spaces so I did two

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.810 
technically our air spaces so I did two
on<00:04:45.540> each<00:04:45.930> side<00:04:45.960> like<00:04:46.560> to<00:04:46.800> if<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:47.190> rest<00:04:47.490> of<00:04:47.639> them

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
on each side like to if the rest of them

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.700 
on each side like to if the rest of them
that's<00:04:48.660> means<00:04:48.840> what<00:04:49.050> I<00:04:49.080> did<00:04:49.260> and<00:04:49.440> then<00:04:49.500> I

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
that's means what I did and then I

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.040 
that's means what I did and then I
stayed<00:04:49.950> five<00:04:50.250> apart<00:04:51.150> from<00:04:51.300> all<00:04:51.510> four<00:04:51.900> down

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
stayed five apart from all four down

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.219 
stayed five apart from all four down
here<00:04:52.200> and<00:04:52.380> I<00:04:52.410> start<00:04:52.650> doing<00:04:52.830> five<00:04:53.100> down<00:04:53.340> there

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
here and I start doing five down there

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:58.340 
here and I start doing five down there
see<00:04:55.229> 1<00:04:55.410> 2<00:04:55.440> 3<00:04:55.680> 4<00:04:56.280> 5<00:04:56.490> and<00:04:56.729> then<00:04:56.789> torch<00:04:57.330> so<00:04:58.200> it's

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
see 1 2 3 4 5 and then torch so it's

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.770 
see 1 2 3 4 5 and then torch so it's
kind<00:04:58.530> of<00:04:58.590> it<00:04:58.770> so<00:04:59.130> that's<00:04:59.669> basically<00:04:59.820> it<00:05:00.150> also

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
kind of it so that's basically it also

kind of it so that's basically it also
there's<00:05:00.960> one<00:05:01.140> more<00:05:01.260> method<00:05:01.520> to<00:05:02.520> go<00:05:02.610> down<00:05:02.729> right

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
there's one more method to go down right

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.860 
there's one more method to go down right
over<00:05:03.090> here<00:05:03.560> and<00:05:04.560> go<00:05:04.680> up<00:05:04.770> here<00:05:05.039> and<00:05:05.750> you<00:05:06.750> just
