the<00:04:09.560> West<00:04:10.690> this<00:04:11.690> is<00:04:11.840> this<00:04:12.560> is<00:04:12.709> nurses

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
the West this is this is nurses

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.259 
the West this is this is nurses
retelling<00:04:13.519> of<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:13.670> garden<00:04:14.120> of<00:04:14.239> the
