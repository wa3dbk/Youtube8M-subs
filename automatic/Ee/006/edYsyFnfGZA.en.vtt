00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello to all we find ourselves 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.890
 today for a short video of 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.040
 doubs to show you how 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.000
 adapt your cat cable to your helmet 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.679
 gamer on your xbox one controller 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.440
 account for that you will need to 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.480
 your original box and your 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.830
 cat cable in this case for me 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.090
 he is an astro at 40 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.320
 so I specify that what this video 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.260
 is not doing live is not done 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.670
 live simply because my 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.070
 neighbors did a little bit of noise 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.660
 so it was a little embarrassing I do not 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.149
 could not introduce you this this 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.250
 video like that suddenly I did a 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.370
 little editing you will need a 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.559
 screwdriver carried six business soldering 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.050
 cutting pliers and a pass to 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.030
 strip to be able to realize this tutorial 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.039
 correctly we will start to disassemble 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.340
 under the small box is what you 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.340
 see there 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.150
 for the cable of the star hoa 40 if you 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.650
 do not want to cut it if you do not want to 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.930
 damage it because you still use 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.380
 the xbox 360 for that very well 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:43.070
 use a being better use a 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.170
 original helmet and broc 360 made 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.610
 disassemble at the headphones 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.990
 recover the girls and the two months and 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.990
 connect them directly to the housing 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.420
 so once the small housing disassemble 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.070
 so feed the wires that are caught 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.530
 directly on the small circuit board 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.080
 we have on the left the stripped son 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.149
 who is the earth the white wire the microphone 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.220
 the black film and the blue net that 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.050
 installs headphones you're going to have a 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.330
 small zoom kit still images even small 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.460
 photo to explain all that with 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.580
 the color codes that can 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.620
 differ from one helmet to another 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.240
 so either you have four sons and you 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.040
 go you will have the configuration of 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.520
 your little box or without you will 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.050
 three sons as for the 3.40 laas and 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.240
 maybe other helmets and there at this 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:38.790
 moment there and cold respect exactly 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:41.130
 like I'm doing it so I 'm going 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.270
 prepare the cable in order to be able to 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.270
 soldering on the little Latin 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.140
 between a path to the bare wires on 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.240
 can see the son the golden son who has the 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.220
 earth we're going to have a home 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.990
 completely left 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:32.840
 then we have the microphone that is the 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.840
 green wire and the earpiece the bush clan 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.710
 Well, here is the operation is over 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:15.110
 the cable is ready to use 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:17.990
 we will go to the trial phase 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.180
 as you can see 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.300
 the mix between the directly connected to the 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:26.630
 joystick at the cable to the cat 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:28.750
 kinect is disabled for those who 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.940
 think that I am of your hopes 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.650
 so here you do as you can 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.000
 see I do it and that's it lights up via 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:39.200
 when you present in front of the helmet 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.880
 I speak and that function mute mount 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.660
 and lower the sound of your joystick 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.660
 works correctly 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.520
 thank you for watching this video 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.770
 I hope this little tutorial will have pleased you 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.970
 will do you a favor 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.970
 I tell you soon cocoa
