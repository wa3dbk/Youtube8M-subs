00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
getting it off a reputation could have

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.080 
getting it off a reputation could have
been<00:01:05.680> to<00:01:05.800> patriot<00:01:06.280> tight<00:01:06.460> ends<00:01:06.700> in<00:01:06.790> there<00:01:06.940> yeah

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.610 
been to patriot tight ends in there yeah
I<00:01:07.120> think<00:01:07.270> Hernandez<00:01:07.870> now<00:01:08.050> knows<00:01:08.350> what<00:01:08.530> it

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
I think Hernandez now knows what it

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.990 
I think Hernandez now knows what it
feels<00:01:08.650> like<00:01:08.890> to<00:01:08.980> get<00:01:09.190> Gronk<00:01:09.550> because<00:01:09.880> i<00:01:09.940> think

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
feels like to get Gronk because i think

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.670 
feels like to get Gronk because i think
his<00:01:10.210> teammate<00:01:10.660> kind<00:01:10.870> of<00:01:10.960> took<00:01:11.080> a<00:01:11.140> spot<00:01:11.440> away

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
his teammate kind of took a spot away

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.260 
his teammate kind of took a spot away
from<00:01:11.890> him<00:01:12.070> there<00:01:12.430> was<00:01:12.580> no<00:01:12.820> way<00:01:13.060> they<00:01:13.240> were

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
from him there was no way they were

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.640 
from him there was no way they were
gonna<00:01:13.390> pick<00:01:13.630> both<00:01:13.870> these<00:01:14.050> guys<00:01:14.290> on<00:01:14.530> the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
gonna pick both these guys on the

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.050 
gonna pick both these guys on the
initial<00:01:14.980> ballot<00:01:15.190> but<00:01:15.280> i<00:01:15.370> think<00:01:15.550> like<00:01:15.700> you<00:01:15.820> said

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
initial ballot but i think like you said

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.610 
initial ballot but i think like you said
he<00:01:16.420> probably<00:01:16.570> will<00:01:16.840> find<00:01:17.080> a<00:01:17.140> way<00:01:17.260> to<00:01:17.320> get<00:01:17.470> to

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
he probably will find a way to get to

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.530 
he probably will find a way to get to
Hawaii<00:01:17.770> on<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.310> offensive<00:01:18.880> line<00:01:18.909> Joe<00:01:19.300> Thomas

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
all season long you know going through

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.460 
all season long you know going through
three<00:01:34.390> different<00:01:34.479> quarterbacks<00:01:34.810> running<00:01:35.170> the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
football as well as they did I would

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.399 
football as well as they did I would
probably<00:01:37.300> take<00:01:37.600> Chris<00:01:37.810> Myers<00:01:38.080> I<00:01:38.260> think

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
probably take Chris Myers I think

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:39.930

Pouncey<00:01:38.800> is<00:01:38.890> actually<00:01:39.190> not<00:01:39.280> had<00:01:39.520> a<00:01:39.550> great

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
Pouncey is actually not had a great

Pouncey is actually not had a great
season<00:01:40.240> this<00:01:40.540> year<00:01:40.600> so<00:01:41.140> maybe<00:01:41.260> mangold's<00:01:41.890> your

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
season this year so maybe mangold's your

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.530 
season this year so maybe mangold's your
starter<00:01:42.400> and<00:01:42.550> then<00:01:42.700> Myers<00:01:43.150> would<00:01:43.360> be<00:01:43.450> the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
starter and then Myers would be the

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.969 
starter and then Myers would be the
backup<00:01:43.720> that's<00:01:44.049> the<00:01:44.140> way<00:01:44.260> I'd<00:01:44.409> like<00:01:44.590> to<00:01:44.710> see<00:01:44.890> it

it's<00:01:45.159> feel<00:01:45.310> like<00:01:45.430> someone<00:01:45.820> should<00:01:45.850> be

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
it's feel like someone should be

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.730 
it's feel like someone should be

Eric Weddle a lot of money but maybe not
the<00:02:34.280> best<00:02:34.310> choice<00:02:34.520> there<00:02:34.910> you<00:02:35.150> know<00:02:35.270> the

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
the best choice there you know the

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.090 
the best choice there you know the
interception<00:02:36.080> certainly<00:02:36.440> stand<00:02:36.770> out<00:02:36.920> I'd

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
interception certainly stand out I'd

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.920 
interception certainly stand out I'd
have<00:02:37.250> taken<00:02:37.550> Ryan<00:02:37.790> Clark<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.360> you<00:02:38.420> can't<00:02:38.690> tell

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
have taken Ryan Clark and you can't tell

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.600 
have taken Ryan Clark and you can't tell
me<00:02:38.960> that<00:02:39.140> that<00:02:39.380> Joseph<00:02:39.950> wasn't<00:02:40.310> better<00:02:40.430> than

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
me that that Joseph wasn't better than

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.670 
me that that Joseph wasn't better than
Bailey<00:02:40.790> this<00:02:41.090> year<00:02:41.300> I<00:02:41.420> just<00:02:41.630> think<00:02:41.810> he<00:02:41.960> was<00:02:42.110> the

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
Bailey this year I just think he was the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.620 
Bailey this year I just think he was the
biggest<00:02:42.890> free<00:02:43.160> agent<00:02:43.520> pickup<00:02:43.850> so<00:02:44.090> some<00:02:44.510> of<00:02:44.540> the

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
biggest free agent pickup so some of the

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.260 
biggest free agent pickup so some of the
guys<00:02:44.780> who<00:02:44.930> got<00:02:45.080> money<00:02:45.350> i<00:02:45.440> think<00:02:45.800> you<00:02:46.580> know<00:02:46.610> two

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.790 
guys who got money i think you know two
different<00:02:47.540> situations<00:02:48.110> there<00:02:48.350> but<00:02:48.530> i<00:02:48.560> think

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
different situations there but i think

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.590 
different situations there but i think
