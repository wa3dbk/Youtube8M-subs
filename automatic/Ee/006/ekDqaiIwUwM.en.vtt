00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.789 
obviously a dancer yeah it doesn't
matter<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.000> mean<00:01:36.270> as<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.840> tapper<00:01:37.200> people<00:01:37.530> I

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
matter but I mean as a tapper people I

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.340 
matter but I mean as a tapper people I
think<00:01:38.220> people<00:01:38.430> are<00:01:38.610> really<00:01:38.909> surprised<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:40.110> was

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
think people are really surprised it was

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.289 
think people are really surprised it was
it<00:01:41.310> was<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.460> challenge<00:01:42.030> getting<00:01:42.960> nut

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
it was a challenge getting nut

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:45.730 
it was a challenge getting nut
the<00:01:44.390> movement<00:01:44.719> was<00:01:44.840> very<00:01:44.899> hard<00:01:45.289> we<00:01:45.409> had<00:01:45.500> a<00:01:45.530> lot

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
the movement was very hard we had a lot

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.200 
the movement was very hard we had a lot
of<00:01:45.859> hard<00:01:46.009> things<00:01:46.219> in<00:01:46.369> it<00:01:46.490> but<00:01:46.700> I<00:01:46.729> think<00:01:46.850> the

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
of hard things in it but I think the

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.149 
of hard things in it but I think the
harder<00:01:47.509> part<00:01:47.719> for<00:01:47.899> me<00:01:48.020> was<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:48.770> connection

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
harder part for me was the connection

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.279 
harder part for me was the connection
because<00:01:49.729> I'm<00:01:49.909> not<00:01:50.090> used<00:01:50.359> to<00:01:50.509> like<00:01:50.780> putting

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
because I'm not used to like putting

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.620 
because I'm not used to like putting
that<00:01:51.619> kind<00:01:51.890> of<00:01:52.039> intention<00:01:52.640> behind<00:01:53.240> every

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
that kind of intention behind every

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.569
