00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
even half of the time read properly as

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:13.880 
even half of the time read properly as
it<00:02:06.840> skips<00:02:07.530> or<00:02:07.979> stops<00:02:09.319> it's<00:02:10.550> it's<00:02:11.550> uh<00:02:12.620> it's<00:02:13.620> not

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
it works but it works very very fast

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.100 
it works but it works very very fast
I'll<00:02:36.150> show<00:02:37.019> you<00:02:37.200> what<00:02:37.349> I<00:02:37.380> mean<00:02:38.690> if<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:39.870> take<00:02:40.080> a

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
I'll show you what I mean if you take a

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:47.600 
I'll show you what I mean if you take a
look<00:02:41.360> from<00:02:42.360> this<00:02:42.630> area<00:02:42.989> here<00:02:45.530> now<00:02:46.530> if<00:02:47.370> I

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
look from this area here now if I

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.770 
look from this area here now if I
activated<00:02:48.239> it<00:02:48.650> you<00:02:49.650> would<00:02:49.860> see<00:02:50.360> it's<00:02:51.360> actually

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
activated it you would see it's actually

00:02:51.780 --> 00:03:03.960 
activated it you would see it's actually
spinning<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.319> little<00:02:52.560> bit<00:02:52.680> fast

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:12.990 

yeah<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:07.670> settings<00:03:08.060> I<00:03:08.239> have<00:03:08.480> here<00:03:09.049> are<00:03:11.500> 33

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
yeah and the settings I have here are 33

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:23.289 
yeah and the settings I have here are 33
or<00:03:14.000> 45<00:03:19.569> and<00:03:20.569> I<00:03:20.780> believe<00:03:21.400> 33<00:03:22.400> that's<00:03:23.030> this

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
or 45 and I believe 33 that's this

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.740 
or 45 and I believe 33 that's this
sitting<00:03:23.660> for<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:25.370> normal<00:03:25.790> size<00:03:26.030> our<00:03:26.360> players

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
sitting for the normal size our players

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.339 
sitting for the normal size our players
and<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.290> 40<00:03:27.530> fires<00:03:27.769> are<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:29.260> little<00:03:30.260> ones

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
and the 40 fires are the little ones

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:35.910 
and the 40 fires are the little ones
which<00:03:31.280> I<00:03:31.459> have<00:03:31.579> to<00:03:32.170> put<00:03:33.170> this<00:03:33.349> in<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.739> record<00:03:33.890> I

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
which I have to put this in the record I

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:50.080 
which I have to put this in the record I
presume<00:03:45.790> but<00:03:46.790> nonetheless<00:03:48.190> that<00:03:49.190> works<00:03:49.430> good

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
presume but nonetheless that works good

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:57.849 
presume but nonetheless that works good
just<00:03:51.079> a<00:03:51.349> little<00:03:51.530> bit<00:03:51.920> fast<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:56.720> coolest<00:03:57.230> but

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
just a little bit fast the coolest but

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:00.550 
just a little bit fast the coolest but
it<00:03:58.160> still<00:03:58.549> doesn't<00:03:58.790> work<00:03:58.940> is<00:03:59.780> that<00:04:00.140> if<00:04:00.290> this

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
it still doesn't work is that if this

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.690 
it still doesn't work is that if this
stereo<00:04:00.950> came<00:04:01.609> with<00:04:01.819> this<00:04:01.970> remote

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
stereo came with this remote

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.870 
stereo came with this remote
but<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:04.790> problem<00:04:05.299> on<00:04:05.540> this<00:04:06.140> is<00:04:06.440> that<00:04:06.760> see<00:04:07.760> this

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
but the problem on this is that see this

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:14.830 
but the problem on this is that see this
sensor<00:04:08.329> over<00:04:08.569> here<00:04:10.209> it<00:04:12.430> doesn't<00:04:13.840> doesn't

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
sensor over here it doesn't doesn't

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.440 
sensor over here it doesn't doesn't
mostly<00:04:15.349> doesn't<00:04:15.769> even<00:04:15.889> have<00:04:16.250> the<00:04:16.820> time<00:04:17.060> pick

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
mostly doesn't even have the time pick

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:23.020 
mostly doesn't even have the time pick
up<00:04:17.919> what<00:04:18.919> I'm<00:04:19.070> pressing<00:04:19.549> on<00:04:19.729> this<00:04:20.570> remote<00:04:22.030> as

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
up what I'm pressing on this remote as

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:31.320 
up what I'm pressing on this remote as
you<00:04:23.090> can<00:04:23.389> see

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.230 

so<00:04:31.870> I'm<00:04:32.080> pressing<00:04:32.320> the<00:04:32.650> disk<00:04:33.340> button<00:04:33.880> on<00:04:34.120> the

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
so I'm pressing the disk button on the

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.300 
so I'm pressing the disk button on the
remote

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
remote

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.340 
remote
it<00:04:36.690> wouldn't<00:04:37.690> pick<00:04:37.870> it<00:04:38.020> up<00:04:39.930> when<00:04:40.930> I<00:04:41.080> just<00:04:41.110> put

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
it wouldn't pick it up when I just put

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.230 
it wouldn't pick it up when I just put
new<00:04:41.710> batteries<00:04:41.920> in<00:04:42.220> here<00:04:42.670> -<00:04:44.040> so<00:04:45.060> those<00:04:46.060> are

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
new batteries in here - so those are

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.220 
new batteries in here - so those are
only<00:04:46.360> just<00:04:46.720> to<00:04:47.280> just<00:04:48.280> do<00:04:48.460> problems<00:04:48.910> on<00:04:49.030> this

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
only just to just do problems on this

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.630 
only just to just do problems on this
stereo<00:04:50.230> and<00:04:51.870> actually<00:04:52.870> I<00:04:52.900> have<00:04:53.560> as<00:04:53.980> well<00:04:54.190> from

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
stereo and actually I have as well from

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.040 
stereo and actually I have as well from
the<00:04:54.700> phone<00:04:55.560> but<00:04:56.560> I'm<00:04:56.770> not<00:04:56.890> for<00:04:57.310> me<00:04:57.510> as<00:04:58.510> long<00:04:58.870> as

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
the phone but I'm not for me as long as
