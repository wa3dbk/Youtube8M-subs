00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
it's just it's a really cool map I think

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:33.330 
it's just it's a really cool map I think
this<00:02:31.780> one's<00:02:31.959> probably<00:02:32.139> my<00:02:32.379> second<00:02:32.889> favorite

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
this one's probably my second favorite

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.729 
this one's probably my second favorite
out<00:02:33.579> of<00:02:33.879> all<00:02:34.180> of<00:02:34.239> them<00:02:34.510> now<00:02:34.689> another<00:02:35.409> map<00:02:35.650> I

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
out of all of them now another map I

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.020 
out of all of them now another map I
played<00:02:35.980> on<00:02:36.099> will<00:02:36.250> switch<00:02:36.519> to<00:02:36.670> this<00:02:36.790> gameplay

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
played on will switch to this gameplay

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.409 
played on will switch to this gameplay
right<00:02:37.420> here<00:02:37.750> this<00:02:38.409> one<00:02:38.650> is<00:02:38.829> called<00:02:39.419> dragon

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:40.419 
right here this one is called dragon

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:42.420 
right here this one is called dragon
pass<00:02:40.840> I<00:02:41.260> believe<00:02:41.620> is<00:02:41.799> what<00:02:42.069> this<00:02:42.189> one<00:02:42.310> was
