00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
and where the pry bar we're going to pry

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.100 
and where the pry bar we're going to pry
the<00:02:52.019> AC<00:02:52.470> vents<00:02:53.100> from<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.459> dash<00:02:53.840> this<00:02:54.840> will

come from the dash and we're going to

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.910 
come from the dash and we're going to
spin<00:02:57.390> it<00:02:57.420> around<00:02:57.660> so<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.110> we<00:02:58.260> can<00:02:58.380> get<00:02:58.470> access

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
spin it around so that we can get access

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.559
