stuff this you progress the same way

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.190

X<00:02:13.769> of<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:14.010> game<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.459> just<00:02:15.030> personally<00:02:15.599> think

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
X of this game I just personally think

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.170 
X of this game I just personally think
that<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.470> was<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:17.010> was<00:02:17.189> a<00:02:17.220> bit<00:02:17.430> overhyped<00:02:17.849> and

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
that it was it was a bit overhyped and

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.420 
that it was it was a bit overhyped and
the<00:02:18.510> end<00:02:18.659> result<00:02:18.900> was<00:02:19.430> slightly

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
the end result was slightly

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.449 
the end result was slightly
disappointing<00:02:21.329> but<00:02:22.319> on<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.709> flip<00:02:22.920> side<00:02:22.950> that

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
disappointing but on the flip side that

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.250 
disappointing but on the flip side that
