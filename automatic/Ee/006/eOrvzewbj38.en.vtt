00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
muscular imbalance I'm going to describe

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.270 
muscular imbalance I'm going to describe
exactly<00:00:50.940> what<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.809> how<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.590> very

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
exactly what and how and a very

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.410 
exactly what and how and a very
interesting<00:00:53.430> one<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.789> many<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.270> have

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
interesting one that many of you have

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.080 
interesting one that many of you have
probably<00:00:54.629> not<00:00:55.050> thought<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.699> but<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.789> hands

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
probably not thought of but the hands

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.779 
probably not thought of but the hands
can<00:00:57.539> become<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.109> as<00:00:58.289> muscularly<00:00:58.800> imbalanced

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
can become just as muscularly imbalanced

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.600 
can become just as muscularly imbalanced
as<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:01.230> shoulders<00:01:01.739> as<00:01:02.270> the<00:01:03.270> hips<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:04.260> fact

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
as the shoulders as the hips and in fact

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.460 
as the shoulders as the hips and in fact
they<00:01:05.610> can't<00:01:05.970> muscular<00:01:06.720> imbalances<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
they can't muscular imbalances in the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.670 
they can't muscular imbalances in the
hand<00:01:07.799> can<00:01:08.369> array<00:01:08.790> D<00:01:08.850> eight<00:01:09.290> into<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.409> core<00:01:10.650> of

the body it radiation radiation right

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.270 
the body it radiation radiation right
basically<00:01:15.360> means<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.780> watch<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.680> if<00:01:17.130> you

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
basically means it watch this if you

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.740 
basically means it watch this if you
squeeze<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.790> hand<00:01:18.030> tight<00:01:18.210> squeeze<00:01:18.659> your
