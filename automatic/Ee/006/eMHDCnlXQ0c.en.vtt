 according to the council 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:17.109
 in there 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.720
 if it is strange that the bank 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.039
 I personally see it differently 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.039
 sober 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.569
 that said 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.760
 it is rather 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.890
 the stentor 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.890
 I have 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.700
 But that has to be clear 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.010
 the plugs 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.800

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.870
 in the parking lot it 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.450

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.450

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.720
 we also hope 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.170

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.170

 Portugal 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.500
 other option 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.710
 the 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.500
 the supporters of twente the minister 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.740

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.810
