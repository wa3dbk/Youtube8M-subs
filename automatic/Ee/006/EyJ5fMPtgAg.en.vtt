hopefully give you guys a sense of

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.789 
hopefully give you guys a sense of
what's<00:00:11.070> going<00:00:11.250> on<00:00:11.929> so<00:00:12.929> when<00:00:13.530> you're<00:00:13.620> playing

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
what's going on so when you're playing

what's going on so when you're playing
in<00:00:13.980> in<00:00:14.250> classic<00:00:14.910> controller<00:00:15.210> mode<00:00:15.410> you're

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
in in classic controller mode you're

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.310 
in in classic controller mode you're
going<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:17.449> use<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.539> control<00:00:18.779> stick<00:00:18.930> down<00:00:19.109> here

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
going to use the control stick down here

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.500 
going to use the control stick down here
to<00:00:19.590> move<00:00:19.740> this<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.090> equivalent<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.420> the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
to move this is the equivalent of the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.509 
to move this is the equivalent of the
c-stick<00:00:21.840> on<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.320> Gamecube<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.340> right

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
c-stick on the Gamecube the right

c-stick on the Gamecube the right
control<00:00:23.850> stick<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.359> it'll<00:00:24.510> be<00:00:24.539> quick

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
control stick is so it'll be quick

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.560 
control stick is so it'll be quick
smashes<00:00:25.650> every<00:00:26.220> direction<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:27.180> d-pad<00:00:27.539> is

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
smashes every direction the d-pad is

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.289 
really really simplifies things and
actually<00:03:39.919> in<00:03:40.190> my<00:03:40.310> mind<00:03:40.489> is<00:03:40.579> sort<00:03:40.790> of<00:03:40.819> it<00:03:41.030> takes

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
actually in my mind is sort of it takes

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.240 
actually in my mind is sort of it takes
me<00:03:41.419> back<00:03:41.540> to<00:03:41.599> NES<00:03:42.379> days<00:03:42.620> because<00:03:42.919> you're<00:03:43.040> doing

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
me back to NES days because you're doing

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.430 
me back to NES days because you're doing
a<00:03:43.310> lot<00:03:43.430> of<00:03:43.489> the<00:03:43.609> similar<00:03:43.819> movements<00:03:44.599> you<00:03:45.290> move

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
a lot of the similar movements you move

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.369 
a lot of the similar movements you move
around<00:03:45.560> with<00:03:46.010> the<00:03:46.340> d-pad<00:03:46.900> double<00:03:47.900> tap<00:03:48.019> to<00:03:48.079> dash

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
around with the d-pad double tap to dash

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.439 
around with the d-pad double tap to dash
so<00:03:48.889> again<00:03:49.609> it's<00:03:49.760> sort<00:03:49.970> of<00:03:50.030> similar<00:03:50.180> to<00:03:50.419> old

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:50.449 
so again it's sort of similar to old

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:53.949 
so again it's sort of similar to old
school<00:03:50.750> fighters<00:03:51.250> attack<00:03:52.250> is<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.459> a<00:03:52.959> special

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
school fighters attack is to a special

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.629 
school fighters attack is to a special
attack<00:03:54.199> is<00:03:54.409> one<00:03:54.680> your<00:03:55.129> shield<00:03:55.370> button<00:03:55.579> is

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
attack is one your shield button is

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.580 
attack is one your shield button is
actually<00:03:55.940> under<00:03:56.030> here<00:03:56.269> so<00:03:57.169> that's<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.440> thing

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
actually under here so that's the thing

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.349 
actually under here so that's the thing
that's<00:03:57.680> going<00:03:57.859> to<00:03:57.919> take<00:03:58.069> the<00:03:58.940> most<00:03:59.090> getting

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
that's going to take the most getting

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:00.399 
that's going to take the most getting
used<00:03:59.510> to<00:03:59.629> I<00:03:59.659> think<00:03:59.750> for<00:03:59.959> a<00:04:00.079> lot<00:04:00.199> of<00:04:00.260> you<00:04:00.379> guys
