00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
of the delay in Japan I think Sony will

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.010

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.020 
probably ship around 10 million in the
US<00:00:56.320> and<00:00:56.560> my<00:00:56.770> guess<00:00:57.010> is<00:00:57.220> that<00:00:57.250> those<00:00:57.580> will<00:00:57.790> sell

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
US and my guess is that those will sell

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.540 
US and my guess is that those will sell
out<00:00:58.060> the<00:00:58.870> Xbox<00:00:59.350> well<00:00:59.680> probably<00:01:00.010> demand<00:01:00.250> will

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
out the Xbox well probably demand will

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.340

be<00:01:00.640> a<00:01:00.670> little<00:01:00.880> lower<00:01:01.180> because<00:01:01.570> an<00:01:01.780> extra<00:01:02.140> one

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
be a little lower because an extra one

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.500 
be a little lower because an extra one
hundred<00:01:02.620> dollars<00:01:02.950> I<00:01:03.160> think<00:01:04.030> microsoft

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
behind the first 1.5 million and so I

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.110 
behind the first 1.5 million and so I
think<00:01:41.740> you're<00:01:42.040> going<00:01:42.250> to<00:01:42.370> have<00:01:42.550> fun<00:01:42.790> some

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
supply short it is and I think to the

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.610 
supply short it is and I think to the

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.710 
Christmas so why you know won't get it
on<00:03:32.500> day<00:03:32.680> one<00:03:32.920> you<00:03:33.130> also<00:03:33.520> get<00:03:33.700> it<00:03:33.850> to<00:03:33.970> this<00:03:34.210> year

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
on day one you also get it to this year

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.020 
on day one you also get it to this year
so<00:03:35.080> it's<00:03:35.290> really<00:03:35.470> tough<00:03:35.740> to<00:03:35.770> say<00:03:36.070> just<00:03:36.790> how

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
so it's really tough to say just how

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.390 
so it's really tough to say just how
much<00:03:37.240> is<00:03:37.300> truth<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:37.990> how<00:03:38.110> much<00:03:38.320> is<00:03:38.560> PR<00:03:38.980> spin

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
much is truth and how much is PR spin

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.760 
much is truth and how much is PR spin
and<00:03:39.670> these<00:03:39.880> two<00:03:40.120> pieces<00:03:40.900> of<00:03:40.960> information<00:03:41.230> I

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
and these two pieces of information I

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.010 
and these two pieces of information I
say<00:03:42.460> that<00:03:42.760> the<00:03:42.880> most<00:03:43.030> interesting<00:03:43.480> fact<00:03:43.780> or

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
say that the most interesting fact or

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.560 
say that the most interesting fact or
idea<00:03:44.410> is<00:03:44.620> at<00:03:44.770> 1.5<00:03:45.370> million<00:03:45.850> pre-orders<00:03:46.120> have

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
idea is at 1.5 million pre-orders have

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.699 
idea is at 1.5 million pre-orders have
been<00:03:46.720> made<00:03:46.930> for<00:03:47.170> the<00:03:47.260> ps4<00:03:47.530> and<00:03:48.390> out<00:03:49.390> of<00:03:49.510> what

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
what I would love to know is the rough

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.010 
what I would love to know is the rough

to a source that I can check out please
do<00:04:10.990> so<00:04:11.200> as<00:04:11.410> I'd<00:04:11.560> love<00:04:11.740> to<00:04:11.920> know<00:04:12.030> but<00:04:13.030> still<00:04:13.300> it's

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
do so as I'd love to know but still it's

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.420 
do so as I'd love to know but still it's
going<00:04:13.630> to<00:04:13.690> be<00:04:13.750> a<00:04:13.780> rather<00:04:13.930> interesting<00:04:14.470> turn<00:04:15.400> of

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
going to be a rather interesting turn of

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.979 
going to be a rather interesting turn of
events<00:04:15.580> when<00:04:16.000> these<00:04:16.150> consoles<00:04:16.510> actually<00:04:16.840> come

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
events when these consoles actually come

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.229 
events when these consoles actually come
out<00:04:17.080> then<00:04:17.320> we<00:04:17.500> will<00:04:17.620> really<00:04:17.950> see<00:04:18.220> how<00:04:18.820> much<00:04:19.030> any

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
out then we will really see how much any

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.970 
out then we will really see how much any
supply<00:04:19.810> shortages<00:04:20.350> that<00:04:20.410> end<00:04:20.799> up<00:04:20.950> happening

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
supply shortages that end up happening

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.190 
supply shortages that end up happening
which<00:04:21.430> may<00:04:21.580> not<00:04:21.609> happen<00:04:21.810> but<00:04:22.810> it<00:04:22.960> wouldn't<00:04:23.140> be

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
which may not happen but it wouldn't be

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.810 
which may not happen but it wouldn't be
surprising<00:04:23.500> if<00:04:23.650> it<00:04:23.800> did<00:04:23.919> given<00:04:24.220> how<00:04:24.340> popular

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
surprising if it did given how popular

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.330 
surprising if it did given how popular
the<00:04:24.910> ps4<00:04:25.150> is<00:04:25.479> how<00:04:26.020> much<00:04:26.260> impacts<00:04:26.890> they<00:04:27.190> would

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
the ps4 is how much impacts they would

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.090 
the ps4 is how much impacts they would
actually<00:04:27.610> have

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
actually have

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.330 
actually have
on<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:28.550> release<00:04:28.760> and<00:04:29.090> sales<00:04:29.480> of<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:29.840> console

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
on the release and sales of the console

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.530 
on the release and sales of the console
