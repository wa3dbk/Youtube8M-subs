00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.630
 video is possible broadcast is already underway 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.070
 maybe she passed maybe only 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.980
 started anyway I advise you to go 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.109
 look well let's rabbit everyone 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.240
 hi my name is benders today i am you 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.610
 show a small mod which add 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.860
 new features glass you can do 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.680
 different interesting manipulations with him and 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.870
 even make glass weapons in general 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.850
 all in order earlier if we broke 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.160
 glass did not get anything just and 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.980
 the glass broke and that's it 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.180
 now if you break the glass then all 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.190
 will be different 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.440
 Well, you probably already understand that of him 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.600
 something you will be what exactly glass 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.539
 broken glass break a lot 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.430
 many-many-many glass fragments 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.649
 as you notice falls out not so 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.110
 a lot really as i say i have 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.330
 does not fall out every time but it is understandable 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.909
 sometimes glass may break completely 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.100
 shatters that glass fragments just 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.290
 it will not be impossible to collect them 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.799
 as now for example, well, and many 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.900
 will ask 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.659
 but why do we need these glass fragments 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.240
 I'll tell you first you can kill them 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.729
 Here I am seriously telling you, see, plus 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.040
 one lesson i mean i can by these shards 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.000
 beat people you know what that reminds me 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.310
 the best weapon in the fight rosochka here 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.270
 Well, that is, from the bottle, okay, let's go 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.310
 from the criminal theme 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.140
 besides the fact that you can beat her you 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.210
 can use it to 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.250
 back to make of this block of glass 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.560
 how easy for that you need 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.899
 the stove and and we will now take out the creative 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.479
 regime and it was necessary to prepare but even i 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.970
 not prepared okay in general, everything is at 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.729
 us the stove has a workbench and oak boards 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.219
 here, too, is all the puhalsky div of the regime all 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.840
 we have and let's try 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.450
 return to this glass the original form 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.790
 very simply throw glass here and fry 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.409
 we fry it straight 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.539
 fry it for example on here 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.229
 vados like anything on coals no matter 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:12.930
 what will you fry on and voila we get 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.180
 boom glass like this 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.280
 there is a chance after the glass 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.959
 will break it back in back 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.060
 normal appearance that is if you fell 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.069
 shards you can somehow in magical 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.019
 to melt the glass in the stove and 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.900
 to make a glass block out of it again 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.330
 okay then the second function is now 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.010
 it can be painted shorter yes now here 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.480
 these fragments can be painted but earlier 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.629
 in general it was impossible because they were not 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.390
 I can now let's go into normal mode 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.360
 back and since it is done to us 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.620
 need a workbench workbench eat well 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.170
 we lay out these fragments like this 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.510
 way and put lapis lazuli here 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.819
 blue fragments do exactly with them 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.510
 we can also melt just take 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:56.549
 stove laying and oak boards here 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.160
 what do you think will work I think many 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.930
 understand that you get a blue glass drag 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.940
 that is, like this, that is usually 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.030
 stronger glass work out let's 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.730
 wait and boom blue glass is fine 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.760
 now want you want something else 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.069
 show how to return the glass to the usual form 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.780
 that is, what it was originally like 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.180
 there are glass fragments if to be 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.680
 exact blue right now i don't want to 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.930
 they were blue for example want to 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.959
 back white became very easy to take 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.349
 gunpowder and craft laid them here 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.139
 add gunpowder and we will need a lot 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.760
 these secret things well, for example 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.889
 so here it is, for example if you 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.530
 there are different colors for example beautiful 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:39.569
 up to 27 these are one purple one green and 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.239
 you want to return them all to normal 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.430
 plain transparent color just put 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.859
 here the powder and the veil from all the fragments we have 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.569
 ordinary further one more thing just 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.790
 did something that I liked, we 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.130
 Skraftim friends knife glass Kraft 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.290
 he follows the glass sword if 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.840
 to be more precise it does not look enough 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.609
 cool well i mean blink unfortunately he is not 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.190
 transparent when it is in our hands 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:04.319
 but in kraft transparent we can now 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.450
 walk and hand out to everyone with a glass sword 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.970
 it is much better than just glass 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.620
 splinters hit in the face is real 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.540
 glass sword but something to me 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.659
 prompts that strength 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.669
 not much power let's this prosthesis him 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:21.239
 Well, let's give some more 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.680
 fluid walking here and see how 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.690
 long it will break at all at the very 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.639
 In fact, he breaks down for a long time and I think 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.009
 it would be logical if he broke 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.340
 quickly that is the spirit of logic given the sword 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:34.139
 all weak things okay in general 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.030
 It works normally in general 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.039
 here's a mod friends more glass 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.539
 splinters and balls and you can put 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:42.000
 more likes under this video 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:44.370
 Well, in principle, thank you all for watching with 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.509
 you have been bender all good luck and to new 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.509
 See you all for now
