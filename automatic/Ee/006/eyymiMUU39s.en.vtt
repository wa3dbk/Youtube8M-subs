00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.290 
column and be up in Echo just the way i
spawned<00:03:20.350> it<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:21.130> would<00:03:21.370> all<00:03:21.580> be<00:03:21.610> marching

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
spawned it it would all be marching

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.420 
spawned it it would all be marching
across<00:03:22.540> this<00:03:22.930> open<00:03:23.350> field<00:03:23.620> at<00:03:24.010> different

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
across this open field at different

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.670 
across this open field at different
speeds<00:03:24.819> it<00:03:25.300> would<00:03:25.480> take<00:03:25.690> five<00:03:25.960> minutes<00:03:26.260> to<00:03:26.440> get

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
speeds it would take five minutes to get

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.460 
speeds it would take five minutes to get
there

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
there

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.200 
there
but<00:03:28.250> what<00:03:28.400> I<00:03:28.430> did<00:03:28.760> through<00:03:29.300> some<00:03:29.600> micro<00:03:30.110> is

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
but what I did through some micro is

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:37.390 
but what I did through some micro is
actually<00:03:33.280> better<00:03:34.870> so<00:03:35.980> you<00:03:36.980> know<00:03:37.100> in<00:03:37.280> this

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
actually better so you know in this

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.180 
actually better so you know in this
asymmetric<00:03:38.240> warfare<00:03:38.560> or<00:03:39.560> maybe<00:03:39.890> this<00:03:40.040> is

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
asymmetric warfare or maybe this is

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.310 
asymmetric warfare or maybe this is
symmetric<00:03:40.670> warfare<00:03:41.090> actually<00:03:41.740> I<00:03:44.140> don't<00:03:45.140> want

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
symmetric warfare actually I don't want

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.550 
symmetric warfare actually I don't want
columns<00:03:45.800> you<00:03:46.370> know<00:03:46.460> this<00:03:46.610> isn't<00:03:46.940> total<00:03:47.300> war

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
columns you know this isn't total war

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.610 
columns you know this isn't total war
with<00:03:48.970> rome<00:03:49.970> total<00:03:50.240> war<00:03:50.450> with<00:03:50.900> phalanx

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
with rome total war with phalanx

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.600 
with rome total war with phalanx
infantry<00:03:52.430> I've<00:03:52.790> got<00:03:53.660> atgm<00:03:54.590> units<00:03:55.070> recon

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
infantry I've got atgm units recon

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.480 
infantry I've got atgm units recon
helicopters<00:03:56.500> infantry<00:03:57.500> transport

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
helicopters infantry transport

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.540 
helicopters infantry transport
helicopters<00:03:59.330> so<00:04:00.290> I<00:04:00.320> don't<00:04:00.650> want<00:04:00.890> a<00:04:01.070> formation

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
helicopters so I don't want a formation

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.900 
helicopters so I don't want a formation
that's<00:04:02.240> so<00:04:02.950> rigid<00:04:03.950> and<00:04:04.160> I<00:04:04.340> don't<00:04:04.520> need<00:04:04.640> it<00:04:04.790> to

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
that's so rigid and I don't need it to

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.530 
that's so rigid and I don't need it to
move<00:04:05.150> like<00:04:05.959> it's<00:04:06.170> rigid<00:04:06.440> formation<00:04:07.360> this<00:04:08.360> is

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
move like it's rigid formation this is

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.570 
move like it's rigid formation this is
much<00:04:08.720> more<00:04:08.750> powerful<00:04:09.350> so<00:04:10.250> there<00:04:10.430> you<00:04:10.550> go

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
much more powerful so there you go

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.570 
much more powerful so there you go
everything<00:04:11.240> is<00:04:11.330> where<00:04:11.510> it<00:04:11.600> should<00:04:11.630> be<00:04:12.310> echo<00:04:13.310> is

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
everything is where it should be echo is

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.180 
everything is where it should be echo is
very<00:04:14.570> secure<00:04:15.970> and<00:04:17.620> there<00:04:18.620> you<00:04:18.709> have<00:04:18.769> it<00:04:18.919> that's

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
very secure and there you have it that's

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.880 
very secure and there you have it that's
its<00:04:20.000> four-point-oh<00:04:20.720> deploying<00:04:21.560> on<00:04:21.769> the

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
its four-point-oh deploying on the

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:28.090 
its four-point-oh deploying on the
battlefield<00:04:24.640> have<00:04:25.640> a<00:04:25.669> great<00:04:25.910> day
