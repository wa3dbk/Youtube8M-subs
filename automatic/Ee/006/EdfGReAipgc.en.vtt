 man jan and as you can see I am level 50 the 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:13.059
 truth is that I started a little bit 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.159
 rested a little I have let the play 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.770
 discard because if it was not going to explode like that 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:19.960

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:27.430

 1 to continue your progress 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.520
 in public games we would give x and no 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.170
 would leave the usual in prestige mode 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.880
 restart your challenges range and two 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.190
 blocks for a bit of prestige to 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.470
 change you will earn a prestigious icon a 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.360

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.180
 emblems that you've got in this 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.090
 case I want to stand out in this explanation 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.399
 the permanent unlocking that I remember 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.010
 that this may be white 2 not me 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.900
 agreement but the permanent unlocking me 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.890
 agreement that was in some previous elbow 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.900
 no words if I do not think the white 12 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.140
 Well well we would give more 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.430
 information and good to see what it puts us 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.260
 here everything you have unlocked 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.850
 including the challenges the experience and 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.440
 the weapons will restart you will have to 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.540
 go back up the rank to 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.700
 recover it your business cards 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.979
 emblem icons camouflage emblems 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.210
 of weapons and arsenal items are not 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.340
 will be affected because we are going to start the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.600
 next prestige I do not care about everything 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.060
 here we are already 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.280
 that we want to unlock permanently 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.720
 and the truth is that I have no idea 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.340
 but in this case I could unlock 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.080
 Help me help you unlock anything at 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.190
 pitu of that I do not use it at all 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:55.380
 pitcher I do not mind jokers either 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:59.430
 advantages I use only these two in 1 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.909
 here I use only the peripheral one and 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.120
 here yes you could use suppressor 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.790
 detonation but I'm not interested 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.260
 and the gusts do not interest me much either 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.260
 unlock anything but 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.530
 let's see what we have in their rifles 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.260
 because I am used very very little and 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.710
 there is a submachine gun that goes very well to see no 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.670
 it was not an assault rifle 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.670
 which was uncle 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.209
 I do not know what to unblock people 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.790
 You can block the streak of points 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.560
 of hacking the system that I think is 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.860
 the sting that bothers me the most I promise you and 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.510
 I will teach you because those you do not know 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.400
 those who have played then you will say you have 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.250
 You are going to give me the reason 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.110
 100% is the most annoying advantage of 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.340
 you will all see because the chosen team 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.100
 keep unlocked after 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.140
 acquire prestige ok there is no turn 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.750
 back uy kids that I do whistle dick 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.170
 gorgorito where are you going I can 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:06.459
 enter prestige come in the game 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.170
 and in theory I'm already a web prestige 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.800
 well I want to show you something else too 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.540
 after having seen this what good not 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.880
 it's no nonsense but it's not something either 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.770
 exaggerated not here we have those of 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.350
 notifications that by the way I have 12 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:26.290
 they have given me all this to acquire nine 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:29.780
 prestigious already exo recognizes sentinel 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.940
 I have this gold the former arsenal 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.489
 advanced that is what I have been given with 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.430
 the steel this one is also good this one 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.680
 is chulito lack of bolts the golden 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.550
 I think it makes me more cool no more and what 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.370
 good rest 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:47.460
 to see the jacket nothing I prefer to be 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.830
 with a good shirt 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:53.110
 well nothing here we are 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.820
 often character you liked that good 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.130
 I wanted to teach is another thing that was to see 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.100
 so the marker of course you know that 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:03.340
 I'm trying to be the top 1 of the 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.960
 world in domain mode in this case 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.910
 we would go to see him in agent 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:11.820
 domain markers and as you can see I am the 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.590
 253 of the world then what am I going to do 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.470
 I said that the series would be called weapon time 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.900
 What a gift is not the plan on the way to 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.549
 end of the world in game plan but 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.370
 I do not know if changing the name put it to your 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.870
 top 1 or something like that to identify 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.270
 more I think so that in the end I will put 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.550
 top 1 time 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.800
 and well what I'm going to do I'm not going to record 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.599
 chapter by chapter chapter by 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.080
 chapter is that he gave me departure for 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:40.449
 departure but commenting that I'm going 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.539
 to record many games in a row without 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:45.159
 comment and without faces without anything and I the 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:46.780
 go up like that what will be a series in 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:50.409
 plan to catch popcorn and cocacola and 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.770
 enjoy all the casualties of all 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:55.509
 the skills of I do not know of all the 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.970
 frantic action of what is the call of 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:00.400
 duty the vanguard guard so good if 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.919
 You see if you do not see what he said and I go up 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.569
 video of it being 30 minutes only 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.659
 playing games where I do not speak then 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:10.360
 well basically it 's because it's the series 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:13.599
 of iron to your top 1 then he will not talk 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.639
 or nothing is worth it so that you know how to try 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.949
 is to get to the top 1 and as soon as you arrive 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:20.020
 I will continue playing I will continue 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:21.819
 trying to hold the throne that for 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.190
 true the top 1 who is therefore this gentleman 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:25.539
 hacker I hope that when he arrives then he will 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.979
 they are already in a damn time and 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:29.139
 eliminate so I can be because of 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.389
 moment as much as these can be 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.220
 two so I hope they go in to this 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:36.370
 kid 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:39.160
 which atemajac if you are not afraid 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.900
 because no hacks have actually 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:44.050
 there haxhi such is normal at the beginning 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.599
 to woofer mode 3 at the beginning 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.780
 there were hacks in white 2 I do not remember 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:51.280
 in tastes too so well then 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.230
 here 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.060
 it is normal that at first yes that you do not 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.920
 you fear that nothing happens is a great game 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.930
 and I recommend it as I said in videos 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.550
 prior to one hundred percent if you want 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.470
 but that you liked already you know like 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:06.389
 for and it's gone a lot we'll see you 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.389
 in the next video goodbye people
