00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.480
 you can never know in advance what 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.840
 you fill up the tank but every refill 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.610
 can be your last car 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.040
 we know how to identify dangerous for 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.680
 gasoline engine 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.690
 here this portable skinny test looks like 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.200
 pregnancy test and tax on your 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.200
 a bun 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:48.239
 check the quality of the fuel before refueling 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.460
 it was impossible but Russian scientists 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.289
 developed a test indicator defining 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.769
 the presence of metal-containing additives in 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.780
 fueled 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.170
 special 2D material in 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.579
 which he drove torn sorbents 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.559
 which selectively arise here are those 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.899
 fake and supplements that are there 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.869
 there is no try to understand the difficult 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.810
 the chemical formula is important it works 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.210
 now everyone can check for himself 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.860
 Does gasoline contain dangerous metals and 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.159
 additives and bring 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.759
 it is they who settle on the details kill 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.420
 engine this strip express test 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.190
 reacts with a color to forbidden to write 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.450
 enough 50 gasoline and compare 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.970
 color scale 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.880
 yellow left good fuel 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.920
 turned green octane raised with 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.990
 using pen prices or other 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.990
 deadly for the engine things 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:49.030
 i'm not direct how is it so expensive 95 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.390
 premium so i think the strip turned green 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.660
 what does it mean someone is pregnant this 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.630
 It means that you filled 92 from and 80 the rest 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.880
 dangerous additives could they possibly 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.630
 sell substandard gas well when 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.110
 here I will bring to the clear water that is 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.380
 petrol 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.530
 my check ordinary refueling see 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.580
 what kind of petrol is poured in here even 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.580
 Barbuck pour 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.040
 black stripe color is generally necessary to us with 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.750
 changed everywhere present forbidden 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.250
 technical regulations tracer 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.520
 suction cup using which lift 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.720
 octane number to make from 92 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.790
 gasoline 95 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.980
 you need to add just a liter of gasoline 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.360
 twenty milligrams of forbidden 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.640
 additive tour price is all the same 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:45.730
 bodyagi who sent our horse 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:48.940
 and this is not the worst bunny yes 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:54.090
 I'm fine, I'm telling you. 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.090
 let's go on foot to
