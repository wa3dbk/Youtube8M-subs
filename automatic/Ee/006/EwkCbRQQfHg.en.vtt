00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
which by the way on mine were a bit

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.850 
which by the way on mine were a bit
loose<00:02:03.330> I<00:02:03.600> had<00:02:03.690> to<00:02:03.810> thicken<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.260> peg<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.590> little

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
loose I had to thicken that peg a little

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.850 
loose I had to thicken that peg a little
bit<00:02:04.980> with<00:02:05.160> some<00:02:05.310> super<00:02:05.610> glue<00:02:05.760> or<00:02:05.790> nail<00:02:06.180> polish

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
bit with some super glue or nail polish

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.729 
bit with some super glue or nail polish
and<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.160> Gehrke<00:02:08.670> bo<00:02:08.879> Rekha<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:10.470> get<00:02:10.619> this

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
and the on Gehrke bo Rekha you get this

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.729 
and the on Gehrke bo Rekha you get this
version<00:02:11.370> which<00:02:11.489> is<00:02:11.609> the<00:02:11.640> stored<00:02:12.150> version<00:02:12.739> now

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
version which is the stored version now

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.309 
version which is the stored version now
here's<00:02:13.950> again<00:02:14.640> this<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:14.939> another<00:02:15.180> minor<00:02:16.079> down

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
here's again this is another minor down

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.970 
here's again this is another minor down
point<00:02:16.620> with<00:02:16.739> this

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
point with this

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.430 
point with this
to<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:18.330> arm<00:02:18.540> him<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:18.900> got<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.050> remove<00:02:19.319> this

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
to to arm him you got to remove this

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.400 
to to arm him you got to remove this
whole<00:02:19.620> thing<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.390> replace<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.660> with<00:02:21.870> a

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
whole thing and replace it with a

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.339 
whole thing and replace it with a
version<00:02:22.709> that<00:02:23.160> is<00:02:23.730> empty<00:02:24.050> so<00:02:25.050> it's<00:02:25.290> a

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
version that is empty so it's a

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.460 
version that is empty so it's a
completely<00:02:25.680> different<00:02:25.860> little<00:02:26.190> clip<00:02:26.430> now

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
completely different little clip now

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.570 
completely different little clip now
this<00:02:28.470> does<00:02:28.680> make<00:02:28.830> sense<00:02:29.010> cuz<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.340> affero

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
this does make sense cuz the affero

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.130 
this does make sense cuz the affero
supposed<00:02:29.879> to<00:02:29.940> get<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.090> lot<00:02:30.330> longer<00:02:30.660> when<00:02:31.019> he's

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
supposed to get a lot longer when he's

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.330 
supposed to get a lot longer when he's
holding<00:02:31.319> them<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:31.739> I'm<00:02:31.800> okay<00:02:32.010> with<00:02:32.160> that

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
holding them and I'm okay with that

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.240 
holding them and I'm okay with that
and<00:02:32.569> similarly<00:02:33.569> he<00:02:34.290> swapped<00:02:34.680> his<00:02:34.800> hands<00:02:35.130> to

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
and similarly he swapped his hands to

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.640 
and similarly he swapped his hands to
his<00:02:35.370> only<00:02:35.670> pair<00:02:35.910> of<00:02:36.000> alternate<00:02:36.450> hands<00:02:36.690> that

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
his only pair of alternate hands that

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.910 
his only pair of alternate hands that
being<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.980> ones<00:02:38.160> holding<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.880> weapons<00:02:39.269> and

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
being the ones holding the weapons and

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.030 
being the ones holding the weapons and
again<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:40.950> can<00:02:41.250> deal<00:02:41.430> with<00:02:41.459> that<00:02:41.730> that's<00:02:41.970> cool

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
again I can deal with that that's cool

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.960 
again I can deal with that that's cool
it's<00:02:44.040> nice<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.430> don't<00:02:44.549> have<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.760> worry

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
it's nice that you don't have to worry

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.940 
it's nice that you don't have to worry
about<00:02:45.090> finagling<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:46.019> toy<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.379> hold<00:02:46.620> his<00:02:46.830> own

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
weapons the the part that's kind of

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.720 
weapons the the part that's kind of
annoying<00:02:49.650> though<00:02:49.830> is<00:02:50.160> that<00:02:50.190> you're<00:02:50.640> gonna

notice these weapons it got nothing on

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.870 
notice these weapons it got nothing on
the<00:02:54.180> end<00:02:54.299> you<00:02:54.750> have<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:54.989> take<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:56.400> little

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
the end you have to take the little

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.670 
the end you have to take the little
demon<00:02:57.239> heads<00:02:57.480> off<00:02:57.750> of<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.079> stored<00:02:58.410> version

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
demon heads off of the stored version

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.670 
demon heads off of the stored version
and<00:02:59.510> stick<00:03:00.510> them<00:03:00.630> onto<00:03:00.810> these<00:03:01.049> ones<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:01.500> that

and stick them onto these ones and that
I<00:03:01.950> just<00:03:02.700> don't<00:03:02.849> understand<00:03:03.329> why<00:03:03.599> they<00:03:04.170> did

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
I just don't understand why they did

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.210 
I just don't understand why they did
that<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:05.870> don't<00:03:06.870> really<00:03:07.530> see<00:03:07.829> how<00:03:07.980> it<00:03:08.099> could

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
that I don't really see how it could

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.890 
that I don't really see how it could
have<00:03:08.310> saved<00:03:08.519> them<00:03:08.700> money<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:09.209> not<00:03:09.360> just<00:03:09.599> sculpt

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
have saved them money to not just sculpt

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.640 
have saved them money to not just sculpt
this<00:03:10.110> on<00:03:10.260> both<00:03:10.500> pieces<00:03:12.019> honestly<00:03:13.019> these<00:03:13.500> are

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
this on both pieces honestly these are

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.470 
this on both pieces honestly these are
two<00:03:13.860> extra<00:03:14.250> pieces<00:03:14.549> of<00:03:14.640> plastic<00:03:15.030> if<00:03:15.150> anything

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
two extra pieces of plastic if anything

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.699 
two extra pieces of plastic if anything
I<00:03:15.569> feel<00:03:15.720> these<00:03:15.900> might<00:03:16.110> have<00:03:16.230> made<00:03:16.349> it<00:03:16.380> cost

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
I feel these might have made it cost

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.819 
I feel these might have made it cost
more<00:03:17.549> to<00:03:17.940> produce<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.510> maybe<00:03:19.140> we<00:03:19.260> lost<00:03:19.440> out<00:03:19.680> on

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
more to produce and maybe we lost out on

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.349 
more to produce and maybe we lost out on
something<00:03:20.099> that<00:03:20.130> this<00:03:20.730> toy<00:03:20.940> really<00:03:21.150> could

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
something that this toy really could

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.270 
something that this toy really could
have<00:03:21.450> used<00:03:21.720> that<00:03:22.049> being<00:03:22.470> more<00:03:23.239> accessories

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
have used that being more accessories

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.039 
have used that being more accessories
quite<00:03:26.280> specifically<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:27.299> feel<00:03:27.600> that<00:03:27.810> this<00:03:27.870> guy

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
quite specifically I feel that this guy

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.300 
quite specifically I feel that this guy
should<00:03:28.230> have<00:03:28.260> had<00:03:28.470> at<00:03:28.620> least<00:03:28.769> a<00:03:28.859> couple<00:03:29.040> more

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
should have had at least a couple more

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.319 
should have had at least a couple more
hands<00:03:30.049> maybe<00:03:31.049> a<00:03:31.170> one<00:03:32.040> hand<00:03:32.730> that's<00:03:33.180> like<00:03:33.299> a

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
hands maybe a one hand that's like a

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.180 
hands maybe a one hand that's like a
fist<00:03:33.660> with<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:33.930> pop-out<00:03:34.350> knuckle<00:03:34.829> spikes

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
fist with the pop-out knuckle spikes

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.370 
fist with the pop-out knuckle spikes
maybe<00:03:35.549> a<00:03:35.639> saluting<00:03:36.389> hand<00:03:36.630> for<00:03:36.870> a<00:03:36.900> signature

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
maybe a saluting hand for a signature

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.740 
maybe a saluting hand for a signature
pose<00:03:37.609> really<00:03:38.609> that's<00:03:38.850> my<00:03:39.000> biggest<00:03:39.299> downside

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
pose really that's my biggest downside

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.240 
pose really that's my biggest downside
with<00:03:39.870> this<00:03:39.989> guy's<00:03:40.139> his<00:03:40.380> accessory<00:03:40.829> count<00:03:41.100> is

other dude who's a lot taller and then I

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.659
