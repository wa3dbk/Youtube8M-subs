00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
down in one I'm pretty sure they call it

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.299 
down in one I'm pretty sure they call it
the<00:00:30.950> ACE<00:00:31.130> cleaver<00:00:31.490> and<00:00:31.960> if<00:00:32.960> not<00:00:33.260> who<00:00:33.739> gives<00:00:34.219> a

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
the ACE cleaver and if not who gives a

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.940 
the ACE cleaver and if not who gives a
shit<00:00:34.370> and<00:00:35.329> does<00:00:36.079> the<00:00:36.170> same<00:00:36.200> thing<00:00:36.590> as<00:00:36.710> all<00:00:36.829> the
