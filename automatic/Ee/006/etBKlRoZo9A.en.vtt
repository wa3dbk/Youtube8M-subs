00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
oakley's or whatever the sun's not out

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.929 
oakley's or whatever the sun's not out
don't<00:03:06.620> wear<00:03:06.859> them<00:03:07.010> cuz<00:03:07.250> if<00:03:07.400> you<00:03:07.430> want<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:07.790> take

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:07.939 
don't wear them cuz if you want to take

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:10.539 
don't wear them cuz if you want to take
them<00:03:08.090> off<00:03:08.859> putting<00:03:09.859> them<00:03:09.980> on<00:03:10.099> your<00:03:10.250> head<00:03:10.340> is

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
them off putting them on your head is

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.720 
them off putting them on your head is
not<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:10.939> right<00:03:11.090> choice<00:03:12.340> because<00:03:13.340> all<00:03:13.549> that's

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
not the right choice because all that's

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.690 
not the right choice because all that's
gonna<00:03:13.909> do<00:03:14.150> is<00:03:14.180> stretch<00:03:14.569> your<00:03:15.129> frames<00:03:16.129> out<00:03:16.400> even

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
gonna do is stretch your frames out even

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.759 
gonna do is stretch your frames out even
more<00:03:16.909> and<00:03:17.569> you<00:03:17.720> don't<00:03:17.900> want<00:03:18.049> that<00:03:18.140> if<00:03:18.470> you<00:03:18.500> like

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
more and you don't want that if you like

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:19.449 
more and you don't want that if you like
a<00:03:18.799> tight<00:03:19.129> fit

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
a tight fit

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.970 
a tight fit
I<00:03:20.769> don't<00:03:21.769> compare<00:03:22.579> these<00:03:22.790> a<00:03:22.819> little<00:03:23.060> bit<00:03:23.980> see

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
I don't compare these a little bit see

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.059 
I don't compare these a little bit see
these<00:03:25.190> bottom<00:03:25.670> ones<00:03:25.700> the<00:03:26.180> hybrids<00:03:26.859> these<00:03:27.859> are

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
these bottom ones the hybrids these are

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.599 
these bottom ones the hybrids these are
polarized<00:03:28.280> as<00:03:28.879> you<00:03:29.150> can<00:03:29.299> tokens<00:03:29.750> they're<00:03:30.709> so

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
polarized as you can tokens they're so

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:37.470 
polarized as you can tokens they're so
much<00:03:31.819> darker<00:03:32.359> than<00:03:32.620> these<00:03:33.620> heaters<00:03:35.859> they

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.520 
polarized they're kind of like a grey
shiny<00:03:46.599> because<00:03:47.599> like<00:03:47.780> when<00:03:47.989> you<00:03:48.109> look<00:03:48.230> in<00:03:48.409> the

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
shiny because like when you look in the

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.250 
shiny because like when you look in the
mirror<00:03:48.769> with<00:03:49.010> him<00:03:49.510> that's<00:03:50.510> better

they<00:03:52.220> reflected<00:03:52.879> really<00:03:53.239> well<00:03:54.819> and<00:03:55.819> then

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
they reflected really well and then

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:03.450 
they reflected really well and then
these

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.460 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.490

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:14.340 
they're still reflective but they're
just<00:04:06.740> not<00:04:06.920> as<00:04:07.720> reflective<00:04:08.720> as<00:04:08.960> the<00:04:10.060> hybrids

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.650 

they're<00:04:15.350> really<00:04:16.040> there's<00:04:16.459> so<00:04:16.700> much<00:04:16.850> darker<00:04:17.420> -
