 Japan's first historical amplifier lsi is stable and reminiscent as 4tb 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:14.659
 I got it 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:16.650
 Not only the appearance full of vintage taste 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.829

 It seems that it is not from mount foam cream sand, and it is the 1st island 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.800
 We cope to a wide range 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.300
 The output was 48 degrees 1 ac at the same time was the portability one quarter

 It was done by this in the future 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.290
 It is also a year-round 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.660
 You can understand the cause by raising the volume of the amplifier

 In the baby boom generation where bees are flying to the traffic lights in the box 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.660
 You have a lineup 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.509
 You will always find it in your own model 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:51.859
