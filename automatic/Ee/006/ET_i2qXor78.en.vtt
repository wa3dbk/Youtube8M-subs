it<00:01:24.210> looked<00:01:24.270> kind<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.570> weird<00:01:24.630> like<00:01:25.759> like

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
it looked kind of weird like like

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.700 
it looked kind of weird like like
there's<00:01:27.000> like<00:01:27.180> all<00:01:27.360> these<00:01:27.509> colors<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.290> people

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
there's like all these colors of people

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.590 
there's like all these colors of people
when<00:01:29.130> they<00:01:29.280> choose<00:01:29.610> were<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.939> go<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.479> was

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
when they choose were to go and I was

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.530 
when they choose were to go and I was
like<00:01:30.750> oh<00:01:30.930> no<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:32.009> have<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.850> choose<00:01:33.060> what<00:01:33.299> color

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
like oh no I have to choose what color

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.260 
like oh no I have to choose what color
shirt<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.170> wear<00:01:34.290> terrible<00:01:35.040> but<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.820> was<00:01:35.939> more

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
shirt to wear terrible but it was more

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.999 
shirt to wear terrible but it was more
than<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.720> think<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.380> they<00:01:37.710> could<00:01:37.770> have

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
than that I think that they could have

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.950 
than that I think that they could have
done<00:01:38.159> better<00:01:38.220> with<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.970> commercials<00:01:39.570> for<00:01:39.780> it

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
done better with the commercials for it

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.310 
done better with the commercials for it
so<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:41.369> thought<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.030> movie<00:01:42.299> was<00:01:42.329> really<00:01:42.750> good

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
so I thought the movie was really good

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.789 
so I thought the movie was really good
and<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.829> liked<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.399> lot<00:01:44.640> um<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.840> didn't<00:01:46.470> like<00:01:46.649> it

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
and I liked it a lot um I didn't like it

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.880 
and I liked it a lot um I didn't like it
was<00:01:46.920> kind<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.220> violent<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.180> if<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:49.380> had<00:01:49.619> little

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
was kind of violent so if I had little

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.280 
was kind of violent so if I had little
kids<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.340> probably<00:01:50.610> wouldn't<00:01:51.180> let<00:01:51.960> them<00:01:52.140> watch

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
kids I probably wouldn't let them watch

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.080 
kids I probably wouldn't let them watch
the<00:01:52.470> first<00:01:52.680> part<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.369> maybe<00:01:53.640> the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
the first part of it like maybe the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.840 
the first part of it like maybe the
second<00:01:54.600> part<00:01:54.780> or<00:01:54.960> something<00:01:55.259> like<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.820> yes

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
second part or something like that yes

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.810 
second part or something like that yes
so<00:01:57.240> pretty<00:01:58.110> much<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.649> also<00:01:59.130> saw<00:01:59.460> Captain

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
gonna go to and stuff like that but um I

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.330 
gonna go to and stuff like that but um I
think<00:03:10.750> that<00:03:11.290> I<00:03:11.680> was<00:03:11.830> just<00:03:12.010> thinking<00:03:12.310> about

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
think that I was just thinking about

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.270 
think that I was just thinking about
this<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.760> other<00:03:12.790> day<00:03:12.940> and<00:03:13.780> I<00:03:13.870> think<00:03:14.140> that<00:03:14.500> no

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
this the other day and I think that no

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.170 
this the other day and I think that no
matter<00:03:15.490> what<00:03:15.730> you're<00:03:15.850> good<00:03:16.030> at

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
matter what you're good at

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.550 
matter what you're good at
I<00:03:16.420> think<00:03:16.630> you<00:03:16.720> should<00:03:16.840> do<00:03:16.959> what<00:03:17.050> you<00:03:17.140> like<00:03:17.380> to

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
I think you should do what you like to

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.110 
I think you should do what you like to
do<00:03:17.680> instead<00:03:17.980> of<00:03:18.190> what<00:03:18.400> you're<00:03:18.550> good<00:03:18.700> at<00:03:18.730> so

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
do instead of what you're good at so

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.460 
do instead of what you're good at so
even<00:03:19.390> if<00:03:19.510> you're<00:03:19.630> not<00:03:19.720> good<00:03:19.930> at<00:03:19.959> what<00:03:20.200> you<00:03:20.320> like

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
even if you're not good at what you like

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.890 
even if you're not good at what you like
you<00:03:20.709> still<00:03:21.100> do<00:03:21.250> it<00:03:21.280> because<00:03:22.269> then<00:03:22.540> you'll

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
you still do it because then you'll

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.420 
you still do it because then you'll
stick<00:03:23.230> with<00:03:23.260> it<00:03:23.560> longer<00:03:23.769> and<00:03:23.950> it<00:03:24.220> will<00:03:24.310> be
