which seems to affect both channels on

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:00.529 
which seems to affect both channels on
this<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.099> with<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.280> presence<00:01:59.670> down<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.239> can

this but with the presence down I can

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.330 
this but with the presence down I can
get<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> smoother<00:02:01.140> distortion<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:01.920> not<00:02:02.069> quite

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.120 
that sustained they think I'm using an
effect<00:02:25.330> like<00:02:25.540> you<00:02:25.780> know<00:02:25.960> a<00:02:25.990> compressor<00:02:26.590> or<00:02:26.770> or

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
effect like you know a compressor or or

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.070 
effect like you know a compressor or or
something<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.760> get<00:02:27.910> that<00:02:28.090> sustain<00:02:28.540> well<00:02:28.840> and

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
something to get that sustain well and

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.720 
something to get that sustain well and
low<00:02:29.620> volumes<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.400> when<00:02:30.610> I<00:02:30.640> use<00:02:30.820> a<00:02:31.200> solid-state

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
low volumes and when I use a solid-state

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.620 
low volumes and when I use a solid-state
preamp<00:02:33.730> or<00:02:33.940> I'm<00:02:34.030> going<00:02:34.270> straight<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.600> the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
preamp or I'm going straight to the

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.120 
preamp or I'm going straight to the
board<00:02:34.870> I<00:02:34.960> will<00:02:35.020> use<00:02:35.260> a<00:02:35.290> compressor<00:02:35.860> but<00:02:36.040> when

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
board I will use a compressor but when

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.830 
board I will use a compressor but when
I'm<00:02:36.250> going<00:02:36.490> into<00:02:36.610> my<00:02:36.700> tube<00:02:36.970> amp<00:02:37.210> there<00:02:37.690> is

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
I'm going into my tube amp there is

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.020 
I'm going into my tube amp there is
nothing<00:02:38.200> between<00:02:38.350> this<00:02:38.710> guitar<00:02:39.070> and<00:02:39.370> the

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
nothing between this guitar and the

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.700 
nothing between this guitar and the
amplifier<00:02:40.270> I<00:02:40.540> go<00:02:40.870> straight<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.500> amp

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
amplifier I go straight to the amp

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.740 
amplifier I go straight to the amp
that's<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.520> same<00:02:42.760> chord<00:02:43.120> it<00:02:43.360> just<00:02:43.570> goes

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
that's the same chord it just goes

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.900 
that's the same chord it just goes
straight<00:02:44.650> from<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:44.980> guitar<00:02:45.280> of<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.490> amp<00:02:45.670> and

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
straight from the guitar of the amp and

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.880 
straight from the guitar of the amp and
then<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.540> preamp<00:02:46.870> is<00:02:47.110> going<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:47.500> this<00:02:47.620> volume

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
then the preamp is going to this volume

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.890 
then the preamp is going to this volume
pedal<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.790> volume<00:02:49.120> pedal<00:02:49.300> goes<00:02:49.480> back<00:02:49.690> to<00:02:49.840> the

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
pedal the volume pedal goes back to the

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.570 
pedal the volume pedal goes back to the
power<00:02:50.110> amp<00:02:50.380> in<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:50.890> only<00:02:51.040> effects<00:02:51.400> I've

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
power amp in and the only effects I've

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.280 
power amp in and the only effects I've
got<00:02:51.760> is<00:02:51.880> the<00:02:52.000> built-in<00:02:52.330> reverb<00:02:52.540> which<00:02:52.960> on<00:02:53.110> this

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
got is the built-in reverb which on this

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.310 
got is the built-in reverb which on this
am<00:02:53.910> real<00:02:54.910> nice<00:02:55.090> reverb<00:02:57.840> controls<00:02:58.840> on<00:02:59.050> the<00:02:59.140> amp

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
am real nice reverb controls on the amp

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.470 
am real nice reverb controls on the amp
and<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.709> overdrive<00:02:59.980> on<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.520> end<00:03:00.700> that's<00:03:01.240> all

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
and the overdrive on the end that's all

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.170 
and the overdrive on the end that's all
that's<00:03:01.900> all<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.380> effects<00:03:02.680> I<00:03:02.860> need<00:03:06.180> another

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
that's all the effects I need another

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.410 
that's all the effects I need another
trick<00:03:11.130> I'm<00:03:12.130> bending<00:03:12.490> one<00:03:12.700> note<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:13.060> match<00:03:13.209> the

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
trick I'm bending one note to match the

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.820 
trick I'm bending one note to match the
other<00:03:13.570> but<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:13.930> volume<00:03:14.650> pedal<00:03:16.590> makes<00:03:17.590> the

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
other but the volume pedal makes the

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.820 
other but the volume pedal makes the
pick<00:03:18.070> sound<00:03:18.370> disappear

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
pick sound disappear

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.380 
pick sound disappear
can<00:03:21.830> you<00:03:21.920> do<00:03:22.220> that<00:03:22.250> by<00:03:22.700> spinning<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.209> buying

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
can you do that by spinning the buying

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.660 
can you do that by spinning the buying

Paul easier and sounds more smooth to
use<00:03:31.580> the<00:03:31.849> volume<00:03:34.900> I<00:03:36.550> put<00:03:37.550> the<00:03:37.670> line<00:03:37.849> fellow

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
use the volume I put the line fellow

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.640 
use the volume I put the line fellow
here<00:03:38.420> like<00:03:38.720> I<00:03:38.840> said<00:03:39.050> before<00:03:39.200> years<00:03:39.530> of

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.490 

I<00:03:48.390> put<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:49.480> volume<00:03:49.690> pedal<00:03:49.960> before<00:03:50.140> the

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
I put the volume pedal before the

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.040 
I put the volume pedal before the
distortion<00:03:51.540> happened<00:03:52.540> those<00:03:52.660> take<00:03:52.900> the

distortion happened those take the

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.660 
distortion happened those take the
distortion<00:03:53.560> away<00:03:53.770> when<00:03:53.980> you<00:03:54.040> back<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.370> volume

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
distortion away when you back the volume

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.980 
distortion away when you back the volume
pedal<00:03:54.850> off<00:03:55.090> cause<00:03:55.300> you're<00:03:55.420> just<00:03:55.660> you're

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
pedal off cause you're just you're

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.960 
pedal off cause you're just you're

that's<00:04:03.220> how<00:04:03.370> I<00:04:03.400> get<00:04:03.640> that<00:04:03.790> sustained<00:04:04.270> that's

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
that's how I get that sustained that's

that's how I get that sustained that's
