00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
I was just thinking about this overnight

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.670 
I was just thinking about this overnight
like<00:00:14.150> to<00:00:15.150> practice<00:00:15.420> your<00:00:15.809> frame<00:00:16.139> traps<00:00:16.440> in

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
like to practice your frame traps in

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.320 
like to practice your frame traps in
this<00:00:16.800> game<00:00:17.039> because<00:00:17.400> sometimes<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:18.119> know<00:00:18.240> you

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
this game because sometimes you know you

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.870 
this game because sometimes you know you
got<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.570> frame<00:00:18.840> trap<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.439> then<00:00:19.560> like<00:00:19.890> oh<00:00:20.189> you

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
got a frame trap and then like oh you

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.330 
got a frame trap and then like oh you
know<00:00:21.270> sometimes<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.199> get<00:00:22.289> get<00:00:22.590> out<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:23.010> you

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
know sometimes you get get out of it you

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.370 
know sometimes you get get out of it you
know<00:00:23.910> if<00:00:24.000> you're<00:00:24.119> not<00:00:24.240> timing<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.630> right<00:00:24.810> then

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
know if you're not timing it right then

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.130 
know if you're not timing it right then
you're<00:00:25.500> gonna<00:00:25.680> get<00:00:25.859> out<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.869> you're<00:00:27.869> gonna<00:00:27.960> get

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
you're gonna get out of you're gonna get

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.209 
you're gonna get out of you're gonna get
hit<00:00:28.349> out<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.949> sorry<00:00:29.539> early<00:00:30.539> in<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.689> morning

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
hit out of it sorry early in the morning

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:35.209 
hit out of it sorry early in the morning
so<00:00:32.270> basically<00:00:33.270> how<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.570> do<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.290> with<00:00:34.980> any

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
so basically how you do this is with any

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.470 
so basically how you do this is with any
character<00:00:35.579> if<00:00:35.820> it's<00:00:36.000> gonna<00:00:36.120> be<00:00:36.239> with<00:00:36.300> any

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
character if it's gonna be with any

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.959 
character if it's gonna be with any
character<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:37.140> set<00:00:37.530> reversal<00:00:38.160> mode<00:00:38.309> with<00:00:38.820> the

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
character you set reversal mode with the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.330 
character you set reversal mode with the
flash<00:00:39.210> against<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.870> flash<00:00:40.110> or<00:00:40.440> Lex<00:00:40.950> Luthor

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
flash against the flash or Lex Luthor

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.470 
flash against the flash or Lex Luthor
corpse<00:00:41.850> charge<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.079> basically<00:00:43.320> have<00:00:44.480> a

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
corpse charge and you basically have a

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.950 
corpse charge and you basically have a
six<00:00:45.840> frame<00:00:46.079> move<00:00:47.090> try<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.149> interrupt<00:00:48.719> you

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
six frame move try to interrupt you

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.500 
six frame move try to interrupt you
before<00:00:49.379> between<00:00:50.039> your<00:00:50.280> frame<00:00:50.460> traps<00:00:50.730> okay

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
before between your frame traps okay

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.630 
before between your frame traps okay
this<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.410> best<00:00:52.620> way<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.890> practice<00:00:53.399> your

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
this is the best way to practice your

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.600 
this is the best way to practice your
frame<00:00:53.940> traps<00:00:54.210> if<00:00:55.110> you're<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.559> flash<00:00:55.739> back<00:00:56.309> to

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
frame traps if you're the flash back to

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.260 
frame traps if you're the flash back to
two<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.149> plus<00:00:58.079> three<00:00:58.980> unblocked<00:00:59.399> so

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
two is plus three unblocked so

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.260 
two is plus three unblocked so
technically<00:01:01.109> you're<00:01:01.469> standing<00:01:02.010> one<00:01:02.270> should

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
technically you're standing one should

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.140 
technically you're standing one should
beat<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.600> every<00:01:03.899> time<00:01:04.250> if<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.760> don't<00:01:05.909> practice

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
beat it every time if you don't practice

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.140 
beat it every time if you don't practice
it<00:01:06.570> even<00:01:07.350> scrubs<00:01:08.010> online<00:01:08.400> are<00:01:08.580> gonna<00:01:08.700> beat<00:01:08.909> you

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
it even scrubs online are gonna beat you

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.660 
it even scrubs online are gonna beat you
you<00:01:09.570> know<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.740> come<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.040> here<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.460> then

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
you know so you come in here and then

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.550 
you know so you come in here and then
you<00:01:11.850> try<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.119> practice<00:01:12.720> your<00:01:12.840> frame<00:01:13.020> truck

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.350 

see<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.590> need<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.250> need<00:01:17.280> some<00:01:17.610> practice<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.180> with

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
see I need I need some practice to with

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.230 
see I need I need some practice to with
my<00:01:18.540> frame<00:01:18.780> traps<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:22.500> goal<00:01:22.740> here<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.280> get

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
my frame traps the goal here is to get

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.870 
my frame traps the goal here is to get
it<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.630> where<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.049> know<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.439> timing<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:26.040> the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
it to where you know the timing of the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.490 
it to where you know the timing of the
blocks<00:01:27.090> done<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.570> they<00:01:27.930> don't<00:01:28.400> so

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
blocks done and they don't so

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.620 
blocks done and they don't so
theoretically<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.619> should<00:01:31.920> be<00:01:32.040> able<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.630> at

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
theoretically I should be able to at

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.800 
theoretically I should be able to at
least<00:01:33.720> trade<00:01:34.259> with<00:01:34.470> him<00:01:34.650> being<00:01:35.280> +3<00:01:35.729> there<00:01:36.720> you

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
least trade with him being +3 there you

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.600 
least trade with him being +3 there you
go<00:01:38.360> so<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:40.290> want<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.710> be<00:01:40.829> able<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.100> know<00:01:41.340> your

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
go so you want to be able to know your

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.609 
go so you want to be able to know your
blocks<00:01:41.880> done<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.960> great<00:01:43.380> way<00:01:43.590> to

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
blocks done and this is a great way to

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.240 
blocks done and this is a great way to
test<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.520> right<00:01:44.909> here<00:01:45.259> you<00:01:46.259> can<00:01:46.290> people<00:01:47.070> can

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
test it so right here you can people can

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.460 
test it so right here you can people can
poke<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.670> out<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.030> online<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:49.200> if<00:01:49.320> you

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
poke you out of this online and if you

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.530 
poke you out of this online and if you
if<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.860> sit<00:01:50.009> here<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.610> try<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.240> against<00:01:51.479> a

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
if you sit here and you try it against a

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.770 
if you sit here and you try it against a
computer<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.649> know<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.950> blocks<00:01:53.189> done

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
computer and you know the blocks done

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.510 
computer and you know the blocks done
you<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:54.960> get<00:01:55.110> them<00:01:55.320> every<00:01:55.799> time<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.340> just

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
you can get them every time you just

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.130 
you can get them every time you just
need<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.880> know<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.479> timing<00:01:57.840> it's<00:01:57.960> kind<00:01:58.110> of

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
need to know the timing it's kind of

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.539 
need to know the timing it's kind of
like<00:01:58.259> Street<00:01:58.530> Fighter<00:01:58.680> knowing<00:01:59.100> your<00:01:59.219> links

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
like Street Fighter knowing your links

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.580 
like Street Fighter knowing your links
you<00:02:00.329> know<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.450> mean<00:02:00.689> knowing<00:02:01.110> your<00:02:01.290> timing

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
you know I mean knowing your timing

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.959 
you know I mean knowing your timing
every<00:02:01.829> link<00:02:02.040> since<00:02:02.219> all<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.520> stuff<00:02:02.729> so

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
every link since all that stuff so

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.419 
every link since all that stuff so
it's<00:02:04.600> just<00:02:04.749> a<00:02:04.810> really<00:02:05.020> good<00:02:05.109> way<00:02:05.259> to<00:02:05.320> test<00:02:05.799> out

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
it's just a really good way to test out

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.419 
it's just a really good way to test out
different<00:02:07.050> your<00:02:08.050> frame<00:02:08.289> traps<00:02:08.590> something

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
different your frame traps something

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:18.000 
different your frame traps something
like<00:02:13.950> okay<00:02:14.950> that<00:02:15.450> is<00:02:16.450> plus<00:02:16.780> ten<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:17.650> I<00:02:17.680> just

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
like okay that is plus ten so I just

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.300 
like okay that is plus ten so I just
beat<00:02:18.190> them<00:02:18.340> out<00:02:18.430> with<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:19.030> normal<00:02:19.810> job<00:02:20.590> but<00:02:21.040> what

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
beat them out with a normal job but what

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.949 
beat them out with a normal job but what
you<00:02:21.430> really<00:02:21.640> want<00:02:21.879> to<00:02:22.060> focus<00:02:22.420> on<00:02:22.720> with<00:02:22.840> the

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
you really want to focus on with the

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.229 
you really want to focus on with the
flat<00:02:23.170> at<00:02:23.319> least<00:02:23.500> with<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.709> flash<00:02:23.920> is<00:02:24.310> linking

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
flat at least with the flash is linking

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.990 
flat at least with the flash is linking
this<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.690> then<00:02:25.780> into<00:02:26.080> your<00:02:26.170> back<00:02:26.349> to<00:02:27.000> when

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
this and then into your back to when

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.520 
this and then into your back to when
I'll<00:02:28.120> sensing<00:02:28.510> this<00:02:28.629> I<00:02:28.870> almost<00:02:29.019> got<00:02:29.230> it<00:02:29.349> every

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
I'll sensing this I almost got it every

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.610 
I'll sensing this I almost got it every
time<00:02:29.709> but<00:02:29.980> you<00:02:30.670> get<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.360> gist<00:02:31.599> of<00:02:31.840> this<00:02:32.080> is<00:02:32.379> to

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
time but you get the gist of this is to

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.160 
time but you get the gist of this is to
basically<00:02:33.239> practice<00:02:34.239> your<00:02:34.450> block<00:02:34.690> strings

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
basically practice your block strings

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.080 
basically practice your block strings
and<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.739> your<00:02:35.860> blocks<00:02:36.099> done<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:36.579> know<00:02:36.760> when

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
and and your blocks done and know when

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.690 
and and your blocks done and know when
your<00:02:37.660> move<00:02:38.110> recovers<00:02:38.680> so<00:02:39.040> that<00:02:39.190> you<00:02:39.340> can<00:02:39.489> get

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
your move recovers so that you can get

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.940 
your move recovers so that you can get
just<00:02:39.910> frame<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:41.590> know<00:02:41.709> like<00:02:43.530> like<00:02:44.530> that<00:02:44.739> is

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
just frame you know like like that is

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.460 
just frame you know like like that is
supposed<00:02:45.610> to<00:02:45.640> be<00:02:45.700> guaranteed<00:02:49.049> add<00:02:50.049> on<00:02:50.260> one

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
supposed to be guaranteed add on one

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.539 
supposed to be guaranteed add on one
after<00:02:50.620> that<00:02:50.920> it's<00:02:51.040> pretty<00:02:51.099> much<00:02:51.310> guaranteed

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
after that it's pretty much guaranteed

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.490 
after that it's pretty much guaranteed
if<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.180> know<00:02:52.360> your<00:02:52.599> blocks<00:02:52.810> done<00:02:53.079> like<00:02:53.290> that

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
if you know your blocks done like that

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.160 
if you know your blocks done like that
so<00:02:54.510> it's<00:02:55.510> just<00:02:55.599> a<00:02:55.720> really<00:02:55.870> good<00:02:55.989> way<00:02:56.140> to

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
so it's just a really good way to

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.839 
so it's just a really good way to
practice<00:02:56.410> your<00:02:56.859> frame<00:02:57.129> traps<00:02:57.370> this<00:02:57.489> doesn't

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
practice your frame traps this doesn't

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.580 
practice your frame traps this doesn't
go<00:02:57.940> only<00:02:58.209> for<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.540> flash<00:02:58.750> every<00:02:59.170> character

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
go only for the flash every character

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.740 
go only for the flash every character
that<00:02:59.620> has<00:02:59.950> advantage<00:03:00.549> on<00:03:00.700> block<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:01.209> you

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
that has advantage on block and you

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.539 
that has advantage on block and you
think<00:03:01.989> you<00:03:02.140> have<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.290> frame<00:03:02.590> trap<00:03:02.799> going<00:03:03.160> you

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
think you have a frame trap going you

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:04.710 
think you have a frame trap going you
definitely<00:03:03.970> want<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.150> do<00:03:04.269> this<00:03:04.390> do<00:03:04.540> you<00:03:04.599> want

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
definitely want to do this do you want

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.599 
definitely want to do this do you want
to<00:03:04.810> play<00:03:04.959> against<00:03:05.349> the<00:03:05.440> flash<00:03:05.680> put<00:03:06.370> them<00:03:06.459> on

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
to play against the flash put them on

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.199 
to play against the flash put them on
reversal<00:03:07.090> mode<00:03:07.269> on<00:03:07.480> flying<00:03:08.019> uppercut<00:03:08.560> or<00:03:09.209> Lex

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
reversal mode on flying uppercut or Lex

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.930 
reversal mode on flying uppercut or Lex
Luthor<00:03:10.599> corpse<00:03:11.470> charge<00:03:11.769> and<00:03:12.099> practice<00:03:12.849> your

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
Luthor corpse charge and practice your

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.379 
Luthor corpse charge and practice your
frame<00:03:13.150> traps<00:03:14.190> anyways<00:03:15.190> I<00:03:15.430> gotta<00:03:15.609> get<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.760> class

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
frame traps anyways I gotta get to class

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.349 
frame traps anyways I gotta get to class
so<00:03:16.660> peace<00:03:17.109> guys
