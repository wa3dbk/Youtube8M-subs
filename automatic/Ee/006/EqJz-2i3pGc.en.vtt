think the most horrible thing I know
it's<00:01:22.890> much<00:01:23.340> more<00:01:23.520> exciting<00:01:24.060> didn't<00:01:24.330> have<00:01:24.479> no

head<00:01:24.840> gear<00:01:25.049> but<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.259> think<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.530> most<00:01:25.650> horrible

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
head gear but I think the most horrible

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.280 
head gear but I think the most horrible
thing<00:01:26.130> about<00:01:27.119> being<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.420> boxer<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.140> is

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
thing about being a boxer is this is

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.020 
thing about being a boxer is this is
what<00:01:28.409> happened<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:28.650> Muhammad<00:01:28.979> Ali<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.880> know<00:01:29.909> I

what happened in Muhammad Ali you know I

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.420 
what happened in Muhammad Ali you know I
mean<00:01:30.270> it's<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.320> lot<00:01:31.500> more<00:01:31.560> exciting<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.250> see

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
mean it's a lot more exciting to see

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.719 
mean it's a lot more exciting to see
real<00:01:32.610> boxing<00:01:33.740> without<00:01:34.740> headgear<00:01:35.189> but<00:01:35.369> i<00:01:35.400> think

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
real boxing without headgear but i think

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.969 
real boxing without headgear but i think

now<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.729> might<00:01:38.970> kind<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.360> end<00:01:39.780> up<00:01:41.090> people<00:01:42.090> might

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
now it might kind of end up people might

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.090 
now it might kind of end up people might
decide<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.960> know<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.439> injuries<00:01:43.890> are

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.350 
too too problematic but I oh but having
said<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.890> think<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.280> boxing<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.299> the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
said that I think that boxing is the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.749 
said that I think that boxing is the
purest<00:01:51.750> sport<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.350> it's<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.590> most

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
purest sport you it's the most

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.620 
purest sport you it's the most
emotionally<00:01:53.759> engaging<00:01:54.030> sport<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.600> watch

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
emotionally engaging sport to watch

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.929 
emotionally engaging sport to watch
because<00:01:55.409> it's<00:01:55.740> there's<00:01:56.310> nothing<00:01:56.520> there<00:01:56.850> not

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
because it's there's nothing there not

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.850 
because it's there's nothing there not
fancy<00:01:57.420> rules<00:01:57.630> there's<00:01:57.869> just<00:01:58.110> competition

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
fancy rules there's just competition

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.350 
fancy rules there's just competition
between<00:01:58.979> two<00:01:59.280> people<00:01:59.549> who<00:01:59.579> really<00:01:59.909> really

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
between two people who really really

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.209 
between two people who really really
really<00:02:00.750> want<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.170> wear<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.860> it's<00:02:02.009> not<00:02:02.159> like

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
really want to wear and it's not like

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.459 
really want to wear and it's not like
other<00:02:03.180> sports<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.600> have<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> game<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.380> know

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
other sports you have a game you know

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.690 
other sports you have a game you know
what's<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.710> week<00:02:04.860> or<00:02:05.070> twice<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.250> week<00:02:05.549> or<00:02:05.670> three

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
what's a week or twice a week or three

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.180 
what's a week or twice a week or three
times<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:06.090> week<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.509> have<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.840> match<00:02:07.530> once<00:02:07.890> every

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
times a week you have a match once every

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.130 
times a week you have a match once every
you<00:02:08.399> know<00:02:08.429> separated<00:02:09.420> by<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.509> long<00:02:09.690> time<00:02:09.869> you

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
you know separated by a long time you

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.550 
you know separated by a long time you
know

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
know

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.420 
know
because<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.670> last<00:02:11.880> time<00:02:12.800> such<00:02:13.800> kind<00:02:14.069> of<00:02:14.130> sport

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
because the last time such kind of sport

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.460 
because the last time such kind of sport
like<00:02:14.610> k1<00:02:14.819> I<00:02:15.300> mean<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.569> can<00:02:15.750> see<00:02:15.930> why<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.140> would<00:02:16.349> be

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
like k1 I mean I can see why it would be

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.940 
like k1 I mean I can see why it would be
because<00:02:16.620> that's<00:02:17.250> an<00:02:17.400> even<00:02:17.550> purer<00:02:17.910> form<00:02:18.270> of

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
because that's an even purer form of

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.089 
because that's an even purer form of
fighting<00:02:19.950> but<00:02:20.870> but<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:21.930> was<00:02:22.380> just<00:02:22.560> comparing<00:02:22.980> it

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
fighting but but I was just comparing it

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.930 
fighting but but I was just comparing it
to<00:02:23.130> say<00:02:23.340> tennis<00:02:23.730> or<00:02:24.739> ski<00:02:25.739> jumping<00:02:26.040> it's<00:02:26.670> know

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
to say tennis or ski jumping it's know

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.330 
to say tennis or ski jumping it's know
it<00:02:27.150> sports<00:02:27.750> like<00:02:27.930> that<00:02:28.080> this<00:02:28.319> one<00:02:28.800> man<00:02:29.040> against

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
it sports like that this one man against

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.610 
it sports like that this one man against
one<00:02:29.519> man<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:29.760> mean<00:02:29.970> that's<00:02:30.200> you<00:02:31.200> can't<00:02:31.410> have<00:02:31.590> a

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
one man I mean that's you can't have a

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.540 
one man I mean that's you can't have a
more<00:02:33.709> no<00:02:35.239> I<00:02:36.239> I<00:02:36.840> don't<00:02:37.319> I<00:02:37.530> can't<00:02:38.069> I<00:02:38.220> can't<00:02:38.250> I

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
more no I I don't I can't I can't I

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.630 
more no I I don't I can't I can't I
don't<00:02:38.580> know<00:02:38.790> I'm<00:02:39.090> sorry<00:02:39.800> maybe<00:02:40.800> no<00:02:40.980> III<00:02:41.430> in

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
don't know I'm sorry maybe no III in

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.770 
don't know I'm sorry maybe no III in
history<00:02:42.150> Jack<00:02:42.840> Dempsey<00:02:46.400> uh<00:02:47.569> who<00:02:48.569> will<00:02:48.690> win

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
history Jack Dempsey uh who will win

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.430 
history Jack Dempsey uh who will win
tomorrow<00:02:49.140> yeah<00:02:49.380> well<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.250> think<00:02:50.819> um<00:02:51.290> here<00:02:52.290> I

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
tomorrow yeah well I think um here I

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.650 
tomorrow yeah well I think um here I
think<00:02:52.739> curious<00:02:53.340> is<00:02:53.549> tall<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.180> he's<00:02:54.360> bigger

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
think curious is tall and he's bigger

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.740 
think curious is tall and he's bigger
but<00:02:55.260> he's<00:02:55.380> more<00:02:55.920> awkward<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.670> I<00:02:57.060> think<00:02:57.360> need

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
but he's more awkward and I think need

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.420 
but he's more awkward and I think need
to<00:02:57.780> be<00:02:57.870> honest<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.410> think<00:02:58.470> if<00:03:00.860> one<00:03:01.860> of<00:03:01.980> them<00:03:02.099> has

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
to be honest I think if one of them has

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.430 
to be honest I think if one of them has
the<00:03:02.760> history<00:03:02.910> of<00:03:03.150> biting<00:03:03.420> someone<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:04.230> means

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
the history of biting someone that means

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.080 
the history of biting someone that means
he<00:03:04.590> really<00:03:05.069> really<00:03:05.340> wants<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.819> win<00:03:05.910> and

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
he really really wants to win and

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.190 
he really really wants to win and
there's<00:03:06.209> something<00:03:06.330> about<00:03:06.480> passion<00:03:07.019> really

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
there's something about passion really

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.870 
there's something about passion really
wanting<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.620> win<00:03:07.830> and<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.340> think<00:03:08.610> he's<00:03:08.700> just

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
wanting to win and I think he's just

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.490 
wanting to win and I think he's just
kind<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.120> is<00:03:09.299> he's<00:03:09.510> more<00:03:09.930> I<00:03:10.170> don't<00:03:10.410> know<00:03:10.470> I

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
kind of is he's more I don't know I

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.170 
kind of is he's more I don't know I
think<00:03:10.709> being<00:03:10.950> compact<00:03:11.370> is<00:03:11.549> more<00:03:11.730> useful<00:03:11.880> and

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
think being compact is more useful and

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.970 
think being compact is more useful and
hard<00:03:12.390> is<00:03:12.630> used<00:03:12.840> more<00:03:13.230> useful<00:03:13.560> than<00:03:13.590> having<00:03:13.920> a

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
hard is used more useful than having a

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.380 
hard is used more useful than having a
long<00:03:14.099> arm<00:03:14.310> so<00:03:14.790> I'm<00:03:14.970> um<00:03:15.380> yeah
