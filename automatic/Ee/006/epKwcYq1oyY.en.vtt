what's going on guys it's iron player

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.610 
what's going on guys it's iron player
here<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:09.599> so<00:00:09.960> I'll<00:00:10.110> show<00:00:10.260> you<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.410> how<00:00:10.590> to

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
here and so I'll show you is how to

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.580 
here and so I'll show you is how to
increase<00:00:11.130> your<00:00:11.250> flying<00:00:11.790> stat<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.540> this<00:00:13.440> is

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
increase your flying stat and this is

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.959 
increase your flying stat and this is
going<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.830> be<00:00:13.950> through<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.309> use<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.490> flying

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
going to be through the use of flying

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.330 
going to be through the use of flying
school<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:16.470> if<00:00:16.529> you<00:00:16.650> look<00:00:16.800> at<00:00:16.890> my<00:00:16.980> stats

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
school and so if you look at my stats

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.010 
school and so if you look at my stats
just<00:00:17.640> then<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:18.000> can<00:00:18.150> see<00:00:18.359> that<00:00:18.480> they<00:00:18.660> are<00:00:18.690> I

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
just then you can see that they are I

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.380 
just then you can see that they are I
think<00:00:19.230> around<00:00:19.500> 40%<00:00:19.980> or<00:00:20.490> they're<00:00:20.730> one<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.210> those

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
think around 40% or they're one of those

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.090 
think around 40% or they're one of those
you<00:00:21.660> can<00:00:21.840> get<00:00:22.050> because<00:00:22.320> I'm<00:00:22.410> using<00:00:22.590> Michael

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
you can get because I'm using Michael

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.800 
you can get because I'm using Michael
who's<00:00:23.460> not<00:00:23.699> good<00:00:23.880> flying<00:00:24.150> if<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.420> look<00:00:24.630> right

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
who's not good flying if you look right

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.990 
who's not good flying if you look right
now<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:24.990> can<00:00:25.199> see<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> lot<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.800> turbulence<00:00:26.130> now

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
now you can see a lot of turbulence now

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.240 
now you can see a lot of turbulence now
that<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.599> kind<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.109> downfall<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.800> having<00:00:29.130> a

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
that is the kind of downfall of having a

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.070 
that is the kind of downfall of having a
low<00:00:29.429> flying<00:00:29.730> skill<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.510> why<00:00:30.750> we<00:00:30.929> want

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
low flying skill and that is why we want

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.080 
low flying skill and that is why we want
to<00:00:31.199> improve<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.830> because<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.520> more<00:00:32.790> flying

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
to improve it because the more flying

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.720 
to improve it because the more flying
stat<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.750> have<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.590> steadier<00:00:35.280> your<00:00:35.460> plane

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
stat you have the steadier your plane

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.100 
stat you have the steadier your plane
will<00:00:35.880> be<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.420> easier<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.840> will<00:00:36.899> be<00:00:37.079> to

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
will be and the easier it will be to

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.560 
will be and the easier it will be to
land<00:00:37.920> planes<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.550> take<00:00:38.730> off<00:00:38.969> planes<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.480> all

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
land planes and take off planes and all

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.540 
land planes and take off planes and all
kind<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.809> things<00:00:40.020> like<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:41.010> what<00:00:41.430> we're

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
kind of things like that so what we're

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.040 
kind of things like that so what we're
going<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.700> be<00:00:41.820> doing<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.270> there<00:00:42.540> flight<00:00:42.780> school

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
going to be doing is there flight school

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.750 
going to be doing is there flight school
this<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.260> easily<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.710> best<00:00:43.920> way<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.190> improve

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
this is easily the best way to improve

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.510 
this is easily the best way to improve
it<00:00:44.969> because<00:00:45.690> there<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.140> can<00:00:46.170> get<00:00:46.559> about<00:00:47.190> three

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
it because there you can get about three

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.520 
it because there you can get about three
percent<00:00:47.730> increase<00:00:48.239> or<00:00:48.780> five<00:00:49.110> percent

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
percent increase or five percent

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.470 
percent increase or five percent
increase<00:00:49.890> for<00:00:50.100> each<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.520> gold<00:00:50.910> medal<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.270> you

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
increase for each a gold medal that you

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.510 
increase for each a gold medal that you
get<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.079> gold<00:00:52.320> medals<00:00:52.559> are<00:00:52.680> really<00:00:53.039> really

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
get and gold medals are really really

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.310 
get and gold medals are really really
easy<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:54.059> do<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.539> they're<00:00:55.050> some<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
easy to do and they're some of the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.510 
easy to do and they're some of the
challenges<00:00:55.680> like<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.070> they're<00:00:56.250> kind<00:00:56.430> of

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
challenges like this they're kind of

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.340 
challenges like this they're kind of
advanced<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.030> get<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.180> little<00:00:57.420> bit<00:00:57.539> tricky<00:00:57.960> but

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
advanced and get a little bit tricky but

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.979 
advanced and get a little bit tricky but
you<00:00:58.440> only<00:00:58.680> need<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.280> do<00:00:59.460> about<00:00:59.730> five<00:01:00.239> or<00:01:00.539> six<00:01:00.780> of

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
you only need to do about five or six of

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.270 
you only need to do about five or six of
these<00:01:01.050> challenges<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.710> max<00:01:01.980> out<00:01:02.250> your

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
these challenges to max out your

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.880 
these challenges to max out your
character<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.329> but<00:01:04.140> otherwise<00:01:04.470> if<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.769> don't

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
character and but otherwise if you don't

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.250 
character and but otherwise if you don't
do<00:01:05.100> flight<00:01:05.339> school<00:01:05.670> then<00:01:06.090> every<00:01:06.540> 10<00:01:06.900> minutes

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
do flight school then every 10 minutes

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.399 
do flight school then every 10 minutes
of<00:01:07.560> flying<00:01:07.950> increases<00:01:08.760> your<00:01:08.909> step<00:01:09.210> by<00:01:09.360> 1%<00:01:10.200> so

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
of flying increases your step by 1% so

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.109 
of flying increases your step by 1% so
that<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.740> really<00:01:11.100> really<00:01:11.549> going<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.909> take<00:01:12.090> a

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
that is really really going to take a

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.480 
that is really really going to take a
seriously<00:01:12.840> long<00:01:13.170> time<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.650> flying<00:01:13.950> to

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
seriously long time of flying to

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.070 
seriously long time of flying to
increase<00:01:14.850> your<00:01:15.000> flying<00:01:15.270> stats<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:15.900> is

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
increase your flying stats so this is

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.320 
increase your flying stats so this is
easily<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.710> best<00:01:16.950> way<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.189> do<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.729> this

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
easily the best way to do it and this

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.969 
easily the best way to do it and this
will<00:01:18.479> protect<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:19.020> honestly<00:01:19.409> about<00:01:19.530> ten

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
will protect you honestly about ten

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.160 
will protect you honestly about ten
minutes<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.430> do<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.820> after<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.630> you'll<00:01:21.900> have

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
minutes to do and after that you'll have

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.080 
minutes to do and after that you'll have
there<00:01:22.439> you'll<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> hundred<00:01:23.100> maxed<00:01:23.970> out

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
there you'll have a hundred maxed out

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.090 
there you'll have a hundred maxed out
flying<00:01:24.390> skill<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:24.900> absolutely<00:01:25.500> no<00:01:25.560> time<00:01:25.890> this

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
flying skill in absolutely no time this

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.770 
flying skill in absolutely no time this
is<00:01:26.250> one<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.520> later<00:01:26.729> challenges<00:01:27.360> probably

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
is one of the later challenges probably

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.420 
is one of the later challenges probably
the<00:01:27.840> hardest<00:01:28.140> one<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.770> actually<00:01:28.920> get<00:01:29.130> 5%

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
the hardest one and you actually get 5%

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.039 
the hardest one and you actually get 5%

these<00:01:44.610> challenges<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.420> don't<00:01:45.479> even<00:01:45.720> need

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
these challenges and I don't even need

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.240 
these challenges and I don't even need
to<00:01:45.930> do<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.259> rest<00:01:46.439> because<00:01:46.740> now<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:46.890> have<00:01:47.130> them

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
to do the rest because now I have them

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.649 
to do the rest because now I have them
maxed<00:01:47.640> out<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.090> if<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.360> look<00:01:48.479> at<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
maxed out and if you look at the

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.359 
maxed out and if you look at the
turbulence<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.380> my<00:01:49.530> helicopter<00:01:50.009> right<00:01:50.220> now

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
turbulence on my helicopter right now

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.520 
turbulence on my helicopter right now
I'm<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.700> cockpit<00:01:50.880> view<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.570> now<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.320> have

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
I'm in the cockpit view and now I have

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.010 
I'm in the cockpit view and now I have
maxed<00:01:52.860> out<00:01:53.009> as<00:01:53.220> flying<00:01:53.820> skill<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.600> turbulence

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
maxed out as flying skill the turbulence

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.810 
maxed out as flying skill the turbulence
is<00:01:55.170> nearly<00:01:55.560> gone<00:01:55.710> there<00:01:56.159> is<00:01:56.280> none<00:01:56.520> look<00:01:56.729> how

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
is nearly gone there is none look how

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.060 
is nearly gone there is none look how
steady<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.140> makes<00:01:58.320> aiming<00:01:58.829> with

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
steady it is and it makes aiming with

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.249 
steady it is and it makes aiming with
your<00:01:59.280> machine<00:01:59.790> gun<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.240> missiles<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:01.049> much

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
your machine gun and missiles so much

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.160 
your machine gun and missiles so much
easier<00:02:01.740> but<00:02:02.340> obviously<00:02:02.969> air<00:02:03.390> Trevor<00:02:03.869> will

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
easier but obviously air Trevor will

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.319 
easier but obviously air Trevor will
always<00:02:04.590> be<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.009> best<00:02:05.040> pilot<00:02:05.700> no<00:02:05.820> matter<00:02:06.000> who

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
always be the best pilot no matter who

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.529 
always be the best pilot no matter who
has<00:02:06.540> what<00:02:06.899> stats<00:02:07.259> they<00:02:08.160> travel<00:02:08.670> always<00:02:08.819> be<00:02:09.209> the

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
has what stats they travel always be the

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.540 
has what stats they travel always be the
best<00:02:09.690> pilot<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.229> if<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.379> max<00:02:10.619> out<00:02:10.800> Trevor<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.520> a

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
best pilot so if you max out Trevor to a

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.700 
best pilot so if you max out Trevor to a
hundred<00:02:12.239> flying<00:02:12.629> skill<00:02:13.020> then<00:02:13.410> he's

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
hundred flying skill then he's

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.250 
hundred flying skill then he's
to<00:02:13.830> be<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:13.950> very<00:02:14.310> very<00:02:14.640> good<00:02:14.940> pilot<00:02:15.450> he's<00:02:16.050> going

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
to be a very very good pilot he's going

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.530 
to be a very very good pilot he's going
to<00:02:16.320> have<00:02:16.470> little<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.010> no<00:02:17.040> turbulence<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:18.180> it's

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
to have little to no turbulence and it's

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.600 
to have little to no turbulence and it's
going<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.720> be<00:02:18.780> very<00:02:18.930> easy<00:02:19.050> for<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.710> to<00:02:19.740> takeoff

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
going to be very easy for you to takeoff

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.940 
going to be very easy for you to takeoff
and<00:02:20.930> touchdown<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.380> I<00:02:22.410> hope<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.650> draw<00:02:22.830> this

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
and touchdown so I hope you draw this

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.040
