now is

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:34.260 
now is
you<00:01:26.650> might<00:01:26.829> actually<00:01:32.490> see<00:01:33.490> a<00:01:33.520> tough<00:01:33.880> boy<00:01:34.030> goes

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
you might actually see a tough boy goes

back to this poor and if he can kill
this<00:01:36.310> for<00:01:36.610> thought<00:01:36.820> that's<00:01:36.850> a<00:01:37.240> pretty<00:01:37.509> big

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
this for thought that's a pretty big

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.420 
this for thought that's a pretty big
deal<00:01:37.899> because<00:01:38.080> he<00:01:38.290> has<00:01:38.409> his<00:01:38.619> at<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.100> same<00:01:39.280> time

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
deal because he has his at the same time
