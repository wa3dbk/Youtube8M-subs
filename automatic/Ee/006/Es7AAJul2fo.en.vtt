we get together and brainstorm

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.310

with<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.190> kind<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.640> gist<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.969> game<00:00:39.120> was<00:00:39.239> I

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
with the kind of gist of the game was I

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.970 
with the kind of gist of the game was I
think<00:00:39.570> very<00:00:39.660> early<00:00:40.140> on<00:00:40.170> we<00:00:40.379> decided<00:00:40.739> though<00:00:40.860> it

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
think very early on we decided though it

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.889 
think very early on we decided though it
was<00:00:41.070> clearly<00:00:41.340> about<00:00:41.520> aliens<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
was clearly about aliens and in the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.420 
was clearly about aliens and in the
original<00:00:42.989> story<00:00:43.350> was<00:00:43.530> all<00:00:43.620> about<00:00:43.739> time<00:00:43.980> travel

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
original story was all about time travel

original story was all about time travel

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
right has become a big space up look

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.850 
right has become a big space up look
like<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.300> science<00:00:48.300> fiction<00:00:48.450> Alden<00:00:49.289> outer<00:00:49.530> space

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
like a science fiction Alden outer space

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.189 
like a science fiction Alden outer space
space<00:00:50.100> opera<00:00:50.430> cathing<00:00:50.760> right<00:00:50.940> yeah<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.899> there

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
space opera cathing right yeah and there

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.510 
space opera cathing right yeah and there
was<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.379> other<00:00:52.500> game<00:00:52.739> called<00:00:53.010> halo<00:00:53.219> or

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
was this other game called halo or

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.389 
was this other game called halo or
something<00:00:54.500> seemed<00:00:55.500> kind<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.739> similar<00:00:56.010> that

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
something seemed kind of similar that

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.220 
something seemed kind of similar that
one<00:00:56.489> was<00:00:56.610> more<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.910> romantic<00:00:57.180> comedy<00:00:57.539> I

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
one was more of a romantic comedy I

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.110 
one was more of a romantic comedy I
think<00:00:58.500> we<00:00:58.590> had<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> distinction<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.820> one

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
think we had a distinction and that one

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.270 
think we had a distinction and that one
scene<00:01:00.359> from<00:01:00.570> starship<00:01:00.809> troopers<00:01:01.379> was<00:01:02.039> kind<00:01:02.250> of

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
scene from starship troopers was kind of

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.100 
scene from starship troopers was kind of
what<00:01:02.430> inspired<00:01:02.789> us<00:01:02.969> from<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.420> beginning<00:01:03.570> with

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
what inspired us from the beginning with

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.050 
what inspired us from the beginning with
that<00:01:04.470> one<00:01:04.619> scene<00:01:04.920> where<00:01:05.159> like<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.400> thousand

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
you could do that enough PSO that was no

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.100 
you could do that enough PSO that was no
that's<00:01:11.790> not<00:01:11.909> really<00:01:12.150> that's<00:01:12.420> not<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> world<00:01:12.810> or

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
that's not really that's not a world or

that's not really that's not a world or
a<00:01:13.170> hook<00:01:13.380> anything<00:01:13.979> but<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.189> was<00:01:14.400> kind<00:01:14.549> of

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
a hook anything but that was kind of

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.130 
a hook anything but that was kind of
like<00:01:14.700> our<00:01:14.850> idea<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.390> what<00:01:15.750> if<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:16.020> could

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
like our idea of what if we could

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.450 
like our idea of what if we could
somehow<00:01:16.290> kind<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.009> get<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.220> kind<00:01:17.430> of

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
somehow kind of get that kind of

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.030 
somehow kind of get that kind of
quantity<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:17.939> kind<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.830> that<00:01:19.830> kind<00:01:19.950> of

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
quantity I kind of that kind of

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.460 
quantity I kind of that kind of

so yeah time travel traveling going to
meteors<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.049> had<00:01:34.200> big<00:01:34.350> worm<00:01:34.560> holes<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:34.890> them

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
meteors that had big worm holes in them

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.700 
meteors that had big worm holes in them
it<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.850> didn't<00:01:36.150> give<00:01:36.600> players<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.290> hold<00:01:37.590> on

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
it it didn't give players a to hold on

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.590 
it it didn't give players a to hold on
to<00:01:37.920> yeah<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.490> can<00:01:38.939> only<00:01:39.090> connect<00:01:39.360> as<00:01:39.450> much

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
to yeah I can only connect as much

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.630 
to yeah I can only connect as much
exactly<00:01:39.960> what<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.829> guys<00:01:40.979> decided<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.369> do<00:01:41.520> with

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
exactly what you guys decided to do with

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.120 
exactly what you guys decided to do with
the<00:01:41.899> 1950s<00:01:42.899> instead<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.590> like<00:01:44.040> the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
the 1950s instead of the like the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.469 
the 1950s instead of the like the
alternate<00:01:44.460> history<00:01:44.759> instead<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.090> going<00:01:45.329> like

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
alternate history instead of going like

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.910 
alternate history instead of going like
contemporary<00:01:45.899> times<00:01:46.290> or<00:01:46.649> something<00:01:46.860> like

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
contemporary times or something like

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.200 
contemporary times or something like
that<00:01:47.009> well<00:01:47.340> started<00:01:47.579> out<00:01:47.640> as<00:01:47.729> world<00:01:47.909> on<00:01:48.030> one

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
that well started out as world on one

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.480 
that well started out as world on one
yeah<00:01:48.509> but<00:01:48.750> was<00:01:48.899> yeah<00:01:49.079> yeah<00:01:49.530> my<00:01:50.040> planes<00:01:50.340> my

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
yeah but was yeah yeah my planes my

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.080 
yeah but was yeah yeah my planes my
first<00:01:50.759> shit<00:01:50.880> up<00:01:51.799> and<00:01:52.799> then<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.700> think<00:01:53.970> we

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
first shit up and then I think we

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.340 
first shit up and then I think we
realized<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.810> was<00:01:54.899> gonna<00:01:54.990> be<00:01:55.110> much<00:01:55.229> it

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
realized that it was gonna be much it

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.539 
realized that it was gonna be much it
was<00:01:55.439> gonna<00:01:55.530> be<00:01:55.619> hard<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.799> sell<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.130> one<00:01:56.280> too

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
was gonna be hard to sell that one too

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.609 
was gonna be hard to sell that one too
because<00:01:56.939> world<00:01:57.570> war<00:01:57.719> one<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:58.110> kind<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.469> an

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
because world war one is kind of an

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.649 
because world war one is kind of an
out-there<00:01:59.000> concept<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.180> weapons<00:02:00.509> weren't

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
out-there concept in the weapons weren't

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.690 
out-there concept in the weapons weren't
as<00:02:00.810> cool<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.829> science<00:02:02.070> fiction<00:02:02.159> at<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.490> time

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
as cool the science fiction at the time

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.149 
as cool the science fiction at the time
there<00:02:03.509> wasn't<00:02:03.780> any<00:02:04.049> resistance<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.890> War<00:02:05.130> of

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
there wasn't any resistance in War of

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.190 
there wasn't any resistance in War of
the<00:02:05.250> Worlds<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.640> was<00:02:05.729> really<00:02:06.060> bye<00:02:06.450> bye<00:02:06.930> luck

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
the Worlds it was really bye bye luck

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.930 
the Worlds it was really bye bye luck
and<00:02:07.409> by<00:02:07.619> act<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.920> God<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.399> these<00:02:08.520> guys<00:02:08.670> won

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
whereas if you look at more the from

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.360 
whereas if you look at more the from
World<00:02:12.060> War

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
World War

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.059 
World War
you<00:02:12.430> on<00:02:12.610> people<00:02:13.480> got<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:14.019> mount<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.440> resistance

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
you on people got to mount a resistance

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.339 
you on people got to mount a resistance
right<00:02:15.310> guerrilla<00:02:15.940> war<00:02:16.180> Jared<00:02:16.599> time<00:02:16.989> back<00:02:17.200> yeah

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
right guerrilla war Jared time back yeah

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.350 
right guerrilla war Jared time back yeah
totally<00:02:17.739> as<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.310> idea<00:02:18.610> was<00:02:18.849> that<00:02:18.879> if<00:02:19.209> the

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
totally as the idea was that if the

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.570 
totally as the idea was that if the
Chimera<00:02:19.720> started<00:02:20.080> in<00:02:20.290> Russia<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:20.920> spread

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
Chimera started in Russia and spread

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.449 
Chimera started in Russia and spread
across<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.959> Asia<00:02:22.959> and<00:02:23.260> then<00:02:23.500> across<00:02:23.950> Europe

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
across the Asia and then across Europe

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.009 
across the Asia and then across Europe
Britain<00:02:24.970> would<00:02:25.269> be<00:02:25.390> probably<00:02:25.720> be<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:25.989> last

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
Britain would be probably be the last

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.960 
Britain would be probably be the last
place<00:02:26.500> that<00:02:26.650> they'd<00:02:27.010> hit<00:02:27.280> simply<00:02:27.640> because

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
place that they'd hit simply because

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.280 
place that they'd hit simply because
they'd<00:02:28.480> have<00:02:28.599> to<00:02:28.720> cross<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.079> English<00:02:29.140> Channel

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
they'd have to cross the English Channel

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.729 
they'd have to cross the English Channel
and<00:02:30.060> we<00:02:31.060> were<00:02:31.379> presupposing<00:02:32.379> that<00:02:32.409> the

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
and we were presupposing that the

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.089 
and we were presupposing that the
Chimera<00:02:33.159> weren't<00:02:33.340> very<00:02:33.459> good<00:02:33.549> with<00:02:33.760> water<00:02:34.000> and

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
Chimera weren't very good with water and

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.580 
Chimera weren't very good with water and
Britain<00:02:36.099> had<00:02:36.250> had<00:02:36.430> time<00:02:36.640> also<00:02:36.940> to<00:02:37.180> create<00:02:38.170> a

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
Britain had had time also to create a

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.890 
Britain had had time also to create a
great<00:02:39.010> defense<00:02:39.310> network<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:40.000> we're<00:02:40.690> probably

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
great defense network and we're probably

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.420 
great defense network and we're probably
going<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.319> be<00:02:41.440> more<00:02:41.590> likely<00:02:41.829> to<00:02:41.950> hold<00:02:42.069> out<00:02:42.280> than

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
going to be more likely to hold out than

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.660 
going to be more likely to hold out than
any<00:02:42.579> other<00:02:42.730> country<00:02:42.940> we<00:02:43.840> started<00:02:44.170> out<00:02:44.290> as<00:02:44.470> a

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
any other country we started out as a

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.449 
any other country we started out as a
lizard<00:02:45.670> ish<00:02:46.180> race<00:02:46.680> big<00:02:47.680> lizards<00:02:48.099> glad<00:02:48.310> you

lizard ish race big lizards glad you

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.400 
lizard ish race big lizards glad you
asked<00:02:48.609> for<00:02:48.910> a<00:02:48.940> while<00:02:49.150> I<00:02:49.390> don't<00:02:49.569> they<00:02:49.810> they<00:02:49.959> I

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
asked for a while I don't they they I

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.979 
asked for a while I don't they they I
can't<00:02:51.220> remember<00:02:51.519> the<00:02:52.000> tentacle<00:02:52.420> listen<00:02:52.780> I

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
can't remember the tentacle listen I

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.479 
can't remember the tentacle listen I
mean<00:02:53.530> some<00:02:53.680> other<00:02:53.769> some<00:02:53.980> of<00:02:54.069> the<00:02:54.129> early

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
mean some other some of the early

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.130 
mean some other some of the early
drawing<00:02:54.760> so<00:02:54.940> it<00:02:55.030> really<00:02:55.329> early<00:02:55.599> was<00:02:55.750> like<00:02:55.900> kind

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
drawing so it really early was like kind

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.050 
drawing so it really early was like kind
of<00:02:56.230> Geiger<00:02:56.680> inspired<00:02:57.099> the<00:02:57.430> idea<00:02:57.730> was<00:02:57.879> that<00:02:57.909> it

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
of Geiger inspired the idea was that it

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.849 
of Geiger inspired the idea was that it
was<00:02:58.150> very<00:02:58.359> lizard-like<00:02:58.720> but<00:02:59.379> now<00:02:59.500> we<00:02:59.560> had<00:02:59.769> this

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
was very lizard-like but now we had this

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.280 
was very lizard-like but now we had this
kind<00:03:00.040> of<00:03:00.159> skull<00:03:00.400> head<00:03:00.900> what<00:03:01.900> ended<00:03:02.200> up

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
kind of skull head what ended up

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.720 
kind of skull head what ended up
happening<00:03:02.349> was<00:03:02.739> that<00:03:02.829> it<00:03:02.980> looked<00:03:03.010> very<00:03:03.250> duck

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
happening was that it looked very duck

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.869 
happening was that it looked very duck
like<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.299> and<00:03:04.569> it<00:03:04.900> did<00:03:05.140> it<00:03:05.709> drove<00:03:06.220> me<00:03:06.250> nuts<00:03:06.430> and

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
like and and it did it drove me nuts and

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.569 
like and and it did it drove me nuts and
so<00:03:07.209> I<00:03:07.870> still<00:03:08.500> see<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:08.769> image<00:03:08.920> all<00:03:09.250> over<00:03:09.459> the

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
so I still see that image all over the

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
the ship learning about the background

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.900 
the ship learning about the background
on<00:04:08.109> the<00:04:08.199> way<00:04:08.349> and<00:04:08.680> then<00:04:08.949> ends<00:04:09.519> up<00:04:09.549> getting<00:04:09.669> into

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
on the way and then ends up getting into

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.839

a<00:04:09.970> VTOL<00:04:10.299> and<00:04:10.690> leaving<00:04:11.019> but<00:04:11.500> we<00:04:11.590> couldn't<00:04:11.919> get

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
a VTOL and leaving but we couldn't get

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.400 
a VTOL and leaving but we couldn't get
that<00:04:12.970> level<00:04:13.180> done<00:04:13.480> so<00:04:13.780> we<00:04:13.900> ended<00:04:14.079> up<00:04:14.199> just

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
that level done so we ended up just

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.710 
that level done so we ended up just
using<00:04:14.620> it<00:04:15.040> for<00:04:15.250> a<00:04:15.280> cinematic<00:04:15.849> being<00:04:16.419> a<00:04:16.449> major

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
problem of because that was all of our

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.360 
problem of because that was all of our
training<00:04:18.760> was<00:04:19.090> in<00:04:19.329> there<00:04:19.630> huh<00:04:20.289> a<00:04:20.500> true<00:04:20.859> yes<00:04:21.159> is

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
training was in there huh a true yes is

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.890 
training was in there huh a true yes is
right<00:04:21.549> and<00:04:22.030> it<00:04:22.240> was<00:04:22.330> like<00:04:22.510> it<00:04:22.599> was<00:04:22.719> big

of urbanchat was

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.830 
of urbanchat was
just<00:04:25.849> going<00:04:25.970> to<00:04:26.030> come<00:04:26.120> across<00:04:26.300> a<00:04:26.389> dialogue

just going to come across a dialogue

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.629 
just going to come across a dialogue
through<00:04:27.080> here<00:04:27.349> and<00:04:27.560> so<00:04:27.860> when<00:04:28.220> we<00:04:28.250> cut<00:04:28.460> that

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
through here and so when we cut that

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.040 
through here and so when we cut that
we've<00:04:28.819> lost<00:04:28.940> our<00:04:29.120> training<00:04:29.479> and<00:04:29.629> kind<00:04:29.870> of<00:04:29.930> our

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
we've lost our training and kind of our

we've lost our training and kind of our
introduction<00:04:30.710> to<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.340> character<00:04:31.699> we<00:04:32.270> had<00:04:32.389> to

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:32.509 
introduction to the character we had to

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:34.270 
introduction to the character we had to
find<00:04:32.960> other<00:04:33.050> solutions<00:04:33.289> to<00:04:33.710> all<00:04:33.740> of<00:04:33.919> it<00:04:34.069> I

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
find other solutions to all of it I

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.129 
find other solutions to all of it I
remember<00:04:34.789> thinking<00:04:34.909> I<00:04:35.419> don't<00:04:35.720> know<00:04:35.900> if<00:04:36.020> we're

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
remember thinking I don't know if we're

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:37.899 
remember thinking I don't know if we're
going<00:04:36.229> to<00:04:36.289> be<00:04:36.440> able<00:04:36.530> to<00:04:36.830> get<00:04:36.979> this<00:04:37.129> out<00:04:37.310> on<00:04:37.669> time

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:37.909 
going to be able to get this out on time

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:40.149 
going to be able to get this out on time
but<00:04:38.090> we<00:04:38.210> will<00:04:38.419> we<00:04:38.900> will<00:04:39.020> somehow<00:04:39.319> do<00:04:39.500> it<00:04:39.860> and<00:04:40.099> I

00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:40.159 
but we will we will somehow do it and I

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:41.770 
but we will we will somehow do it and I
think<00:04:40.220> everybody<00:04:40.699> kind<00:04:40.909> of<00:04:41.060> felt<00:04:41.270> that<00:04:41.419> way<00:04:41.569> we

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
think everybody kind of felt that way we

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.659 
think everybody kind of felt that way we
just<00:04:42.169> knew<00:04:42.319> that<00:04:42.349> we<00:04:42.650> needed<00:04:42.919> to<00:04:43.129> get<00:04:43.400> it<00:04:43.520> done

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
just knew that we needed to get it done

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:44.770 
just knew that we needed to get it done
because<00:04:43.970> it<00:04:44.150> was<00:04:44.240> such<00:04:44.360> a<00:04:44.389> great<00:04:44.509> opportunity

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
because it was such a great opportunity

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.230 
because it was such a great opportunity
I<00:04:45.199> think<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:45.830> the<00:04:46.129> last<00:04:46.280> six<00:04:47.030> to<00:04:47.120> eight<00:04:47.210> weeks

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
I think the the last six to eight weeks

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.420 
I think the the last six to eight weeks
or<00:04:47.629> so<00:04:47.750> in<00:04:47.900> particular<00:04:48.110> the<00:04:48.949> two<00:04:49.099> of<00:04:49.190> you<00:04:49.310> guys

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
or so in particular the two of you guys

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.100 
or so in particular the two of you guys
in<00:04:49.759> mark<00:04:49.970> Cerny<00:04:50.270> were<00:04:50.419> playing<00:04:50.720> the<00:04:50.840> games<00:04:51.020> a

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
in mark Cerny were playing the games a

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.260 
in mark Cerny were playing the games a
lot<00:04:51.139> and<00:04:51.620> we're<00:04:51.800> just<00:04:51.979> getting<00:04:52.190> like<00:04:52.400> a<00:04:52.550> lot<00:04:53.120> of

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
lot and we're just getting like a lot of

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.360 
lot and we're just getting like a lot of
feedback<00:04:53.419> of<00:04:53.900> you<00:04:54.110> know<00:04:54.259> we<00:04:54.889> went<00:04:55.069> through<00:04:55.190> all

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
feedback of you know we went through all

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.969 
feedback of you know we went through all
the<00:04:55.580> setups<00:04:55.940> yes<00:04:56.810> and<00:04:57.199> lists<00:04:57.440> of<00:04:57.530> things<00:04:57.590> and

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
the setups yes and lists of things and

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.170 
the setups yes and lists of things and
you<00:04:58.099> guess<00:04:58.370> it<00:04:58.520> would<00:04:58.639> amount<00:04:58.789> to<00:04:58.909> like<00:04:59.120> a

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
you guess it would amount to like a

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.460 
you guess it would amount to like a
completely<00:04:59.569> scripting<00:04:59.990> of<00:05:00.050> the<00:05:00.139> game<00:05:00.319> and

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
completely scripting of the game and

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:09.040 
completely scripting of the game and
like<00:05:00.590> two<00:05:00.740> months<00:05:07.599> that's<00:05:08.599> the<00:05:08.690> grappling

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
like two months that's the grappling

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.219 
like two months that's the grappling
hook<00:05:09.259> right<00:05:09.530> yeah<00:05:09.919> the<00:05:10.130> graph<00:05:10.340> ler<00:05:10.550> I<00:05:11.229> remember

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
hook right yeah the graph ler I remember

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:13.719 
hook right yeah the graph ler I remember
one<00:05:12.349> of<00:05:12.380> the<00:05:12.440> reasons<00:05:12.770> we<00:05:12.860> cut<00:05:13.069> it<00:05:13.190> two<00:05:13.400> reasons

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
one of the reasons we cut it two reasons

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:15.670 
one of the reasons we cut it two reasons
when<00:05:14.210> it<00:05:14.330> became<00:05:14.539> an<00:05:14.780> uber<00:05:14.960> weapon<00:05:15.229> so<00:05:15.440> that<00:05:15.590> if

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
when it became an uber weapon so that if

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.920 
when it became an uber weapon so that if
you<00:05:15.800> used<00:05:16.039> it<00:05:16.250> against<00:05:16.940> any<00:05:17.150> enemy<00:05:17.240> you<00:05:17.630> it

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
you used it against any enemy you it

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.990 
you used it against any enemy you it
would<00:05:18.020> be<00:05:18.050> an<00:05:18.229> auto<00:05:18.380> kill<00:05:18.740> and<00:05:19.069> since<00:05:19.789> it<00:05:19.880> had

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
would be an auto kill and since it had

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.790 
would be an auto kill and since it had
no<00:05:20.120> ammo<00:05:20.419> you<00:05:20.780> pretty<00:05:20.990> much<00:05:21.050> could<00:05:21.319> use<00:05:21.440> it<00:05:21.560> on

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
no ammo you pretty much could use it on

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.040 
no ammo you pretty much could use it on
everybody<00:05:22.190> and<00:05:22.400> the<00:05:23.210> second<00:05:23.539> one<00:05:23.659> was<00:05:23.690> we<00:05:23.960> were

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
everybody and the second one was we were

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.350 
everybody and the second one was we were
worried<00:05:24.349> about<00:05:24.409> people<00:05:24.800> dragging<00:05:25.360> physics

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
worried about people dragging physics

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.439 
worried about people dragging physics
objects<00:05:26.889> into<00:05:27.889> awkward<00:05:28.340> places<00:05:28.819> and<00:05:29.300> either

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
objects into awkward places and either

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:31.059 
objects into awkward places and either
getting<00:05:29.690> suspended<00:05:30.110> a<00:05:30.289> lot<00:05:30.349> of<00:05:30.590> lot<00:05:30.889> of

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:31.069 
getting suspended a lot of lot of

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:33.219 
getting suspended a lot of lot of
problems<00:05:31.669> yeah<00:05:32.210> I<00:05:32.479> think<00:05:32.810> if<00:05:32.900> we<00:05:33.050> had<00:05:33.080> like

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
problems yeah I think if we had like

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:34.659 
problems yeah I think if we had like
three<00:05:33.440> more<00:05:33.620> months<00:05:33.740> we<00:05:34.190> could<00:05:34.430> have<00:05:34.520> gotten

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
three more months we could have gotten

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.059 
three more months we could have gotten
it<00:05:34.819> in<00:05:34.940> but<00:05:35.240> I<00:05:35.270> mean<00:05:35.449> as<00:05:35.690> it<00:05:35.870> as<00:05:36.409> it<00:05:36.440> was<00:05:36.590> it<00:05:36.949> was

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:37.069 
it in but I mean as it as it was it was

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:38.649 
it in but I mean as it as it was it was
you<00:05:37.520> know<00:05:37.580> this<00:05:37.789> is<00:05:37.819> a<00:05:37.940> launch<00:05:38.150> title<00:05:38.240> and<00:05:38.599> we

the launch titles and realize that
resistance<00:06:06.259> really<00:06:06.500> did<00:06:06.620> stand<00:06:06.830> out<00:06:06.979> as

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
resistance really did stand out as

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.459 
resistance really did stand out as
something<00:06:07.340> unique<00:06:07.819> it<00:06:08.060> was<00:06:08.240> it<00:06:08.539> was<00:06:08.690> cool<00:06:08.930> and

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:09.469 
something unique it was it was cool and

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:12.519 
something unique it was it was cool and
it<00:06:09.860> made<00:06:10.159> all<00:06:10.400> the<00:06:10.669> pain<00:06:11.120> worth<00:06:11.449> it<00:06:11.630> I<00:06:11.870> remember

Manchester for the next like three

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.200 
Manchester for the next like three
levels<00:06:15.949> just<00:06:16.039> kind<00:06:16.250> of<00:06:16.310> like<00:06:16.460> just<00:06:16.490> amazing

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
levels just kind of like just amazing

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.120 
levels just kind of like just amazing
experience<00:06:18.169> like<00:06:18.319> I<00:06:18.440> couldn't<00:06:18.830> put<00:06:19.009> it<00:06:19.039> down

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
experience like I couldn't put it down

as I was playing and I'd played it like
