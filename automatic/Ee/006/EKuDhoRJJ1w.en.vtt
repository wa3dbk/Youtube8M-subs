00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
I'm just going to skip the first chain

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.540 
I'm just going to skip the first chain
and<00:00:23.930> pick<00:00:24.930> up<00:00:25.080> loops<00:00:25.350> in<00:00:25.590> all<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.250> chains

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
and pick up loops in all the chains

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.269 
and pick up loops in all the chains
across<00:00:26.789> in<00:00:27.390> order<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.289> do<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.560> stitch<00:00:28.859> pattern

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
across in order to do the stitch pattern

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.749 
across in order to do the stitch pattern
you<00:00:29.429> will<00:00:29.580> need<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.939> multiple<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.750> three<00:00:31.320> and

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
you will need a multiple of three and

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.069 
you will need a multiple of three and
then<00:00:32.759> add<00:00:33.030> two<00:00:33.750> here<00:00:34.620> I've<00:00:34.829> got<00:00:35.300> fourteen<00:00:36.300> so

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
then add two here I've got fourteen so

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.440 
then add two here I've got fourteen so
multiple<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.739> three<00:00:38.070> would<00:00:38.250> be<00:00:38.370> 12<00:00:39.170> plus<00:00:40.170> 2<00:00:40.739> and

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
multiple of three would be 12 plus 2 and

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.119 
multiple of three would be 12 plus 2 and
that<00:00:42.450> will<00:00:42.690> give<00:00:42.870> me<00:00:42.899> 14<00:00:45.230> so<00:00:46.230> any<00:00:46.500> multiple<00:00:47.010> of

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
that will give me 14 so any multiple of

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.080 
that will give me 14 so any multiple of
3<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.760> then<00:00:47.969> just<00:00:48.239> add<00:00:48.539> 2<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.670> I'm<00:00:50.670> just<00:00:50.850> going

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
3 and then just add 2 and I'm just going

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.760 
3 and then just add 2 and I'm just going
to<00:00:51.149> pull<00:00:51.420> up<00:00:51.570> loops<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:52.140> every<00:00:52.469> chain<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:54.770> this

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
to pull up loops in every chain and this

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.520 
to pull up loops in every chain and this
is<00:00:56.039> lace<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.820> it's<00:00:57.000> going<00:00:57.270> it's<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:58.020> slightly

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
is lace so it's going it's it's slightly

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.340 
is lace so it's going it's it's slightly
different<00:00:58.980> than<00:01:01.039> normal<00:01:03.260> Tunisian<00:01:04.260> crochet

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
different than normal Tunisian crochet

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.219 
different than normal Tunisian crochet
stitches<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.489> has<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:06.090> different<00:01:06.950> closing

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
stitches it has a different closing

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.620 
stitches it has a different closing
you're<00:01:10.229> going<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.470> always<00:01:10.680> pick<00:01:11.189> up<00:01:11.430> 14<00:01:12.150> loops

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
you're going to always pick up 14 loops

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:20.530 
you're going to always pick up 14 loops
but<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.560> closing<00:01:14.070> will<00:01:14.220> be<00:01:14.400> different

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.480 

so<00:01:21.080> let<00:01:21.260> me<00:01:21.380> just<00:01:21.590> get<00:01:21.740> across<00:01:22.070> here<00:01:24.370> now<00:01:25.370> if

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
so let me just get across here now if

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.550 
so let me just get across here now if
you<00:01:25.550> wanted<00:01:25.880> to<00:01:26.000> make<00:01:26.150> a<00:01:26.180> little<00:01:26.750> scarf<00:01:27.140> out<00:01:27.410> of

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.470 
you wanted to make a little scarf out of
this<00:01:27.740> trying<00:01:28.130> out<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.490> stitch<00:01:28.820> pattern<00:01:29.300> I

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
this trying out the stitch pattern I

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.410 
this trying out the stitch pattern I
would<00:01:30.200> say<00:01:30.800> perhaps<00:01:33.160> let's<00:01:34.160> say<00:01:34.340> 22<00:01:34.910> stitches

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
would say perhaps let's say 22 stitches

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.050 
would say perhaps let's say 22 stitches
might<00:01:35.630> make<00:01:35.840> a<00:01:35.870> nice<00:01:36.140> scarf<00:01:36.850> depending<00:01:37.850> on<00:01:37.970> the

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
might make a nice scarf depending on the

might make a nice scarf depending on the
yarn<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:38.480> the<00:01:38.570> size<00:01:38.780> of<00:01:38.900> the<00:01:39.020> hook<00:01:39.200> now<00:01:40.130> I<00:01:40.400> have

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
yarn and the size of the hook now I have

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:49.540 
yarn and the size of the hook now I have
14<00:01:41.330> 1<00:01:41.660> 2<00:01:42.080> 3<00:01:42.530> 4<00:01:43.040> 5<00:01:43.430> 6<00:01:44.060> 7<00:01:44.450> 8<00:01:45.040> 10<00:01:46.040> 11<00:01:46.340> 12<00:01:47.210> 13<00:01:47.570> 14<00:01:48.550> all

right<00:01:49.730> so<00:01:49.910> here's<00:01:50.180> where<00:01:50.390> we're<00:01:50.510> going<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.690> get

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
right so here's where we're going to get

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.000 
right so here's where we're going to get
into<00:01:51.080> something<00:01:51.320> different

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
into something different

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.400 
into something different
okay<00:01:52.420> instead<00:01:53.420> of<00:01:53.540> a<00:01:53.600> chain<00:01:53.810> one<00:01:54.080> we're<00:01:54.320> going

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
okay instead of a chain one we're going

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.670 
okay instead of a chain one we're going
to<00:01:54.470> do<00:01:54.620> a<00:01:54.650> chain<00:01:55.040> two<00:01:55.430> chain<00:01:56.710> two<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:59.680> instead

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
to do a chain two chain two and instead

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.160 
to do a chain two chain two and instead
of<00:02:00.740> yarn<00:02:01.070> over<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:01.370> pull<00:02:01.490> through<00:02:01.700> two<00:02:02.570> like

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
of yarn over and pull through two like

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.810 
of yarn over and pull through two like
we<00:02:03.350> do<00:02:03.470> normally<00:02:03.890> I'm<00:02:03.979> going<00:02:04.160> to<00:02:04.220> yarn<00:02:04.490> over

we do normally I'm going to yarn over

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.480 
we do normally I'm going to yarn over
and<00:02:04.850> pull<00:02:04.970> through<00:02:05.180> four<00:02:06.010> now<00:02:07.010> pay<00:02:07.460> attention

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
and pull through four now pay attention

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.960 
and pull through four now pay attention
here<00:02:08.330> because<00:02:08.860> for<00:02:09.860> some<00:02:10.100> reason<00:02:10.550> this<00:02:10.760> is

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
here because for some reason this is

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.500 
here because for some reason this is
this<00:02:11.420> always<00:02:11.870> seems<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.320> happen<00:02:12.620> with<00:02:12.980> lace

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
this always seems to happen with lace

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.120 
this always seems to happen with lace
when<00:02:14.510> you<00:02:14.660> yarn<00:02:14.959> over<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.320> pull<00:02:15.440> through<00:02:15.650> two

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
when you yarn over and pull through two

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.390 
when you yarn over and pull through two
you're<00:02:16.490> closing<00:02:16.880> one<00:02:17.360> stitch<00:02:17.950> when<00:02:18.950> you<00:02:19.100> yarn

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400

you're closing one stitch when you yarn
over<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:19.760> pull<00:02:19.910> through<00:02:20.120> for<00:02:20.390> your<00:02:20.990> closing

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
only three stitches for some reason when

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.670
