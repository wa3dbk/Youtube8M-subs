00:01:38.769 --> 00:01:38.779 
same one as they had with the flip where

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:45.889 
same one as they had with the flip where
this<00:01:39.779> goes<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:43.429> and<00:01:44.429> plugs<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.270> it's<00:01:45.539> still<00:01:45.869> a

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
this goes in and plugs in it's still a

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.709 
this goes in and plugs in it's still a
big<00:01:46.259> bulky<00:01:46.740> charger<00:01:47.420> they<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.539> a<00:01:48.569> USB<00:01:49.229> cable

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719 
big bulky charger they have a USB cable

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:59.390 
big bulky charger they have a USB cable
that<00:01:51.719> goes<00:01:51.779> in

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.260 

side<00:02:00.400> right<00:02:00.850> here<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:03.009> the<00:02:03.369> cable<00:02:03.790> goes<00:02:04.000> in

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
side right here so the cable goes in

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:16.520 
side right here so the cable goes in
here<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:07.800> the<00:02:12.300> most<00:02:13.300> of<00:02:13.569> the<00:02:13.599> other<00:02:15.480> chargers

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
here and the most of the other chargers

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.860 
here and the most of the other chargers
have<00:02:17.530> got<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.190> new<00:02:18.489> style<00:02:18.850> where<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.540> flips

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
have got the new style where it flips

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.290 
have got the new style where it flips
down<00:02:20.140> like<00:02:20.890> that<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.459> that's<00:02:22.450> one<00:02:23.020> of<00:02:23.050> the

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
down like that and that's one of the

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.910 
down like that and that's one of the
not-so-good<00:02:25.300> points<00:02:25.750> about<00:02:26.019> this<00:02:26.319> where<00:02:26.800> it

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
not-so-good points about this where it

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.580 
not-so-good points about this where it
slides<00:02:27.819> in<00:02:28.209> and<00:02:28.390> it's<00:02:28.510> always<00:02:28.720> it's<00:02:29.349> much

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
slides in and it's always it's much

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.530 
slides in and it's always it's much
bigger

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
bigger

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.309 
bigger
so<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:32.680> difference<00:02:33.160> primarily<00:02:34.200> it's<00:02:35.200> a

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
so the difference primarily it's a

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.840 
so the difference primarily it's a
little<00:02:35.620> bit<00:02:35.769> different<00:02:36.040> it's<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.489> little<00:02:36.730> bit

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
little bit different it's a little bit

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:44.309 
little bit different it's a little bit
bigger<00:02:37.269> than<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.410> flip<00:02:38.709> and<00:02:42.870> so<00:02:43.870> there's<00:02:44.230> a

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
bigger than the flip and so there's a

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.210 
bigger than the flip and so there's a
direct<00:02:44.560> comparison<00:02:45.220> of<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.760> flip<00:02:46.950> it's<00:02:47.950> got

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
direct comparison of the flip it's got

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.350 
direct comparison of the flip it's got
auxilary<00:02:48.670> in<00:02:49.060> power<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:50.350> it<00:02:51.069> has<00:02:51.100> auxilary<00:02:52.030> in

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
auxilary in power and it has auxilary in

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.289 
auxilary in power and it has auxilary in
and<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:53.080> power<00:02:53.290> cable<00:02:53.709> is<00:02:54.040> now<00:02:54.310> coming

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
and the power cable is now coming

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.900 
and the power cable is now coming
through<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.900> USB<00:02:59.010> so<00:03:00.010> you<00:03:00.069> charge<00:03:00.549> it<00:03:00.760> with<00:03:00.880> a

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
through the USB so you charge it with a

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.780 
through the USB so you charge it with a
USB<00:03:01.000> charge<00:03:01.780> which<00:03:02.049> is<00:03:02.080> different<00:03:02.739> so<00:03:03.640> it

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
USB charge which is different so it

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.680 
USB charge which is different so it
doesn't<00:03:04.120> have<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:05.230> he<00:03:05.380> take<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:06.820> dedicated

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
doesn't have to he take the dedicated

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.060 
doesn't have to he take the dedicated
power<00:03:07.840> supply<00:03:08.350> from<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.709> flip<00:03:09.540> that<00:03:10.540> was

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
power supply from the flip that was

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:17.099 
power supply from the flip that was
different<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.920> flip<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.940> JBL<00:03:16.510> flip<00:03:16.540> power

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
different the flip the JBL flip power

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:24.569 
different the flip the JBL flip power
supply<00:03:17.650> has<00:03:18.690> this<00:03:19.690> type<00:03:19.959> of<00:03:19.989> connector<00:03:20.850> and<00:03:23.579> so

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
supply has this type of connector and so

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.580 
supply has this type of connector and so
it<00:03:24.820> has<00:03:25.180> to<00:03:25.420> have<00:03:25.570> a<00:03:25.600> dedicated<00:03:26.430> power<00:03:27.430> supply

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
it has to have a dedicated power supply

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.550 
it has to have a dedicated power supply
whereas<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:30.070> new<00:03:30.549> charge<00:03:32.850> has<00:03:34.049> this<00:03:35.049> type<00:03:35.350> of

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
whereas the new charge has this type of

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.940 
whereas the new charge has this type of
connector<00:03:36.010> which<00:03:36.640> is<00:03:37.079> more<00:03:38.079> universally

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
connector which is more universally

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.289 
connector which is more universally
acceptable<00:03:39.820> as<00:03:40.299> a<00:03:40.959> USB<00:03:41.560> charge<00:03:42.160> so<00:03:42.940> that's<00:03:43.180> a

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
acceptable as a USB charge so that's a

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.599 
acceptable as a USB charge so that's a
one<00:03:43.540> good<00:03:43.810> point<00:03:44.079> with<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.329> new<00:03:46.329> charge<00:03:47.609> the

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
one good point with the new charge the

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.750 
one good point with the new charge the
the<00:03:49.299> sound<00:03:49.540> is<00:03:49.780> about<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.230> same<00:03:50.440> on<00:03:51.040> these

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
the sound is about the same on these

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.479 
the sound is about the same on these
lights<00:03:52.150> these<00:03:52.510> lights<00:03:52.840> actually<00:03:53.650> give<00:03:54.250> the

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
lights these lights actually give the

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.090 
lights these lights actually give the
charge<00:03:54.819> capacity<00:03:55.690> of<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:55.930> battery<00:03:56.109> right<00:03:57.040> now

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
charge capacity of the battery right now

hundred<00:04:08.560> percent<00:04:08.769> charge

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
hundred percent charge

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.160 
hundred percent charge
also<00:04:10.720> one<00:04:11.290> of<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.590> other<00:04:12.390> big<00:04:13.390> differences

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
also one of the other big differences

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.170 
also one of the other big differences
between<00:04:14.440> the<00:04:14.920> flip<00:04:15.550> and<00:04:15.760> the<00:04:16.570> charge<00:04:16.870> is<00:04:17.260> that

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
between the flip and the charge is that

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.840 
between the flip and the charge is that
the<00:04:19.180> flip<00:04:20.400> takes<00:04:21.540> five<00:04:22.540> hours<00:04:22.570> to<00:04:23.320> charge<00:04:23.850> with

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
the flip takes five hours to charge with

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.160 
the flip takes five hours to charge with
this<00:04:25.060> with<00:04:25.900> the<00:04:27.000> with<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.180> charger<00:04:28.840> that<00:04:28.990> it

this with the with the charger that it

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:34.650 
this with the with the charger that it
encompasses<00:04:32.640> got<00:04:33.640> a<00:04:33.670> new<00:04:33.940> lithium-ion

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
encompasses got a new lithium-ion

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.230 
encompasses got a new lithium-ion
battery<00:04:35.320> it<00:04:35.950> only<00:04:36.130> takes<00:04:36.490> three<00:04:36.880> and<00:04:36.910> a<00:04:37.060> half

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
battery it only takes three and a half

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.920 
battery it only takes three and a half
hours<00:04:37.660> to<00:04:37.960> get<00:04:38.110> to<00:04:38.380> a<00:04:38.410> hundred<00:04:38.740> percent<00:04:39.720> and<00:04:40.720> it

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
hours to get to a hundred percent and it

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.820 
hours to get to a hundred percent and it
will<00:04:41.050> last<00:04:41.290> for<00:04:41.920> 12<00:04:42.250> hours<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:43.900> flip<00:04:44.320> takes

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
will last for 12 hours the flip takes

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.390 
will last for 12 hours the flip takes
five<00:04:45.190> hours<00:04:45.220> to<00:04:45.790> charge<00:04:46.090> and<00:04:46.480> only<00:04:47.080> lasts<00:04:47.800> for

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
five hours to charge and only lasts for

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.110 
five hours to charge and only lasts for
eight<00:04:48.700> hours<00:04:49.050> so<00:04:50.050> there's<00:04:50.290> a<00:04:50.350> quite<00:04:50.800> a<00:04:50.830> big

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
eight hours so there's a quite a big

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.960 
eight hours so there's a quite a big
difference<00:04:52.120> in<00:04:52.330> the<00:04:52.680> charge<00:04:53.680> capacity<00:04:54.370> of<00:04:54.550> the

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
difference in the charge capacity of the

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.020 
difference in the charge capacity of the
battery<00:04:55.150> and<00:04:55.810> the<00:04:56.560> charging<00:04:57.040> system<00:04:57.220> that

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
battery and the charging system that

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.130 
battery and the charging system that
goes<00:04:58.210> along<00:04:58.540> with<00:04:58.720> this<00:04:58.900> new<00:04:59.200> charge<00:04:59.850> and<00:05:01.140> oh

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
goes along with this new charge and oh

the<00:05:32.350> new<00:05:32.590> one<00:05:32.860> they're<00:05:33.490> calling<00:05:33.520> black<00:05:34.740> so

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
the new one they're calling black so

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.020 
the new one they're calling black so
it's<00:05:36.580> a<00:05:36.730> combination<00:05:37.390> of<00:05:37.570> gray<00:05:37.960> and<00:05:38.320> white<00:05:39.030> and

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
it's a combination of gray and white and

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.180 
it's a combination of gray and white and
I<00:05:40.150> think<00:05:40.419> that's<00:05:40.600> the<00:05:40.780> only<00:05:40.810> colors<00:05:41.440> it<00:05:41.800> comes

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
I think that's the only colors it comes

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.140 
I think that's the only colors it comes
in<00:05:42.490> as<00:05:42.700> this<00:05:43.330> black<00:05:43.780> and<00:05:44.110> white<00:05:44.580> the<00:05:45.580> old<00:05:45.790> one

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
in as this black and white the old one

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.190 
in as this black and white the old one
is<00:05:47.190> either<00:05:48.190> black<00:05:48.669> or<00:05:49.090> white<00:05:49.150> this<00:05:49.660> happens<00:05:50.080> to

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
is either black or white this happens to

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.700 
is either black or white this happens to
be<00:05:50.320> all<00:05:50.470> white<00:05:50.710> the<00:05:50.950> other<00:05:51.280> one<00:05:51.430> is<00:05:51.580> all<00:05:51.760> black

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
be all white the other one is all black

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.770 
be all white the other one is all black
so<00:05:53.710> that's<00:05:54.340> pretty<00:05:54.820> much<00:05:54.910> it

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
so that's pretty much it

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.110 
so that's pretty much it
the<00:05:56.140> new<00:05:56.320> charge<00:05:56.650> is<00:05:56.950> definitely<00:05:57.669> improved

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
the new charge is definitely improved

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.500 
the new charge is definitely improved
with<00:05:58.450> the<00:05:59.280> charging<00:06:00.280> capacity<00:06:00.970> and<00:06:01.270> the

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
with the charging capacity and the

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.270 
with the charging capacity and the
charging<00:06:01.960> time<00:06:02.230> as<00:06:02.590> well<00:06:03.520> as<00:06:03.820> having<00:06:04.270> the<00:06:04.480> new

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
charging time as well as having the new

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.520 
charging time as well as having the new
USB<00:06:06.280> charge<00:06:06.760> port<00:06:07.050> making<00:06:08.050> it<00:06:08.350> more

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
USB charge port making it more

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.430 
USB charge port making it more
universally<00:06:09.370> acceptable<00:06:09.940> for<00:06:10.510> charging<00:06:11.260> and

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
universally acceptable for charging and

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.890 
universally acceptable for charging and
the<00:06:14.440> sound<00:06:14.710> is<00:06:15.040> about<00:06:15.400> the<00:06:15.580> same<00:06:15.820> they<00:06:16.630> say

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
the sound is about the same they say

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.620 
the sound is about the same they say
that<00:06:17.140> they've<00:06:17.290> got<00:06:17.470> a<00:06:17.500> base<00:06:17.770> port<00:06:18.479> but<00:06:19.479> I've

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
that they've got a base port but I've

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.090 
that they've got a base port but I've
listened<00:06:20.020> to<00:06:20.050> both<00:06:20.289> and<00:06:20.650> there's<00:06:20.800> no

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.100 
listened to both and there's no

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.440 
listened to both and there's no
difference<00:06:21.550> that<00:06:21.789> I<00:06:22.419> can<00:06:22.630> perceive

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.450 
difference that I can perceive

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.900 
difference that I can perceive
the<00:06:23.810> base<00:06:24.320> they<00:06:24.830> both<00:06:25.100> have<00:06:25.340> about<00:06:25.550> the<00:06:25.730> same

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910 
the base they both have about the same

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.640 
the base they both have about the same
pace<00:06:26.240> between<00:06:27.110> the<00:06:27.710> flip<00:06:28.400> and<00:06:28.640> the<00:06:28.940> new<00:06:29.060> charge

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
pace between the flip and the new charge

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.740 
pace between the flip and the new charge
that's<00:06:30.650> about<00:06:30.980> it<00:06:31.570> thanks<00:06:32.570> for<00:06:32.600> watching

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:32.750 
that's about it thanks for watching

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.120 
that's about it thanks for watching
