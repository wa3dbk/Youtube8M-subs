in<00:00:04.920> this<00:00:05.310> segment<00:00:05.580> of<00:00:06.109> decorative<00:00:07.109> painting

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
in this segment of decorative painting

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.180 
in this segment of decorative painting
techniques<00:00:07.700> we're<00:00:08.700> looking<00:00:09.240> at<00:00:09.920> once<00:00:10.920> we've

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
techniques we're looking at once we've

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.120 
techniques we're looking at once we've
colored<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.880> glaze<00:00:12.240> what<00:00:13.170> we<00:00:13.349> can<00:00:13.530> actually<00:00:13.740> do

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
colored a glaze what we can actually do

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.970 
colored a glaze what we can actually do
with<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.790> that's<00:00:15.630> where<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.350> think<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.770> lot

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
with it and that's where I think a lot

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.910 
with it and that's where I think a lot
of<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.340> glazing<00:00:17.850> techniques<00:00:18.300> come<00:00:18.660> in

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
of the glazing techniques come in

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.010 
of the glazing techniques come in
techniques<00:00:19.920> like<00:00:20.130> sponging<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.359> ragging

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
techniques like sponging and ragging

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.990 
techniques like sponging and ragging
color<00:00:22.560> washing<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:24.980> strea<00:00:25.980> all<00:00:26.580> these

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
color washing and strea all these

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.220 
color washing and strea all these
techniques<00:00:27.570> are<00:00:28.279> basically<00:00:29.480> using<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.630> film<00:00:30.990> of

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
techniques are basically using a film of

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.299 
techniques are basically using a film of
glaze<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:32.250> top<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:33.000> surface<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.690> then

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
glaze on top of a surface and then

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.250 
glaze on top of a surface and then
manipulating<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.460> with<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:36.000> tool<00:00:36.360> whether<00:00:36.960> it's

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
manipulating it with a tool whether it's

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.590 
manipulating it with a tool whether it's
a<00:00:37.410> brush<00:00:37.680> or<00:00:38.090> a<00:00:39.090> rag<00:00:40.020> or<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.710> sponge<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.969> what

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
a brush or a rag or a sponge so what

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.360 
a brush or a rag or a sponge so what
you're<00:00:42.750> doing<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.290> you're<00:00:43.530> applying<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
you're doing is you're applying the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.850 
you're doing is you're applying the
glaze<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:45.030> your<00:00:45.420> surface<00:00:45.690> whether<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:46.680> your

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
glaze to your surface whether it's your

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.990 
glaze to your surface whether it's your
walls<00:00:47.129> or<00:00:47.550> your<00:00:47.760> ceiling<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.480> then<00:00:49.260> working

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
walls or your ceiling and then working

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.209 
walls or your ceiling and then working
in<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.420> limited<00:00:51.960> amount<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.410> time<00:00:52.649> before<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
in a limited amount of time before the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.319 
in a limited amount of time before the
glaze<00:00:53.730> dries<00:00:54.469> to<00:00:55.469> make<00:00:56.070> an<00:00:56.250> imprint<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:57.090> your

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
glaze dries to make an imprint of your

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.920 
glaze dries to make an imprint of your
work<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.620> glaze<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.430> we<00:00:59.850> would<00:01:00.120> really<00:01:00.329> use

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
work in the glaze so we would really use

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.979 
work in the glaze so we would really use
glazes<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:02.070> situations<00:01:02.969> where<00:01:03.359> we<00:01:03.600> want<00:01:03.840> to

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
glazes in situations where we want to

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.630 
glazes in situations where we want to
bring<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.589> lot<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.890> warmth<00:01:05.850> or<00:01:06.180> depth<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:07.650> walls

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
bring a lot of warmth or depth to walls

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.450 
bring a lot of warmth or depth to walls
or<00:01:09.270> any<00:01:09.780> surface<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.560> could<00:01:10.979> even<00:01:11.159> be

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
or any surface it could even be

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.670 
or any surface it could even be
furniture<00:01:12.119> for<00:01:12.390> example<00:01:12.420> if<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.260> put<00:01:13.530> an

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
furniture for example if you put an

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.870 
furniture for example if you put an
antiquing<00:01:14.310> glaze<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:16.040> let's<00:01:17.040> say<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.549> cream

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
antiquing glaze on let's say a cream

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.270 
antiquing glaze on let's say a cream
background<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.409> make<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.979> piece<00:01:20.220> of

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
background you can make a piece of

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.429 
background you can make a piece of
furniture<00:01:20.640> look<00:01:21.150> like<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.630> was<00:01:21.840> hundreds<00:01:22.290> of

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
furniture look like it was hundreds of

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.210 
furniture look like it was hundreds of
years<00:01:22.500> old

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
years old

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.670 
years old
as<00:01:23.580> opposed<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.960> know<00:01:24.990> something<00:01:25.530> you

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
as opposed to you know something you

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.330 
as opposed to you know something you
bought<00:01:25.920> yesterday<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.759> ultimately<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.659> think

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
bought yesterday and ultimately I think

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.450 
bought yesterday and ultimately I think
glazes<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.610> used<00:01:30.090> quite<00:01:30.930> unexpectedly<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:31.920> a

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
glazes I used quite unexpectedly on a

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.270 
glazes I used quite unexpectedly on a
lot<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.030> things<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.140> may<00:01:34.380> have<00:01:34.409> lying

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
lot of things that you may have lying

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.940 
lot of things that you may have lying
around<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.970> your<00:01:36.119> home<00:01:36.360> or<00:01:36.780> your<00:01:36.930> office<00:01:37.170> you

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
around in your home or your office you

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.800 
around in your home or your office you
could<00:01:38.100> find<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:38.700> mirror<00:01:39.000> frames<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.780> can

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
could find it on mirror frames you can

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.200 
could find it on mirror frames you can
find<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.380> as<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.590> mentioned<00:01:41.159> on<00:01:41.280> cabinetry<00:01:42.000> a

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
find it as I mentioned on cabinetry a

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.899 
find it as I mentioned on cabinetry a
lot<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.869> kitchen<00:01:43.320> cabinets<00:01:43.350> as<00:01:44.220> well<00:01:44.520> have

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
lot of kitchen cabinets as well have

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.289 
lot of kitchen cabinets as well have
glaze<00:01:45.869> on<00:01:46.200> them<00:01:46.500> because<00:01:46.710> glaze<00:01:47.640> actually<00:01:48.180> is

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
glaze on them because glaze actually is

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.219 
glaze on them because glaze actually is
much<00:01:48.570> tougher<00:01:49.020> than<00:01:49.290> paint<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.600> becomes<00:01:52.079> a

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
much tougher than paint so it becomes a

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.160 
much tougher than paint so it becomes a
much<00:01:52.530> more<00:01:52.890> durable<00:01:53.610> surface<00:01:54.420> once<00:01:54.869> it's

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
much more durable surface once it's

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.069 
much more durable surface once it's
glazed<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.100> one<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.149> things<00:01:57.810> that

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
glazed and one of the things that

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.800 
glazed and one of the things that
possibly<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:59.100> should<00:01:59.700> not<00:01:59.909> be<00:02:00.090> confused<00:02:00.540> with

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
possibly you should not be confused with

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.959 
possibly you should not be confused with
is<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.530> glaze<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.850> used<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:03.719> pottery

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
is the glaze that is used on pottery

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:07.940 
is the glaze that is used on pottery
glazes<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.299> are<00:02:06.810> actually<00:02:07.530> applied<00:02:07.920> to

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
glazes that are actually applied to

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.029 
glazes that are actually applied to
pottery<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:08.910> then<00:02:09.119> fired<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.929> kiln<00:02:10.039> but

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
pottery and then fired in the kiln but

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.740 
pottery and then fired in the kiln but
it<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.940> same

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
it is the same

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.210 
it is the same
seneschal<00:02:13.820> outer<00:02:14.820> coating<00:02:15.560> that<00:02:16.560> is<00:02:16.890> the

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
seneschal outer coating that is the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.770 
seneschal outer coating that is the
tough<00:02:17.490> durable<00:02:18.000> part<00:02:18.480> of<00:02:18.750> let's<00:02:19.080> say<00:02:19.260> pottery
