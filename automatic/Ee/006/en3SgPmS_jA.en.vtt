screw<00:01:49.979> up<00:01:50.100> hard<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.549> flash<00:01:51.000> looks<00:01:51.360> like<00:01:51.509> he's

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
screw up hard and flash looks like he's

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.620 
screw up hard and flash looks like he's
can<00:01:51.750> go<00:01:51.899> for<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.229> 1015<00:01:53.220> gate<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.700> hope<00:01:54.360> that

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
can go for it to 1015 gate I hope that

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.480 
can go for it to 1015 gate I hope that
would<00:01:54.750> be<00:01:54.810> kind<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.020> cool<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.409> see<00:01:56.070> him<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.460> a

would be kind of cool to see him do a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.010 
would be kind of cool to see him do a
10-15<00:01:57.060> gate<00:01:57.740> but<00:01:58.759> yeah<00:01:59.759> I'm<00:02:00.450> hoping<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.840> see<00:02:00.990> a

10-15 gate but yeah I'm hoping to see a

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.910 
10-15 gate but yeah I'm hoping to see a
really<00:02:01.229> epic<00:02:01.700> game<00:02:02.700> with<00:02:03.020> not<00:02:04.020> pro<00:02:04.380> standards

trying to find some good replays but

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:24.349 
trying to find some good replays but
they're<00:02:22.379> hard<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.680> come<00:02:22.859> by<00:02:23.010> now<00:02:23.939> as<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.209> go

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359 
they're hard to come by now as I go

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.509 
they're hard to come by now as I go
there<00:02:24.749> off<00:02:24.930> racing<00:02:25.170> alright<00:02:26.159> so<00:02:26.310> flash

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
there off racing alright so flash

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.160 
there off racing alright so flash
producing<00:02:27.060> one<00:02:27.209> goon<00:02:27.389> so<00:02:27.569> he's<00:02:27.689> not<00:02:27.780> gonna<00:02:27.959> go

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
producing one goon so he's not gonna go

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.709 
producing one goon so he's not gonna go
for<00:02:28.379> 10<00:02:28.530> 15<00:02:28.680> which<00:02:29.670> is<00:02:29.790> good<00:02:29.939> on<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.150> which<00:02:30.420> is

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:30.719 
for 10 15 which is good on that which is

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.050 
for 10 15 which is good on that which is
a<00:02:30.840> good<00:02:31.290> decision<00:02:31.709> on<00:02:31.859> this<00:02:32.129> map<00:02:32.310> 1015<00:02:32.849> gate

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
a good decision on this map 1015 gate

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.819 
a good decision on this map 1015 gate
because<00:02:33.569> obviously<00:02:33.870> it<00:02:34.230> doesn't<00:02:34.379> have<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.590> ramp

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
because obviously it doesn't have a ramp

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.349 
because obviously it doesn't have a ramp
and<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.040> goons<00:02:35.549> can<00:02:35.639> get<00:02:35.819> right<00:02:35.969> in<00:02:36.060> your<00:02:36.120> face

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:36.359 
and the goons can get right in your face

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:38.569 
and the goons can get right in your face
tickle<00:02:37.349> the<00:02:37.439> tank<00:02:37.650> all<00:02:37.769> that<00:02:37.889> fun<00:02:38.040> stuff<00:02:38.069> this

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
tickle the tank all that fun stuff this

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.280 
tickle the tank all that fun stuff this

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
with now Roz almost call it flash never

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.309 
with now Roz almost call it flash never
has<00:02:43.049> SCV<00:02:43.669> flashes<00:02:44.669> probe<00:02:45.030> is<00:02:45.659> gonna<00:02:45.989> be<00:02:46.139> that

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
has SCV flashes probe is gonna be that

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.869 
has SCV flashes probe is gonna be that
hero<00:02:46.560> here<00:02:46.889> I'm<00:02:47.010> gonna<00:02:47.129> scout<00:02:47.639> cross

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
hero here I'm gonna scout cross

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.149 
hero here I'm gonna scout cross
positions<00:02:48.389> now<00:02:48.569> he<00:02:49.379> has<00:02:49.560> not<00:02:49.709> together<00:02:49.889> now

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
positions now he has not together now

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.259 
positions now he has not together now
rot<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.700> so<00:02:51.209> he<00:02:52.079> uh<00:02:52.349> we<00:02:53.069> only<00:02:53.189> have<00:02:53.340> one<00:02:53.370> SUV<00:02:54.180> on

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
rot and so he uh we only have one SUV on

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.780 
rot and so he uh we only have one SUV on
gas<00:02:54.540> so<00:02:54.840> now<00:02:55.349> we're<00:02:55.530> all<00:02:55.590> might<00:02:55.799> actually<00:02:56.340> be

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
gas so now we're all might actually be

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.520 
gas so now we're all might actually be
going<00:02:56.879> for<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.180> siege<00:02:57.419> expand<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:58.079> type<00:02:58.260> build

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
going for a siege expand to type build

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.589 
going for a siege expand to type build
order<00:02:58.799> very<00:02:59.430> strong<00:02:59.730> build<00:02:59.969> order<00:03:00.209> you<00:03:00.419> can't

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
order very strong build order you can't

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.280 
order very strong build order you can't
really<00:03:00.750> screw<00:03:01.079> it<00:03:01.199> up<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:02.689> flash<00:03:03.689> upgrading

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
really screw it up and flash upgrading

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.729 
really screw it up and flash upgrading
singularity<00:03:04.859> charge<00:03:05.159> and<00:03:06.409> yeah<00:03:07.409> this<00:03:07.590> is

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
singularity charge and yeah this is

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.619 
singularity charge and yeah this is
gonna<00:03:07.889> be<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.099> most<00:03:08.189> epic<00:03:08.430> thing<00:03:08.609> ever<00:03:08.969> I<00:03:09.269> hope

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
gonna be the most epic thing ever I hope

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.879 
gonna be the most epic thing ever I hope
this<00:03:10.260> map<00:03:10.500> I'll<00:03:11.250> go<00:03:11.519> here<00:03:12.000> again<00:03:12.620> this<00:03:13.620> map

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
this map I'll go here again this map

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:15.830 
this map I'll go here again this map
it's<00:03:14.129> kind<00:03:14.370> of<00:03:14.400> hard<00:03:14.639> for<00:03:14.699> protoss<00:03:15.510> because

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
it's kind of hard for protoss because

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.599 
it's kind of hard for protoss because
the<00:03:15.959> Terran<00:03:16.230> has<00:03:16.349> all<00:03:16.680> this<00:03:16.889> high<00:03:17.129> ground<00:03:17.159> all

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
the Terran has all this high ground all

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.449 
the Terran has all this high ground all
over<00:03:17.849> the<00:03:17.939> place<00:03:18.259> so<00:03:19.259> normally<00:03:20.220> i<00:03:20.250> would<00:03:20.400> be

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
over the place so normally i would be

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.339 
over the place so normally i would be
flash<00:03:20.759> that<00:03:21.060> would<00:03:21.180> have<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.349> imminent

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
flash that would have the imminent

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:23.929 
flash that would have the imminent
Advantage<00:03:22.919> Plus<00:03:23.159> now<00:03:23.340> rod<00:03:23.549> would<00:03:23.669> be<00:03:23.759> out<00:03:23.909> of

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:23.939 
Advantage Plus now rod would be out of

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:25.879 
Advantage Plus now rod would be out of
practice<00:03:24.209> but<00:03:24.569> now<00:03:25.139> we're<00:03:25.319> all<00:03:25.409> probably<00:03:25.590> just

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
practice but now we're all probably just

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.429 
practice but now we're all probably just
even<00:03:26.159> at<00:03:26.280> his<00:03:26.400> you<00:03:27.209> know<00:03:27.329> disadvantage<00:03:28.229> from
