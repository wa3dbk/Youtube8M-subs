with InDesign when you use templates I'm

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.629 
with InDesign when you use templates I'm
going<00:00:12.059> right<00:00:12.269> into<00:00:12.540> InDesign<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.349> as<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:14.460> see

going right into InDesign and as you see

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.360 
going right into InDesign and as you see
I'm<00:00:14.759> creating<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.210> new<00:00:15.240> document<00:00:15.920> my<00:00:16.920> albums

I'm creating a new document my albums

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.540 
I'm creating a new document my albums
are<00:00:17.520> always<00:00:17.820> 30<00:00:18.180> by<00:00:18.420> 30<00:00:18.689> centimeter<00:00:19.320> or<00:00:19.680> 25<00:00:20.310> by

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
are always 30 by 30 centimeter or 25 by

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.109 
are always 30 by 30 centimeter or 25 by
25<00:00:20.720> centimeter<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.980> this<00:00:22.980> one<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.550> now<00:00:23.970> an

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
25 centimeter and this one is now an

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.870 
25 centimeter and this one is now an
example<00:00:24.570> for<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.750> 25<00:00:25.260> by<00:00:25.529> 25<00:00:25.590> centimeter<00:00:26.580> with

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
example for a 25 by 25 centimeter with

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.519 
example for a 25 by 25 centimeter with
one<00:00:27.180> centimeter<00:00:27.810> margin<00:00:29.720> so<00:00:30.720> what<00:00:31.230> I'm<00:00:31.349> going

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
one centimeter margin so what I'm going

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.680 
one centimeter margin so what I'm going
to<00:00:31.650> do<00:00:31.830> first<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.400> creating<00:00:32.850> some<00:00:33.060> pages<00:00:33.330> for

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
to do first is creating some pages for

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.150 
to do first is creating some pages for
us<00:00:33.810> so<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.740> we<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:34.980> an<00:00:35.100> album<00:00:37.040> making<00:00:38.040> them

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
us so that we have an album making them

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.950 
us so that we have an album making them
a<00:00:38.220> little<00:00:38.460> bit<00:00:38.580> smaller<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.450> we<00:00:39.570> can<00:00:39.750> see

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
a little bit smaller so that we can see

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.750 
a little bit smaller so that we can see
them<00:00:40.140> all<00:00:41.450> so<00:00:42.450> what<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.290> see<00:00:43.500> here<00:00:43.800> now<00:00:43.830> is<00:00:44.340> the

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
I have my picture here and I do this

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:07.499 
I have my picture here and I do this
with<00:01:58.890> all<00:01:59.340> images<00:02:01.280> see<00:02:02.280> how<00:02:02.430> easy<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.880> is

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:15.550 

what<00:02:08.509> you<00:02:08.630> can<00:02:08.840> do<00:02:09.020> from<00:02:09.590> here<00:02:11.050> you<00:02:12.050> can<00:02:14.560> make

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
what you can do from here you can make

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.620 
what you can do from here you can make
them<00:02:15.740> make<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.520> images<00:02:16.820> inside<00:02:17.480> your

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
them make the images inside your

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.380 
them make the images inside your
template<00:02:18.020> bigger<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:18.650> would<00:02:19.100> only<00:02:19.340> show<00:02:19.880> what

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
template bigger and would only show what

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.460 
template bigger and would only show what
you<00:02:20.510> just<00:02:20.720> chose<00:02:22.780> you<00:02:23.780> can<00:02:23.930> also<00:02:24.080> make<00:02:24.350> them

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
you just chose you can also make them

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.990 
you just chose you can also make them
small<00:02:24.770> smaller<00:02:25.190> which<00:02:25.460> wouldn't<00:02:25.730> make<00:02:25.790> any

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
small smaller which wouldn't make any

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.550 
small smaller which wouldn't make any
sense<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:27.850> you<00:02:28.850> can<00:02:29.000> also<00:02:29.210> change<00:02:29.960> this

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
sense and you can also change this

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.770 
sense and you can also change this
template<00:02:30.980> of<00:02:31.160> course<00:02:33.790> making<00:02:34.790> it<00:02:35.060> smaller<00:02:35.390> and

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
template of course making it smaller and

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.180 
template of course making it smaller and

paper you click on it and here you see
your<00:03:15.560> new<00:03:15.709> design<00:03:16.100> I<00:03:16.810> will<00:03:17.810> change<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.560> name

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
your new design I will change the name

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.880 
your new design I will change the name
so<00:03:19.550> that<00:03:20.060> like<00:03:20.390> here<00:03:20.810> it<00:03:21.019> gets<00:03:21.290> into<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.739> right

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
so that like here it gets into the right

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.060 
so that like here it gets into the right
order<00:03:22.130> so<00:03:22.550> these<00:03:23.150> are<00:03:23.360> our<00:03:23.450> five<00:03:23.780> images<00:03:24.110> and<00:03:24.560> I

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
order so these are our five images and I

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.210 
order so these are our five images and I
will<00:03:25.250> just<00:03:25.459> call<00:03:25.640> it<00:03:25.700> five<00:03:26.209> story<00:03:26.660> so<00:03:27.560> that<00:03:27.890> you

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
will just call it five story so that you

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.830 
will just call it five story so that you
know<00:03:28.489> it's<00:03:28.700> five<00:03:29.269> images<00:03:29.600> but<00:03:30.170> not<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.530> same

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
know it's five images but not the same

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.570 
know it's five images but not the same
same<00:03:32.840> shape<00:03:34.269> so<00:03:35.380> let's<00:03:36.380> do<00:03:36.560> this<00:03:36.709> again<00:03:37.010> we

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
same shape so let's do this again we

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.830 
same shape so let's do this again we
just<00:03:37.850> take<00:03:38.180> some<00:03:38.209> pictures<00:03:38.799> we<00:03:39.799> have<00:03:39.890> a<00:03:39.920> dress

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.050
