00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:10.740
 hello everyone so it's the little cabbage 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.410
 for a video on minecraft so in 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.540
 this video i will show you the the 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.220
 cathedral of cologne 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.720
 so I wanted to introduce a little bit 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.260
 so this is the cathedral of the city of 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.279
 cologne that is 157 meters high 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.680
 it is the second highest church 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.439
 germany and the world after the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.689
 lm and she is considered the jewel 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.920
 Gothic style of the middle ages or the 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.630
 middle age because it was started 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.250
 in 1247 is finished in 1881 so six hundred 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.230
 thirty two years and two months after so 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.680
 it took a long time to be done 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.530
 it is and it is also the most 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.680
 visited germany so with 6 million 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.770
 6 million visitors a year 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.210
 case it is a figure that dates from 2004 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.010
 and so here is to reproduce it I 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.510
 I used a model that I had 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.579
 seen at langeais castle in the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.620
 country-of-the-loire so a model that 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.780
 I took a photo and I was served 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.360
 for to reproduce all the wrapped 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.040
 outer 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.350
 and so that's it for me it's really 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:14.990
 one of the most beautiful cathedrals he 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:17.410
 or even started the tour 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.410
 indoor 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.140
 So here we go under the nave of which will 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.869
 to be for this for the inside of the 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.280
 cathedral I chose to do 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.990
 downright invented that is to say that it 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.600
 has nothing to do with the Cathedral of 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.729
 cologne like that I could have fun at 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.560
 do what I wanted a little my full 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.670
 to return in the 10 years of late war 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.490
 who goes around the heart so 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.009
 now with the mercies the 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.399
 seats under which that try the 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.619
 monks there on the edges so we have three 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:54.069
 organs 1 in the central part and two 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.810
 in the side parts and had there 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:57.369
 also I have a friend who has gone from 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.299
 'keep' and a quarter before all that I 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:08.500
 found it really funny 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:09.610
 realistic did I like too 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.140
 in this cathedral is that I 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.560
 added a lot of little passages 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.980
 secrets 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.680
 finally secret messages like that hidden 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.620
 under the pylons or three years and then the one 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.670
 of languages â€‹â€‹including staircases like 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.640
 that is 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:28.010
 you have got there so here we have 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.129
 precisely the main lord of the 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.129
 cathedral 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:40.700
 to the point that 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.610
 so we can climb but I take 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:52.270
 andy shortened to broom closet hop 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.770
 it's quite practical 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.120
 so here we come in a small 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.020
 chapel that is not finished at all and 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:06.670
 loud he is not visitor can be 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:10.990
 so here we go here so we go up and 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.910
 we arrive under the eaves so here it is 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.459
 the frame of the cathedral so it's 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.030
 really awesome and we have a 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.920
 access to the bells so with a 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.340
 very nice view everywhere in the 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.760
 cathedral way so here we go up 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.760
 to the bells 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.019
 so here we still have a beautiful city 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.090
 more to the outbursts is so 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.290
 behind there are the bells it's gone 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.690
 so do that sounds like bells 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.690
 did what I could 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.360
 and so he climbed into the carpentry 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.900
 so who does entirely 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.099
 so here I tell you that 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.299
 like a potting soil of the cathedral 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.970
 invented I do not know how was 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.730
 really 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.200
 Oh 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.200
 and there the cathedral seen from above 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.670
 month december we will go visit a 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:17.329
 very interesting part too of this 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.669
 cathedral but who I do not know if she 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.889
 actually exists it's the crypt so 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:26.199
 So here we have to come down good game at 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.199
 soil if we got a little too long 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.819
 so this final is very deep I 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.580
 do not know if it exists in real life but I 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:39.430
 find it funny in this film a way 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:43.200
 there by cons what I know is so 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.920
 there I had several tones sand 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.920
 to lose 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.500
 I see 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:57.560
 ah no for example here I have a friend who 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.560
 with ap that also from an angle 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.270
 and what is true is that 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.240
 normally it's not here but in the 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.740
 heart there are the relics of the three wise men 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.100
 which are on display in the cathedral 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.389
 cologne is time that precisely the young 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.590
 amy in the crypt finally they are 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:20.129
 in the net heart and so with melchior 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:23.099
 gaspard and balthazar 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:24.869
 here you go, so the crypt is really 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:27.869
 in the perfect alignment to watch 

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:30.709
 when we arrive directly in the 

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:30.709
 double chin cathedral 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.400
 1 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.570
 and so that's it for this cathedral 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.130
 cologne so that was my first video 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.419
 of my achievements on minecraft so 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.240
 people around others especially on the 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:52.560
 castle of Versailles that fire and so 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.560
 Here I say more
