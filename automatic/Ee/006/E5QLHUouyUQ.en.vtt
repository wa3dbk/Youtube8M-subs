magnets<00:01:38.210> so<00:01:39.619> basically<00:01:40.619> not<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.610> smart<00:01:42.180> cover

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
magnets so basically not the smart cover

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.530 
magnets so basically not the smart cover
I've<00:01:42.810> also<00:01:43.020> heard<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.380> during<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.540> hardware

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
I've also heard that during the hardware

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.980 
I've also heard that during the hardware
building<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.130> iPad<00:01:47.520> 2<00:01:47.549> when<00:01:48.420> they<00:01:48.630> pressed

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
building of the iPad 2 when they pressed

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.280 
building of the iPad 2 when they pressed
the<00:01:49.140> screen<00:01:49.740> on<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.700> back<00:01:50.880> end<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.899> iPad<00:01:52.259> 2

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
the screen on the back end of the iPad 2

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.990 
the screen on the back end of the iPad 2
and<00:01:52.560> maybe<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.189> was<00:01:53.310> pressed<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.670> little<00:01:53.759> bit

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
and maybe it was pressed a little bit

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.880 
and maybe it was pressed a little bit
hard<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.869> caused<00:01:55.079> some<00:01:55.110> damage<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
hard and it caused some damage to the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.580 
hard and it caused some damage to the
edges<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.490> screen<00:01:56.759> it's<00:01:57.479> not<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:58.229> well

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
edges of the screen it's not that well

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.910 
edges of the screen it's not that well
what<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.799> think<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.250> is<00:02:00.079> simply<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.680> glue

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
what I think it is is simply the glue

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.069 
what I think it is is simply the glue
well<00:02:02.189> underneath<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.759> iPad<00:02:03.149> 2<00:02:03.329> now<00:02:03.689> let<00:02:03.840> me<00:02:03.960> go

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
well underneath the iPad 2 now let me go

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.679 
well underneath the iPad 2 now let me go
ahead<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.290> explain<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:05.119> basically<00:02:06.119> this

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
ahead and explain this basically this

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.770 
ahead and explain this basically this
was<00:02:07.049> seen<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.829> error<00:02:08.220> screen<00:02:08.759> bleeding<00:02:09.209> was

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
was seen this error screen bleeding was

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.050 
was seen this error screen bleeding was
also<00:02:10.229> seen

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
also seen

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.140 
also seen
some<00:02:11.630> people's<00:02:12.190> iPhone<00:02:13.190> iPod<00:02:13.910> Touch

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
some people's iPhone iPod Touch

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.390 
some people's iPhone iPod Touch
basically<00:02:14.840> I<00:02:14.870> did<00:02:15.200> see<00:02:15.470> it<00:02:15.500> on<00:02:15.709> my<00:02:15.860> iPod<00:02:16.190> Touch

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
basically I did see it on my iPod Touch

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.820 
basically I did see it on my iPod Touch
when<00:02:16.610> I<00:02:16.670> first<00:02:16.910> got<00:02:17.060> my<00:02:17.270> iPod<00:02:17.600> touch<00:02:17.840> but<00:02:18.470> it

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
when I first got my iPod touch but it

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.010 
when I first got my iPod touch but it
wasn't<00:02:19.069> a<00:02:19.100> big<00:02:19.220> deal<00:02:19.490> because<00:02:19.640> after<00:02:20.360> a<00:02:20.390> day<00:02:20.840> or

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
wasn't a big deal because after a day or

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.140 
wasn't a big deal because after a day or
two<00:02:21.230> it<00:02:21.500> actually<00:02:21.920> disappeared<00:02:22.850> completely

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
two it actually disappeared completely

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.020 
two it actually disappeared completely
and<00:02:23.930> it<00:02:24.410> never<00:02:24.560> became<00:02:24.920> much<00:02:25.160> of<00:02:25.310> an<00:02:25.400> issue<00:02:25.520> now

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
and it never became much of an issue now

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.540 
and it never became much of an issue now
how<00:02:26.270> did<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:26.540> disappear<00:02:27.140> because<00:02:27.800> well

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
how did that disappear because well

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.000 
how did that disappear because well
basically<00:02:28.940> how<00:02:29.180> did<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:30.290> iPhone<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:30.800> iPod

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
basically how did the iPhone and iPod

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.040 
basically how did the iPhone and iPod
touch<00:02:31.069> screen<00:02:31.970> bleeding<00:02:32.300> disappear<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:32.989> the

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
touch screen bleeding disappear and the

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.530 
touch screen bleeding disappear and the
iPad<00:02:33.440> 2<00:02:33.770> screen<00:02:34.550> bleeding<00:02:34.910> is<00:02:35.030> still<00:02:35.300> here

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
iPad 2 screen bleeding is still here

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.229 
iPad 2 screen bleeding is still here
basically<00:02:36.080> on<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.890> iPod<00:02:37.220> touch<00:02:37.489> it's<00:02:38.060> a

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
basically on the iPod touch it's a

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.880 
basically on the iPod touch it's a
smaller<00:02:38.540> screen<00:02:38.989> so<00:02:39.760> letting<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.910> glue

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
smaller screen so letting the glue

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.150 
smaller screen so letting the glue
harden<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:43.209> basically<00:02:44.209> dry<00:02:44.680> won't<00:02:45.680> take<00:02:45.950> as

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
harden and basically dry won't take as

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.370 
harden and basically dry won't take as
long<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:46.730> with<00:02:46.880> a<00:02:46.910> bigger<00:02:47.150> screen<00:02:47.390> with<00:02:48.080> a<00:02:48.110> lot

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
long and with a bigger screen with a lot

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.630 
long and with a bigger screen with a lot
more<00:02:48.590> glue<00:02:48.890> it'll<00:02:49.550> take<00:02:49.820> longer<00:02:50.330> time<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:51.640> dry

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
more glue it'll take longer time to dry

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.180 
more glue it'll take longer time to dry
and<00:02:52.670> harden<00:02:53.269> so<00:02:53.630> in<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.290> case<00:02:54.500> of<00:02:54.680> this<00:02:54.830> what

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
and harden so in the case of this what

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.640 
and harden so in the case of this what
they<00:02:55.310> did<00:02:55.489> is<00:02:55.730> supposedly<00:02:56.660> they<00:02:57.110> took<00:02:57.500> the

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
they did is supposedly they took the

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.830 
they did is supposedly they took the
back<00:02:57.830> of<00:02:58.040> it<00:02:58.190> and<00:02:58.430> they<00:02:58.730> glued<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.330> screen

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
back of it and they glued the screen

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.340 
back of it and they glued the screen
down<00:03:00.080> to<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.650> back<00:03:00.890> of<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.400> iPad<00:03:01.550> 2<00:03:01.970> now<00:03:02.660> the

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
down to the back of the iPad 2 now the

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.440 
down to the back of the iPad 2 now the
problem<00:03:03.680> is<00:03:03.800> when<00:03:04.340> they<00:03:04.730> were<00:03:04.790> building<00:03:05.180> it

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
problem is when they were building it

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.400 
problem is when they were building it
the<00:03:06.319> glue<00:03:06.620> had<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.340> hard<00:03:07.550> time<00:03:07.840> drying<00:03:08.840> and

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
the glue had a hard time drying and

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.170 
the glue had a hard time drying and
hardening<00:03:10.040> which<00:03:10.220> is<00:03:10.400> what<00:03:10.580> it's<00:03:10.730> supposed<00:03:11.060> to

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
hardening which is what it's supposed to

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.449 
hardening which is what it's supposed to
do<00:03:11.360> what<00:03:11.690> it<00:03:11.810> did<00:03:12.050> throughout<00:03:12.739> the<00:03:12.800> middle<00:03:13.280> of

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
do what it did throughout the middle of

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.580 
do what it did throughout the middle of
the<00:03:13.610> screen<00:03:13.850> year<00:03:14.180> except<00:03:14.569> around<00:03:14.989> the<00:03:15.140> edges

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
the screen year except around the edges

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.090 
the screen year except around the edges
now<00:03:16.190> in<00:03:16.519> this<00:03:16.760> case<00:03:17.140> it<00:03:18.140> kind<00:03:18.709> of<00:03:18.769> bleeds

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
now in this case it kind of bleeds

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.430 
now in this case it kind of bleeds
through<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:19.640> screen<00:03:19.940> as<00:03:20.090> you<00:03:20.180> guys<00:03:20.360> saw<00:03:20.630> which

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
through the screen as you guys saw which

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.979 
through the screen as you guys saw which
is<00:03:21.560> kind<00:03:21.769> of<00:03:21.799> an<00:03:21.920> LCD<00:03:22.340> effect<00:03:22.850> may<00:03:23.450> be<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.780> glue

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
is kind of an LCD effect may be the glue

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.060 
is kind of an LCD effect may be the glue
got<00:03:24.200> up<00:03:24.350> in<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.620> screen<00:03:24.890> and<00:03:25.220> simply<00:03:25.579> caused<00:03:25.820> a

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
got up in the screen and simply caused a

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.100 
got up in the screen and simply caused a
problem<00:03:28.070> with<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.730> screen<00:03:29.030> itself<00:03:29.450> so<00:03:29.989> I<00:03:30.019> do

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
problem with the screen itself so I do

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.050 
problem with the screen itself so I do
think<00:03:30.560> it<00:03:30.650> was<00:03:30.829> the<00:03:31.040> glue<00:03:31.280> that<00:03:31.310> holds<00:03:31.730> the

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
think it was the glue that holds the

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.910 
think it was the glue that holds the
screen<00:03:32.450> to<00:03:32.630> the<00:03:32.720> iPad<00:03:33.079> -<00:03:33.260> that's<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.739> most

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
screen to the iPad - that's the most

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.729 
screen to the iPad - that's the most
legit<00:03:34.850> answer<00:03:35.269> I<00:03:35.299> have<00:03:35.690> found<00:03:36.079> that's

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
legit answer I have found that's

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.100 
legit answer I have found that's
basically<00:03:37.549> what<00:03:37.760> I<00:03:37.790> think<00:03:38.030> it<00:03:38.150> is<00:03:38.180> now<00:03:38.840> like<00:03:38.959> I

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
basically what I think it is now like I

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.289 
basically what I think it is now like I
said<00:03:39.380> whether<00:03:39.769> or<00:03:39.950> not<00:03:40.040> to<00:03:40.340> return<00:03:40.670> in<00:03:40.880> Iran

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
said whether or not to return in Iran

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.780 
said whether or not to return in Iran
that's<00:03:42.200> all<00:03:42.380> up<00:03:42.500> to<00:03:42.709> you<00:03:42.829> if<00:03:43.130> it<00:03:43.310> gets<00:03:43.489> worse

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
that's all up to you if it gets worse

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.970 
that's all up to you if it gets worse
maybe<00:03:44.269> you<00:03:44.420> want<00:03:44.600> to<00:03:44.660> return<00:03:44.989> it<00:03:45.200> if<00:03:45.350> it

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
maybe you want to return it if it

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.410 
maybe you want to return it if it
doesn't<00:03:46.489> really<00:03:46.609> do<00:03:46.850> anything<00:03:47.239> and<00:03:47.329> it

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
doesn't really do anything and it

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.910 
doesn't really do anything and it
doesn't<00:03:47.450> really<00:03:47.750> bother<00:03:48.019> you<00:03:48.380> and<00:03:48.650> you<00:03:48.769> don't

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
doesn't really bother you and you don't

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.039 
doesn't really bother you and you don't
think<00:03:49.040> it's<00:03:49.220> a<00:03:49.280> big<00:03:49.430> problem<00:03:49.910> don't<00:03:50.690> take<00:03:50.930> the

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
think it's a big problem don't take the

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.289 
think it's a big problem don't take the
time<00:03:51.230> to<00:03:51.410> return<00:03:51.739> it<00:03:51.980> whatever<00:03:52.670> it's<00:03:53.209> your

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
time to return it whatever it's your

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.509 
time to return it whatever it's your
choice<00:03:53.690> but<00:03:54.140> I<00:03:54.200> just<00:03:54.530> wanted<00:03:54.739> to<00:03:54.829> go<00:03:54.890> ahead<00:03:55.160> and

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
choice but I just wanted to go ahead and

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.690 
choice but I just wanted to go ahead and
hopefully<00:03:56.420> put<00:03:57.170> an<00:03:57.260> answer<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.980> lots<00:03:58.489> of<00:03:58.609> your

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
hopefully put an answer to lots of your

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.729 
hopefully put an answer to lots of your
guys's<00:03:58.880> questions<00:03:59.510> about<00:03:59.930> screen<00:04:00.320> bleeding

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
guys's questions about screen bleeding

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.280 
guys's questions about screen bleeding
and<00:04:00.920> simply<00:04:01.549> say<00:04:01.850> it's<00:04:02.359> caused<00:04:02.660> by<00:04:02.870> the<00:04:03.019> glue

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
and simply say it's caused by the glue

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.210 
and simply say it's caused by the glue
around<00:04:03.590> the<00:04:03.859> edges<00:04:04.340> so<00:04:05.230> I've<00:04:06.230> heard<00:04:06.440> that<00:04:06.650> you

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
around the edges so I've heard that you

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.630 
around the edges so I've heard that you
know<00:04:07.359> with<00:04:08.359> me<00:04:08.570> on<00:04:09.350> day<00:04:09.680> one<00:04:09.950> when<00:04:10.160> I<00:04:10.220> got<00:04:10.430> this

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
know with me on day one when I got this

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.849 
know with me on day one when I got this
and<00:04:10.910> I<00:04:11.000> checked<00:04:11.329> screen<00:04:11.870> bleeding<00:04:12.260> it<00:04:12.470> wasn't

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859 
and I checked screen bleeding it wasn't

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:16.390 
and I checked screen bleeding it wasn't
near<00:04:13.130> as<00:04:13.250> bad<00:04:13.459> as<00:04:13.519> today<00:04:14.150> is<00:04:14.450> I<00:04:15.049> think<00:04:15.890> it<00:04:16.130> is

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
near as bad as today is I think it is

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.089 
near as bad as today is I think it is
that<00:04:16.430> and<00:04:17.090> this<00:04:17.269> also<00:04:17.600> points<00:04:18.019> to<00:04:18.079> the<00:04:19.070> idea

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
that and this also points to the idea

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:21.580 
that and this also points to the idea
that<00:04:19.580> it's<00:04:19.970> caused<00:04:20.299> by<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:20.630> glue<00:04:20.870> also<00:04:21.169> I

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
that it's caused by the glue also I

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.840 
that it's caused by the glue also I
played<00:04:22.010> infinity<00:04:22.550> blade<00:04:22.669> all<00:04:22.970> day<00:04:23.240> and<00:04:23.510> it<00:04:23.659> may

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
played infinity blade all day and it may

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.000 
played infinity blade all day and it may
my<00:04:24.000> I've<00:04:24.180> had<00:04:24.390> two<00:04:24.600> very<00:04:24.990> very<00:04:25.530> very

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
my I've had two very very very

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.180 
my I've had two very very very
overheated<00:04:26.940> now<00:04:27.510> I<00:04:27.540> wasn't<00:04:28.020> taking<00:04:28.770> extreme

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
overheated now I wasn't taking extreme

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.400 
overheated now I wasn't taking extreme
caution<00:04:29.430> to<00:04:29.760> that<00:04:29.970> until<00:04:30.330> after<00:04:30.810> a<00:04:30.840> while

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
caution to that until after a while

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.860 
caution to that until after a while
so<00:04:31.830> after<00:04:32.400> a<00:04:32.430> while<00:04:32.490> I<00:04:32.610> show<00:04:32.940> off<00:04:33.000> my<00:04:33.090> iPad<00:04:33.690> and

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
so after a while I show off my iPad and

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.480 
so after a while I show off my iPad and
then<00:04:34.260> when<00:04:34.440> I<00:04:34.470> decided<00:04:34.830> to<00:04:34.950> do<00:04:35.010> this<00:04:35.100> video<00:04:35.280> I

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
then when I decided to do this video I

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.910 
then when I decided to do this video I
went<00:04:35.790> back<00:04:35.940> onto<00:04:36.180> the<00:04:36.570> black<00:04:36.900> photo<00:04:37.290> here<00:04:37.800> and

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
went back onto the black photo here and

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.830 
went back onto the black photo here and
I<00:04:38.370> noticed<00:04:38.820> that<00:04:39.060> there<00:04:39.210> was<00:04:39.360> a<00:04:39.420> lot<00:04:39.810> more

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
I noticed that there was a lot more

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.410 
I noticed that there was a lot more
screen<00:04:40.560> bleeding<00:04:40.950> so<00:04:41.400> that<00:04:41.550> points<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:42.150> kind

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
screen bleeding so that points the kind

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.270 
screen bleeding so that points the kind
of<00:04:42.480> more<00:04:42.720> of<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:42.900> fact<00:04:43.170> that<00:04:43.320> maybe<00:04:43.860> it<00:04:44.160> is

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
of more of the fact that maybe it is

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.220 
of more of the fact that maybe it is
caused<00:04:44.520> by<00:04:44.730> the<00:04:44.790> blue<00:04:45.030> because<00:04:45.540> when<00:04:45.960> my<00:04:46.110> I've

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
caused by the blue because when my I've

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.560 
caused by the blue because when my I've
had<00:04:46.410> too<00:04:46.560> got<00:04:46.710> overheated<00:04:47.130> maybe<00:04:47.850> it<00:04:48.090> caused

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
had too got overheated maybe it caused

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.490 
had too got overheated maybe it caused
some<00:04:49.020> of<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.140> glue<00:04:49.770> to<00:04:50.100> soften<00:04:50.580> or<00:04:51.150> dry<00:04:51.540> which

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
some of the glue to soften or dry which

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.560 
some of the glue to soften or dry which
then<00:04:52.770> caused<00:04:53.070> more<00:04:53.370> screaming<00:04:53.760> leading<00:04:54.120> so<00:04:54.540> I

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
then caused more screaming leading so I

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.090 
then caused more screaming leading so I
do<00:04:54.660> think<00:04:55.050> it<00:04:55.140> is<00:04:55.230> caused<00:04:55.470> by<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.650> glue<00:04:55.860> on<00:04:56.010> the

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
do think it is caused by the glue on the

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.160 
do think it is caused by the glue on the
iPad<00:04:56.430> -<00:04:56.610> we<00:04:57.120> didn't<00:04:57.300> comment<00:04:57.660> in<00:04:57.750> the<00:04:57.840> comments
