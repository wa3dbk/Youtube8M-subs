00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.330
 Good day dear friends with 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.900
 you and numbered and today we have such 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.320
 tutorial tutorial on the same 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:18.600
 customize your graphics card game hearth 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.400
 contra strike 1 6 yes well let's get started 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.670
 right click on the worker 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.570
 table and go to the control panel 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.119
 nvidia so wait for me 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.100
 will load 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:36.510
 we clean the basket immediately speak to me 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.210
 nvidia and so if you have some 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.600
 another video card immediately close i 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.579
 just gonna talk about n video so u 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.860
 we have this little window 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.960
 here it is video and tv and display and 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.180
 do not touch and go directly to the parameters 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.210
 3d 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:01:03.930
 Relay gurov shorter image setting 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:04.860
 and here we will of course stand on 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.080
 quality 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.720
 well by default on the idea if you never 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.780
 the court did not go and therefore I press everything 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.540
 the slider translates into performance 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.000
 press the button to apply and then 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.960
 go advanced settings 3d 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.140
 images go click and here 's 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.369
 all and the floor and so here is such a window 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.960
 we just can get who does not want 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.799
 listen just might pause 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.479
 all that copy and rest all 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.610
 but if you're interested, you can 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.119
 listen to 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:49.020
 first anisotropic optimization well she 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:53.549
 a strong role does not of course not include 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:57.299
 you and therefore you can make her 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.280
 included who is very weak he can 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.860
 of course and turn off anisotropic 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.490
 Optimization of the sample or the floor I Borki 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.799
 do not know 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:10.679
 then just like the optimization they 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:15.540
 not affected by anisotropic filtering we are 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:17.640
 not and brine 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.890
 and we do not touch it and hardware 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.590
 acceleration and also do not touch just 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.400
 skip vertical sync pulses 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.819
 can turn it off before turn it off 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.080
 scalable textures of choice of course 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.120
 same 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:37.470
 image setting is the most important 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.660
 important such parameter you will have 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.180
 default set to stand for the best 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.150
 quality and we change everything to the maximum 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.760
 performance you have 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.890
 the quality of course drops to 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.330
 performance but the quality is not so 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:57.209
 strongly and will go down on the floor 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:01.290
 extension restrictions turn off and on 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.659
 dodging about d also disable the parameters 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.060
 smoothing control from the application 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:09.250
 you will be smoothing transparency not 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.880
 turn off and referenced texture we 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.790
 Well, do not touch and optimization 3 linear and 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.830
 triple buffering we turn off of course 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.500
 I'm not so strong comp and therefore 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:24.180
 I almost all kun almost all functions 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.040
 disconnected but if you know what you have 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.410
 strong computer then you just can 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.209
 all put the keys and you will and 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.190
 quality is good 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.890
 performance you will just 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:41.200
 super push a button to apply and all 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:44.110
 we will have a good agassi push so 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.300
 now whether i will computer well and here in 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.100
 Basically, on video cards, I give you everything 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.330
 told and about 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:55.920
 from stim counter strike 1 6 is very 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.620
 important function click on our 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:03.130
 counter-strike push properties and 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:06.280
 set launch parameters 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.959
 run yes if you don't know what's up 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.370
 write something just do not write better 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.930
 write this command here if you 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.680
 Of course you do not see and the quality will be 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.810
 I'll write bad in the description 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:23.830
 what kind of command is this command lowers 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.930
 our fps and this is very important and important 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.540
 such 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:32.320
 such a parameter and here you can of course 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:35.260
 register both 100 and 50 but the most average 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:42.669
 sleep there and deliver a75 and therefore 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:47.229
 choose 75 apply and then another 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.740
 so check integrity or integrity 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.530
 cache 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:54.400
 please do it at least once 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:57.160
 week it will be very good even very 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.960
 helpful and caress with of course will not 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:05.000
 lag so close 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.340
 that's all dear friends if i am you 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.040
 I helped and I hope that I helped you 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.790
 subscribe put like call your 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:20.650
 friends leave your comments with 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:20.650
 you were your mouth all good luck all bye
