00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 Good day dear friends to visit 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.400
 viewers of my channel before dmitry smoke 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.529
 prime hundred this goodbye childhood 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.490
 just recently we had a figurine from 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.309
 lukey's a wine like that 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.789
 one figure is not enough to understand 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.699
 really worth this series or not 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:24.180
 so we have a company for 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.570
 venoma is rooted in carnage whatever you want about 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.029
 something also a symbiote derivative from here 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.000
 this here is the venome and inside carnage 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.739
 hiding good maniac killer 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.010
 venom company is not such a box 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.320
 somewhat different from the venom box 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.469
 but not very much in principle the same 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.600
 and drawn back well, about the same 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.879
 the most complete set seems to be waiting for us 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.969
 stand and the same red tentacles 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.489
 which the Chinese havetily made happy 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.160
 some inscriptions on the boxes themselves 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.469
 look and think whether they are suitable 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.809
 for a series about spiderman and cancer 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.650
 open the box in our box 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.260
 figure with stand and card card 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.650
 there are three of us and this time it's Korneevich 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.320
 this is already such a wine in my opinion 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.420
 and spidey new case has a place to be 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.549
 cards of exactly the same disgusting 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.890
 qualities may just get past 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.350
 Okay, that's not the point. 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.530
 the figure this time it is almost assembled 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.509
 the figure of us is red and painted 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.390
 black and white print 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.450
 what's that hole under the mouse carnage oh 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.759
 the guys in my Chinese surpassed themselves 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.549
 starting with the hands of the figure 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.490
 black despite the fact that she herself is red and 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.009
 okay it wouldn't be so shameful 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.350
 there is only one hand here 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.530
 and more and more no none well how is it 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.600
 so love well can you really not 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.070
 follow at least that face go in the box 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.710
 then really one hand we have 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.689
 one-handed carnage turned out great yes 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.090
 you open such a box you want a 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.360
 I will now assemble a cool figure 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.370
 I put in the collection go once and she 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.399
 no one hand maybe for that 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.350
 efforts with putting their sets by several 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.840
 arms that we we to other Chinese 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.910
 set them applied 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.520
 red plastic from this here rubber 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.650
 Circuits they look much worse than in 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.930
 black I do not know what it is 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.450
 Is the quality of the plastic worse ? 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.720
 either they simply could not have already finished these 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.850
 figures normal is fine with that 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.120
 what the last figure got from me 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.450
 solid 5 minus and here i'm not even 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.670
 I know what to say and listen as 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.280
 plastic quality shortage already in 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.380
 plus all the elite is the same worse prints 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.570
 less normal and but they are pretty 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.489
 simple just black color 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.930
 red everything is fine well frankly 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:54.690
 say the figurine disappointed me and 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.520
 probably have to continue to watch the series ok 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.980
 because this figure got five with 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.670
 minus and this i can put well 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.980
 maximum 4 minus too much 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.200
 books of the question that is, as I said 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.870
 If you order figures from China or 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.080
 buy somewhere they succeed know what 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.570
 somewhere 50 to 50 you get either 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.510
 something normal or marriage or 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.130
 incomplete but here it is 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.459
 ok, I will not be indulgent you 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.580
 you get a well-earned top three with you 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.190
 ok we'll figure it out well then with you 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.500
 was Dmitri demin about them orphan goodbye 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.060
 childhood hung themselves seen so what 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.060
 subscribe to the channel put like 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.980
 comment on the video and do not buy such 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.380
 here are toys and if you buy something 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.390
 check the kit is not all sellers but 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.060
 many will allow you to open the box and 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:49.049
 see what is inside everything is there 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.330
 in place for now tell me you so much 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.420
 time could kill a man book 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.670
 you know who he is and where he lives but 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.820
 why still haven't done it and 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:03.640
 every time you win wrecks and 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:07.010
 you go back with nothing 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.560
 you understand is not so simple if I kill 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.350
 where will I find another such 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.250
 the photographer in his pictures I get 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.250
