00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:10.690
 my name does not matter my work - little 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.990
 lost book but I find myself with 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.990
 others 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.370
 a book is like an island or sometimes like 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.470
 the impenetrable 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.010
 there are books that have the poison of a 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.080
 snake 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.180
 I could not specify how they got to my 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.480
 hands the tales of Horace's jungle 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.530
 Quiroga, but how did they separate me? 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.320
 time of my search 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.660
 Quiroga a man who knew missions 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.339
 as a photographer and was touched by the 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.250
 jungle returned to that adventurous entrepreneur 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:46.560
 colonizer 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.350
 they say that he repeatedly failed in 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.020
 his commercial attempts but it was the 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.150
 jungle same rebel make instrument 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.890
 for his wealth the one that gave him matter 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.830
 premium for its definitive constitution 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.920
 as a writer I was looking for a raw material 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:05.070
 and he found another one that fed his 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.080
 fantasies and his stories lived in a 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.440
 nature insurrected before the will 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.430
 human and he wrote that rebellion in 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.050
 some of the stories more 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.840
 Extraordinary Literature 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.700
 River Plate 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.369
 the stories of the jungles are stories 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.520
 designed for children in whom 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.909
 animals suffer are wrong establish 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.799
 alliances betray animals not 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.960
 they look like men for some 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.209
 successful domestication but that the 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.130
 traits that match them are those that 

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:37.729
 reveal in men their animal background 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.009
 rather they seem similar because they share 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.469
 psychic forces that travel all 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.750
 bond and everything I find a nature 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:46.880
 magnificent required these stories 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.000
 precise about passion madness and 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.000
 death 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.550
 That man if he wants 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.000
 he chose a good place to read 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.230
 coincidence 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.230
 because that book 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.440
 tales of the jungle like me from 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.460
 Horacio Quiroga and reading the war of 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.770
 the yacarés 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:20.060
 a group of yacarés 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:22.650
 who oppose civilization and win 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.900
 to a navy ship 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.900
 with the help of a 2 meter climb 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.420
 I want now was a kind of 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.420
 advanced ecologist that put the 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.330
 man and animals in nature 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.950
 as equals 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:46.160
 but I anticipated the confrontation 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.480
 tremendous that they were beginning to have 1918 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.110
 when he wrote these stories for his 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:55.210
 children and then that's where 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:59.300
 the yacarés see that the passage of some 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:01.340
 vapors will mean the end of your 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.630
 food to not have more fish if they decide 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:11.680
 face it and build a kind of dike 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:14.390
 with trees and east and clear the wing 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.090
 the company that sent the vapors 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.350
 sent a warship to suppress the 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.330
 strikes to get that out 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.100
 and I hope the yacarés face them 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.460
 face again and again they build 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.410
 bigger dams more solid but 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.080
 even the warship destroys them 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.940
 old they are reminded of an old surubí 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.040
 of two meters that has saved a 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.600
 torpedo of the Second World War to 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.720
 the first world war 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:46.080
 the surubí that solidarity is between 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:49.250
 species detonates the torpedo and sinks in the 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:53.160
 warship 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.410
 and the yacarés overcome that speed that 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.930
 have to animate the animals too 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.940
 they are in the giant turtle when 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.680
 listen to the man and immediately 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.080
 knows what your need is 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.580
 the turtle totally directly goes 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.580
 about him and he starts to heal 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.030
 I said goodbye to that man to continue 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.540
 my unsuccessful search books in between 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.540
 of the series 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.620
 Y
