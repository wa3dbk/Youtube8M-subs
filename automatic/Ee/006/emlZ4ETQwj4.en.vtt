on my previous video in the comments

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.290 
on my previous video in the comments
that<00:00:18.180> they'll<00:00:18.539> just<00:00:18.810> spawn<00:00:19.080> so<00:00:19.500> so<00:00:20.400> this<00:00:21.119> is

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
that they'll just spawn so so this is

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.240 
that they'll just spawn so so this is
like<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.810> bit<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:23.000> clarification<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:25.250> the

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
like a bit of a clarification and the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.820 
like a bit of a clarification and the
next<00:00:26.519> we<00:00:26.670> we<00:00:26.849> have<00:00:27.060> here<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:28.050> about<00:00:28.410> armor

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
next we we have here is is about armor

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.500 
next we we have here is is about armor
and<00:00:29.570> Iran<00:00:30.570> was<00:00:30.960> was<00:00:31.560> working<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.160> armor<00:00:33.120> g

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
and Iran was was working on the armor g

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.500 
and Iran was was working on the armor g
GUI<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.590> for<00:00:35.130> me<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.430> looks<00:00:35.610> pretty<00:00:35.760> nice<00:00:36.120> and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
GUI and for me it looks pretty nice and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.950 
GUI and for me it looks pretty nice and
you'll<00:00:36.719> see<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:38.010> picture<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.000> armor<00:00:39.690> here

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
you'll see a picture of the armor here

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.920 
you'll see a picture of the armor here
full<00:00:40.200> screen<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:41.399> basically<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:42.059> kind<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.420> like

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
full screen so basically is kind of like

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.920 
full screen so basically is kind of like
the<00:00:43.110> MC<00:00:43.440> um<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:44.129> minecraft<00:00:44.550> PC<00:00:44.969> version<00:00:45.570> but

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
the MC um the minecraft PC version but

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.430 
the MC um the minecraft PC version but
it's<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:47.340> guess<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.180> bit<00:00:48.360> different<00:00:48.930> than

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
it's a I guess it's a bit different than

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.189 
it's a I guess it's a bit different than
the<00:00:49.559> pc<00:00:49.980> version<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.670> that's<00:00:51.360> how<00:00:51.539> armor<00:00:51.960> looks

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
the pc version so that's how armor looks

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.560 
the pc version so that's how armor looks
like<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.620> zero<00:00:52.860> point<00:00:53.070> six<00:00:53.250> point<00:00:53.520> zero

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
like in zero point six point zero

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.620 
like in zero point six point zero
next<00:00:56.020> we<00:00:56.200> have<00:00:56.470> here<00:00:56.739> is<00:00:57.070> I<00:00:57.610> guess<00:00:58.030> a<00:00:58.060> new<00:00:58.360> block

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
next we have here is I guess a new block

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.470 
next we have here is I guess a new block
for<00:00:58.870> mcpe<00:00:59.380> zero<00:01:00.340> point<00:01:00.550> six<00:01:00.670> point<00:01:00.940> zero<00:01:01.030> it's

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
for mcpe zero point six point zero it's

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.720 
for mcpe zero point six point zero it's
a<00:01:01.960> new<00:01:02.110> stone<00:01:02.350> cutter<00:01:02.590> and<00:01:02.890> it<00:01:03.040> says<00:01:03.250> here<00:01:03.489> it's

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
a new stone cutter and it says here it's

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.430 
a new stone cutter and it says here it's
a<00:01:03.850> decorated<00:01:04.449> block<00:01:04.660> used<00:01:04.930> to<00:01:05.019> create<00:01:05.229> other

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
a decorated block used to create other

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.950 
a decorated block used to create other
kinds<00:01:05.920> of<00:01:06.040> quartz<00:01:06.850> block<00:01:07.090> I'm<00:01:07.300> not<00:01:07.479> sure<00:01:07.660> what

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
kinds of quartz block I'm not sure what

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.820 
kinds of quartz block I'm not sure what
this<00:01:08.080> is<00:01:08.140> a<00:01:08.410> block<00:01:09.250> will<00:01:09.490> exactly<00:01:10.150> do<00:01:10.619> but<00:01:11.619> just

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
this is a block will exactly do but just

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.320 
this is a block will exactly do but just
tell<00:01:11.979> me<00:01:12.010> in<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.190> comments<00:01:12.640> it<00:01:12.790> could<00:01:13.119> be<00:01:13.300> a
