in<00:00:01.790> imaginary<00:00:02.790> numbers<00:00:03.149> or<00:00:03.330> complex<00:00:03.750> numbers

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:04.370 
in imaginary numbers or complex numbers

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.720 
in imaginary numbers or complex numbers
we<00:00:05.370> like<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.700> have<00:00:05.879> things<00:00:06.120> in<00:00:07.130> the<00:00:08.130> form<00:00:08.429> of<00:00:08.519> a

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
we like to have things in the form of a

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.890 
we like to have things in the form of a
+<00:00:09.000> bi<00:00:09.500> which<00:00:10.500> means<00:00:10.830> some<00:00:11.400> number<00:00:11.820> let's<00:00:12.780> call

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
+ bi which means some number let's call

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.440 
+ bi which means some number let's call
it<00:00:13.110> with<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.259> circle<00:00:13.650> around<00:00:13.710> it<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.450> another

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
it with a circle around it and another

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.099 
it with a circle around it and another
number<00:00:15.719> like<00:00:16.260> with<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.500> square<00:00:16.800> around<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.310> I

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:18.109 
number like with the square around it I

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.700 
number like with the square around it I
so<00:00:19.109> these<00:00:19.410> two<00:00:19.710> are<00:00:19.859> regular<00:00:20.250> old<00:00:20.430> numbers<00:00:20.850> and

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
so these two are regular old numbers and

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.700 
so these two are regular old numbers and
I<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.769> your<00:00:23.130> little<00:00:23.340> imaginary<00:00:23.939> number<00:00:24.240> so

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
I is your little imaginary number so

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.820 
I is your little imaginary number so
this<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.949> your<00:00:26.160> standard<00:00:26.820> nice<00:00:27.390> form<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.439> an

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
this is your standard nice form of an

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.609 
this is your standard nice form of an
imaginary<00:00:29.369> or<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> complex<00:00:30.090> number<00:00:30.619> so

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
imaginary or a complex number so

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.549 
imaginary or a complex number so
something<00:00:32.070> like<00:00:32.120> 3<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.390> over<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.380> minus<00:00:34.829> 2<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:36.559> as

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
something like 3 I over I minus 2 is as

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.910 
something like 3 I over I minus 2 is as
a<00:00:37.620> rebel<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.219> not<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.899> right<00:00:40.079> form<00:00:40.500> he

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
a rebel is not in the right form he

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.330 
a rebel is not in the right form he
needs<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.309> be<00:00:41.460> molded<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.149> brainwashed<00:00:43.340> so

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
needs to be molded and brainwashed so

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.369 
needs to be molded and brainwashed so
how<00:00:44.520> do<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.730> get<00:00:44.910> there<00:00:45.239> well<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.200> can

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
how do you get there well you can

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.610 
how do you get there well you can
multiply<00:00:46.620> by<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:48.420> conjugate<00:00:48.750> over<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
multiply by the conjugate over the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.040 
multiply by the conjugate over the
conjugate<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.760> bottom<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.570> people<00:00:51.870> say

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
conjugate of the bottom so people say

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.330 
conjugate of the bottom so people say
multiply<00:00:52.469> by<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.649> conjugate<00:00:52.860> well<00:00:53.250> you're

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
multiply by the conjugate well you're

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.319 
multiply by the conjugate well you're
not<00:00:53.430> really<00:00:53.579> multiplying<00:00:54.059> by<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.239> conjugate

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
not really multiplying by the conjugate

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.979 
not really multiplying by the conjugate
you're<00:00:54.899> multiplying<00:00:55.260> by<00:00:56.180> a<00:00:57.180> clever<00:00:57.750> form<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.500> 1

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
you're multiplying by a clever form of 1

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.020 
you're multiplying by a clever form of 1
so<00:01:00.989> you've<00:01:01.289> got<00:01:01.520> because<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.640> can<00:01:02.789> multiply

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
so you've got because you can multiply

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.759 
so you've got because you can multiply
anything<00:01:03.420> by<00:01:03.600> 1<00:01:03.930> all<00:01:04.110> day<00:01:04.290> long<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.680> nothing

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
anything by 1 all day long and nothing

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.990 
anything by 1 all day long and nothing
changes<00:01:05.990> so<00:01:06.990> I'm<00:01:07.110> going<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.260> multiply<00:01:07.799> by<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
changes so I'm going to multiply by the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.390 
changes so I'm going to multiply by the
conjugate<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:12.080> the<00:01:13.080> bottom<00:01:13.470> over<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
conjugate of the bottom over the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.070 
conjugate of the bottom over the
conjugate<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.060> bottom<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.570> since<00:01:15.869> it's

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
conjugate of the bottom and since it's

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.499 
conjugate of the bottom and since it's
really<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.710> 1<00:01:17.100> I'm<00:01:17.520> not<00:01:17.759> changing<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.450> value

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
really a 1 I'm not changing this value

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.660 
really a 1 I'm not changing this value
I'm<00:01:19.170> just<00:01:19.380> changing<00:01:19.619> what<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> value<00:01:20.340> looks

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
I'm just changing what the value looks

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.580 
I'm just changing what the value looks
like<00:01:21.259> so<00:01:22.259> now<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.439> have<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.890> do<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.159> arithmetic

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
like so now I have to do the arithmetic

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.819 
like so now I have to do the arithmetic
so<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.650> need<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.920> distribute<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.700> guy<00:01:27.799> so<00:01:28.799> I

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
so I need to distribute this guy so I

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.789 
so I need to distribute this guy so I
have<00:01:28.979> 3i<00:01:29.340> squared<00:01:31.759> plus<00:01:32.990> 6i

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
have 3i squared plus 6i

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.630 
have 3i squared plus 6i
and<00:01:36.250> of<00:01:36.549> course<00:01:36.789> here<00:01:37.000> we<00:01:37.119> would<00:01:37.270> have<00:01:37.689> to<00:01:37.840> do

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
and of course here we would have to do

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.200 
and of course here we would have to do
this<00:01:39.640> one

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
this one

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.330 
this one
so<00:01:40.780> have<00:01:40.960> I<00:01:41.170> squared<00:01:42.539> plus<00:01:43.539> 2i<00:01:44.049> if<00:01:44.770> you<00:01:44.950> foil

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
so have I squared plus 2i if you foil

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.690 
so have I squared plus 2i if you foil
great<00:01:46.060> I<00:01:46.450> never<00:01:46.840> understood<00:01:47.350> foil<00:01:47.710> myself<00:01:48.280> I

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
great I never understood foil myself I

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.859 
great I never understood foil myself I
got<00:01:49.630> confused<00:01:49.899> as<00:01:50.560> to<00:01:50.590> what<00:01:50.859> each<00:01:51.069> of<00:01:51.250> a<00:01:51.340> mint

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
got confused as to what each of a mint

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.590 
got confused as to what each of a mint
so<00:01:52.869> this<00:01:53.020> is<00:01:53.200> minus<00:01:53.649> 2<00:01:54.069> I<00:01:54.450> plus<00:01:55.679> 4<00:01:57.240> notice<00:01:58.240> this

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
so this is minus 2 I plus 4 notice this

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.179 
so this is minus 2 I plus 4 notice this
is<00:01:58.810> specifically<00:01:59.649> designed<00:02:00.280> to<00:02:01.950> make<00:02:02.950> this

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
is specifically designed to make this

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.969 
is specifically designed to make this
bow<00:02:03.490> move<00:02:03.850> oof<00:02:04.240> that's<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.439> cool<00:02:05.649> thing<00:02:05.950> about

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
bow move oof that's the cool thing about

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.600 
bow move oof that's the cool thing about
conjugates<00:02:06.729> so<00:02:07.390> you<00:02:07.450> can<00:02:07.659> poof<00:02:07.929> away<00:02:08.229> stuff<00:02:08.610> 3

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
conjugates so you can poof away stuff 3

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.449 
conjugates so you can poof away stuff 3
I<00:02:10.179> squared<00:02:10.569> is<00:02:11.079> negative<00:02:11.110> 1<00:02:11.500> so<00:02:12.099> this<00:02:12.250> is

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
I squared is negative 1 so this is

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.039 
I squared is negative 1 so this is
negative<00:02:12.790> 3<00:02:13.590> plus<00:02:14.590> 6i<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:15.900> squared<00:02:16.900> is<00:02:17.019> negative

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
negative 3 plus 6i I squared is negative

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:22.470 
negative 3 plus 6i I squared is negative
1<00:02:17.410> so<00:02:17.739> this<00:02:17.829> is<00:02:18.010> negative<00:02:18.190> 1<00:02:18.579> plus<00:02:19.120> 4<00:02:21.269> so<00:02:22.269> I<00:02:22.299> have

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
1 so this is negative 1 plus 4 so I have

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.819 
1 so this is negative 1 plus 4 so I have
negative<00:02:22.720> 3<00:02:23.260> plus<00:02:23.650> 6i<00:02:24.840> over<00:02:25.840> 3

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
negative 3 plus 6i over 3

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:30.990 
negative 3 plus 6i over 3
oh<00:02:26.860> how<00:02:27.819> sweet<00:02:27.880> is<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:29.200> so<00:02:29.920> taking<00:02:30.640> it<00:02:30.760> over

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
oh how sweet is that so taking it over

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.860 
oh how sweet is that so taking it over
here<00:02:31.420> I<00:02:31.599> can<00:02:32.230> do<00:02:32.349> negative<00:02:32.769> 3<00:02:33.040> over<00:02:33.069> 3<00:02:33.390> plus<00:02:34.390> 6

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
here I can do negative 3 over 3 plus 6

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.699 
here I can do negative 3 over 3 plus 6
over<00:02:35.500> 3<00:02:35.739> I<00:02:36.629> careful<00:02:37.629> this<00:02:37.900> because<00:02:38.260> this<00:02:38.470> guy

over 3 I careful this because this guy

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.509 
over 3 I careful this because this guy
has<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.370> go<00:02:39.700> underneath<00:02:40.180> each<00:02:40.630> piece
