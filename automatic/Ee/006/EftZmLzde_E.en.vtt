and I will be showing you largest to
smallest<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.690> the<00:00:33.690> first<00:00:34.440> thing<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:35.130> this

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
smallest so the first thing is this

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.180 
smallest so the first thing is this
companion<00:00:36.510> cube<00:00:36.870> from<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.649> video<00:00:37.980> game

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
companion cube from the video game

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.100 
companion cube from the video game
portal<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:40.010> I<00:00:41.010> got<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.340> pattern<00:00:41.610> on

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
portal and I got the pattern on

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.330 
portal and I got the pattern on
Instructables<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> website<00:00:44.219> for<00:00:44.550> nerds

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
Instructables it is a website for nerds

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.560 
Instructables it is a website for nerds
so<00:00:47.840> this<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.920> 3d<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.879> hollow

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
so this is it it is 3d it is hollow

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:00.260 
so this is it it is 3d it is hollow
inside<00:00:53.149> so<00:00:54.149> there's<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.879> then<00:00:59.270> my

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
inside so there's that and then my

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.490 
inside so there's that and then my
friend<00:01:00.809> Kevin<00:01:02.090> likes<00:01:03.090> Chrono<00:01:03.600> Trigger<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:04.439> I

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
friend Kevin likes Chrono Trigger so I

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.250 
friend Kevin likes Chrono Trigger so I
mean<00:01:04.710> him<00:01:04.920> chrono<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:06.270> bits<00:01:06.479> between<00:01:06.990> his

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
mean him chrono and the bits between his

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.179 
mean him chrono and the bits between his
arms<00:01:07.530> are<00:01:08.130> see-through<00:01:09.439> so<00:01:10.439> it's<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.770> game

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
arms are see-through so it's a game

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.830 
arms are see-through so it's a game
sprite<00:01:11.670> from<00:01:11.880> Chrono<00:01:12.330> Trigger<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:13.460> then<00:01:14.460> I

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
you can't really tell what that'd be

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.160 
you can't really tell what that'd be
colors<00:03:42.269> different<00:03:42.660> from<00:03:42.780> that<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.109> that's

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
colors different from that and that's

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.590 
colors different from that and that's
the<00:03:43.410> lip<00:03:43.560> for<00:03:43.799> me<00:03:43.889> drink<00:03:44.160> from<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:44.609> then<00:03:45.329> on

the lip for me drink from and then on

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.410 
the lip for me drink from and then on
the<00:03:45.840> bottom<00:03:46.230> is<00:03:46.889> the<00:03:47.220> words<00:03:47.430> ramen<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.150> and

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
kanji and it hangs like that so there's

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.789 
kanji and it hangs like that so there's
that<00:03:55.880> and<00:03:57.260> then<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:59.840> made<00:04:00.840> a<00:04:00.870> brown<00:04:01.200> mustache

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.120 
that and then I made a brown mustache
which<00:04:02.130> will<00:04:02.310> be<00:04:02.400> a<00:04:02.430> necklace<00:04:02.850> and<00:04:03.590> a<00:04:04.590> pastel

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
you know that way as well and then this

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.370 
you know that way as well and then this
I<00:04:22.460> made<00:04:22.640> from<00:04:22.940> generally<00:04:23.450> my<00:04:23.570> own<00:04:23.690> design<00:04:24.050> but

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
I made from generally my own design but

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.540 
I made from generally my own design but
it's<00:04:24.680> pretty<00:04:25.430> easy<00:04:26.030> to<00:04:26.180> copy<00:04:26.540> it<00:04:27.140> is<00:04:27.590> a<00:04:27.620> sea

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
it's pretty easy to copy it is a sea

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.430 
it's pretty easy to copy it is a sea
salt<00:04:28.730> ice<00:04:29.000> cream<00:04:29.270> with<00:04:29.480> a<00:04:29.510> paopu<00:04:29.720> fruit<00:04:29.930> at<00:04:30.410> the

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
salt ice cream with a paopu fruit at the

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.560 
salt ice cream with a paopu fruit at the
bottom<00:04:30.530> that<00:04:31.220> dangles<00:04:31.580> and<00:04:31.790> I'm<00:04:32.390> actually

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
bottom that dangles and I'm actually

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.890 
bottom that dangles and I'm actually
thinking<00:04:32.900> of<00:04:33.170> making<00:04:33.410> a<00:04:33.770> sora<00:04:34.160> head<00:04:34.810> kind<00:04:35.810> of

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
thinking of making a sora head kind of

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.500 
thinking of making a sora head kind of
like<00:04:36.020> a<00:04:36.050> Scott<00:04:36.440> head<00:04:36.710> to<00:04:36.980> hang<00:04:37.330> off<00:04:38.330> of<00:04:38.390> it<00:04:39.220> and

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
like a Scott head to hang off of it and

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.150 
like a Scott head to hang off of it and
then<00:04:41.650> lastly<00:04:42.650> I<00:04:43.210> will<00:04:44.210> be<00:04:44.330> making<00:04:45.160> tutorials
