hey<00:00:08.010> there<00:00:08.250> cement<00:00:08.639> with<00:00:08.790> Ubu<00:00:09.059> I'm<00:00:09.840> going<00:00:10.139> to

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
hey there cement with Ubu I'm going to

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.600 
hey there cement with Ubu I'm going to
show<00:00:10.320> you<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.620> basic<00:00:10.980> movements<00:00:11.400> of<00:00:11.519> the

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
show you the basic movements of the

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.010 
show you the basic movements of the
tilt-shift<00:00:11.849> buns<00:00:12.210> so<00:00:13.049> here<00:00:13.200> we<00:00:13.290> go<00:00:14.450> this<00:00:15.450> knob

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
tilt-shift buns so here we go this knob

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.140 
tilt-shift buns so here we go this knob
right<00:00:16.199> here<00:00:16.400> controls<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.520> shift<00:00:17.760> function

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
right here controls the shift function

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.150 
right here controls the shift function
on<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.539> lens<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.050> all<00:00:19.289> we<00:00:19.410> do<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.560> turn<00:00:19.949> that

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
on the lens and all we do is turn that

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.540 
on the lens and all we do is turn that
knob<00:00:20.449> we<00:00:21.449> can<00:00:21.600> move<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.840> up<00:00:22.160> where<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.310> can<00:00:23.430> move

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
knob we can move it up where we can move

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.130 
knob we can move it up where we can move
it<00:00:23.670> down<00:00:26.300> so<00:00:27.300> put<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:27.599> back<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.109> zero

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
it down so put that back to zero

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.910 
it down so put that back to zero
position<00:00:29.000> this<00:00:30.000> bigger<00:00:30.660> knob<00:00:30.900> here<00:00:31.349> controls

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
position this bigger knob here controls

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.030 
position this bigger knob here controls
tilt<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.669> we<00:00:33.540> can<00:00:33.660> also<00:00:33.780> move<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:34.890> this

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
tilt and we can also move that so this

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.920 
tilt and we can also move that so this
lens<00:00:35.280> goes<00:00:35.790> up<00:00:36.090> or<00:00:36.930> down<00:00:37.730> here<00:00:38.730> we<00:00:38.879> go<00:00:38.969> back<00:00:39.180> up

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.940 

and<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:43.170> can<00:00:43.320> put<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.620> back<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.789> zero<00:00:45.770> so<00:00:46.770> let's

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
and we can put it back to zero so let's

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.700 
and we can put it back to zero so let's
look<00:00:47.070> at<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.309> tilt<00:00:47.520> function<00:00:47.969> first<00:00:48.559> we<00:00:49.559> can

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
look at the tilt function first we can

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.220 
look at the tilt function first we can
tilt<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.039> lens<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.239> goes<00:00:51.329> down<00:00:51.600> all

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
tilt the lens so that it goes down all

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.470 
tilt the lens so that it goes down all
the<00:00:52.410> way<00:00:52.760> or<00:00:53.760> we<00:00:53.879> can<00:00:54.030> tilt<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.420> lens<00:00:54.449> up<00:00:56.480> and

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
the way or we can tilt the lens up and

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.299 
the way or we can tilt the lens up and
we<00:00:57.930> can<00:00:58.079> also<00:00:58.260> rotate<00:00:59.210> the<00:01:00.210> lens<00:01:01.100> so<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.129> we

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
we can also rotate the lens so that we

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.850 
we can also rotate the lens so that we
can<00:01:02.430> then<00:01:02.579> tilt<00:01:03.019> into<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.170> different<00:01:04.439> plane<00:01:04.619> now

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
can then tilt into a different plane now

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.630 
can then tilt into a different plane now
we're<00:01:05.040> tilting<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.729> side<00:01:06.229> and<00:01:07.520> here<00:01:08.520> we're

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
we're tilting to the side and here we're

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.160 
we're tilting to the side and here we're
tilting<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.780> other<00:01:09.960> side<00:01:12.080> what<00:01:13.080> about

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
tilting to the other side what about

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.820 
tilting to the other side what about
shift<00:01:13.619> well<00:01:14.549> let's<00:01:14.820> look<00:01:14.939> at<00:01:15.090> shift<00:01:15.590> so<00:01:16.590> we<00:01:16.619> can

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
shift well let's look at shift so we can

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.700 
shift well let's look at shift so we can
shift<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.310> lens<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.659> entire<00:01:18.900> lens<00:01:19.229> moves

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
shift the lens so the entire lens moves

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.120 
shift the lens so the entire lens moves
down<00:01:20.689> or<00:01:21.689> we<00:01:21.840> can<00:01:21.960> shift<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.259> lens<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:23.009> it

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
down or we can shift the lens so it

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.260 
down or we can shift the lens so it
moves<00:01:23.430> up<00:01:24.950> then<00:01:25.950> we<00:01:26.070> can<00:01:26.189> still<00:01:26.460> rotate<00:01:26.790> the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
moves up then we can still rotate the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.580 
moves up then we can still rotate the
lens

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.929 

and<00:01:33.890> then<00:01:34.340> we<00:01:34.520> can<00:01:34.700> shift<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.149> lens<00:01:36.820> to<00:01:37.820> the

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
and then we can shift the lens to the

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.170 
and then we can shift the lens to the
right<00:01:38.210> there<00:01:39.200> we<00:01:39.320> go

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
right there we go

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.560 
right there we go
or<00:01:41.180> to<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.170> left<00:01:42.939> another<00:01:43.939> interesting

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
or to the left another interesting

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.819 
or to the left another interesting
movement<00:01:44.750> that<00:01:45.049> you<00:01:45.140> can<00:01:45.289> do<00:01:45.409> with<00:01:45.530> a<00:01:45.619> tilt

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
movement that you can do with a tilt

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.100 
movement that you can do with a tilt
shift<00:01:45.890> lens<00:01:46.130> is<00:01:46.549> actually<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:47.600> put<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.930> lens

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
shift lens is actually to put the lens

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.990 
shift lens is actually to put the lens
on<00:01:48.259> a<00:01:48.289> diagonal<00:01:48.710> so<00:01:49.340> let's<00:01:49.490> try<00:01:49.670> that<00:01:49.700> with

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
on a diagonal so let's try that with

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.669 
on a diagonal so let's try that with
tilt

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
tilt

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.550 
tilt
here's<00:01:51.679> tilt<00:01:52.600> tilt<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.780> lens<00:01:53.960> just<00:01:54.080> a<00:01:54.350> little

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
here's tilt tilt the lens just a little

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.590 
here's tilt tilt the lens just a little
bit<00:01:54.679> so<00:01:54.799> it's<00:01:54.950> out<00:01:55.039> of<00:01:55.070> diagonal<00:01:55.429> and<00:01:56.390> now<00:01:56.539> we

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
bit so it's out of diagonal and now we

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.219 
bit so it's out of diagonal and now we
can<00:01:56.929> tilt<00:01:57.500> into<00:01:57.799> a<00:01:58.360> plane<00:01:59.360> that<00:01:59.659> is<00:01:59.750> actually

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
can tilt into a plane that is actually

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.419 
can tilt into a plane that is actually
added<00:02:00.649> diagonal<00:02:01.159> to<00:02:01.460> our<00:02:01.549> camera<00:02:03.070> so<00:02:04.070> before

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
added diagonal to our camera so before

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.190 
added diagonal to our camera so before
we<00:02:04.549> can<00:02:04.700> use<00:02:04.759> shift<00:02:05.179> and<00:02:05.479> tilt<00:02:05.659> on<00:02:05.840> our<00:02:05.990> tilt

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
we can use shift and tilt on our tilt

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.139 
we can use shift and tilt on our tilt
shift<00:02:06.259> lens<00:02:06.470> we<00:02:07.159> have<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.490> make<00:02:07.640> sure<00:02:07.819> that

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
shift lens we have to make sure that

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.729 
shift lens we have to make sure that
those<00:02:08.330> functions<00:02:08.810> aren't<00:02:08.989> actually<00:02:09.440> locked

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
those functions aren't actually locked

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.160 
those functions aren't actually locked
and<00:02:10.009> these<00:02:10.670> two<00:02:10.910> levers<00:02:11.180> right<00:02:11.390> here<00:02:11.900> these

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
and these two levers right here these

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.370 
and these two levers right here these
two<00:02:12.350> knobs<00:02:12.530> control<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.790> lock<00:02:14.030> on<00:02:14.330> shift<00:02:15.110> and

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
two knobs control the lock on shift and

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.420 
two knobs control the lock on shift and
a<00:02:15.890> lock<00:02:16.100> on<00:02:16.340> tilt<00:02:16.760> respectively<00:02:17.620> so<00:02:18.620> if<00:02:19.250> we

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
a lock on tilt respectively so if we

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.850 
a lock on tilt respectively so if we
were<00:02:19.549> to<00:02:19.760> use<00:02:19.910> our<00:02:20.090> tilt<00:02:20.599> function<00:02:20.780> make<00:02:21.709> sure

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
were to use our tilt function make sure

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.809 
were to use our tilt function make sure
this<00:02:21.980> is<00:02:22.160> loose<00:02:22.370> then<00:02:23.090> we<00:02:23.330> can<00:02:23.510> tilt<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.110> lens

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
this is loose then we can tilt the lens

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.800 
this is loose then we can tilt the lens
you<00:02:25.819> want<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.060> make<00:02:26.180> sure<00:02:26.209> they<00:02:26.540> let<00:02:26.690> you

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
you want to make sure they let you

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.900 
you want to make sure they let you
actually<00:02:26.959> lock<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.769> lens<00:02:27.980> at<00:02:28.190> that<00:02:28.489> degree<00:02:28.819> of

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
actually lock the lens at that degree of

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.000 
actually lock the lens at that degree of
tilt<00:02:29.090> otherwise<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.930> lens<00:02:30.110> might<00:02:30.380> slip<00:02:30.739> and

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
tilt otherwise the lens might slip and

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.430 
tilt otherwise the lens might slip and
you<00:02:31.519> would<00:02:31.880> have<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.060> ruined<00:02:32.540> composition<00:02:33.110> we

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
you would have a ruined composition we

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.949 
you would have a ruined composition we
don't<00:02:33.590> want<00:02:33.709> that<00:02:33.830> so<00:02:34.430> let's<00:02:34.750> make<00:02:35.750> sure<00:02:35.780> we

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
don't want that so let's make sure we

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.840 
don't want that so let's make sure we
lock<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.530> lens<00:02:36.739> and<00:02:37.040> then<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:37.790> won't<00:02:37.910> move<00:02:38.709> if

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
lock the lens and then it won't move if

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.699 
lock the lens and then it won't move if
we<00:02:40.850> want<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.180> change<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.989> planes<00:02:42.350> that<00:02:42.590> were

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
we want to change the planes that were

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.340 
we want to change the planes that were
shifting<00:02:43.160> and<00:02:43.310> tilting<00:02:43.670> into<00:02:43.970> these<00:02:44.959> are<00:02:45.230> the

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
shifting and tilting into these are the

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.470 
shifting and tilting into these are the
release<00:02:45.680> levers<00:02:46.130> that<00:02:46.310> we<00:02:46.400> use<00:02:46.549> to<00:02:46.730> do<00:02:46.850> that<00:02:47.060> so

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
release levers that we use to do that so

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.180 
release levers that we use to do that so
this<00:02:47.630> is<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.840> release<00:02:48.230> lever<00:02:48.470> that<00:02:48.739> changes

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
this is the release lever that changes

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.720 
this is the release lever that changes
shift<00:02:49.850> and<00:02:50.200> this<00:02:51.200> is<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.500> release<00:02:51.769> lever<00:02:52.010> that

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
shift and this is the release lever that

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.009 
shift and this is the release lever that
changes<00:02:53.209> tilt<00:02:54.819> now<00:02:55.819> a<00:02:55.850> good<00:02:56.120> workflow<00:02:56.600> before

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
changes tilt now a good workflow before

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.780 
changes tilt now a good workflow before
you<00:02:57.079> put<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.410> lens<00:02:57.590> away<00:02:57.769> is<00:02:58.160> to<00:02:58.609> make<00:02:58.760> sure

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
you put the lens away is to make sure

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.470 
you put the lens away is to make sure
that<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.269> lens<00:02:59.480> is<00:03:00.069> set<00:03:01.069> back<00:03:01.310> to<00:03:01.579> its<00:03:01.730> neutral

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
that the lens is set back to its neutral

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.690 
that the lens is set back to its neutral
position<00:03:02.959> so<00:03:03.590> if<00:03:03.680> we<00:03:03.799> look<00:03:03.980> at<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.220> degrees<00:03:04.549> of

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
position so if we look at the degrees of

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.360 
position so if we look at the degrees of
tilt<00:03:04.880> on<00:03:05.359> shift<00:03:05.750> degrees<00:03:06.410> of<00:03:06.620> tilt<00:03:06.859> here<00:03:07.190> on

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
tilt on shift degrees of tilt here on

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.520 
tilt on shift degrees of tilt here on
the<00:03:07.489> tilt<00:03:07.730> side<00:03:07.940> and<00:03:08.299> the<00:03:08.840> degrees<00:03:09.139> of<00:03:09.290> shift

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
the tilt side and the degrees of shift

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.140 
the tilt side and the degrees of shift
want<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.310> make<00:03:10.400> sure<00:03:10.430> that<00:03:10.639> the<00:03:10.790> two<00:03:10.940> long

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
want to make sure that the two long

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.229 
want to make sure that the two long
lines<00:03:11.450> are<00:03:11.989> lined<00:03:12.290> up<00:03:13.420> so<00:03:14.420> unlock<00:03:15.109> that<00:03:16.239> tilt

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
lines are lined up so unlock that tilt

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.069 
lines are lined up so unlock that tilt
down<00:03:17.480> lock<00:03:18.470> the<00:03:19.280> tilt<00:03:19.549> function<00:03:19.780> shift<00:03:20.780> is<00:03:20.930> all

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
down lock the tilt function shift is all

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.140 
down lock the tilt function shift is all
good<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:21.590> one<00:03:22.190> final<00:03:22.459> thing<00:03:22.579> we<00:03:22.790> want<00:03:22.940> to<00:03:23.030> make

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
good and one final thing we want to make

sure that we do is engage the lock that

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.840 
sure that we do is engage the lock that
locks<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:26.959> entire<00:03:27.200> lens<00:03:27.380> this<00:03:27.620> way<00:03:27.829> the<00:03:28.549> lens

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
locks the entire lens this way the lens

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.500 
locks the entire lens this way the lens
won't<00:03:29.120> move<00:03:29.329> in<00:03:29.810> our<00:03:29.989> camera<00:03:30.230> bag
