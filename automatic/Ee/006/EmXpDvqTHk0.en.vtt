14<00:00:38.140> however<00:00:38.620> the<00:00:38.739> way<00:00:38.860> that<00:00:39.010> it<00:00:39.100> looks<00:00:39.129> now

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
14 however the way that it looks now

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.430 
14 however the way that it looks now
they<00:00:40.030> probably<00:00:40.300> will<00:00:40.719> not<00:00:40.840> be<00:00:41.020> coming<00:00:41.320> until

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
they probably will not be coming until

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.770 
they probably will not be coming until
the<00:00:41.770> next<00:00:42.010> coming<00:00:42.490> update<00:00:42.760> after<00:00:42.910> that<00:00:43.240> which

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
the next coming update after that which

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.560 
the next coming update after that which
will<00:00:43.930> likely<00:00:44.110> be<00:00:44.500> 2<00:00:44.800> u16<00:00:45.160> because<00:00:45.790> tu<00:00:46.030> 15<00:00:46.390> is

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
will likely be 2 u16 because tu 15 is

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.960 
will likely be 2 u16 because tu 15 is
almost<00:00:47.200> guaranteed<00:00:47.470> going<00:00:48.130> to<00:00:48.220> be<00:00:48.340> a<00:00:48.370> bug<00:00:48.730> fix

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.260 
this is to show it in a real world
application<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.610> let's<00:01:30.850> go<00:01:30.970> ahead<00:01:31.000> and

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
application so let's go ahead and

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.820 
application so let's go ahead and
pretend<00:01:31.540> for<00:01:31.900> a<00:01:31.990> moment<00:01:32.110> that<00:01:32.350> you<00:01:32.530> were<00:01:32.619> able

went ahead and you built a house and you
only<00:02:41.940> wanted<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.390> have<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.570> floor<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:42.930> was<00:02:43.170> one

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
only wanted to have a floor that was one

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.770 
only wanted to have a floor that was one
thick<00:02:43.710> but<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.520> didn't<00:02:44.850> want<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.180> ceiling<00:02:45.660> of

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780

thick but you didn't want the ceiling of
the<00:02:45.990> floor<00:02:46.260> below<00:02:46.710> your<00:02:46.950> second<00:02:47.340> floor<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:48.240> be

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
the floor below your second floor to be

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.990 
the floor below your second floor to be
like<00:02:48.810> red<00:02:49.140> so<00:02:49.740> you<00:02:49.800> can<00:02:50.040> still<00:02:50.250> put<00:02:50.520> carpet<00:02:50.790> on

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
like red so you can still put carpet on

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.760 
like red so you can still put carpet on
top<00:02:51.270> of<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.600> whatever<00:02:52.050> like<00:02:52.260> building<00:02:52.590> block

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
top of the whatever like building block

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.860 
top of the whatever like building block
you<00:02:52.890> had<00:02:53.040> like<00:02:53.190> wood<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:54.300> could<00:02:54.480> not<00:02:54.630> have

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
you had like wood and you could not have

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.690 
you had like wood and you could not have
a<00:02:54.900> ceiling<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.320> was<00:02:55.410> red<00:02:55.770> and<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:56.340> realize

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
a ceiling that was red and I realize

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.920 
a ceiling that was red and I realize
that's<00:02:56.820> kind<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.150> difficult<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.510> understand

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
that's kind of difficult to understand

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.210 
that's kind of difficult to understand
so<00:02:58.050> let<00:02:58.140> me<00:02:58.200> go<00:02:58.320> ahead<00:02:58.350> and<00:02:58.500> construct<00:02:58.920> it<00:02:59.040> here

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
so let me go ahead and construct it here

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.740 
so let me go ahead and construct it here

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
here's what I was trying to describe

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.680 
here's what I was trying to describe
pretend<00:03:02.580> here<00:03:02.790> for<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.000> minute<00:03:03.210> that<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:03.510> are

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
pretend here for a minute that you are

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.350 
pretend here for a minute that you are
on<00:03:03.900> like<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.350> bottom<00:03:04.620> floor<00:03:05.130> of<00:03:05.160> a<00:03:05.370> house<00:03:05.580> when

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
on like the bottom floor of a house when

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.000 
on like the bottom floor of a house when
you<00:03:06.450> look<00:03:06.690> up<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:06.930> can<00:03:07.110> either<00:03:07.350> see<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.650> red

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
you look up you can either see a red

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.830 
you look up you can either see a red
ceiling<00:03:08.460> or<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.640> normal<00:03:09.150> building<00:03:09.390> block<00:03:09.600> but

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
ceiling or a normal building block but

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.990 
ceiling or a normal building block but
on<00:03:09.990> top<00:03:10.350> you<00:03:10.980> can<00:03:11.160> see<00:03:11.220> here<00:03:11.610> that<00:03:11.640> they<00:03:11.820> look

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
on top you can see here that they look

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.400 
on top you can see here that they look
the<00:03:12.120> exact<00:03:12.450> same<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:12.960> this<00:03:13.050> one<00:03:13.230> here

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
the exact same and this one here

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.990 
the exact same and this one here
obviously<00:03:13.560> has<00:03:13.830> carpets<00:03:14.220> on<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.490> but<00:03:14.910> you

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
obviously has carpets on it but you

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.280 
obviously has carpets on it but you
still<00:03:15.240> have<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.540> wood<00:03:15.720> on<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:15.930> bottom<00:03:16.170> so

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
still have the wood on the bottom so

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.420 
still have the wood on the bottom so
that's<00:03:16.440> another<00:03:16.680> use<00:03:16.920> that<00:03:17.070> you<00:03:17.160> can<00:03:17.280> use<00:03:17.400> it

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
that's another use that you can use it

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.070 
that's another use that you can use it
for<00:03:17.670> so<00:03:17.850> that<00:03:17.970> your<00:03:18.090> ceiling<00:03:18.480> isn't<00:03:18.630> this<00:03:18.840> red

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
for so that your ceiling isn't this red

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.900 
for so that your ceiling isn't this red
color<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:20.010> can<00:03:20.130> be<00:03:20.250> normal<00:03:20.490> like

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
color and it can be normal like

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.430 
color and it can be normal like
everything<00:03:21.360> else<00:03:21.510> alright<00:03:22.020> so<00:03:22.230> that<00:03:22.260> is

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
everything else alright so that is

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.170 
everything else alright so that is
carpets<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.160> how<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.340> can<00:03:23.610> use<00:03:23.670> them<00:03:24.030> let's

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
carpets and how you can use them let's

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.120 
carpets and how you can use them let's
go<00:03:24.330> ahead<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.690> take<00:03:25.050> a<00:03:25.080> look<00:03:25.230> at<00:03:25.530> flower<00:03:25.800> pots

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
go ahead and take a look at flower pots

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.920 
go ahead and take a look at flower pots
now<00:03:26.910> let's<00:03:27.210> go<00:03:27.330> ahead<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.660> continue

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
now let's go ahead and continue

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.510 
now let's go ahead and continue
imagining<00:03:28.650> that<00:03:28.710> this<00:03:28.830> is<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.070> second<00:03:29.400> floor

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
imagining that this is the second floor

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.150 
imagining that this is the second floor
and<00:03:29.850> I<00:03:30.270> realize<00:03:30.780> that<00:03:31.170> over<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.770> course<00:03:31.920> this

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
and I realize that over the course this

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.980 
and I realize that over the course this
video<00:03:32.400> I've<00:03:32.640> had<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:33.000> guys<00:03:33.120> imagine<00:03:33.450> a<00:03:33.690> lot<00:03:33.840> of

video I've had you guys imagine a lot of

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.170 
video I've had you guys imagine a lot of
stuff<00:03:34.200> but<00:03:34.410> brain<00:03:35.010> workouts<00:03:35.460> are<00:03:35.640> good<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.060> so

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
stuff but brain workouts are good and so

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.400 
stuff but brain workouts are good and so
is<00:03:36.210> creativity<00:03:36.690> so<00:03:36.990> that's<00:03:37.200> what<00:03:37.320> I'm

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
is creativity so that's what I'm

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
mushroom even so you can obviously

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.650 
mushroom even so you can obviously
imagine<00:04:14.070> some<00:04:14.340> different<00:04:14.670> ways<00:04:14.880> that<00:04:14.910> this

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
imagine some different ways that this

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.690 
imagine some different ways that this
would<00:04:16.109> be<00:04:16.290> useful<00:04:16.590> in<00:04:16.950> your<00:04:17.070> house<00:04:17.310> or<00:04:17.580> in<00:04:17.670> your

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
would be useful in your house or in your

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.550 
would be useful in your house or in your
world<00:04:17.970> especially<00:04:18.780> if<00:04:19.020> you're<00:04:19.109> building<00:04:19.260> like

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
world especially if you're building like

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.050 
world especially if you're building like
a<00:04:19.590> mansion<00:04:19.980> or<00:04:20.280> something<00:04:20.609> and<00:04:20.700> you<00:04:20.790> really

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
a mansion or something and you really

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.670 
a mansion or something and you really
want<00:04:21.239> to<00:04:21.330> decorate<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.840> inside<00:04:21.989> and<00:04:22.440> make<00:04:22.530> it

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
want to decorate the inside and make it

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.530 
want to decorate the inside and make it
