00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.150
 hello everyone with you nickname and today I will 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.560
 teach you how to write off the bottom 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:19.800
 whether debut iii g I will say right away what if 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.630
 you are unsure of yourself and 3 ios are shaking hands 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.850
 then most likely you will fail because 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.779
 what are you just plain blamed on 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:32.640
 exam and let's have it right away in general 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:35.610
 move on to the top three building our drag 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.840
 leaders in cheating as ways as 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.969
 write off correctly so on 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.020
 third position is enough 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:49.590
 banal way this phone can 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.870
 write off the phone and but notice on 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.930
 it's better to take two phones with you 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.760
 and the second one is so fake 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.649
 there must be some kind of left in general 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.530
 unnecessary star 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.969
 well, just even if you are burned then you 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.670
 can give star 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.189
 Well, how to say but the main rise 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.320
 special can write off the same when you 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.290
 go to the classroom some teachers 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.020
 start you simply search that is 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.869
 speak will show that pocket there is something 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.140
 also you just ask this phone as 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.049
 I did in general on exams and 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:29.390
 I calmly wrote off this by the way I want 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.590
 draw your attention to the tablets 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.030
 tablets 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.590
 in fact, they are very suitable because 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.590
 you exactly burn 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.080
 so on the second line we have a method 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.270
 cheating called a bomb or rather 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.790
 invisible bomb for this to us 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.040
 need 2 pens one pen should 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.780
 be without rod here on 2 per rod and 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.420
 a piece of paper on which god we will 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.460
 make this bomb itself 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.520
 write some sentence that is here 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.930
 by rod but carefully press i.e. 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.660
 to leave such an invisible light 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:12.080
 for example i will write at 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.080
 No, I will write 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.740
 so I don't know, you will see no 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.170
 probably not visible but correct and not 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.670
 it should be visible it should gel minutes 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.970
 only be for students now we 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:37.050
 go around with a regular segre knob 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:43.740
 get away i see i have this this this 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:47.760
 the word well, that's actually something like this 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:51.030
 there's got nick handwriting looks 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.950
 very but the essence itself that is what is 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.260
 invisible paper you can write a whole 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:00.600
 abstract is certainly not a handy thing 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:02.760
 but how the formulas should converge and the first 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.709
 the place is quite useful 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.890
 cheat sheet which I do not know how 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.650
 called the judge probably now I will not 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.720
 say i will do first show you then 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.540
 what maybe some don't know though 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.820
 But this year, they are very precise 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.900
 learned a lot of our own 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.820
 need scissors 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:27.000
 plain tape and sheets of paper 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.980
 with your notes here of course not 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.860
 synopsis is I just found some 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.549
 a piece of paper and we wrote instructions here 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.440
 on return, we will make slots 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.090
 Well, thereâ€™s a better formula here. 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.540
 write print this all affairs on 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.480
 printer in such a medium font somewhere 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:48.410
 eight-nine 12 where so probably so what 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.850
 Well let's start cutting attiny first we 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.360
 Tape this thing with scotch tape and then 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.360
 cut out 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.720
 so all and 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:12.150
 principle to glue what we need 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.150
 need to cut out now 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:25.990
 so own cut out and we should 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:28.150
 there was such a small thing 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:32.320
 in general, the word is written instruction 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:35.979
 go on and on we take found on 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.380
 cheat sheet and just the other side 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:45.130
 the country is exactly the paper itself we start it 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:48.180
 drench with cold water so here we drench and 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.180
 starting to rub 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:05.170
 that's actually what happened 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.170
 if you can read now like this 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.330
 something is written very much that the camera is not 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.960
 focuses well there is written instructions 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.450
 that is, we need an instruction here with us 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.360
 actually it turned out she is our couples 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:24.010
 tick she's scotch and that is her 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:31.430
 only the font itself is visible and we are like this 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:33.800
 stick you just want a little more 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.050
 Doster on hand 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.590
 Well, somehow it looks so general 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:42.980
 here you can fix the formulas and much that 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:46.370
 another forgot to tell you completely 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:50.780
 the main thing on the exam anyway 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:52.820
 Wear a jacket or a shirt I have 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.530
 so she was the main long sleeve 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.540
 because thanks to a long sleeve 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:00.020
 you can hide a lot of things 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:02.120
 and an example can also be given that is 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.210
 phone yes here's the usual phone here 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.990
 sleeve stupidly ends with i phone 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:10.970
 nobody catches him just 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:14.540
 I pull them all up pretty well 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:16.700
 I will say right away the phone is better to leave on 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.169
 the party, that is, under the leaflet there somewhere 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.510
 because when you look down and then 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:22.780
 immediately all prominent 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.850
 torturer naturally this is fast fields 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:29.270
 sort of like that all I want to say 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:31.610
 you do not worry, I certainly much 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.520
 It is easier to pass the principle easy exam 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.660
 the hardest thing there could be is 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.470
 math to treat people was complicated 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:41.540
 Mathematics steel on itself was easy and that 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:45.050
 g &amp; g of course there is a little harder because 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:48.260
 that from this year introduced such of course 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:52.430
 nonsense that type if you are not one thing 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.970
 you hand over all the khan to you you go again to 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.440
 college 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.840
 that is, a college that could get away with 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.009
 ninth grade and first year yes it is 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.400
 done crazy but so here is our 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:04.110
 state time limit what can you do 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.240
 Good luck on your exams and 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:09.589
 with you was a nickname subscribe to the channel 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.589
 put likes and all for now
