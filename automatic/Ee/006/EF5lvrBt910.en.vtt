00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 asks how do I know the difference ? 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.189
 if a pulse is positive and something to me 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.440
 good or a harmful impulse 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.540
 is for example if you have no sex 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.599
 and you instead want a porno 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.859
 So get a porno to watch then 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.550
 would you like to become one? 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.609
 wank 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.170
 but you actually know when you are 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.359
 was busy that the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.710
 Harmful to the soul is only when one 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.150
 that does not know then you just do it 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.760
 and then you sink deeper into 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.619
 the unrealistic world of sex woran 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.570
 can one recognize which impulse in 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.850
 order and which is more harmful 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.160
 is and in which one then rather not 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.809
 should follow so where does one recognize 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.620
 which one impulse now is to pursue 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:47.129
 and which not so very good question 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.120
 honestly, you know 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.890
 only afterwards 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.570
 you realize that only when you 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.820
 it has often done that you the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.140
 pornography that's an addiction pulse 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.520
 is something you have done more often 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.399
 that gives fast satisfaction 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.199
 and then you pay for it later, the 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.120
 is the reason why it is harmful then 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.899
 is therefore something that you very easily 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.360
 falls 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.710
 this pulse will cost you nothing that 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.420
 is fast satisfaction and a porno 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.130
 pushing in shifts nowadays 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.470
 in the first place so a porno 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.750
 to click 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:20.189
 I grew up in 1980's 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.920
 have a principle that the thieves follow 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.130
 can the fear be when the impulse 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.140
 if you want to press this one 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.900
 pulse act out when you uncomfortable 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.579
 is to live out this impulse 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.799
 when you realize you want something it 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.229
 pulls you in some direction and you 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.759
 but at the same time you are afraid that is one 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.119
 impulse that you probably follow 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.250
 should something that you are afraid of it 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.290
 something you should probably do 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.210
 You can still be a rational one 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.950
 common sense as the last filter 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.799
 that is, if you are afraid of it 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.180
 have to jump from the balcony then that is 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.649
 perhaps what what you should not do 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.570
 but if you hate the impulse on one 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.340
 Woman to go or if you notice one 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.049
 Woman that you look at a woman 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.390
 all the time and she is watching and herself 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.870
 I like to think and think 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.540
 would like in this e 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.120
 this feeling that your attention 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:16.270
 Focusing on where you are right now 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.470
 and you the thought that comes 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.370
 could go over it and you have 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.900
 also afraid of it 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.310
 then that is a pulse was 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.630
 would probably grow from it 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.640
 if you will follow that is 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.940
 probably a voice he sees 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.740
 Calls where you are afraid of what 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.150
 is unfamiliar and was but at it 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.560
 would grow if you agree 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.600
 you would not hear what 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.730
 will happen and that is mostly 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.190
 this impulse this positive I on 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.190
 direct something where you do not know what 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.940
 can happen out well the bad 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.010
 can go out 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.900
 of course, always has to watch what the 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.120
 Possible risks are there 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.930
 also impulses that are really stupid because 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:56.890
 can lose the bad 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:59.110
 For example, if you're on your job in 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.910
 then in a circle of his 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.850
 work colleagues because your wife is you 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.220
 like it then it can be quite that 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.260
 it's reasonable if you have yours there 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.700
 impulses suppressed when you are there 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.890
 the woman does not appeal and if you 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.920
 do not say that you get up but 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.800
 that you have this impulse to feminine 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.450
 Close to the duden elsewhere, that satisfies that 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.400
 means that you then yours somewhere 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.350
 Keep your eyes open and then somewhere else 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.930
 Woman sees you like that then you there 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.470
 establish the near and someone else 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.510
 get to know because you just work 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.850
 could lose a lot if you takes it 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.660
 ansprichst and sat you get up the 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.670
 can go well 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.489
 that can go well even if she does 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.810
 not interested can anyway 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.520
 that lead to a good one 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.660
 Friendship between developed 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.580
 but also that somehow unpleasant 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.390
 It can always be funny 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.120
 to run 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.800
 and no matter whose fault is the end 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.500
 it may just be funny afterwards 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.260
 is and if you do it every time you do 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.360
 Somebody comes over to the office 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.980
 let yourself be very uncomfortable then do it 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.660
 it broke the working atmosphere and then 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.430
 do you have in a piece of of your 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.870
 quality of life was broken for 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.209
 the next month or the next 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.190
 years maybe it does not have to be 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.880
 and it can give the man a boost 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.430
 suppress 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.710
 but that does not mean you're the one 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.450
 complete impulse and low 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.830
 if a woman interests me then 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.890
 I have to press this down but 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.870
 can you see okay just like when i did 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.040
 not so much thinking about this woman 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.650
 then I seem to look after myself 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.210
 female closeness and that means I should 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.320
 not being so sensible now 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.330
 full attention to this 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.380
 to steer work colleague but me 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.170
 maybe I should be a little bit more 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.480
 more look around when I am through the city 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:41.620
 i go shopping when i'm in the 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:44.470
 I'm vacationing and if I mean mine 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.890
 things do not kill because if we 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.720
 any women liked and should 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.280
 then targeted close search specifically 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.320
 try to make the contact and 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.360
 to watch what develops because you 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.950
 Of course, your workmate in the 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.240
 can you shoot yourself because of that ? 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.370
 you spend a lot of time with her 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.230
 you see a lot and therefore focused 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.700
 someday your attention on it 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.980
 that does not mean that she is pretty than 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.330
 Every woman on the street takes away 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.100
 that just means more 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.440
 That's why you spent time with her 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.080
 Do you feel more of her femininity 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.730
 and that's why you can do it that way 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.200
 strongly attracted lead by me 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.420
 that does not mean that she is the one 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.910
 only person in the world is that 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:25.360
 has to offer what you are so attractive 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.860
 but just means that you 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.020
 obviously just a strong one 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.170
 need for female energy 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.670
 to have in your life and that can 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.890
 you find somewhere that means if you are 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.720
 realize that with the work colleague that 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.100
 that would not be wise or if 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.290
 it is perhaps the woman's forehand 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:44.410
 or if there are any other reasons 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.520
 gives why that would be unreasonable and 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.020
 would do harm 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.850
 then you can the pulse still 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.940
 redirect and you can speak so to speak 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:54.040
 another valve is looking for that 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.170
 would be a bit longer , so to speak 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.600
 First of all , one can impulse 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.550
 redirect and secondly if you have one 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.670
 thumb rule, if you are afraid of it 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.320
 then have a momentum to follow if 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.300
 This unpleasant is a bit strange 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.530
 is and because you are taking a risk 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.660
 would have to be, then it probably is 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.550
 good impulse and then you should 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:15.130
 probably just yours 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.510
 own growth in any case 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.960
 a very good question from you many 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.400
 a heartfelt thank you 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.400
 and we got in the next video
