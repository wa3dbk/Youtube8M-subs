00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
roll-aboard choice pro-choice there is a

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.410 
roll-aboard choice pro-choice there is a
difference<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.070> can<00:01:32.100> be<00:01:32.369> anti<00:01:32.820> abortion<00:01:32.909> but

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
get into I think that's about as a

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.330 
get into I think that's about as a
Dalton<00:01:42.750> topic<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.560> can<00:01:43.590> get<00:01:43.799> into<00:01:44.009> without

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
Dalton topic you can get into without

stretching<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.890> threshold<00:01:58.990> I<00:01:59.990> could<00:02:00.799> have

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
stretching the threshold I could have

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.609
