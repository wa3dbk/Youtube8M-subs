three<00:00:10.050> I<00:00:10.670> suppose<00:00:11.670> for<00:00:12.240> things<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.750> take<00:00:13.110> note

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
three I suppose for things to take note

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.950 
three I suppose for things to take note
of<00:00:13.380> one<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.910> plant<00:00:15.179> which<00:00:15.389> will<00:00:15.570> give<00:00:15.780> you

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
of one is the plant which will give you

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.019 
of one is the plant which will give you
the<00:00:16.260> pheromone<00:00:16.740> mark<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.430> very

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
the pheromone mark this is very

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.000 
the pheromone mark this is very
important<00:00:18.510> as<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.080> how<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.380> will<00:00:19.800> get

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
important as this is how you will get

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.700 
important as this is how you will get
the<00:00:20.220> news<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.670> follow<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:21.090> now<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.140> pheromone

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
the news to follow you now the pheromone

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.189 
the news to follow you now the pheromone
mark<00:00:22.980> does<00:00:23.490> run<00:00:23.760> out<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:23.939> time<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:24.840> you'll<00:00:25.080> need

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
mark does run out of time so you'll need

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.320 
mark does run out of time so you'll need
to<00:00:25.260> bear<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:25.890> mind<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.369> if<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.760> do<00:00:27.060> end

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
to bear that in mind and if you do end

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.880 
to bear that in mind and if you do end
up<00:00:27.510> running<00:00:27.720> out<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.230> pheromone<00:00:28.650> mark

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
up running out of the pheromone mark

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.490 
up running out of the pheromone mark
that<00:00:29.880> use<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.330> probably<00:00:30.660> going<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.960> not<00:00:31.289> follow

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
that use is probably going to not follow

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.410 
that use is probably going to not follow
you<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.920> instead<00:00:32.250> go<00:00:32.550> for<00:00:32.579> one<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.120> other

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
you and instead go for one of the other

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.310 
you and instead go for one of the other
targets<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:35.670> second<00:00:36.030> thing<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:37.050> use

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
targets so the second thing is the use

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.610 
targets so the second thing is the use
now<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.460> news<00:00:38.760> needs<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.600> be<00:00:39.690> taken<00:00:39.899> through

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
now this news needs to be taken through

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.260 
now this news needs to be taken through
the<00:00:41.070> little<00:00:41.489> maze<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.510> fire<00:00:43.309> if<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.610> goes

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
the little maze of fire if it goes

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.970 
the little maze of fire if it goes
through<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.780> fire<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.260> takes<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.710> lot<00:00:46.950> of

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
through the fire it takes a lot of

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.220 
through the fire it takes a lot of
damage<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.450> need<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.750> bear<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.200> mind

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
damage so you need to bear that in mind

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.799 
damage so you need to bear that in mind
it<00:00:49.590> does<00:00:49.829> need<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.129> be<00:00:50.280> quite<00:00:50.789> cleanly<00:00:51.239> taken

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
it does need to be quite cleanly taken

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.930 
it does need to be quite cleanly taken
through<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.320> maze<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:53.129> don't<00:00:53.670> need<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.850> be

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
through the maze I don't need to be

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.080 
through the maze I don't need to be
taken<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.360> cog<00:00:54.629> now<00:00:55.469> there's<00:00:56.100> 2<00:00:56.370> z's<00:00:56.699> two

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
taken to the cog now there's 2 z's two

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.869 
taken to the cog now there's 2 z's two
plans<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.960> two<00:00:58.020> people<00:00:58.469> need<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.370> guide<00:00:59.520> and

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
plans so two people need to guide and

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.810 
plans so two people need to guide and
use<00:01:00.059> each<00:01:00.410> through<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.010> cog<00:01:02.280> at<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.640> other

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
use each through to the cog at the other

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.729 
use each through to the cog at the other
end<00:01:03.149> now<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.719> need<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.140> do<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.409> within

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
end now you need to do this within

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.560 
end now you need to do this within
around<00:01:05.339> 10<00:01:05.700> seconds<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.270> each<00:01:06.420> other

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
around 10 seconds of each other

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.740 
around 10 seconds of each other
otherwise<00:01:07.560> you'll<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:08.040> start<00:01:08.220> again<00:01:08.750> the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
otherwise you'll have to start again the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.870 
otherwise you'll have to start again the
third<00:01:09.960> thing<00:01:09.990> worth<00:01:10.350> noting<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.520> fire

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
third thing worth noting is the fire

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.179 
third thing worth noting is the fire

projectile<00:01:33.840> attack<00:01:34.110> does<00:01:34.650> immobilized<00:01:35.340> so

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
projectile attack does immobilized so

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.069 
projectile attack does immobilized so
that'll<00:01:35.759> be<00:01:35.850> mobilizing<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.840> will<00:01:36.930> be

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
that'll be mobilizing you and it will be

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.160 
that'll be mobilizing you and it will be
immobilizing<00:01:37.650> with<00:01:37.799> food<00:01:38.689> the<00:01:39.689> full<00:01:39.900> thing<00:01:40.049> to

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
immobilizing with food the full thing to

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.590 
immobilizing with food the full thing to
take<00:01:40.290> note<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.159> fire<00:01:41.430> itself<00:01:41.640> this

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
take note of is the fire itself this

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.410 
take note of is the fire itself this
does<00:01:42.840> do<00:01:43.020> quite<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.350> lot<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.530> damage<00:01:44.270> it<00:01:45.270> is

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
does do quite a lot of damage it is

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.990 
does do quite a lot of damage it is
considered<00:01:45.780> kind<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.680> lava<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.610> if<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.850> go

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
considered kind of lava so if you go

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.160 
considered kind of lava so if you go
into<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.390> will<00:01:48.630> get<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.200> lava<00:01:49.409> diva

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
into it you will get the lava diva

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.240 
into it you will get the lava diva
cut<00:01:51.560> from<00:01:51.710> that<00:01:51.909> not<00:01:52.909> much<00:01:52.939> else<00:01:53.920> now<00:01:54.920> bear<00:01:55.220> in

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250

mind<00:01:55.520> that<00:01:55.700> these<00:01:56.360> lover<00:01:56.630> elementals<00:01:57.170> do

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
certain number of them can spawn so the

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.749 
certain number of them can spawn so the
first<00:02:03.259> tactic<00:02:03.649> is<00:02:03.770> to<00:02:03.830> gather<00:02:04.070> all<00:02:04.399> the<00:02:04.580> fire

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
now the way that I run this is to take

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.289 
now the way that I run this is to take
me<00:02:35.540> on<00:02:35.690> an<00:02:35.870> elementalist<00:02:36.350> to<00:02:36.739> one<00:02:36.950> area<00:02:37.299> the

me on an elementalist to one area the

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.479 
me on an elementalist to one area the
right<00:02:38.540> path<00:02:38.780> for<00:02:38.810> me<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.410> basically<00:02:40.010> solo<00:02:40.310> it

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
right path for me and basically solo it

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.910 
right path for me and basically solo it
that<00:02:40.880> was<00:02:41.000> because<00:02:41.150> I<00:02:41.630> could<00:02:42.170> happily<00:02:42.530> do<00:02:42.769> this

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
that was because I could happily do this

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.070 
that was because I could happily do this
myself<00:02:43.100> I<00:02:43.430> could<00:02:43.670> keep<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:44.239> lover<00:02:44.600> elemental

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
myself I could keep the lover elemental

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.370 
myself I could keep the lover elemental
safe<00:02:45.500> especially<00:02:45.860> when<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:47.600> other<00:02:47.810> group<00:02:48.110> had

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.559 
safe especially when the other group had
sort<00:02:48.650> of<00:02:48.680> my<00:02:48.860> lover<00:02:49.069> that's<00:02:49.370> now<00:02:49.850> if<00:02:50.330> they

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
sort of my lover that's now if they

sort of my lover that's now if they
started<00:02:50.989> first<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.799> firearm<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.610> lover

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
started first the firearm the lover

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.289 
started first the firearm the lover
elementals<00:02:53.540> towards<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.670> latter<00:02:55.670> end<00:02:55.970> of<00:02:56.120> the

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
elementals towards the latter end of the

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.509 
elementals towards the latter end of the
puzzle<00:02:56.600> would<00:02:57.019> run<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.620> values<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.340> they'd<00:02:58.459> be

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
puzzle would run to values and they'd be

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.240 
puzzle would run to values and they'd be

that<00:03:01.670> kind<00:03:01.910> of<00:03:01.970> thing<00:03:02.150> they<00:03:02.390> basically<00:03:02.720> have

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
that kind of thing they basically have

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.800 
that kind of thing they basically have
to<00:03:02.989> deal<00:03:03.200> with<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.190> lover<00:03:04.340> elementals<00:03:04.880> now<00:03:05.329> I

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
to deal with the lover elementals now I

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.860 
to deal with the lover elementals now I
used<00:03:06.200> project<00:03:06.590> how<00:03:06.709> destruction<00:03:07.220> reflection

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
used project how destruction reflection

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.479 
used project how destruction reflection
slowing<00:03:08.870> I<00:03:09.170> pretty<00:03:09.769> much<00:03:09.859> used<00:03:10.130> a<00:03:10.220> lot<00:03:10.370> of

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
slowing I pretty much used a lot of

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.819 
slowing I pretty much used a lot of
control<00:03:10.820> to<00:03:10.970> keep<00:03:11.150> these<00:03:11.440> elementals<00:03:12.440> off<00:03:12.620> my

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
control to keep these elementals off my

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.789 
control to keep these elementals off my
use<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.280> then<00:03:13.820> we<00:03:14.299> just<00:03:14.540> timed<00:03:14.930> it<00:03:15.140> so<00:03:15.290> we<00:03:15.620> got

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
use and then we just timed it so we got

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.610 
use and then we just timed it so we got
through<00:03:16.070> if<00:03:16.280> I<00:03:16.670> got<00:03:16.970> through<00:03:17.299> too<00:03:17.630> quickly<00:03:17.660> may

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
through if I got through too quickly may

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.890 
through if I got through too quickly may
still<00:03:18.859> need<00:03:19.010> some<00:03:19.220> time<00:03:19.430> cut<00:03:20.239> it<00:03:20.390> around<00:03:20.660> at

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
still need some time cut it around at

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.720 
still need some time cut it around at
the<00:03:21.019> end<00:03:21.230> of<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.620> mace<00:03:21.799> but<00:03:22.190> remember<00:03:22.579> your

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
the end of the mace but remember your

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.970 
the end of the mace but remember your
pheromone<00:03:23.180> is<00:03:23.359> going<00:03:23.600> to<00:03:23.720> run<00:03:23.930> out<00:03:24.140> after<00:03:24.500> a

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
pheromone is going to run out after a

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.849 
pheromone is going to run out after a
while<00:03:25.750> this<00:03:26.750> puzzle<00:03:27.079> is<00:03:27.230> actually<00:03:27.620> really

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
while this puzzle is actually really

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.430 
while this puzzle is actually really
simple<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:28.910> only<00:03:29.150> issue<00:03:29.329> is<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:29.780> execution

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
simple the only issue is the execution

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.000 
simple the only issue is the execution
so<00:03:31.120> as<00:03:32.120> soon<00:03:32.329> as<00:03:32.480> you<00:03:32.570> get<00:03:32.810> basically<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.739> feel

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
so as soon as you get basically the feel

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.729 
so as soon as you get basically the feel
of<00:03:34.390> kiting<00:03:35.390> the<00:03:35.690> path<00:03:35.870> you<00:03:36.049> need<00:03:36.170> to<00:03:36.290> take<00:03:36.470> and

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
of kiting the path you need to take and

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.190 
of kiting the path you need to take and
making<00:03:37.549> sure<00:03:37.730> that<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:38.090> elementals<00:03:38.720> aren't<00:03:39.140> a

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
making sure that the elementals aren't a

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.740 
making sure that the elementals aren't a
problem<00:03:39.980> they're<00:03:40.430> taking<00:03:41.000> out<00:03:41.150> completely

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
problem they're taking out completely

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.890 
problem they're taking out completely
then<00:03:42.530> it's<00:03:42.680> actually<00:03:43.040> relatively<00:03:43.400> easy<00:03:43.730> so<00:03:44.450> I

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
then it's actually relatively easy so I

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.690 
then it's actually relatively easy so I
hope<00:03:45.140> that<00:03:45.350> helped<00:03:45.590> you<00:03:45.799> have<00:03:46.190> any<00:03:46.340> questions
