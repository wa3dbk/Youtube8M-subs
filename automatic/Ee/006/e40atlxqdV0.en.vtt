00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.479
 hello in the previous video we have you 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:11.290
 shown the film installation 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:13.360
 in glass on the samsung galaxy s 4 in the 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.220
 our store are now available 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.740
 same glass films then with the 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.329
 same properties for the galaxy note due 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.810
 the galaxy note 3 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:25.300
 the galaxy s iii and the galaxy s 4 le 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.419
 properties of the glass film like 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.339
 we explained to you in the previous video 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:33.100
 concern the complete transparency of the 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:37.600
 film also protects against impacts 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:42.129
 that from the display high resistance to 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:45.370
 temperature and touch sensitivity 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.120
 greater than those films 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.750
 in plastic 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.309
 let's see now what it is 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.399
 the effect of the glass film 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:01:00.429
 applied on the galaxy note 3 comes 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:03.370
 installed the film to these 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:08.050
 open this opening for the sensors 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:14.710
 the cash and as we have said in 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:16.600
 previously it has a greater thickness 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.740
 compared to other films 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.200
 in fact, here we are going to apply 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.560
 the stone cover the home button that is 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.350
 supplied and they in white for the 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.680
 version of cara xnote 3 white either 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.680
 Black 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.399
 then we apply the moment a 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.399
 coverage 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.220
 ok 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.410
 and see how the glass film does not 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.770
 it interferes with the use of the 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.770
 nib 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:28.210
 the colors are very bright on the display 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.090
 we remember that we also have anti-scratch 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:34.270
 shown with screwdriver like this 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:41.320
 film is resistant and is also 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:44.370
 anti fingerprint thanks for attention e 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.370
 see you soon. Bye
