that I want to make sure that i'm
getting<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.830> roots<00:00:26.189> I'm<00:00:26.849> getting<00:00:27.330> between

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
getting the roots I'm getting between

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.859 
getting the roots I'm getting between
the<00:00:28.170> roots<00:00:28.410> where<00:00:28.800> they're<00:00:29.010> separate<00:00:29.869> where

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
the roots where they're separate where

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.840 
the roots where they're separate where
it's<00:00:31.019> separate<00:00:31.439> from<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.800> mother<00:00:32.009> plant<00:00:32.430> and

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
it's separate from the mother plant and

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.540 
it's separate from the mother plant and
if<00:00:33.780> it's<00:00:33.960> still<00:00:34.230> connected<00:00:34.620> some<00:00:35.100> I'm<00:00:35.340> going

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
if it's still connected some I'm going

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.549 
if it's still connected some I'm going
to<00:00:35.610> cut<00:00:35.850> through<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.420> but<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:36.989> want<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.320> cut

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
to cut through it but I want to cut

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.340 
to cut through it but I want to cut
straight<00:00:38.160> down<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.940> any<00:00:39.180> cuts<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.899> root<00:00:40.110> or

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
straight down so any cuts in the root or

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.210 
straight down so any cuts in the root or
deep<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.010> not<00:00:41.790> close<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.450> plan

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.570 

okay<00:00:46.840> yeah<00:00:47.840> I'm<00:00:48.230> going<00:00:48.380> to<00:00:48.500> come<00:00:48.710> back<00:00:48.920> on<00:00:49.310> the

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
okay yeah I'm going to come back on the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.320 
okay yeah I'm going to come back on the
other<00:00:49.760> side<00:00:50.270> and<00:00:51.640> often<00:00:52.640> times<00:00:52.670> you<00:00:53.150> have<00:00:53.300> to

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
other side and often times you have to

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.410 
other side and often times you have to
do<00:00:53.630> this<00:00:53.780> on<00:00:54.020> all<00:00:54.260> four<00:00:54.740> sides<00:00:54.850> but<00:00:55.850> this<00:00:56.120> dirt

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
do this on all four sides but this dirt

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.040 
do this on all four sides but this dirt
is<00:00:56.720> very<00:00:57.020> good<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:57.710> so<00:00:58.520> i<00:00:58.820> will<00:00:59.420> probably<00:00:59.630> only

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
is very good and so i will probably only

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.730 
is very good and so i will probably only
have<00:01:00.380> to<00:01:00.530> do<00:01:00.680> it<00:01:00.710> on<00:01:00.860> two<00:01:01.070> sides<00:01:01.340> so<00:01:02.560> now<00:01:03.560> I'll

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:03.740 
have to do it on two sides so now I'll

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.800 
have to do it on two sides so now I'll
take<00:01:03.950> the<00:01:04.130> shovel<00:01:04.400> and<00:01:04.699> I'll<00:01:04.880> go<00:01:05.059> down<00:01:05.360> and<00:01:05.390> get

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
take the shovel and I'll go down and get

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.530 
take the shovel and I'll go down and get
the<00:01:05.960> rest<00:01:06.170> of<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:06.590> roots

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.480 

and<00:01:10.750> there<00:01:11.620> we<00:01:11.800> go<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:14.110> now<00:01:14.380> here<00:01:14.950> we<00:01:15.100> are<00:01:15.130> at

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
and there we go so now here we are at

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.320 
and there we go so now here we are at
the<00:01:15.670> new<00:01:15.880> bed<00:01:16.210> and<00:01:16.980> I've<00:01:17.980> dug<00:01:18.520> a<00:01:18.550> hole<00:01:18.910> with

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
the new bed and I've dug a hole with

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.630 
the new bed and I've dug a hole with
this<00:01:19.570> hand<00:01:19.990> tool<00:01:20.320> and<00:01:21.030> i've<00:01:22.030> added<00:01:23.400> sandy<00:01:24.400> loam

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
this hand tool and i've added sandy loam

this hand tool and i've added sandy loam
and<00:01:25.080> compost<00:01:26.080> mixed<00:01:26.560> together<00:01:26.710> and<00:01:28.260> i've

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
and compost mixed together and i've

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.790 
and compost mixed together and i've
added<00:01:29.530> it<00:01:30.450> into<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:31.840> soil<00:01:32.080> i'm<00:01:32.380> going<00:01:32.530> to<00:01:32.590> put

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
added it into the soil i'm going to put

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.620 
added it into the soil i'm going to put
back<00:01:32.950> into<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.400> hole<00:01:33.580> and<00:01:33.820> into<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.270> bottom

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
back into the hole and into the bottom

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.570 
back into the hole and into the bottom
of<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:34.840> hole<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:37.290> now<00:01:38.290> i<00:01:38.320> notice<00:01:38.979> that<00:01:39.460> the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
of the hole and now i notice that the

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.820 
of the hole and now i notice that the
plan<00:01:39.790> i<00:01:39.820> dug<00:01:40.210> up<00:01:40.390> actually<00:01:41.290> has<00:01:41.620> two<00:01:42.580> plants

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
plan i dug up actually has two plants

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.999 
plan i dug up actually has two plants
but<00:01:44.830> i<00:01:45.210> don't<00:01:46.210> want<00:01:46.390> to<00:01:46.479> risk<00:01:46.830> disturbing<00:01:47.830> that

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
but i don't want to risk disturbing that

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.770 
but i don't want to risk disturbing that
and<00:01:48.310> so<00:01:48.430> i'm<00:01:48.520> just<00:01:48.580> going<00:01:48.880> to<00:01:48.970> leave<00:01:49.210> it<00:01:49.240> as<00:01:49.479> one

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
and so i'm just going to leave it as one

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.230 
and so i'm just going to leave it as one
if<00:01:50.200> I<00:01:50.410> if<00:01:50.650> I<00:01:50.830> needed<00:01:51.100> another<00:01:51.310> plant<00:01:51.880> I<00:01:52.000> could

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
if I if I needed another plant I could

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.990 
if I if I needed another plant I could
even<00:01:52.509> separate<00:01:53.110> it<00:01:53.229> more<00:01:53.590> but<00:01:54.490> I<00:01:54.550> think<00:01:54.850> I'll

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
even separate it more but I think I'll

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.480 
even separate it more but I think I'll
leave<00:01:55.210> that<00:01:55.270> is<00:01:55.690> one<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:57.119> then<00:01:58.119> I'm<00:01:58.390> going<00:01:58.720> to

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
leave that is one and then I'm going to

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.480 
leave that is one and then I'm going to
I've<00:02:00.490> mixed<00:02:01.090> this<00:02:01.479> dirt<00:02:01.840> up<00:02:02.080> already<00:02:03.900> like<00:02:04.900> so

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
I've mixed this dirt up already like so

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.990 
I've mixed this dirt up already like so
and<00:02:06.490> then<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:08.259> will<00:02:08.709> just<00:02:08.979> cover<00:02:09.369> it<00:02:09.520> with<00:02:09.820> this

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
and then I will just cover it with this

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.780 
and then I will just cover it with this
really<00:02:10.420> nice<00:02:11.080> rich<00:02:12.420> black<00:02:13.420> gold

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.430 

and<00:02:17.909> then<00:02:18.599> I<00:02:18.629> press<00:02:19.019> it<00:02:19.079> down

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.510 

just<00:02:24.440> lightly<00:02:24.950> gently<00:02:25.850> press<00:02:26.150> it<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:27.490> then<00:02:28.490> I

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
just lightly gently press it and then I

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.250 
just lightly gently press it and then I
will<00:02:28.940> water<00:02:29.210> it<00:02:29.480> right<00:02:29.720> away<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.380> that's<00:02:31.280> it

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
will water it right away and that's it

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.490 
will water it right away and that's it
that's<00:02:33.260> how<00:02:33.470> you<00:02:33.530> do<00:02:33.770> the<00:02:33.920> plan<00:02:34.160> team
