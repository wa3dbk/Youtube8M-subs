00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:04.319
 last time I like pressing it very hard with 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.389
 sound so i wanted another blast 

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:09.909
 search vapor with light and they photograph me 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:13.509
 we have this picture 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.139
 Christmas tree song on but very bad sleep under 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:16.730
 the dome 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:17.820
 and but 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.180
 This is of course 2 taste and color but such as 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.180
 big engine rather quenching 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.390
 maybe the case is postponed that too 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.259
 photoshop by us 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.919
 these threads i get nothing and 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.690
 significantly unique because 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.420
 she said that time 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.050
 lawyers will be sent 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.750
 but if you shoot but you can 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.590
 and about the same water quality picture 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.770
 it can be difficult 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.280
 fan of our country look not only 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.280
 what it was for me to change something 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.730
 but wants 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.280
 I'm still making only names 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.280
 Moscow 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.930
 in which we are a little bit 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.430
 say more about current 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.850
 but again 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.130
 use it is not necessary but 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.219
 I tried to figure it out 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:13.490
 gradient overlay which can but 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.869
 match and honestly not yet 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.510
 picked up therefore 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.170
 the year he is out of habit on national projects 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.460
 we understand the simplest thing after 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.250
 this list assigned bolt 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.410
 I do not know now how they say but on 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.230
 maximum 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.640
 the only thing 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.380
 read a solid someone here that something 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.530
 so we are very saturated with her whose 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.530
 but place and 231 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.900
 fathers but I have from 40 to new 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.280
 years estimated for news 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.329
 debt more Siberia 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:48.370
 generally 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.370
 nissan on the trail is sun 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.410
 but sharpening the child’s schedule because 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.790
 pushed the camp of the sun 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.670
 and it affects many decades 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.729
 there is no point in doing this publicly 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.830
 standards should not submit to auction 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.650
 so in our institute yes 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.650
 in a programme 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.900
 we don't have on the square 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.879
 a year ago she is too strong 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.819
 but as our shows us as she reports 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.499
 sheep's official website 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:34.629
 lead 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:35.779
 program 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:39.219
 for the waiting ones and there are no fives after 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:42.219
 drought finance data and as an example 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.339
 of course you have no right 

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:47.919
 im now we can price it applies 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:50.919
 the color that we want theater them 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:54.679
 do not believe it so because because 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:57.679
 point find mb memory cube 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.419
 alexander frost how 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:03.580
 stamp 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.459
 means 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.539
 but mainly 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:09.670
 with bag 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.609
 but 8 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.479
 husband who is books young 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:16.009
 red edging a little 

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:19.009
 there is inadequacy 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.159
 station both candidate networks obs 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.159
 noted Konstantinov he believes 

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:28.739
 with this he is absolutely indifferent 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.739
 stay recall 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.439
 need to shout points to him 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.669
 that there are no equal 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:39.829
 second plan 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.579
 rather retiring was a pity 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.579
 in Russia 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.919
 the number of men will go on and on we 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.389
 can we 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.259
 let's remind a little bit what to rely on 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:55.939
 what moment myself 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:57.240
 our sailors 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.240
 together even more purple there 

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:03.859
 average brand we want 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.709
 can be anything 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.039
 This circumstance can and will bring and this 

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:10.109
 in the American box office about what 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.889
 In fact, these photos can be 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:15.180
 make no complaints no but perhaps 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.629
 it’s time to stand at the same time 

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:19.199
 shades 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.199
 do not recruit according to the principle 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.080
 state association 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.949
 it's about us with one teaspoon 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.419
 and 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:31.280
 and sugar 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.500
 the stock should except that is from the proportions 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.500
 blue purple shades 

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:39.929
 she is honored to start real 

00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:42.639
 I will not work with him recently 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.919
 we are all the rest as you can fit in 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.669
 Red Glade rubles 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.259
 what it consists of will undoubtedly become 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:50.710
 reality and sleep 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.009
 why 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:55.830
 it's all done 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.840
 Well, rude and she generally, that is, there is no 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.759
 prices dropped 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:02.069
 so no 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:04.059
 yes photos 

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:06.589
 on each program it works very 

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:09.110
 differently 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.770
 that appointed well it turned out we even 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.520
 turned on place counterattacks 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.969
 the market it turned out we have one too 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:18.129
 much order east 10 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:19.090
 ceremony 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.540
 mine also increased this aggressively 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.550
 advise garbage 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.509
 I understand that this is not very good 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:28.199
 but as such 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:29.860
 very good because my team 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.930
 concrete shot of the edge 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.219
 of which 1 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:38.439
 intelligible tires and batch workers 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:40.900
 stayed the same fit 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.990
 as ITAR TASS explained 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.490
 fired 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.759
 economy 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:48.849
 what exactly is the fourth 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:51.249
 in this case, the red triangle 

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:53.839
 understandably 

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:55.939
 may not be very sorry that may 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:58.939
 receive from the purchase amount 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:02.939
 Moscow to
