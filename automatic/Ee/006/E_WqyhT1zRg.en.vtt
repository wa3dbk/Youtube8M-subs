I think big wave surfing so just keep
going<00:00:46.359> a<00:00:46.780> bigger<00:00:47.019> and<00:00:47.289> bigger<00:00:47.530> waves<00:00:47.739> you<00:00:47.979> know

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:48.039 
going a bigger and bigger waves you know

on days like this when the surf is down

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.240 
on days like this when the surf is down
that's<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.330> best<00:01:25.600> time<00:01:25.750> to<00:01:25.900> Train<00:01:26.170> I<00:01:26.410> mean<00:01:27.130> no

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
that's the best time to Train I mean no

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.010 
that's the best time to Train I mean no
more<00:01:27.370> big<00:01:27.610> waves<00:01:27.790> but<00:01:28.240> you<00:01:28.570> can<00:01:28.690> get<00:01:28.870> together

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
more big waves but you can get together

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.860 
more big waves but you can get together
and<00:01:29.620> you<00:01:29.950> can<00:01:30.160> start<00:01:30.400> practicing<00:01:30.780> today<00:01:31.780> we

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
and you can start practicing today we

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.420 
and you can start practicing today we
went<00:01:32.020> on<00:01:32.110> to<00:01:32.200> do<00:01:32.260> some<00:01:32.290> on<00:01:32.620> water<00:01:32.920> jet<00:01:33.250> ski

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
went on to do some on water jet ski

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.140 
went on to do some on water jet ski
training<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:34.570> some<00:01:35.290> of<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.440> scenarios<00:01:35.890> were

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
training and some of the scenarios were

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.000 
training and some of the scenarios were
unconscious<00:01:37.150> victim<00:01:37.180> laying<00:01:38.170> face<00:01:38.500> down<00:01:38.530> and

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
unconscious victim laying face down and

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.670 
unconscious victim laying face down and
how<00:01:39.670> to<00:01:39.700> grab<00:01:40.030> them<00:01:40.210> so<00:01:40.510> we<00:01:40.600> practice<00:01:40.750> getting

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
how to grab them so we practice getting

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.290 
how to grab them so we practice getting
him<00:01:41.860> on<00:01:41.980> the<00:01:42.070> ski<00:01:42.250> and<00:01:42.280> getting<00:01:42.640> him<00:01:42.730> out<00:01:43.090> of

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
him on the ski and getting him out of

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.390 
him on the ski and getting him out of
the<00:01:43.360> impact<00:01:43.600> zone<00:01:43.660> another<00:01:44.350> real<00:01:44.590> scenario<00:01:45.159> is

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
the impact zone another real scenario is

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.710 
the impact zone another real scenario is
just<00:01:45.700> somebody<00:01:45.940> that<00:01:46.090> broke<00:01:46.390> their<00:01:46.540> leash

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
just somebody that broke their leash
