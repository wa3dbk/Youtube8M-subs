00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
do that for about 5-10 minutes when I

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.820 
do that for about 5-10 minutes when I
feel<00:02:44.489> like<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.730> hair<00:02:44.910> is<00:02:45.180> drying<00:02:45.830> quite

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
feel like the hair is drying quite

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.780 
feel like the hair is drying quite
sufficiently<00:02:47.459> I<00:02:47.819> use<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.569> on<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:49.250> low<00:02:50.250> heat<00:02:50.280> so

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
sufficiently I use it on the low heat so

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.340 
sufficiently I use it on the low heat so
it's<00:02:50.970> quite<00:02:51.269> cool<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.959> it's<00:02:52.110> coming<00:02:52.319> through

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
it's quite cool and it's coming through

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.440 
it's quite cool and it's coming through
so<00:02:52.590> it's<00:02:52.769> not<00:02:52.920> again<00:02:53.250> damaging<00:02:53.819> like<00:02:54.090> hot<00:02:54.330> air

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.990 
so it's not again damaging like hot air
and<00:02:54.830> yeah<00:02:55.890> keep<00:02:56.220> doing<00:02:56.459> that<00:02:56.580> but<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:56.850> doesn't

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
to move to the other side

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.420 
to move to the other side
the<00:04:10.700> head<00:04:10.990> so<00:04:11.990> then<00:04:12.200> I<00:04:12.230> do<00:04:12.350> the<00:04:12.980> whole<00:04:13.130> bottom

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.100 
half of the hair the top half is tied up
at<00:04:15.560> the<00:04:15.650> top<00:04:15.970> so<00:04:16.970> that's<00:04:17.090> how<00:04:17.269> the<00:04:17.330> 1/2<00:04:17.780> is<00:04:17.989> I

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:18.110 
at the top so that's how the 1/2 is I

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:19.539 
at the top so that's how the 1/2 is I
don't<00:04:18.170> spend<00:04:18.650> too<00:04:18.860> much<00:04:18.980> time<00:04:19.040> they're<00:04:19.400> both

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
don't spend too much time they're both

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.250 
don't spend too much time they're both
sewn<00:04:19.760> just<00:04:20.000> pivots<00:04:20.330> on<00:04:20.450> the<00:04:20.600> bottom<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:21.170> not

start<00:04:24.680> on<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:24.860> top<00:04:25.250> half<00:04:25.580> one<00:04:26.150> of<00:04:26.270> the<00:04:26.330> top

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
start on the top half one of the top

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.200 
start on the top half one of the top
halves<00:04:26.750> and<00:04:27.130> it<00:04:28.130> takes<00:04:28.340> quite<00:04:28.610> a<00:04:28.670> while<00:04:28.790> and

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
cream again and I lightly kind of comb

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.430 
cream again and I lightly kind of comb
out<00:04:44.030> the<00:04:44.210> curls<00:04:44.450> just<00:04:44.720> to<00:04:44.810> make<00:04:44.960> them<00:04:45.140> a<00:04:45.170> bit

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
out the curls just to make them a bit

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.480 
out the curls just to make them a bit
more<00:04:46.150> natural-looking<00:04:47.150> not<00:04:47.510> so<00:04:47.660> perfect<00:04:47.900> and

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
more natural-looking not so perfect and

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.580 
more natural-looking not so perfect and
then<00:04:49.490> I<00:04:49.520> take<00:04:49.850> some<00:04:49.880> hairspray<00:04:50.570> and<00:04:51.050> I<00:04:51.410> like

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
then I take some hairspray and I like

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.500 
then I take some hairspray and I like
this<00:04:51.710> once<00:04:51.890> it's<00:04:52.070> quite<00:04:52.250> light<00:04:52.460> and<00:04:52.790> I<00:04:53.240> like

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
this once it's quite light and I like

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.780 
this once it's quite light and I like
each<00:04:53.810> will<00:04:54.080> kind<00:04:54.410> of<00:04:54.470> lightly<00:04:54.740> spray<00:04:54.980> all<00:04:55.310> over

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
each will kind of lightly spray all over

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.390 
each will kind of lightly spray all over
just<00:04:55.970> to<00:04:56.090> help<00:04:56.300> hold<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:57.020> curls<00:04:57.290> you<00:04:58.220> don't

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
just to help hold the curls you don't

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.800 
just to help hold the curls you don't
them<00:04:58.580> to<00:04:58.610> drop<00:04:58.850> after<00:04:59.120> all<00:04:59.240> that<00:04:59.360> work<00:04:59.600> and

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
them to drop after all that work and

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.420 
them to drop after all that work and
then<00:04:59.960> I<00:05:00.050> backcomb<00:05:00.560> it<00:05:00.680> a<00:05:00.770> little<00:05:00.950> bit<00:05:01.250> but

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
then I backcomb it a little bit but

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.130 
then I backcomb it a little bit but
again<00:05:01.520> not<00:05:01.940> too<00:05:02.210> roughly<00:05:02.690> just<00:05:02.870> to<00:05:02.990> give<00:05:03.110> it

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
again not too roughly just to give it

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.830 
again not too roughly just to give it
some<00:05:03.440> body<00:05:03.650> and<00:05:04.010> some<00:05:04.310> more<00:05:04.490> volume<00:05:04.840> and

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
some body and some more volume and

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.060 
some body and some more volume and
that's<00:05:06.020> how<00:05:06.140> I<00:05:06.200> get<00:05:06.260> and<00:05:06.530> I'm<00:05:06.620> really<00:05:06.920> really

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
that's how I get and I'm really really

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.850 
that's how I get and I'm really really
big<00:05:07.550> and<00:05:08.060> sort<00:05:08.810> out<00:05:08.870> my<00:05:08.930> leave<00:05:09.350> out<00:05:09.620> at<00:05:09.740> the

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
big and sort out my leave out at the

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.720 
big and sort out my leave out at the
front<00:05:11.560> looks<00:05:12.560> great<00:05:12.710> with<00:05:12.860> it<00:05:13.070> and<00:05:13.220> and<00:05:13.490> then

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
front looks great with it and and then

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.440 
front looks great with it and and then
use<00:05:14.000> the<00:05:14.450> shine<00:05:15.080> spray<00:05:15.470> from<00:05:15.800> frizzies<00:05:16.550> and<00:05:17.360> I

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
use the shine spray from frizzies and I

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.390 
use the shine spray from frizzies and I
so<00:05:17.630> use<00:05:17.750> a<00:05:17.810> lot<00:05:17.930> of<00:05:17.960> frizzy<00:05:18.230> as<00:05:18.290> products<00:05:18.680> and
