00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 hi girls and guys welcome to the 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.650
 new special video for to elevate 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.330
 today he passes me through the shoe store he goes to 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.280
 bring to your website and chosen 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.929
 those sandals that I consider a 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.519
 basic footwear for summer so 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.410
 let's start testing those 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.410
 sandals and openings we can give 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.160
 ah 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.030
 let's start with the classic live 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.620
 very classic flip flop logo 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.810
 summer that is this that simply has 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.400
 two strips in this case I have chosen these 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.020
 Andrea that pitcher inside the 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.690
 flick flock style has seemed very 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.280
 interesting one the silver color that you 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.140
 gives a little more importance there is no 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.420
 of mammoth and especially as this species 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.500
 of imitation from snake skin that 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.500
 also adds to the look 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.960
 we go with a second pair that would be 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.760
 these sandals also look like a 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.559
 classic and these sandals in particular I 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.420
 they are very flattering to the feet 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.670
 for all the lines that usually draw 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.619
 the line around the big toe the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.330
 high line that usually runs the length 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.280
 of the foot and this one just before the 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.020
 ankle in this case not as you have 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.420
 chosen ones that have materials of 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.380
 like a little skin and gold to give it 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.380
 a little more than we're going 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.799
 then we have the classic Roman sandal 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.180
 how are you that I teach you about it shoes 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.070
 These sandals I have found 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.049
 impressive are full of details 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.970
 made with love you can not see 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.100
 that the skin is very good apart 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.200
 they remain at the foot like a glove and well that 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.149
 it's the typical classic shoe that you 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.250
 It serves for the day to day to perform 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.140
 any kind of message truth and then 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.700
 have the comfort of being flat that in 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.600
 summer I go out I think all 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.600
 We are looking for a lot 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:50.829
 and another type of very classic sandals is 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.630
 the t-type call that has 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.000
 a line so it goes through the 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.799
 clean hand and then say what beats 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.090
 crosses not around the ankles this 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.950
 sandal is usually very 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.570
 flattering also for the feet of 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.009
 new are usually flat these sandals 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.259
 and then in this case I liked it 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.580
 much in detail so more ethnic of the 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.580
 pebbles from the front 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.830
 let's put aside the sandals 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.450
 We're going to move on to those that 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.070
 they have a little bit of heel we start 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.050
 with these sandals that I 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.910
 I would consider more at night they seem very 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.190
 sexy because they have a lot of strips 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.260
 very finite and then apart they have a 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.060
 heel as you can see that they end 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.140
 quite in tips two these I think 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.490
 They are a type of sandals too 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.470
 necessary for summer for example 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.630
 for the nights when we go out to 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.890
 we went out to dinner or a drink we 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.930
 now to go with these sandals 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.340
 booty sandals that I discovered being 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.410
 pregnant and that the truth is cool and that 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.300
 they are very comfortable apart that one walks 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.340
 quite safe especially cases 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.720
 they have mixed fat chubby heels 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.430
 sandals I think they have good 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.690
 that breathe very much the foot at the same time 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.690
 that you hold it a lot 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.550
 it seems that we have strained this is 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.020
 but they are not really shoes 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.430
 but I will consider them almost 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.230
 sandals for being open 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.850
 right on the feet and by the fact of being 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.200
 a type of footwear very appropriate for 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.330
 those people that you have to follow 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.460
 working or going more or less elegant 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.780
 without teaching too much the good foot but 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.160
 at the same time you have a little 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.290
 fingers to the air so I leave this 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.270
 option last could not miss the 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.010
 sandals with wedge in this case with a 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.870
 cork wedge there are also with a 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.160
 wedge of esparto this type of footwear me 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.990
 It seems very appropriate for those 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.820
 people that you want to gain in height that 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.440
 in general we are all true and about 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.970
 everything that you do not feel very heavy since 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.070
 these materials usually do not weigh 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.960
 quite in this color plus a color 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.960
 orange to give joy to the feet 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.690
 until we have arrived after this 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.400
 small excursion in the shoe store of 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.990
 dance bar teaching the basics in 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.430
 sandals for this summer I hope that you 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.240
 have liked and see you in the next 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.240
 until next time
