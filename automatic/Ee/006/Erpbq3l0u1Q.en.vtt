in this country during the civil rights

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.130 
in this country during the civil rights
movement<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:31.220> think<00:02:31.790> that<00:02:31.910> they<00:02:32.060> can<00:02:32.330> clean

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
be cleaned up and I think that black

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.520 
be cleaned up and I think that black

is the greatest country in the world

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.949 
is the greatest country in the world
because<00:03:36.470> we<00:03:37.430> have<00:03:37.459> the<00:03:37.730> ability<00:03:38.150> here<00:03:38.180> to<00:03:38.389> to

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
because we have the ability here to to

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.660 
because we have the ability here to to
make<00:03:39.139> it<00:03:39.260> better<00:03:39.410> and<00:03:39.650> we<00:03:39.739> are<00:03:40.130> constantly

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
make it better and we are constantly

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.360 
make it better and we are constantly
trying<00:03:40.850> to<00:03:41.030> do<00:03:41.269> that<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:41.690> I<00:03:42.560> think<00:03:42.590> that<00:03:42.829> that

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
trying to do that and I think that that

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.420 
trying to do that and I think that that
sets<00:03:43.639> us<00:03:43.819> apart<00:03:43.940> and<00:03:44.389> I<00:03:44.690> think<00:03:44.930> we<00:03:45.049> have<00:03:45.230> to

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
sets us apart and I think we have to

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.640 
sets us apart and I think we have to
continually<00:03:46.430> remember<00:03:46.940> that<00:03:47.230> when<00:03:48.230> we<00:03:48.350> try<00:03:48.620> to

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
continually remember that when we try to

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.300 
continually remember that when we try to
get<00:03:48.859> things<00:03:49.069> done<00:03:49.250> can<00:03:50.180> you<00:03:50.329> forgive<00:03:50.780> sterling

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.580 

yeah<00:03:55.310> but<00:03:55.730> he<00:03:56.050> hasn't<00:03:57.050> asked<00:03:57.410> for<00:03:57.440> any

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
yeah but he hasn't asked for any

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.280 
yeah but he hasn't asked for any
forgiveness<00:03:57.920> he<00:03:58.850> seems<00:03:59.210> pretty<00:03:59.450> secure<00:03:59.750> in

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
forgiveness he seems pretty secure in

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.340 
forgiveness he seems pretty secure in
his<00:04:00.590> attitude<00:04:01.010> and<00:04:01.540> again<00:04:02.540> that's<00:04:02.990> part<00:04:03.110> of

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
his attitude and again that's part of
