00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
bit to find that this one is a

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.319 
bit to find that this one is a
remote-controlled<00:03:58.549> one<00:03:58.760> and<00:03:58.969> it<00:03:59.060> has<00:03:59.180> the

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
because it's a bit annoying to have the

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.030 
because it's a bit annoying to have the
two<00:04:05.570> separate<00:04:06.020> you<00:04:06.440> can<00:04:06.560> also<00:04:06.680> get<00:04:06.830> ones<00:04:07.010> that

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
two separate you can also get ones that

two separate you can also get ones that
have<00:04:07.190> a<00:04:07.220> little<00:04:07.430> button<00:04:07.580> so<00:04:07.940> it's<00:04:08.510> just<00:04:08.720> an

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
have a little button so it's just an
