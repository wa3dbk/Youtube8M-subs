Karen's cookies net so now that the

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.160 
Karen's cookies net so now that the
consistency<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.789> frosting<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.480> like<00:00:49.140> a

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
consistency of this frosting is like a

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.049 
consistency of this frosting is like a
traditional<00:00:49.739> buttercream<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:50.430> thicker

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
traditional buttercream it's thicker

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.299 
traditional buttercream it's thicker
it<00:00:51.360> won't<00:00:51.629> smooth<00:00:51.930> out<00:00:52.110> completely<00:00:52.649> it'll

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
it won't smooth out completely it'll

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.209 
it won't smooth out completely it'll
give<00:00:53.699> some<00:00:54.210> texture<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.690> your<00:00:54.960> decorations<00:00:55.590> so

give some texture to your decorations so

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.349 
give some texture to your decorations so
what<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.520> do<00:00:56.640> first<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.800> outline<00:00:58.800> with<00:00:59.359> black

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.689 
what I do first is I outline with black
usually<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:00.960> like<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.590> black<00:01:02.039> outline<00:01:02.250> for

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699

almost<00:01:03.000> all<00:01:03.300> my<00:01:03.539> cookies<00:01:03.899> as<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.290> can<00:01:04.500> see<00:01:05.100> on

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
almost all my cookies as you can see on

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.480 
almost all my cookies as you can see on
my<00:01:05.280> website<00:01:06.170> and<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.590> usually<00:01:07.740> use<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.070> number

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
my website and I usually use a number

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.060 
my website and I usually use a number
two<00:01:08.850> tip<00:01:09.260> to<00:01:10.260> outline<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.240> so<00:01:12.240> we'll<00:01:12.799> be<00:01:13.799> doing

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
two tip to outline and so we'll be doing

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.749 
two tip to outline and so we'll be doing
a<00:01:14.130> little<00:01:15.110> hot<00:01:16.110> air<00:01:16.290> balloon<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.860> you'll

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
a little hot air balloon and you'll

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.530 
a little hot air balloon and you'll
notice<00:01:18.060> when<00:01:18.299> I'm<00:01:18.450> outlining<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:19.580> my<00:01:20.580> tip

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
notice when I'm outlining that my tip

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.830 
notice when I'm outlining that my tip
almost<00:01:22.259> never<00:01:22.950> touches<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.549> cookie<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.180> just

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
almost never touches the cookie I just

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.240 
almost never touches the cookie I just
let<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.229> frosting<00:01:25.860> fall<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:27.860> that<00:01:28.860> gives<00:01:29.130> me

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
let that frosting fall and that gives me

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.010 
let that frosting fall and that gives me
nice<00:01:29.610> straight<00:01:30.030> lines<00:01:30.240> because<00:01:30.540> my<00:01:30.689> hands

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
nice straight lines because my hands

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.069 
nice straight lines because my hands
aren't<00:01:31.200> completely<00:01:31.740> steady<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.930> so<00:01:33.930> that

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
aren't completely steady and so that

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.420 
aren't completely steady and so that
gives<00:01:34.259> me<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> good<00:01:34.590> straight<00:01:34.920> line<00:01:34.950> when<00:01:35.280> it

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
gives me a good straight line when it

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.929 
gives me a good straight line when it
just<00:01:35.670> falls<00:01:36.860> this<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.100> takes<00:01:38.369> some<00:01:38.610> practice

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
just falls this it takes some practice

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.090 
just falls this it takes some practice
it<00:01:39.329> takes<00:01:39.450> some<00:01:39.689> getting<00:01:39.720> used<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.259> but<00:01:40.560> once

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
it takes some getting used to but once

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.240 
it takes some getting used to but once
you<00:01:41.340> get<00:01:41.460> used<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.060> consistency<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
you get used to the consistency of the

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.980 
you get used to the consistency of the
frosting<00:01:44.729> how<00:01:44.909> fast<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.390> comes<00:01:45.540> out<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.899> the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
frosting how fast it comes out of the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.330 
frosting how fast it comes out of the
bag<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:48.229> how<00:01:49.229> hard<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.619> need<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.770> squeeze<00:01:50.130> it

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
bag and how hard you need to squeeze it

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.209 
bag and how hard you need to squeeze it
then<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.579> can<00:01:50.759> do<00:01:50.939> this<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:52.399> it<00:01:55.100> comes<00:01:56.100> out

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
then you can do this and it comes out

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.990 
then you can do this and it comes out
really<00:01:56.549> nice<00:01:56.909> just<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.780> little<00:01:57.960> practice<00:01:59.000> now

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
really nice just a little practice now

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.060 
really nice just a little practice now
don't<00:02:00.240> worry<00:02:00.360> if<00:02:00.630> your<00:02:00.810> outlines<00:02:01.200> aren't

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
don't worry if your outlines aren't

don't worry if your outlines aren't
perfect<00:02:02.460> mine<00:02:02.729> art<00:02:03.799> but<00:02:04.799> once<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.189> get<00:02:05.310> some

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
perfect mine art but once you get some

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.979 
perfect mine art but once you get some
color<00:02:06.479> in<00:02:06.750> there<00:02:06.899> filled<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:08.239> it<00:02:09.239> will<00:02:09.479> hide<00:02:09.720> a

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
color in there filled in it will hide a

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.520 
color in there filled in it will hide a
lot<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.310> mistakes

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
is I'll outline the area that needs to

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.849 
is I'll outline the area that needs to
be<00:02:34.359> filled<00:02:34.659> in<00:02:35.459> and<00:02:36.900> then<00:02:37.900> just<00:02:38.170> go<00:02:38.409> back<00:02:38.439> in

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859 
be filled in and then just go back in

be filled in and then just go back in
and<00:02:39.040> fill<00:02:39.310> that<00:02:39.959> Center<00:02:40.959> in<00:02:41.079> that<00:02:41.290> way<00:02:41.849> just

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
and fill that Center in that way just

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.640 
and fill that Center in that way just
gives<00:02:43.060> me<00:02:43.180> nice<00:02:43.359> clean<00:02:44.019> edges<00:02:45.959> and<00:02:46.959> I<00:02:47.200> just<00:02:47.500> can

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
gives me nice clean edges and I just can

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:55.520 
gives me nice clean edges and I just can
just<00:02:47.680> go<00:02:48.010> back<00:02:48.189> and<00:02:48.430> forth

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.250 

put<00:02:56.530> a<00:02:56.560> little<00:02:56.770> red<00:02:57.070> in<00:02:57.310> there<00:02:57.930> I'm<00:02:58.930> gonna<00:02:59.050> do

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
put a little red in there I'm gonna do

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:10.640 
put a little red in there I'm gonna do
this<00:02:59.440> stripe<00:02:59.860> in<00:03:00.100> red<00:03:06.180> little<00:03:07.180> bit<00:03:07.330> of<00:03:07.450> blue

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.410 

and<00:03:11.650> then<00:03:11.800> I'll<00:03:12.010> just<00:03:12.220> continue<00:03:12.490> on<00:03:12.820> with<00:03:13.210> all

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
and then I'll just continue on with all

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.770 
and then I'll just continue on with all
the<00:03:13.570> sections<00:03:14.050> and<00:03:15.090> when<00:03:16.090> I'm<00:03:16.210> done<00:03:16.450> it's

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
the sections and when I'm done it's

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.510 
the sections and when I'm done it's
gonna<00:03:16.960> look<00:03:17.110> like<00:03:17.440> this<00:03:17.680> now<00:03:18.160> you'll<00:03:18.310> notice

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
gonna look like this now you'll notice

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.400 
gonna look like this now you'll notice
there<00:03:18.820> is<00:03:18.940> some<00:03:19.210> texture<00:03:19.660> in<00:03:19.750> there<00:03:19.930> it's<00:03:20.170> not

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
there is some texture in there it's not

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.860 
there is some texture in there it's not
going<00:03:20.830> to<00:03:21.040> flatten<00:03:21.490> out<00:03:21.580> completely<00:03:22.090> that's

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
going to flatten out completely that's

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.080 
going to flatten out completely that's
just<00:03:23.140> the<00:03:23.260> nature<00:03:23.470> of<00:03:23.740> this<00:03:23.890> this<00:03:24.520> frosting

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
just the nature of this this frosting

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.210 
just the nature of this this frosting
and<00:03:25.240> sometimes<00:03:25.690> I<00:03:25.990> like<00:03:26.440> that<00:03:26.890> and<00:03:27.040> sometimes

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
and sometimes I like that and sometimes

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.860 
and sometimes I like that and sometimes
I<00:03:27.610> don't<00:03:27.670> it<00:03:27.940> depends<00:03:28.330> on<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.480> cookie<00:03:28.780> I'm

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
I don't it depends on the cookie I'm

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.400 
I don't it depends on the cookie I'm
doing<00:03:29.230> but<00:03:30.060> this<00:03:31.060> is<00:03:31.270> you<00:03:31.690> know<00:03:31.810> when<00:03:31.960> I<00:03:31.990> want<00:03:32.290> a

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
doing but this is you know when I want a

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.199 
doing but this is you know when I want a
little<00:03:32.680> bit<00:03:32.770> of<00:03:32.890> texture<00:03:33.220> with<00:03:33.580> the<00:03:33.730> frosting

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
little bit of texture with the frosting

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.790 
little bit of texture with the frosting
and<00:03:34.420> this<00:03:34.540> is<00:03:34.690> what<00:03:34.870> I<00:03:34.900> this<00:03:35.200> is<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:35.410> method

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
and this is what I this is the method

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.070 
and this is what I this is the method
that<00:03:35.920> I<00:03:35.980> use
