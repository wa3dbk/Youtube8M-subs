00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
we have a CD player

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.780 
we have a CD player
we<00:00:35.130> have<00:00:35.340> an<00:00:35.520> auxilary<00:00:35.880> input<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:37.520> on<00:00:38.520> this

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
we have an auxilary input and on this

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.940 
we have an auxilary input and on this
side<00:00:39.059> here<00:00:39.420> we're<00:00:39.600> going<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.840> see<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.020> USB<00:00:40.590> port

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
side here we're going to see a USB port

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.060 
side here we're going to see a USB port
so<00:00:41.540> if<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.690> can<00:00:42.840> also<00:00:42.989> plug<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.559> an<00:00:43.680> iPod

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
so if we can also plug in an iPod

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.840 
so if we can also plug in an iPod
directly<00:00:44.250> via<00:00:44.730> USB<00:00:46.129> I'm<00:00:47.129> going<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.370> focus<00:00:47.700> on

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
directly via USB I'm going to focus on

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.560 
directly via USB I'm going to focus on

settings<00:00:48.930> for<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.770> one<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.160> let's<00:00:50.340> go<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.579> FM

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
settings for this one so let's go to FM

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.479 
settings for this one so let's go to FM
here<00:00:52.430> this<00:00:53.430> knob<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.149> top<00:00:55.020> left<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.800> going

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
here this knob on the top left is going

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.459 
here this knob on the top left is going
to<00:00:56.640> give<00:00:56.850> me<00:00:57.120> my<00:00:57.539> volume<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:59.780> that's<00:01:00.780> also<00:01:00.989> a

to give me my volume and that's also a

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.990 
to give me my volume and that's also a
power<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.879> push<00:01:03.090> on<00:01:03.270> push<00:01:03.480> off<00:01:04.760> on<00:01:05.760> the

power so I can push on push off on the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.870 
power so I can push on push off on the
opposite<00:01:06.420> side<00:01:06.890> we<00:01:07.890> can<00:01:08.100> use<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.610> to

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
opposite side we can use this to

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.280 
opposite side we can use this to
actually<00:01:09.030> fine<00:01:09.510> tune<00:01:09.780> our<00:01:09.930> radio<00:01:10.260> stations<00:01:12.290> so

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
actually fine tune our radio stations so

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.140 
actually fine tune our radio stations so
what<00:01:13.500> you're<00:01:13.650> noticing<00:01:13.860> right<00:01:14.310> now<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.939> we

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
what you're noticing right now is we

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.260 
what you're noticing right now is we
have<00:01:15.180> HD<00:01:16.080> for<00:01:16.380> HD<00:01:16.830> radio<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.850> has<00:01:18.030> been

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
have HD for HD radio and it has been

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.960 
have HD for HD radio and it has been
selected<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.990> advantage<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.100> selecting<00:01:20.580> HD

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
selected the advantage of selecting HD

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.719 
selected the advantage of selecting HD
radio<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:22.220> for<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.520> particular

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
radio is that for this particular

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.090 
radio is that for this particular
station<00:01:24.270> for<00:01:24.630> example<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:25.170> have<00:01:25.409> four<00:01:25.710> separate

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
station for example I have four separate

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.330 
station for example I have four separate
options<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:27.930> cycle<00:01:28.380> through<00:01:28.409> them<00:01:28.890> by

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
options so I can cycle through them by

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.380 
options so I can cycle through them by
hitting<00:01:29.579> multicast<00:01:30.270> here<00:01:30.920> so<00:01:31.920> I'm<00:01:32.009> going<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.579> a

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
hitting multicast here so I'm going to a

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.950 
hitting multicast here so I'm going to a
four<00:01:33.960> three<00:01:34.590> or<00:01:34.770> four<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.909> all<00:01:36.180> these<00:01:36.420> are<00:01:36.689> just

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
four three or four so all these are just

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.780 
four three or four so all these are just
different<00:01:37.140> versions<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.159> same<00:01:38.369> radio

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
different versions of the same radio

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.929 
different versions of the same radio
station<00:01:39.890> otherwise<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:41.130> can<00:01:41.280> use<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.670> just<00:01:41.700> like

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
station otherwise I can use it just like

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.999 
station otherwise I can use it just like
regular<00:01:42.479> radio<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.049> not<00:01:43.259> have<00:01:43.530> those<00:01:43.740> extra

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
regular radio and not have those extra

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.810 
regular radio and not have those extra
options<00:01:45.649> to<00:01:46.649> do<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.040> all<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.250> need<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.579> do<00:01:47.759> is

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
options to do so all I need to do is

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.630 
options to do so all I need to do is
turn<00:01:48.000> off<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.390> HD<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:48.990> now<00:01:49.619> it's<00:01:49.920> just<00:01:50.430> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
turn off the HD and now it's just the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.380 
turn off the HD and now it's just the
one<00:01:50.930> station<00:01:54.590> from<00:01:55.590> here<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.130> can<00:01:56.159> also<00:01:56.549> do

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
one station from here you can also do

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.980 
one station from here you can also do
the<00:01:58.430> iPod<00:01:59.430> tagging<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.180> what<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:00.780> would

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
the iPod tagging and what this would

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.499 
the iPod tagging and what this would
allow<00:02:01.259> me<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.680> do<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.130> save<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.520> information

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
allow me to do is save this information

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.109 
allow me to do is save this information
so<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.290> next<00:02:04.469> time<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.829> plug<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.219> my<00:02:05.250> iPod

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
so that the next time I plug in my iPod

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.300 
so that the next time I plug in my iPod
it<00:02:06.329> will<00:02:06.630> actually<00:02:06.840> look<00:02:07.469> for<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:07.799> song<00:02:08.099> on

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
it will actually look for this song on

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.309 
it will actually look for this song on
iTunes<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.119> can<00:02:09.360> download<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.780> if<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.080> choose

allows me to do is adjust the volume for

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.050 
allows me to do is adjust the volume for
when<00:03:20.320> I<00:03:20.350> hit<00:03:20.740> the<00:03:21.100> freeway<00:03:21.370> or<00:03:21.730> when<00:03:21.850> there's

when I hit the freeway or when there's
more<00:03:22.240> ambient<00:03:22.630> noise<00:03:22.930> so<00:03:23.770> what<00:03:24.190> this<00:03:24.430> will<00:03:24.670> do

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
more ambient noise so what this will do

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.970 
more ambient noise so what this will do
is<00:03:25.000> if<00:03:25.270> there<00:03:25.420> is<00:03:25.510> more<00:03:25.750> road<00:03:26.230> noise<00:03:26.470> around<00:03:26.710> me

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
is if there is more road noise around me

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.740 
is if there is more road noise around me
it<00:03:27.310> will<00:03:27.460> raise<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:27.790> volume<00:03:28.390> of<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.690> stereo

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
it will raise the volume of the stereo

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.320 
it will raise the volume of the stereo
according<00:03:29.710> to<00:03:29.920> these<00:03:30.100> settings<00:03:30.520> so<00:03:31.090> I<00:03:31.120> could

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
according to these settings so I could

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.160 
according to these settings so I could
have<00:03:31.450> it<00:03:31.570> low<00:03:31.780> mid<00:03:32.230> or<00:03:32.440> high<00:03:33.570> or<00:03:34.570> I<00:03:34.600> can<00:03:34.960> turn

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
have it low mid or high or I can turn

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.120 
have it low mid or high or I can turn
that<00:03:35.320> off<00:03:35.530> and<00:03:35.770> it<00:03:35.890> never<00:03:36.190> will<00:03:36.490> adjust<00:03:36.880> the

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
that off and it never will adjust the

combine<00:04:15.660> AM<00:04:16.660> FM<00:04:17.500> stations<00:04:18.040> all<00:04:18.220> on<00:04:18.580> the<00:04:18.670> same

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
combine AM FM stations all on the same

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.190 
combine AM FM stations all on the same
set<00:04:19.209> and<00:04:19.359> I<00:04:20.290> can<00:04:20.500> also<00:04:20.920> have<00:04:21.190> my<00:04:22.200> satellite

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
set and I can also have my satellite

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.010 
set and I can also have my satellite
radio<00:04:23.650> stations<00:04:24.190> all<00:04:24.400> on<00:04:24.850> the<00:04:25.030> same<00:04:25.210> preset<00:04:25.750> so

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
radio stations all on the same preset so

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.750 
radio stations all on the same preset so
total<00:04:26.740> of<00:04:26.830> 36<00:04:27.310> different

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
total of 36 different

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.300 
total of 36 different
and<00:04:28.180> I<00:04:28.240> can<00:04:28.420> mix<00:04:28.630> in<00:04:28.840> number<00:04:29.410> one<00:04:29.590> being<00:04:29.800> a.m.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
and I can mix in number one being a.m.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.260 
and I can mix in number one being a.m.
number<00:04:30.730> second<00:04:31.150> being<00:04:31.270> FM<00:04:31.780> and<00:04:32.740> end<00:04:32.980> the<00:04:33.100> third

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
number second being FM and end the third

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.100 
number second being FM and end the third
potentially<00:04:34.270> being<00:04:34.480> an<00:04:35.080> XM<00:04:35.440> radio<00:04:35.740> as<00:04:35.890> well

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
potentially being an XM radio as well

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.810 
potentially being an XM radio as well
now<00:04:38.110> when<00:04:38.320> I<00:04:38.380> go<00:04:38.560> through<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:38.950> options<00:04:39.130> here

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
now when I go through the options here

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.210 
now when I go through the options here
what<00:04:40.690> I'm<00:04:40.840> going<00:04:40.870> to<00:04:41.140> find<00:04:41.380> is<00:04:41.590> I<00:04:41.740> have<00:04:42.010> the

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
what I'm going to find is I have the

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.310 
what I'm going to find is I have the
ability<00:04:42.340> to<00:04:42.910> look<00:04:43.360> for<00:04:43.570> traffic<00:04:43.810> information

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
ability to look for traffic information

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.710 
ability to look for traffic information
so<00:04:45.250> some<00:04:45.490> radio<00:04:45.850> station<00:04:46.330> will<00:04:46.680> be<00:04:48.720> doing

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
so some radio station will be doing

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.900 
so some radio station will be doing
traffic<00:04:50.110> info<00:04:50.650> and<00:04:50.830> they<00:04:51.250> have<00:04:51.430> to<00:04:51.610> send<00:04:51.790> the

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
traffic info and they have to send the

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.020 
traffic info and they have to send the
right<00:04:52.060> signal<00:04:52.480> that<00:04:52.690> this<00:04:53.200> radio<00:04:53.560> can<00:04:53.880> pick<00:04:54.880> up

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
right signal that this radio can pick up

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.180 
right signal that this radio can pick up
otherwise<00:04:55.780> you'll<00:04:56.260> see<00:04:56.470> the<00:04:56.590> type<00:04:56.890> search

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
otherwise you'll see the type search

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.440 
otherwise you'll see the type search
here<00:04:57.430> and<00:04:57.550> I<00:04:57.610> can<00:04:57.760> go<00:04:57.910> either<00:04:58.120> way

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
here and I can go either way

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.570 
here and I can go either way
and<00:04:58.690> this<00:04:59.260> allows<00:04:59.620> me<00:04:59.890> to<00:05:00.010> search<00:05:00.220> for<00:05:00.520> a

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
and this allows me to search for a

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.690 
and this allows me to search for a
certain<00:05:00.910> type<00:05:01.180> of<00:05:01.210> radio<00:05:01.720> station<00:05:02.230> and<00:05:02.700> you

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
certain type of radio station and you

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.640 
certain type of radio station and you
can<00:05:03.730> see<00:05:04.090> that<00:05:04.270> changing<00:05:04.750> here<00:05:07.230> so<00:05:08.230> let's<00:05:08.470> say

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
can see that changing here so let's say

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.280 
can see that changing here so let's say
we<00:05:08.800> wanted<00:05:09.070> to<00:05:09.130> hear<00:05:09.460> talk<00:05:09.970> radio<00:05:10.420> then<00:05:10.930> I<00:05:10.960> will

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
we wanted to hear talk radio then I will

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.250 
we wanted to hear talk radio then I will
hit<00:05:11.440> type<00:05:11.770> seek<00:05:12.160> and<00:05:12.480> it's<00:05:13.480> going<00:05:13.660> to<00:05:13.720> scan<00:05:14.080> the

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
hit type seek and it's going to scan the

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.610 
hit type seek and it's going to scan the
FM<00:05:14.650> dial<00:05:14.920> until<00:05:15.760> it<00:05:15.880> finds<00:05:16.150> a<00:05:16.360> talk<00:05:16.720> station

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
FM dial until it finds a talk station

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.550 
FM dial until it finds a talk station
and<00:05:18.120> I<00:05:19.120> can<00:05:19.330> choose<00:05:19.510> to<00:05:19.570> listen<00:05:20.050> to<00:05:20.200> this<00:05:20.320> one

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
and I can choose to listen to this one

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.160 
and I can choose to listen to this one
here<00:05:20.770> and<00:05:20.950> right<00:05:21.370> now<00:05:21.580> we're<00:05:21.820> on<00:05:21.970> 100.3<00:05:22.810> which

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.170 
here and right now we're on 100.3 which

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:28.920 
here and right now we're on 100.3 which
is<00:05:23.350> a<00:05:23.380> local<00:05:23.830> talk<00:05:24.040> station<00:05:25.620> and<00:05:27.660> source<00:05:28.660> is

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
is a local talk station and source is

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.200 
is a local talk station and source is
where<00:05:29.200> we<00:05:29.320> started<00:05:29.710> originally<00:05:30.310> that<00:05:30.820> allows

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
where we started originally that allows

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.530 
where we started originally that allows
us<00:05:31.420> to<00:05:31.660> adjust<00:05:32.100> whether<00:05:33.100> we<00:05:33.250> go<00:05:33.430> from<00:05:33.670> AM<00:05:34.090> FM

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540
