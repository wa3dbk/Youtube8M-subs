00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.399 
and last but not least I'm going to add
kosher<00:02:58.459> salt<00:02:58.790> to<00:02:59.000> it<00:03:00.400> liberally<00:03:01.659> I'm<00:03:02.659> going<00:03:03.200> to

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409 
kosher salt to it liberally I'm going to

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.460 
kosher salt to it liberally I'm going to
boil<00:03:03.980> it<00:03:04.220> only<00:03:04.670> for<00:03:04.939> three<00:03:05.299> minutes<00:03:05.629> that's<00:03:06.140> it

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
boil it only for three minutes that's it

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.770 
boil it only for three minutes that's it
and<00:03:06.680> then<00:03:07.159> I'll<00:03:07.310> check<00:03:07.609> it<00:03:08.030> has<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:08.659> be

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
and then I'll check it has to be

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.149 
and then I'll check it has to be
slightly<00:03:09.049> el<00:03:09.439> dente<00:03:09.680> not<00:03:10.129> cooked<00:03:10.459> through

slightly el dente not cooked through

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.099 
slightly el dente not cooked through
so<00:03:13.159> the<00:03:13.280> heat<00:03:13.489> is<00:03:13.519> medium<00:03:14.150> now<00:03:14.329> and<00:03:14.629> it's

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
so the heat is medium now and it's

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:20.440

cooking<00:03:18.280> I'm<00:03:19.280> going<00:03:19.519> to<00:03:19.609> strain<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.419> water
