00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.439
 Nine people here are related or seven to an MBA moped 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.449
 largely away from here and just free for everyone 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.789
 AR does not have his eyes on why percent lays 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.940
 The employees in the magazine dictate more easily 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.070
 Percent dexterity per Friday 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.820
 Rest and more pro and the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.880
 the equipment of formats and its text 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.360
 The conclusion of the marriage with Ivana shortly lose that because I really have today 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.130
 strange conclusion of the European Championship 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.160
 and never fully deserves Victor and the clients 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.800
 % Freight me now not why I chose to foresee a light the foresight 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.960
 Zerg one really 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.960
 Great thoughts behind but I dropped you here, for example 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:01.090
 At the time I never used Sach MA's current phase of Modern Warfare 2 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.500
 at least almost never 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.559
 and that's why I thought 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.929
 Here fit a Ohrenschmaus times this is so 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.230
 and I have to say that I really like the team, but I had that in the team 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.230
 claim blocks Error committed but more on that later 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.690
 I would like to lose something for everyone today, even if you have the 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.980
 Know mode you know what you have to do you know you are strengthened but 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:23.700
 Nevertheless 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.510
 powerful was again a second 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.800
 attach and always try first tip always eat around 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.490
 Say always runs so that they have a wall 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.979
 Zentes usual point has worked so well 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.210
 always warned to have the spinal cord is already 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.320
 this advantage quite simply because you then 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.840
 can not be shot off the page 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.940
 9 percent 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.800
 For example, here she has really helped enormously and now 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.710
 but unfortunately more and more in the middle and that tries the data all the way 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.390
 to 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.670
 change and hearing problems spring 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.430
 Would express direction percent 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.440
 Area of ​​the map to arrive 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.620
 and there, however, flies to Pewnow and of course, equal first 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.969
 triggered in a safe spot 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:14.159
 Merkel gives today from now on with the rules of the FEI which also already in 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.289
 Doctorow us top ten 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:19.439
 Percent tips Academia or whatever the title the News 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:24.729
 but still we talk again 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.279
 As a second tip here is definitely 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:29.619
 to take Mainzer with you 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:33.749
 Yade alone by the advantage of the other 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:34.729
 People 

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:37.329
 to use the seedlings 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.819
 there must be no adversary from the steps of oneself there can be no friends » 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.299
 a teammate continues to defeat everyone against everyone 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:48.499
 Estate must be foolish footsteps if it is 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:50.619
 this could be your own 

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:53.919
 as you promptly 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:55.040
 Let's go for it too 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.029
 the second one becomes and how does the mistake give him 

00:02:58.029 --> 00:03:00.989
 I do not even want to get it out there 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.059
 the only one I wear is top notch 

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:07.549
 and I have a lot to do with him 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.909
 Of course that was pretty stupid 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:11.769
 Percent that he does not care 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:12.870
 but it is 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.029
 a plus as well 

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:18.079
 I can do more cheese with the weapon and can for their flags 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.659
 Years ago the gameplay was the first time one of them was also one 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.729
 talk a bit about movies 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:27.570
 because 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.549
 I do not know 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.289
 I saw two really great stripes two days ago and I thought so 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.609
 that sometimes I stop at the giro, that can be a bit like that 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.030
 more general topic and that's why I want to give them a strong 

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:39.859
 do 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.429
 and indeed the topic is as already addressed 

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:45.429
 So the day before yesterday or yesterday I do not remember 

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:51.189
 seen two grandiose stripes and although ACS was and percent inception both 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:54.209
 looked at blu-ray and has to say 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.029
 Terrific stripes probably the best films of the last three years 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.819
 Percent provided 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.919
 in fact, around my last two years 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:06.459
 come out in the new if I'm wrong 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:07.979
 and we have 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:11.900
 In any case, I would like to give you a short percent feedback which sense 

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:13.259
 I found better now 

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:15.799
 we were almost better 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.070
 Percent for all worker fans I'm sorry 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.070
 but I think he just has such a terrific storey 

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:27.530
 really cool animation partially so alone this already 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.620
 imaginations 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.639
 that could really intervene in the dream world is already pitch »pretty much 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.460
 cool 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.969
 the worker 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:37.820
 Dr 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.350
 I do not know the movie I like a really good too 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.270
 if the story is not so great 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.919
 maybe not just because the queen he's for me 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.930
 a little smaller is thought I do not know if it is not there 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.099
 definitely 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:54.970
 If I liked the story fifth came about a bit 8:15 pm though 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:58.780
 There were of course new ideas also general with the award and so on 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.940
 is all well and good alone principle SZ then again so 

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:07.370
 you creep yourselves you miss village should learn to take 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.630
 falls in love with one of Lehndorff's and we have since stopped her 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.569
 betray 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:17.750
 if you have any show theme wrong you have fini i did not feel 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.379
 I do not know how you are doing 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:24.949
 In any case, percent still has day percent animation 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:28.229
 Definitely won the Panorama so throw 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.360
 because have done so incredible all the details and so I'm the bright 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.499
 madness 

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:38.330
 but Hoffmann has fallen in Fürth, however, due to win in Vienna 1 0 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:43.629
 and percent yes that's why Inception Main is absolute 

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:46.099
 Favorite topic right now 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:49.469
 Whoever inside wedding should definitely do it the gameplay is here 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:52.770
 because he has already come to an end but I'll add my video question and that 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.940
 Kristof Wilke at his what's your favorite movie may even be 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.460
 Pasta or infection 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.659
 4 stuffy writes us in the comments 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:04.100
 and I'm curious what it will come out 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.490
 Score is here for 30 for two on Richards until next time 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.710
 at 3 shovels
