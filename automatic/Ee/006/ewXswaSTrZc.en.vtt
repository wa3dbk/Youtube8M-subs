manufacturers<00:01:55.320> offer<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:56.250> that's<00:01:56.430> the

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
manufacturers offer so that's the

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.600 
manufacturers offer so that's the
QuickStart<00:01:57.119> guide<00:01:57.950> that's<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.219> battery

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
QuickStart guide that's the battery

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.679 
QuickStart guide that's the battery
that's<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.119> thousand<00:02:00.420> 600<00:02:00.810> mAh<00:02:01.020> battery<00:02:01.500> and

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
that's the thousand 600 mAh battery and

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.810 
that's the thousand 600 mAh battery and
then<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.960> have<00:02:04.320> data<00:02:04.890> cables<00:02:05.310> charge<00:02:05.610> around

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
then you have data cables charge around

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.340 
then you have data cables charge around
here<00:02:06.030> phones<00:02:06.390> that's<00:02:06.600> about<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:06.960> let's<00:02:07.140> take

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
here phones that's about it let's take

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.460 
here phones that's about it let's take
the<00:02:07.530> earphones<00:02:07.860> out<00:02:08.009> there

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
the earphones out there

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.440 
the earphones out there
be<00:02:08.590> anything<00:02:08.800> surprising<00:02:09.490> about<00:02:10.030> the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
be anything surprising about the

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.930 
be anything surprising about the
delicate<00:02:10.810> ball<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.290> B<00:02:11.440> charger<00:02:11.890> so<00:02:12.550> these<00:02:12.730> are

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
delicate ball and B charger so these are

the air phones not in there but

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.240 
the air phones not in there but
definitely<00:02:15.570> decent<00:02:16.570> quality<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:17.050> guess<00:02:17.350> we'll

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
definitely decent quality I guess we'll

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.740

fun touch OS and the other things that

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.840 
fun touch OS and the other things that
you<00:04:07.540> need<00:04:07.750> to<00:04:07.900> know<00:04:08.049> is<00:04:08.110> that<00:04:08.260> it<00:04:08.560> has<00:04:08.709> a<00:04:08.739> 512<00:04:09.400> MB

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
you need to know is that it has a 512 MB

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.810 
you need to know is that it has a 512 MB
of<00:04:09.880> RAM<00:04:10.090> which<00:04:10.239> is<00:04:10.660> not<00:04:11.410> great<00:04:11.680> for<00:04:11.709> even<00:04:12.670> the

one phones have one
cram<00:04:16.239> and<00:04:16.600> then<00:04:17.020> you<00:04:17.140> have<00:04:17.260> the<00:04:17.380> 1.3<00:04:18.010> gigahertz

cram and then you have the 1.3 gigahertz
quad-core<00:04:18.700> processor<00:04:19.300> just<00:04:19.480> most<00:04:19.810> likely<00:04:20.170> the

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
folders and that's about it there is no

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.520 
folders and that's about it there is no
app<00:04:36.160> list<00:04:36.460> as<00:04:36.730> usual<00:04:37.240> it's<00:04:37.930> just<00:04:38.230> the<00:04:38.350> home

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
app list as usual it's just the home

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.330 
app list as usual it's just the home
screen<00:04:38.860> and<00:04:39.580> many<00:04:40.060> home<00:04:40.270> screens<00:04:40.600> that's<00:04:40.900> it

so<00:04:42.340> that's<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:42.700> fun<00:04:42.910> touch<00:04:43.120> OS<00:04:43.810> you<00:04:44.020> can<00:04:44.050> see<00:04:44.320> a

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
so that's the fun touch OS you can see a

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.900 
so that's the fun touch OS you can see a
lot<00:04:44.560> of<00:04:44.590> differences<00:04:45.160> here<00:04:45.480> in<00:04:46.480> terms<00:04:46.780> of<00:04:46.930> UI

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
lot of differences here in terms of UI

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.180 
lot of differences here in terms of UI
it's<00:04:48.910> completely<00:04:49.450> custom<00:04:49.870> and<00:04:50.050> it<00:04:50.650> does<00:04:50.890> it

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
it's completely custom and it does it

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.590 
it's completely custom and it does it
does<00:04:51.400> have<00:04:51.640> a<00:04:51.670> different<00:04:52.150> kind<00:04:52.270> of<00:04:52.420> an

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
does have a different kind of an

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.390 
does have a different kind of an
inertial<00:04:53.110> scrolling<00:04:53.320> if<00:04:53.860> you<00:04:53.980> notice<00:04:54.390> so<00:04:55.390> yes

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
inertial scrolling if you notice so yes

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.540 
inertial scrolling if you notice so yes
let's

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
let's

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.310 
let's
probably<00:04:58.000> lessen<00:04:58.330> the<00:04:58.420> writing<00:04:58.750> right<00:04:59.080> ones<00:04:59.260> a

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
probably lessen the writing right ones a

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:05.400 
probably lessen the writing right ones a
little<00:04:59.350> bit<00:05:02.820> so<00:05:03.820> there<00:05:04.300> you<00:05:04.390> go<00:05:04.540> that's<00:05:04.750> the<00:05:05.110> UI

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
little bit so there you go that's the UI

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.480 
little bit so there you go that's the UI
the<00:05:06.010> fun<00:05:06.280> touch<00:05:06.490> OS<00:05:07.440> every<00:05:08.440> app<00:05:08.650> is<00:05:08.920> definitely

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
the fun touch OS every app is definitely

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.320 
the fun touch OS every app is definitely
custom<00:05:09.940> it's<00:05:10.180> not<00:05:10.390> based<00:05:10.690> on<00:05:10.900> some<00:05:11.200> skin<00:05:11.860> or

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
custom it's not based on some skin or

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.890 
custom it's not based on some skin or
default<00:05:13.330> things<00:05:13.630> that<00:05:14.190> OMS<00:05:15.190> do<00:05:15.540> so<00:05:16.540> everything

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
default things that OMS do so everything

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.290 
default things that OMS do so everything
is<00:05:16.990> custom<00:05:17.350> which<00:05:17.500> is<00:05:17.620> cool<00:05:17.830> but<00:05:18.070> and<00:05:19.060> also

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
is custom which is cool but and also

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.690 
is custom which is cool but and also
it's<00:05:19.540> fast<00:05:19.780> as<00:05:20.020> you<00:05:20.110> can<00:05:20.260> see<00:05:20.440> it's<00:05:21.100> fast<00:05:21.370> and

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
it's fast as you can see it's fast and

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.560 
it's fast as you can see it's fast and
smooth<00:05:22.110> but<00:05:23.110> we<00:05:23.440> all<00:05:23.530> held<00:05:23.770> out<00:05:24.420> what<00:05:25.420> will

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
smooth but we all held out what will

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.500 
smooth but we all held out what will
hold<00:05:25.840> out<00:05:25.990> on<00:05:26.170> the<00:05:26.350> review<00:05:27.340> and<00:05:27.640> let<00:05:28.210> you<00:05:28.330> know

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
hold out on the review and let you know

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.900 
hold out on the review and let you know
how<00:05:28.960> it<00:05:29.110> turns<00:05:29.320> out<00:05:29.530> later<00:05:29.740> so<00:05:30.610> that's<00:05:30.820> about

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
how it turns out later so that's about

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.670 
how it turns out later so that's about
it<00:05:31.030> for<00:05:31.090> the<00:05:31.240> unboxing<00:05:31.480> and<00:05:31.810> a<00:05:31.930> first<00:05:32.200> look<00:05:32.470> at

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
it for the unboxing and a first look at

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.340 
it for the unboxing and a first look at
the<00:05:32.770> vivo<00:05:33.550> Y<00:05:33.850> 15<00:05:34.300> a<00:05:34.510> really<00:05:34.780> decent<00:05:34.990> mid-range

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
the vivo Y 15 a really decent mid-range

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.670 
the vivo Y 15 a really decent mid-range
phone<00:05:35.830> but<00:05:36.520> 512<00:05:37.150> MB<00:05:37.450> of<00:05:37.480> RAM<00:05:37.690> is<00:05:38.020> definitely<00:05:38.650> a

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
phone but 512 MB of RAM is definitely a

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.980 
phone but 512 MB of RAM is definitely a
bummer<00:05:38.920> that's<00:05:39.760> what<00:05:39.970> we<00:05:40.120> think<00:05:40.420> what<00:05:40.690> do<00:05:40.810> you
