representatives<00:00:03.230> I'm<00:00:04.230> filming<00:00:04.650> this<00:00:04.799> to<00:00:05.130> see

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
representatives I'm filming this to see

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.550 
representatives I'm filming this to see
why<00:00:05.640> I'm<00:00:05.819> getting<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.270> vertical<00:00:06.810> bounce<00:00:07.200> up

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
why I'm getting the vertical bounce up

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.940 
why I'm getting the vertical bounce up
and<00:00:07.680> down<00:00:07.799> and<00:00:08.700> I<00:00:09.120> was<00:00:09.179> told<00:00:09.389> by<00:00:09.650> Kimberly<00:00:10.650> I

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
and down and I was told by Kimberly I

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.070 
and down and I was told by Kimberly I
believe<00:00:11.219> her<00:00:11.309> name<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.940> record<00:00:12.690> this<00:00:12.840> video

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
believe her name is to record this video

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.799 
believe her name is to record this video
so<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:14.099> guess<00:00:14.580> your<00:00:14.730> technicians<00:00:15.269> could<00:00:15.450> see<00:00:15.660> it

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
so I guess your technicians could see it

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.490 
so I guess your technicians could see it
and<00:00:16.560> give<00:00:16.830> me<00:00:17.010> some<00:00:17.220> advice<00:00:17.520> on<00:00:17.760> how<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:18.500> get

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
and give me some advice on how to get

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.720 
and give me some advice on how to get
rid<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.100> don't<00:00:20.250> know<00:00:20.369> if<00:00:20.430> it's<00:00:20.580> my

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
rid of that I don't know if it's my

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.120 
rid of that I don't know if it's my
footing<00:00:21.390> or<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.689> actual<00:00:21.900> balancing<00:00:22.470> so

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
footing or the actual balancing so

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.019 
footing or the actual balancing so
before<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.490> was<00:00:23.640> using<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.300> Canon<00:00:25.109> 5d<00:00:25.380> Mark<00:00:25.590> 3

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
before I was using the Canon 5d Mark 3

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.620 
before I was using the Canon 5d Mark 3
with<00:00:27.029> Tokina<00:00:28.250> 1116<00:00:29.250> 228<00:00:30.090> which<00:00:30.300> was<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> very

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
with Tokina 1116 228 which was a very

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.680 
with Tokina 1116 228 which was a very
heavy<00:00:30.960> lens<00:00:31.289> but<00:00:31.980> now<00:00:32.130> I'm<00:00:32.430> now<00:00:32.820> have<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.180> gh4

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
heavy lens but now I'm now have the gh4

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.549 
heavy lens but now I'm now have the gh4
with<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.890> Olympus<00:00:35.780> 12<00:00:36.780> millimeter<00:00:37.320> which<00:00:37.530> is

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
with the Olympus 12 millimeter which is

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.260 
with the Olympus 12 millimeter which is
a<00:00:37.710> prime<00:00:38.010> lens<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:39.149> as<00:00:39.270> far<00:00:39.480> as<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:40.260> balancing

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
a prime lens so as far as this balancing

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.290 
a prime lens so as far as this balancing
so<00:00:42.270> far<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.989> okay<00:00:43.440> because<00:00:44.149> I'm<00:00:45.149> guessing

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
so far this is okay because I'm guessing

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.069 
so far this is okay because I'm guessing
cuz<00:00:45.570> it's<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.840> lighter<00:00:46.079> camera<00:00:47.960> so<00:00:50.750> this<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.960> not

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
cuz it's a lighter camera so this is not

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.569 
cuz it's a lighter camera so this is not
the<00:00:52.199> problem<00:00:52.699> also<00:00:53.699> balancing<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.480> way<00:00:55.579> it's

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
the problem also balancing this way it's

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.130 
the problem also balancing this way it's
not<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> problem<00:00:57.030> as<00:00:57.239> well<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:57.780> not<00:00:57.899> going

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
not a problem as well it's not going

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.959 
not a problem as well it's not going
backward<00:00:58.649> for<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.129> seems<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.460> be<00:00:59.550> staying<00:00:59.820> in

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
backward for it seems to be staying in

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.860 
backward for it seems to be staying in
the<00:01:00.090> same<00:01:00.270> place<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:02.359> yes<00:01:03.359> as<00:01:03.480> far<00:01:03.660> as<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
the same place and yes as far as the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.060 
the same place and yes as far as the
roll<00:01:04.640> that's<00:01:05.640> okay<00:01:06.030> as<00:01:06.240> well<00:01:06.680> cuz<00:01:07.680> whenever<00:01:07.920> I

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
roll that's okay as well cuz whenever I

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.399 
roll that's okay as well cuz whenever I
turn<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.549> stays<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.510> same<00:01:09.990> place<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:12.409> the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
turn it stays in the same place and the

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.100 
turn it stays in the same place and the
yawl<00:01:13.740> portion<00:01:15.860> which<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.780> guess<00:01:18.780> if<00:01:18.960> we're

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
yawl portion which I guess if we're

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.469 
yawl portion which I guess if we're
trying<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.380> Center<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.860> right<00:01:19.920> here<00:01:20.479> y'all

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
trying to Center it right here y'all

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.310 
trying to Center it right here y'all
portion

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
portion

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.350 
portion
Mylene<00:01:23.130> afford<00:01:24.140> me<00:01:25.140> see<00:01:27.409> only<00:01:28.409> afford<00:01:29.360> it

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
Mylene afford me see only afford it

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.399 
Mylene afford me see only afford it
seems<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.780> be<00:01:30.900> staying<00:01:31.880> in<00:01:32.990> a<00:01:33.990> place<00:01:34.140> this

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
seems to be staying in a place this

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.200 
seems to be staying in a place this
whilst<00:01:34.710> we<00:01:34.860> stay<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.430> try<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.240> level<00:01:36.720> this

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
whilst we stay I try to level this

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.520 
whilst we stay I try to level this
portion<00:01:39.210> right<00:01:39.240> here<00:01:39.390> as<00:01:40.140> straight<00:01:40.409> as

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
portion right here as straight as

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.319 
portion right here as straight as
possible<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.979> know<00:01:41.070> before<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.729> had<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.180> little

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
possible I know before I had it a little

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.609 
possible I know before I had it a little
bit<00:01:43.399> balanced<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:45.119> left<00:01:45.600> but<00:01:46.290> I've<00:01:46.439> tried

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
bit balanced to the left but I've tried

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.130 
bit balanced to the left but I've tried
to<00:01:46.710> keep<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.070> straight<00:01:47.700> kind<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.600> like<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.720> 90

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
to keep it straight kind of like a 90

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.249 
to keep it straight kind of like a 90
degree<00:01:49.439> angle<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:50.119> when<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.149> did<00:01:51.390> did<00:01:51.600> this<00:01:51.780> lift

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
degree angle so when I did did this lift

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.789 
degree angle so when I did did this lift
test<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:53.250> didn't<00:01:53.490> go<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.360> right<00:01:54.990> or<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
test it didn't go to the right or the

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.209 
test it didn't go to the right or the
left<00:01:55.979> kind<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.399> stay<00:01:56.549> center<00:01:57.110> but<00:01:58.110> there's<00:01:59.100> one

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
left kind of stay center but there's one

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.289 
left kind of stay center but there's one
to<00:01:59.310> keep<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.579> short<00:01:59.700> cuz<00:01:59.880> I<00:01:59.939> know<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.180> other

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
to keep it short cuz I know the other

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.719 
to keep it short cuz I know the other
videos<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.750> did<00:02:00.930> were<00:02:01.049> pretty<00:02:01.290> long<00:02:01.729> so

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
videos I did were pretty long so

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.819 
videos I did were pretty long so
everything<00:02:03.149> seems<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.509> be<00:02:03.600> bounce<00:02:03.930> I'm<00:02:04.530> using

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
everything seems to be bounce I'm using

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.419 
everything seems to be bounce I'm using
this<00:02:05.130> battery<00:02:05.790> dad<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.600> from<00:02:07.099> cheesy<00:02:08.099> cam

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
this battery dad and from cheesy cam

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.280 
this battery dad and from cheesy cam
suggested<00:02:09.530> so<00:02:10.550> what<00:02:11.550> actually<00:02:11.849> do<00:02:12.060> plug<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.480> in

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
suggested so what actually do plug it in

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.729 
suggested so what actually do plug it in
see<00:02:13.769> what<00:02:13.980> happens<00:02:14.280> when<00:02:14.400> plug<00:02:14.640> in<00:02:14.760> him<00:02:15.739> and

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
see what happens when plug in him and

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:34.070 
see what happens when plug in him and
she<00:02:16.890> do<00:02:17.129> plug<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.580> in<00:02:28.040> started<00:02:29.040> up<00:02:32.900> so<00:02:33.900> that's

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
she do plug it in started up so that's

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.330

well another thing I'm noticing too
because<00:02:36.620> this<00:02:37.620> portion<00:02:37.890> is<00:02:38.220> not<00:02:38.340> level<00:02:38.640> it

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
because this portion is not level it

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.190 
because this portion is not level it
seems<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.690> be<00:02:40.010> well<00:02:41.010> less<00:02:41.190> level<00:02:41.849> two<00:02:42.090> more<00:02:43.019> to

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
seems to be well less level two more to

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.400 
seems to be well less level two more to
the<00:02:43.319> left<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.860> actually<00:02:44.489> leveled<00:02:45.000> evenly<00:02:45.810> so

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
the left and actually leveled evenly so

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.050 
the left and actually leveled evenly so
I<00:02:46.440> don't<00:02:46.650> know<00:02:46.799> if<00:02:47.069> that's<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.579> balancing

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
I don't know if that's the balancing

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.640 
I don't know if that's the balancing
issue<00:02:48.269> as<00:02:48.540> well<00:02:48.750> maybe<00:02:49.140> you<00:02:49.260> guys<00:02:49.379> could<00:02:49.590> help

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
issue as well maybe you guys could help

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.990 
issue as well maybe you guys could help
me<00:02:49.890> out<00:02:49.920> on<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.390> but<00:02:51.390> I<00:02:51.840> do<00:02:52.530> fly<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:53.310> does<00:02:53.700> seem

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
me out on that but I do fly it does seem

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.740 
me out on that but I do fly it does seem
like<00:02:54.239> it's<00:02:54.959> more<00:02:55.260> leaning<00:02:55.650> towards<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.750> left

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
like it's more leaning towards the left

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.720 
like it's more leaning towards the left
side<00:02:57.989> than<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.319> right<00:02:58.349> side<00:02:58.530> cuz<00:02:59.400> if<00:02:59.489> we<00:02:59.579> can

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
side than the right side cuz if we can

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.949 
side than the right side cuz if we can
see<00:02:59.879> it<00:03:00.000> if<00:03:00.870> we<00:03:01.019> line<00:03:01.260> up<00:03:01.290> king-tv<00:03:02.780> towards<00:03:03.780> it

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
see it if we line up king-tv towards it

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.720 
see it if we line up king-tv towards it
it<00:03:04.170> feels<00:03:04.379> like<00:03:04.500> it's<00:03:04.680> on<00:03:04.739> an<00:03:04.890> even<00:03:05.190> horizon

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
it feels like it's on an even horizon

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.059 
it feels like it's on an even horizon
you<00:03:06.510> can<00:03:06.569> see<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:06.900> this<00:03:07.049> side<00:03:07.319> over<00:03:07.500> here<00:03:07.650> is

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
you can see that this side over here is

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.670 
you can see that this side over here is
a<00:03:08.099> little<00:03:08.340> bit<00:03:08.569> lean<00:03:09.569> to<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.109> left<00:03:10.140> more<00:03:10.650> than

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
a little bit lean to the left more than

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.349 
a little bit lean to the left more than
actually<00:03:11.280> this<00:03:11.519> side<00:03:11.760> so<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.090> don't<00:03:12.269> know

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
actually this side so I don't know

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.479 
actually this side so I don't know
what's<00:03:12.540> causing<00:03:12.690> that<00:03:12.930> even<00:03:13.500> though<00:03:13.590> when<00:03:13.799> you

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
what's causing that even though when you

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.670 
what's causing that even though when you
know<00:03:14.579> you<00:03:14.700> saw<00:03:14.849> in<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.239> video<00:03:15.810> just<00:03:16.260> before

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
know you saw in the video just before

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.750 
know you saw in the video just before
that<00:03:17.389> everything<00:03:18.389> seems<00:03:18.599> to<00:03:18.720> be<00:03:18.840> balanced<00:03:19.260> how

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
that everything seems to be balanced how

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.629 
that everything seems to be balanced how
the<00:03:20.760> Internet<00:03:21.200> specifies<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:22.980> this<00:03:23.310> is<00:03:23.459> the

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
the Internet specifies it so this is the

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.240 
the Internet specifies it so this is the
hunka<00:03:24.090> in<00:03:24.239> this<00:03:24.389> video<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:24.989> so<00:03:25.709> you<00:03:25.769> can<00:03:25.950> see

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
hunka in this video and so you can see

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.490 
hunka in this video and so you can see
that<00:03:26.519> that's<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.359> portion<00:03:27.750> I'm<00:03:28.079> dealing<00:03:28.470> with

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
that that's the portion I'm dealing with

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.699 
that that's the portion I'm dealing with
now<00:03:28.799> as<00:03:29.040> far<00:03:29.250> as<00:03:29.310> how<00:03:30.000> balanced<00:03:30.599> everything<00:03:30.840> so

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
now as far as how balanced everything so

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.740 
now as far as how balanced everything so
if<00:03:31.799> I'm<00:03:31.919> doing<00:03:31.950> something<00:03:32.340> wrong<00:03:32.700> or<00:03:33.000> if<00:03:33.480> you

YouTube as you can see from the the

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.640 
YouTube as you can see from the the
first<00:03:52.310> video<00:03:52.580> we<00:03:52.670> took<00:03:52.849> on<00:03:53.390> the<00:03:53.480> sidewalk<00:03:53.959> and

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
first video we took on the sidewalk and

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.140 
first video we took on the sidewalk and
what<00:03:54.769> I've<00:03:54.860> noticed<00:03:54.890> is<00:03:55.280> a<00:03:55.310> lot<00:03:55.550> of<00:03:55.670> shake<00:03:55.910> in

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
what I've noticed is a lot of shake in

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.119 
what I've noticed is a lot of shake in
the<00:03:56.360> gimbal<00:03:56.750> so<00:03:56.989> the<00:03:57.230> skin<00:03:57.500> was<00:03:57.620> not<00:03:57.769> running

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
the gimbal so the skin was not running

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:00.190 
the gimbal so the skin was not running
as<00:03:58.250> smoothly<00:03:58.550> as<00:03:58.790> I<00:03:58.819> see<00:03:59.120> from<00:03:59.420> other<00:03:59.720> YouTube

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
as smoothly as I see from other YouTube

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.759 
as smoothly as I see from other YouTube
videos<00:04:00.620> or<00:04:00.860> even<00:04:00.890> venial<00:04:01.310> videos<00:04:01.910> so<00:04:02.769> because

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
videos or even venial videos so because

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:05.710 
videos or even venial videos so because
he<00:04:03.890> has<00:04:03.980> a<00:04:04.010> lot<00:04:04.190> of<00:04:04.280> shake<00:04:04.519> in<00:04:04.790> the<00:04:05.300> vertical

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
he has a lot of shake in the vertical

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.520 
he has a lot of shake in the vertical
movement<00:04:05.980> so<00:04:06.980> in<00:04:07.790> these<00:04:08.209> first<00:04:08.269> two<00:04:08.750> portions

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
movement so in these first two portions

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.970 
movement so in these first two portions
of<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:09.739> video<00:04:09.890> you'll<00:04:10.340> see<00:04:10.810> that<00:04:11.810> will<00:04:12.769> shake

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
of the video you'll see that will shake

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:27.460 
of the video you'll see that will shake
I'm<00:04:13.129> actually<00:04:13.280> talking<00:04:13.549> about<00:04:26.020> so<00:04:27.020> as<00:04:27.260> we

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
I'm actually talking about so as we

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.350 
I'm actually talking about so as we
proceed<00:04:27.889> I<00:04:28.070> did<00:04:28.280> a<00:04:28.310> running<00:04:28.729> test<00:04:28.970> and<00:04:29.270> then

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
proceed I did a running test and then

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.640 
proceed I did a running test and then
with<00:04:29.450> this<00:04:29.570> running<00:04:29.810> test<00:04:30.110> is<00:04:30.320> to<00:04:30.410> see<00:04:30.620> if

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
with this running test is to see if

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.040 
with this running test is to see if
we'll<00:04:30.889> be<00:04:31.010> similar<00:04:31.400> to<00:04:31.430> what<00:04:31.580> I<00:04:31.729> see<00:04:32.060> on<00:04:32.419> other

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
we'll be similar to what I see on other

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.680 
we'll be similar to what I see on other
like<00:04:33.620> I<00:04:33.710> said<00:04:33.889> YouTube<00:04:34.310> and<00:04:34.580> Vimeo<00:04:34.760> pages<00:04:35.479> so

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
like I said YouTube and Vimeo pages so

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.110 
like I said YouTube and Vimeo pages so
as<00:04:36.590> you<00:04:36.740> can<00:04:36.830> see<00:04:36.889> with<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.160> video<00:04:37.400> running

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
as you can see with the video running

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.390 
as you can see with the video running
test<00:04:38.500> it's<00:04:39.500> completely<00:04:39.979> shaky

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
test it's completely shaky

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.210 
test it's completely shaky
there's<00:04:40.580> no<00:04:40.729> smoothness<00:04:41.240> in<00:04:41.389> the<00:04:41.510> video<00:04:41.780> and

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
there's no smoothness in the video and

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.969 
there's no smoothness in the video and
then<00:04:43.220> lastly<00:04:43.580> I<00:04:43.669> did<00:04:43.910> another<00:04:44.500> running<00:04:45.500> test<00:04:45.770> -

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979
