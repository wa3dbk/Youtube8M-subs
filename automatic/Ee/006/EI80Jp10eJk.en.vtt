00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.020
 present a recipe in ushuaia for 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.630
 realize them you will need 100 oars 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.720
 salt anchovies if you do not have any 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.689
 you misunderstand the anchovies to him 810 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.329
 liters of olive oil 25 grams of crumb 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.779
 of bread a teaspoon the 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:34.469
 cape 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:38.140
 a tablespoon of wine vinegar 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.090
 a clove of garlic and a blazer first 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.309
 stage treats rooms and anchovies 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.500
 so I put them in a container 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.260
 I cover back I made thirty and a little 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.850
 you can do it too by doing them 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.790
 rooms and under a stream of water at 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.590
 above your sink 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.070
 After three changes of water 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.810
 anchovy 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.880
 I will be able to take it off and train 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:02.890
 on the contrary like that and we shoot we did not 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:08.920
 do not even need a knife remove the 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:14.259
 kill that nets the inside as 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.759
 this frees you and I keep that but 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.469
 in choices are finished stack all 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.920
 the edges we will go to the stage 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:19.869
 next 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.499
 third step i'm going to soak 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:26.670
 granny bath with a little bit of water 

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:26.670
 like this for their flight 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.389
 once she's soft I'll 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.389
 disgusted strongly 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.979
 here is gaillard for just now 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.679
 next I'm going to gather all the 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:07.359
 ingredients and pass them to the blender 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:07.359
 ashamed but we choose grandma as 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:26.540
 him but there he I cut in 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:27.920
 little pieces and 4é him now we 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.510
 will continue and move everything seems 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.660
 ender until the consistency or 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.660
 him 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.170
 And here's the result 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.120
 so the anchoïade has a good consistency 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.099
 in ointment like that so it's fine 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.659
 to post we can go to laveyron 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.459
 now so if you have evidence 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.840
 and with anchovy are liquid gambling dens 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.849
 or add a little bit of not 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.620
