00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
 okubo everyone sings we take 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.650
 like a new video this time 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.600
 it's to show you how to put 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.860
 correctly gaiters and protects 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:16.350
 wanted so these damage seem like 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.609
 this then it is necessary that the scratch as 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.760
 those shall be placed outside 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:25.380
 see here the redis shoots here he goes 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.779
 coming was happening outside 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.720
 if it's like that and it's going to be 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.020
 inwardly it 's not going we're coming 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.750
 replace here all good and we will do it 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.850
 slide until there you see 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.059
 to find his position 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.710
 Then we come to tighten scratches 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.530
 feels too tight but so that 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.800
 it sounds good and we do the same with the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.800
 other members 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:02.120
 hop hop or ten gigs to protect them 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.680
 ball is a little the same principle and 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.560
 it's a bit more elusive so 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:14.630
 it's the same and the scratch that closes 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:17.600
 outward honda this one 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.830
 you're slipping we 'll be doing well 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:26.380
 place and our game the same and talk about 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.380
 your side that's all stupid 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.770
 to see if your gaiters fit her 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.990
 at the size of your desired horse 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.550
 lift your leg and we see so banal if 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.540
 it stuck at this level is that the 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:52.090
 gaiter is too big 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.090
 in fact no, but you stepped on me
