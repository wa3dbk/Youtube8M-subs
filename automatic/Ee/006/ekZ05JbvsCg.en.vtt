 Lodente clinic and today I will tell you 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.930
 about new technology digital design bold 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.420
 think you can build a house without 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.020
 project and sew a dress without a certain 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.910
 style is unlikely to achieve 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.170
 result at least so that everyone 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.140
 process participants 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.110
 clearly imagined him 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.310
 the result is simply necessary 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.590
 dentistry however as in almost all 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.060
 mental medicine 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.070
 the final result is evaluated after the fact 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.390
 large telecommuting often 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.490
 patient surprise 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.440
 but sobinka many gives us the opportunity 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.329
 look into the future and do without 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.489
 stress the patient see from the side 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.470
 your updated smile before starting work 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.950
 the doctor and his team are correct 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.170
 plan therapeutic measures 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:01.920
 smile architecture is a whole science and so 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.320
 what is the essence of technology for consultation 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.149
 the doctor takes a series of photographs of the patient and 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.950
 removes pussy top and bottom 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.229
 jaws when you handle 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.299
 special program allowing upward 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.609
 perfect settings future smiles on 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.659
 based on the principles of biometrics and taking into account 

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:18.030
 patient wishes 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.950
 all calculations are performed in real 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.749
 scale and are a finished project 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.380
 for further work of the doctor and dental 

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:24.389
 equipment 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.429
 after digital processing and work 

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:28.979
 dental technician new sounds of laziness 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:31.170
 varta power train former without treatment 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.880
 last we are doing a new series 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.039
 photographs result 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.409
 even before treatment begins , we get 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:40.279
 patient photos with new teeth and 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.959
 You can compare them with what was before 

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:44.939
 the project of the future teeth model to the patient in 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:46.649
 Digital view of the house, you can safely 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.899
 look once relatives 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.880
 friends close possible proposals 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.560
 option you will accept unconditionally as well 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.659
 can pass and make adjustments 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.429
 us at this stage to do it absolutely 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.499
 easy and that's when the design is approved we 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.450
 calmly proceed to treatment and you 

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:05.789
 you know what the result is and why you 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.799
 pay money the doctor his team understands 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.670
 what expects them not to bullet 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.340
 need to perform 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.510
 to achieve the desired result 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.099
 digital smile design 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.379
 will be at a new level of communication process 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.480
 between the doctor and patient the patient does not go 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.750
 blindly for a doctor about trusting he is a partner 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.680
 understanding process and knowing result 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.750
 smile visualization also makes it easier 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.030
 communication in the team of doctors and technicians 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.849
 it all reduces stress and increases 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.170
 comfort and reliability of the treatment process 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.950
 Detailed information can be obtained from 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.849
