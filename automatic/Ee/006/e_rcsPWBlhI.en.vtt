some bubbles to pretend like our turtle

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.770 
some bubbles to pretend like our turtle
in<00:01:54.410> water<00:01:54.710> and<00:01:55.670> then<00:01:55.820> of<00:01:55.940> course<00:01:55.970> you<00:01:56.360> would<00:01:56.480> do

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
in water and then of course you would do

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.130 
in water and then of course you would do
all<00:01:57.020> of<00:01:57.200> these<00:01:57.380> down<00:01:57.680> the<00:01:57.740> kids<00:01:58.220> went<00:01:58.460> too<00:01:58.580> bad

and then there you go we've got an

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.170 
and then there you go we've got an
example<00:02:02.090> for<00:02:02.360> a<00:02:02.420> collage<00:02:02.750> Skippy
