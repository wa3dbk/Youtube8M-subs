to put the holes in it this is a
standard<00:01:02.920> pennywhistle<00:01:03.910> this<00:01:04.030> is<00:01:04.149> a<00:01:04.239> I

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
standard pennywhistle this is a I

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.870 
standard pennywhistle this is a I
commercially<00:01:05.049> made<00:01:05.170> one<00:01:05.379> and<00:01:05.579> as<00:01:06.579> you<00:01:06.639> can<00:01:06.819> see

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
commercially made one and as you can see

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.529 
commercially made one and as you can see
there<00:01:07.630> are<00:01:07.869> six<00:01:08.380> holes<00:01:08.619> in<00:01:08.889> it<00:01:09.039> and<00:01:09.299> they<00:01:10.299> play

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:10.539 
there are six holes in it and they play

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:19.679 
there are six holes in it and they play
a<00:01:10.749> standard<00:01:11.319> standard<00:01:12.280> scale<00:01:18.299> okay<00:01:19.299> so<00:01:19.359> we're

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
a standard standard scale okay so we're

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:21.270 
a standard standard scale okay so we're
going<00:01:19.810> to<00:01:19.899> seek<00:01:20.170> to<00:01:20.200> transfer<00:01:20.799> that<00:01:20.950> scale

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
going to seek to transfer that scale

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.120 
going to seek to transfer that scale
from<00:01:22.240> this<00:01:22.450> whistle<00:01:22.780> onto<00:01:23.409> any<00:01:23.709> other<00:01:23.920> size

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
from this whistle onto any other size

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.789 
from this whistle onto any other size
missile<00:01:24.490> okay<00:01:24.969> I'm<00:01:25.420> going<00:01:26.200> to<00:01:26.259> use<00:01:26.409> a<00:01:26.439> cheat

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
missile okay I'm going to use a cheat

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.639 
missile okay I'm going to use a cheat
for<00:01:27.009> that<00:01:27.429> a<00:01:27.929> template<00:01:28.929> which<00:01:29.079> relies<00:01:29.439> to

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
for that a template which relies to

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.139 
for that a template which relies to
transfer<00:01:30.009> under<00:01:30.159> whistle<00:01:30.549> is<00:01:30.609> not<00:01:30.759> just<00:01:30.999> of

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
transfer under whistle is not just of

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.149 
transfer under whistle is not just of
this<00:01:31.719> length<00:01:31.959> but<00:01:32.259> of<00:01:32.350> any<00:01:32.499> length<00:01:32.740> and<00:01:33.039> the

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
this length but of any length and the

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.609 
this length but of any length and the
holes<00:01:33.340> will<00:01:33.520> always<00:01:33.729> be<00:01:33.850> in<00:01:33.939> relation<00:01:34.560> now<00:01:35.560> we

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
holes will always be in relation now we

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.830 
holes will always be in relation now we
know<00:01:35.889> that<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.189> holes<00:01:36.429> are<00:01:36.729> placed<00:01:37.029> according

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
know that the holes are placed according

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.129 
know that the holes are placed according
to<00:01:38.020> a<00:01:38.049> certain<00:01:38.529> percentage<00:01:39.009> of<00:01:39.219> the<00:01:40.179> of<00:01:40.420> the

00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:41.139 
to a certain percentage of the of the

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:42.959 
to a certain percentage of the of the
overall<00:01:41.439> length<00:01:41.770> and<00:01:42.039> the<00:01:42.189> overall<00:01:42.459> length<00:01:42.729> is

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
overall length and the overall length is

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.300 
overall length and the overall length is
a<00:01:43.359> distance<00:01:43.810> that<00:01:43.929> goes<00:01:44.139> from<00:01:44.350> here<00:01:44.950> this

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
a distance that goes from here this

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.449 
a distance that goes from here this
sharp<00:01:45.880> edge<00:01:46.060> down<00:01:46.869> to<00:01:47.380> what<00:01:48.069> they<00:01:48.159> call<00:01:48.340> the

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
sharp edge down to what they call the

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:50.370 
sharp edge down to what they call the
distal<00:01:48.880> end<00:01:49.119> the<00:01:49.569> open<00:01:49.840> end<00:01:49.990> of<00:01:50.079> the<00:01:50.170> flute

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
distal end the open end of the flute

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.309 
distal end the open end of the flute
okay<00:01:51.039> so<00:01:51.099> this<00:01:51.369> is<00:01:51.549> what<00:01:52.209> we<00:01:52.359> would<00:01:52.450> call<00:01:52.509> 100%

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
okay so this is what we would call 100%

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.940 
okay so this is what we would call 100%
on<00:01:54.179> the<00:01:55.179> distance<00:01:55.539> from<00:01:55.599> here<00:01:55.990> to<00:01:56.679> the<00:01:56.799> very

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
on the distance from here to the very

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.669 
on the distance from here to the very
last<00:01:57.189> hole<00:01:57.579> this<00:01:58.299> is<00:01:58.479> 83%<00:01:59.609> this<00:02:00.609> is<00:02:00.909> 73%<00:02:01.679> this

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
last hole this is 83% this is 73% this

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.709 
last hole this is 83% this is 73% this
is<00:02:02.859> 68%<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:04.509> is<00:02:04.659> 58%<00:02:05.259> this<00:02:06.189> is<00:02:06.340> 50%<00:02:06.700> and<00:02:07.179> this

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
is 68% this is 58% this is 50% and this

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:11.930 
is 68% this is 58% this is 50% and this
is<00:02:07.929> 43%<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:09.130> those<00:02:09.789> are<00:02:09.970> all<00:02:10.090> obviously<00:02:10.329> as<00:02:10.750> a

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
is 43% and those are all obviously as a

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.540 
is 43% and those are all obviously as a
as<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.240> proportion<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:13.020> this<00:02:13.500> 100%<00:02:14.130> length

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
as a proportion of this 100% length

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.490 
as a proportion of this 100% length
which<00:02:14.760> goes<00:02:14.970> from<00:02:15.150> here<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:16.200> here<00:02:16.410> so<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:19.380> easy

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
which goes from here to here so the easy

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.220 
which goes from here to here so the easy
way<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.710> do<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.610> take<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.820> simple

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
way to do that is to take a simple

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.000 
way to do that is to take a simple
elastic<00:02:22.230> band<00:02:22.410> as<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.770> can<00:02:22.920> see<00:02:24.800> there<00:02:25.800> right

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
elastic band as you can see there right

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.460 
elastic band as you can see there right
so<00:02:26.610> let's<00:02:26.760> just<00:02:27.330> let<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.570> in<00:02:27.690> its<00:02:27.810> natural<00:02:27.960> flat

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
so let's just let it in its natural flat

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.870 
so let's just let it in its natural flat
instead<00:02:28.880> alongside<00:02:29.880> a<00:02:30.390> ruler<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.880> we're

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
instead alongside a ruler and we're

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.250 
instead alongside a ruler and we're
going<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.060> mark<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.450> point<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:33.990> we're<00:02:34.140> going

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
going to mark a point that we're going

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.990 
going to mark a point that we're going
to<00:02:34.320> call<00:02:34.530> point<00:02:35.340> zero<00:02:35.960> on<00:02:37.160> this<00:02:38.160> point<00:02:38.460> here<00:02:38.760> at

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
to call point zero on this point here at

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.630 
to call point zero on this point here at
the<00:02:39.090> very<00:02:39.210> end<00:02:39.510> is<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.350> equivalent<00:02:40.830> of<00:02:40.950> where

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
the very end is the equivalent of where

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.530 
the very end is the equivalent of where
this<00:02:42.630> sharp<00:02:42.960> it<00:02:43.140> is<00:02:43.580> okay<00:02:44.610> equipment<00:02:45.270> over<00:02:45.330> the

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
sharp it is here no because we're not

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.040 
sharp it is here no because we're not
going<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.730> make<00:02:50.880> whistles<00:02:51.510> which<00:02:51.690> are<00:02:51.870> any

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
going to make whistles which are any

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.530 
going to make whistles which are any
shorter<00:02:52.560> than<00:02:53.250> over<00:02:53.580> 20<00:02:53.910> centimeters<00:02:54.390> and

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
shorter than over 20 centimeters and

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.010 
shorter than over 20 centimeters and
most<00:02:54.690> them<00:02:54.840> will<00:02:54.960> be<00:02:55.110> substantially<00:02:55.710> longer

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
most them will be substantially longer

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.410 
most them will be substantially longer
we're<00:02:58.020> going<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.320> take<00:02:58.500> 20<00:02:59.220> as<00:02:59.370> our<00:02:59.820> basis<00:03:00.270> so

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
we're going to take 20 as our basis so

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.950 
we're going to take 20 as our basis so
that<00:03:00.570> is<00:03:00.690> our<00:03:00.810> 100%<00:03:01.380> is<00:03:02.360> 20<00:03:03.360> centimeters<00:03:03.810> or

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
that is our 100% is 20 centimeters or

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.230 
that is our 100% is 20 centimeters or
200<00:03:04.410> millimeters<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:04.980> if<00:03:05.640> we<00:03:05.730> know<00:03:05.850> that<00:03:05.880> the

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
200 millimeters and if we know that the

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.130 
200 millimeters and if we know that the
bottom<00:03:06.570> hole<00:03:06.770> this<00:03:07.770> hole<00:03:07.830> here<00:03:08.370> is<00:03:08.780> 83<00:03:09.780> percent

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
bottom hole this hole here is 83 percent

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.650 
bottom hole this hole here is 83 percent
of<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:11.130> way<00:03:11.220> along<00:03:11.490> from<00:03:12.060> there<00:03:12.210> to<00:03:12.360> there

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
of the way along from there to there

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.390 
of the way along from there to there
so<00:03:13.110> 83<00:03:14.420> percent<00:03:15.420> of<00:03:15.600> 20<00:03:16.200> is<00:03:16.320> sixteen<00:03:16.890> point<00:03:17.160> six

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
so 83 percent of 20 is sixteen point six

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.479 
so 83 percent of 20 is sixteen point six
so<00:03:18.209> we<00:03:18.330> count<00:03:18.540> down<00:03:18.780> from<00:03:19.230> here<00:03:19.500> from<00:03:20.010> our<00:03:20.250> our

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
so we count down from here from our our

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.750 
so we count down from here from our our
mark<00:03:21.090> down<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.930> sixteen<00:03:22.380> point<00:03:22.800> six<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.310> we

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
mark down to sixteen point six and we

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.479 
mark down to sixteen point six and we
make<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:23.940> mark<00:03:24.239> on<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.690> elastic<00:03:25.050> band<00:03:25.230> our<00:03:26.160> next

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
make a mark on the elastic band our next

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.390 
make a mark on the elastic band our next
one<00:03:26.610> is<00:03:26.820> 73%<00:03:27.510> so<00:03:28.380> that's<00:03:28.530> fourteen<00:03:28.980> point<00:03:29.220> six

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
one is 73% so that's fourteen point six

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.060 
one is 73% so that's fourteen point six
we<00:03:30.120> mark<00:03:30.300> that<00:03:30.510> went<00:03:30.660> on<00:03:30.720> as<00:03:30.870> well<00:03:31.020> our<00:03:31.650> next

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
we mark that went on as well our next

with<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.240> edge<00:04:39.389> of<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.990> sharp<00:04:40.229> bit<00:04:40.410> get<00:04:41.250> my

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
with the edge of the sharp bit get my

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.210 
with the edge of the sharp bit get my
other<00:04:41.550> fingernail<00:04:42.060> on<00:04:42.440> this<00:04:43.440> bottom<00:04:44.010> line

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
other fingernail on this bottom line

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.920 
other fingernail on this bottom line
here<00:04:44.840> yeah<00:04:45.870> all<00:04:46.410> right<00:04:46.590> here<00:04:46.770> and<00:04:47.690> stretch<00:04:48.690> it

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
here yeah all right here and stretch it

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.180 
here yeah all right here and stretch it
so<00:04:49.110> that<00:04:49.289> matches<00:04:49.440> the<00:04:49.740> length<00:04:49.919> of<00:04:50.100> the

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
so that matches the length of the

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.610 
so that matches the length of the
whistle<00:04:50.460> you'll<00:04:50.910> see<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.419> I<00:04:51.510> let<00:04:52.289> the<00:04:52.410> holes

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
whistle you'll see and I let the holes

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.790 
whistle you'll see and I let the holes
where<00:04:52.830> I've<00:04:52.889> marked<00:04:53.070> them<00:04:53.419> much<00:04:54.419> roughly<00:04:55.320> the

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
where I've marked them much roughly the

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.100 
where I've marked them much roughly the
length<00:04:56.039> of<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.850> whistle<00:04:57.120> okay<00:04:57.870> now<00:04:57.990> there

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
length of the whistle okay now there

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.629 
length of the whistle okay now there
will<00:04:58.169> be<00:04:58.229> slight<00:04:58.470> adjustments<00:04:58.949> you'll<00:04:59.400> notice

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
will be slight adjustments you'll notice

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:00.920 
will be slight adjustments you'll notice
here<00:04:59.789> for<00:04:59.940> example<00:05:00.240> on<00:05:00.330> this<00:05:00.600> commercial

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
here for example on this commercial

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.040 
here for example on this commercial
whistle<00:05:01.410> that<00:05:02.039> the<00:05:02.460> this<00:05:03.419> hole<00:05:03.630> here<00:05:03.840> is

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
whistle that the this hole here is

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.020 
whistle that the this hole here is
slightly<00:05:04.380> smaller<00:05:04.770> and<00:05:04.979> the<00:05:05.490> reason<00:05:05.639> for<00:05:05.910> that

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
slightly smaller and the reason for that

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.800 
slightly smaller and the reason for that
is<00:05:06.300> as<00:05:06.810> my<00:05:07.789> template<00:05:08.789> tells<00:05:09.030> me<00:05:09.210> is<00:05:09.360> that<00:05:09.660> the

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
is as my template tells me is that the

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.170 
is as my template tells me is that the
hole<00:05:10.080> should<00:05:10.470> be<00:05:10.650> lower<00:05:11.100> down<00:05:11.370> the<00:05:11.880> problem

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
hole should be lower down the problem

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.760 
hole should be lower down the problem
with<00:05:12.300> that<00:05:12.330> is<00:05:12.630> the<00:05:12.780> holes<00:05:13.020> are<00:05:13.289> very<00:05:13.320> close

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
with that is the holes are very close

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.409 
with that is the holes are very close
together<00:05:13.979> and<00:05:14.310> therefore<00:05:15.030> you<00:05:15.090> need<00:05:15.210> to<00:05:15.300> move

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
together and therefore you need to move

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.089 
together and therefore you need to move
the<00:05:15.570> whole<00:05:15.720> very<00:05:15.990> slightly<00:05:16.289> away<00:05:16.560> just<00:05:17.010> to

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
the whole very slightly away just to

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:18.230 
the whole very slightly away just to
give<00:05:17.220> you<00:05:17.280> a<00:05:17.310> bit<00:05:17.400> of<00:05:17.430> extra<00:05:17.669> room<00:05:17.760> to<00:05:18.000> get<00:05:18.090> your

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
give you a bit of extra room to get your

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.320 
give you a bit of extra room to get your
fingers<00:05:18.539> in<00:05:19.070> so<00:05:20.070> unpack<00:05:20.400> by<00:05:20.610> by<00:05:20.940> moving<00:05:21.120> the

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
fingers in so unpack by by moving the

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.600 
fingers in so unpack by by moving the
hole<00:05:21.449> away<00:05:21.599> then<00:05:22.260> obviously<00:05:22.440> you<00:05:22.800> would<00:05:22.949> make

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
hole away then obviously you would make

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.189 
hole away then obviously you would make
that<00:05:23.760> make<00:05:24.120> that<00:05:24.240> into<00:05:24.510> a<00:05:24.539> higher<00:05:24.780> note<00:05:24.990> so<00:05:25.139> you

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 
that make that into a higher note so you

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:26.900 
that make that into a higher note so you
need<00:05:25.349> to<00:05:25.440> compensate<00:05:25.650> for<00:05:26.130> that<00:05:26.190> by<00:05:26.430> making

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
need to compensate for that by making

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.990 
need to compensate for that by making
the<00:05:27.090> hole<00:05:27.240> slightly<00:05:27.720> smaller<00:05:28.020> okay<00:05:28.979> so<00:05:29.580> as<00:05:29.880> I

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
the hole slightly smaller okay so as I

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.029 
the hole slightly smaller okay so as I
said<00:05:30.210> fingernail<00:05:31.050> on<00:05:31.080> one<00:05:31.349> end<00:05:31.530> fingernail<00:05:31.949> on

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
said fingernail on one end fingernail on

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:33.379 
said fingernail on one end fingernail on
the<00:05:32.130> other<00:05:32.250> stretch<00:05:32.669> to<00:05:32.910> the<00:05:33.030> length<00:05:33.180> of<00:05:33.300> the

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
the other stretch to the length of the

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.750 
the other stretch to the length of the
whistle<00:05:33.660> and<00:05:33.870> the<00:05:34.229> holes<00:05:34.440> so<00:05:34.800> therefore<00:05:35.639> be

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
whistle and the holes so therefore be

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.490 
whistle and the holes so therefore be
laid<00:05:36.150> out<00:05:36.270> for<00:05:36.449> you<00:05:36.570> okay

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
laid out for you okay

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.710
