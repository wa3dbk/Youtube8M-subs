00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.430 

you<00:06:09.560> can<00:06:09.740> add<00:06:09.860> in<00:06:10.010> vibrato<00:06:10.370> um<00:06:10.850> I<00:06:11.300> think<00:06:11.750> it

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 
you can add in vibrato um I think it

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.900 
you can add in vibrato um I think it
sounds<00:06:12.560> better<00:06:12.770> but<00:06:12.890> if<00:06:13.520> you<00:06:13.640> want<00:06:13.760> to<00:06:13.790> take
