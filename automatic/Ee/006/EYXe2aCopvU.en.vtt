there<00:00:33.149> initializing<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.110> becoming<00:00:34.489> dynamic

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
there initializing you becoming dynamic

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.670 
there initializing you becoming dynamic
disk<00:00:35.700> drives<00:00:36.469> yeah

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
disk drives yeah

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.709 
disk drives yeah
finish<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.460> they<00:00:38.550> are<00:00:38.700> all<00:00:38.879> online<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.629> I'm

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
finish and they are all online and I'm

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.200 
finish and they are all online and I'm
able<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.320> be<00:00:40.559> creating<00:00:40.950> volumes<00:00:41.340> within<00:00:41.879> them

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
able to be creating volumes within them

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.840 
able to be creating volumes within them
ok<00:00:42.629> one<00:00:43.110> last<00:00:43.140> thing<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.680> say<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.309> within

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
ok one last thing to say is that within

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.970 
ok one last thing to say is that within
basic<00:00:45.480> disk<00:00:45.719> drives<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.379> are<00:00:46.500> creating

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
basic disk drives you are creating

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.060 
basic disk drives you are creating
partitions<00:00:47.579> but<00:00:48.090> within<00:00:48.860> dynamic<00:00:49.860> disk

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
partitions but within dynamic disk

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.250 
partitions but within dynamic disk
drives<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:51.030> are<00:00:51.180> not<00:00:51.360> creating<00:00:51.690> partitions

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
drives you are not creating partitions

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.200 
drives you are not creating partitions
anymore<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.039> are<00:00:53.070> creating<00:00:53.550> volume<00:00:53.760> so

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
anymore and you are creating volume so

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.340 
anymore and you are creating volume so
this<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> difference<00:00:55.050> between<00:00:55.170> a

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
this is the difference between a

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.630 
this is the difference between a
partition<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.190> volume<00:00:56.520> right<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:58.640> to

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
partition and a volume right so to

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.910 
partition and a volume right so to
proceed<00:00:59.820> ahead<00:01:00.059> let's<00:01:00.600> write<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.199> right<00:01:01.649> click

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
proceed ahead let's write a right click

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.479 
proceed ahead let's write a right click
on<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.520> unallocated<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:04.439> space<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.979> this

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
on the unallocated this space of this

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.469 
on the unallocated this space of this
and<00:01:05.900> this<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.280> dynamic<00:01:08.280> disk<00:01:08.490> drive<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.909> click

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
and this to dynamic disk drive and click

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.950 
and this to dynamic disk drive and click
new<00:01:09.689> volume<00:01:10.610> alright<00:01:11.610> we<00:01:12.210> click<00:01:12.450> Next

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
new volume alright we click Next

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.830 
new volume alright we click Next
as<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.500> see<00:01:13.680> here<00:01:13.950> I've<00:01:14.189> got<00:01:14.360> simple<00:01:15.360> spans

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
as you see here I've got simple spans

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.170 
as you see here I've got simple spans
stripped<00:01:16.259> mirrored<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.920> raid<00:01:17.100> 5<00:01:17.400> option<00:01:18.030> to

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.960 
partitions and there's no more extended
partition<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.210> what<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> simple<00:01:28.970> volume

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
partition so what is a simple volume

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.660 
partition so what is a simple volume
well<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.600> simple<00:01:30.900> volume<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.890> volume<00:01:32.520> that

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
well a simple volume is a volume that

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.490 
well a simple volume is a volume that
you<00:01:32.850> would<00:01:33.060> be<00:01:33.180> creating<00:01:33.630> with<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.140> with

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
you would be creating with and in with

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.499 
you would be creating with and in with
within<00:01:34.890> dynamic<00:01:35.640> disk<00:01:35.909> drives<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:38.299> which<00:01:39.299> is

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
within dynamic disk drives and which is

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.510 
within dynamic disk drives and which is
which<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.290> which<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.040> could<00:01:41.220> be<00:01:41.400> used

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
which is the which you could be used

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.160 
which is the which you could be used
actually<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.210> free<00:01:42.390> disk<00:01:42.600> space<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.869> create

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
actually the free disk space to create

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.429 
actually the free disk space to create
these<00:01:43.439> simple<00:01:43.920> volumes<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.090> they<00:01:45.869> would<00:01:46.259> be

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
these simple volumes and they would be

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.580 
these simple volumes and they would be
extendable<00:01:47.479> within<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.780> same<00:01:49.049> disk<00:01:49.320> drive

automatically<00:04:52.130> converted<00:04:53.130> into<00:04:53.810> spanned

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
automatically converted into spanned

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.219 
automatically converted into spanned
volumes<00:04:55.979> okay<00:04:56.610> a<00:04:56.789> click<00:04:57.180> finished<00:04:57.569> and<00:04:57.870> as<00:04:58.110> you

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
volumes okay a click finished and as you

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.610 
volumes okay a click finished and as you
see<00:04:58.440> here<00:04:58.800> this<00:04:59.310> is<00:04:59.550> not<00:05:00.030> a<00:05:00.330> simple<00:05:00.810> disk<00:05:01.259> drive

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
see here this is not a simple disk drive

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.980 
see here this is not a simple disk drive
anymore<00:05:01.979> here<00:05:02.400> is<00:05:02.550> a<00:05:02.610> simple<00:05:03.150> volume<00:05:03.690> anymore

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
anymore here is a simple volume anymore

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.100 
anymore here is a simple volume anymore
so<00:05:04.830> it's<00:05:05.270> automatic<00:05:06.270> automatically

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
so it's automatic automatically

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.360 
so it's automatic automatically
converted<00:05:07.650> into<00:05:07.740> a<00:05:07.919> span<00:05:08.280> volume<00:05:08.669> alright<00:05:09.150> so

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
converted into a span volume alright so

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.700 
converted into a span volume alright so
this<00:05:11.370> is<00:05:11.550> a<00:05:11.580> span<00:05:11.909> volume<00:05:12.330> it's<00:05:12.599> actually<00:05:13.560> what

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
this is a span volume it's actually what

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.010 
this is a span volume it's actually what
is<00:05:13.830> the<00:05:13.919> span<00:05:14.130> volume<00:05:14.610> it's<00:05:14.849> a<00:05:15.030> simple<00:05:15.539> volume

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
is the span volume it's a simple volume

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.980 
is the span volume it's a simple volume
that<00:05:16.169> has<00:05:16.229> been<00:05:16.620> extended<00:05:17.330> onto<00:05:18.330> different

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
that has been extended onto different

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.909 
that has been extended onto different
and<00:05:19.729> multiple<00:05:20.729> disk<00:05:21.090> drives<00:05:21.360> okay<00:05:21.750> so<00:05:22.380> again

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
and multiple disk drives okay so again

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.969 
and multiple disk drives okay so again
we<00:05:23.190> would<00:05:23.520> be<00:05:23.699> creating<00:05:24.509> and<00:05:24.840> making<00:05:25.530> another

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
we would be creating and making another

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:27.709 
we would be creating and making another
quick<00:05:26.430> review<00:05:26.820> on<00:05:26.849> how<00:05:27.180> you<00:05:27.240> could<00:05:27.539> actually

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:27.719 
quick review on how you could actually

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:32.029 
quick review on how you could actually
create<00:05:28.340> span<00:05:29.340> volumes<00:05:29.909> without<00:05:30.860> creating<00:05:31.860> a

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
create span volumes without creating a

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:33.830 
create span volumes without creating a
simple<00:05:32.280> volume<00:05:32.759> and<00:05:32.880> extending<00:05:33.300> it<00:05:33.419> with<00:05:33.690> it

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
simple volume and extending it with it

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.680 
simple volume and extending it with it
within<00:05:34.340> multiple<00:05:35.340> disk<00:05:35.610> drives<00:05:35.880> so<00:05:36.479> you

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
within multiple disk drives so you

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.020 
within multiple disk drives so you
choose<00:05:36.870> spanned<00:05:37.259> click<00:05:37.800> Next<00:05:38.250> and<00:05:38.400> as<00:05:38.729> you<00:05:38.849> see

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
choose spanned click Next and as you see

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.370 
choose spanned click Next and as you see
here<00:05:39.889> I'll<00:05:40.889> remove<00:05:41.460> this<00:05:41.729> this<00:05:41.969> 5<00:05:42.330> and<00:05:42.719> add

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530 
don't know why it didn't set at it as I

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.939 
don't know why it didn't set at it as I
chose<00:06:19.949> so<00:06:20.490> now<00:06:21.030> it's<00:06:21.240> now<00:06:21.870> it's<00:06:22.500> working

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270 
140 ok the limit to spanned volumes is

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.350 
140 ok the limit to spanned volumes is
that<00:06:38.450> you're<00:06:38.720> forced<00:06:39.110> to<00:06:39.200> choose<00:06:39.290> 2<00:06:39.740> discs<00:06:40.430> to

that you're forced to choose 2 discs to

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.440 
that you're forced to choose 2 discs to
create<00:06:41.660> your<00:06:41.810> spanned<00:06:42.170> volume<00:06:42.790> so<00:06:43.790> you<00:06:44.090> cannot

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:44.450 
create your spanned volume so you cannot

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.030 
create your spanned volume so you cannot
be<00:06:44.630> actually<00:06:44.990> creating<00:06:45.500> a<00:06:45.590> spanned<00:06:45.890> volume

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:46.040 
be actually creating a spanned volume

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.170 
be actually creating a spanned volume
only<00:06:46.940> within<00:06:47.180> one<00:06:47.630> disk<00:06:47.900> so<00:06:48.740> we<00:06:49.160> chose<00:06:49.400> just

each of them and we click Next and it

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.920 
each of them and we click Next and it

would assign a drive letter we're not

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.750 
would assign a drive letter we're not
going<00:07:00.140> to<00:07:00.230> format<00:07:00.590> it<00:07:00.770> and<00:07:00.950> click<00:07:01.310> Next<00:07:01.610> and

going to format it and click Next and
it's<00:07:01.940> finished

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:02.510 
it's finished

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.410 
it's finished
ok<00:07:03.050> so<00:07:03.470> here<00:07:03.950> we<00:07:04.130> are<00:07:04.550> going<00:07:04.850> to<00:07:05.030> be<00:07:05.180> having

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:11.680 
ok so here we are going to be having
another<00:07:06.700> volume<00:07:07.700> which<00:07:07.820> is<00:07:07.970> named<00:07:08.180> J<00:07:08.570> and<00:07:10.690> here

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:11.690 
another volume which is named J and here

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:16.360 
another volume which is named J and here
as<00:07:11.960> you<00:07:12.260> see<00:07:12.940> named<00:07:13.940> J<00:07:14.480> its<00:07:14.840> span<00:07:15.440> is<00:07:15.800> a<00:07:15.860> spanned

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:16.370 
as you see named J its span is a spanned

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.350 
as you see named J its span is a spanned
volume<00:07:16.490> and<00:07:17.180> it<00:07:17.930> has<00:07:18.110> 310<00:07:19.070> mega<00:07:19.370> megabytes<00:07:20.120> of

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.360 
volume and it has 310 mega megabytes of

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.880 
volume and it has 310 mega megabytes of
disk<00:07:20.960> storage<00:07:21.440> so<00:07:22.630> it's<00:07:23.630> been<00:07:23.930> using<00:07:24.290> 70

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:24.890 
disk storage so it's been using 70

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.100 
disk storage so it's been using 70
megabytes<00:07:25.160> from<00:07:25.610> this<00:07:25.790> to<00:07:26.060> 100<00:07:26.720> megabytes

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.110 
megabytes from this to 100 megabytes

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.570 
megabytes from this to 100 megabytes
from<00:07:27.380> this<00:07:27.530> three<00:07:27.830> one<00:07:28.100> hundred<00:07:28.340> forty

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:28.580 
from this three one hundred forty

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.660 
from this three one hundred forty
megabytes<00:07:28.700> from<00:07:29.210> disk<00:07:29.390> for
