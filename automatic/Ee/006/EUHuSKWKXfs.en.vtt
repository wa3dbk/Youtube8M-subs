00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.180 

I'll<00:05:11.449> copy<00:05:11.660> that<00:05:11.840> also<00:05:12.440> put<00:05:12.620> them<00:05:12.710> up<00:05:12.860> the<00:05:12.979> alt

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
I'll copy that also put them up the alt

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.260 
text let me go ahead and just look while
I'm<00:05:15.919> at<00:05:16.039> it<00:05:16.069> throw<00:05:16.430> it<00:05:16.460> into<00:05:16.639> these<00:05:16.849> other<00:05:17.030> ones

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
I'm at it throw it into these other ones

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.890 
I'm at it throw it into these other ones
and<00:05:17.569> then<00:05:17.750> just<00:05:18.139> change<00:05:18.889> it<00:05:19.569> the<00:05:20.569> end<00:05:20.690> of<00:05:20.780> this

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
and then just change it the end of this

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:27.249 
and then just change it the end of this
say<00:05:22.300> matching<00:05:23.300> his<00:05:23.629> and<00:05:23.900> Mary's<00:05:25.720> and<00:05:26.720> then

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:27.259 
say matching his and Mary's and then

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:32.740 
say matching his and Mary's and then
this<00:05:27.379> one<00:05:27.590> is<00:05:27.740> the<00:05:27.770> black<00:05:28.009> one<00:05:31.419> so<00:05:32.419> I<00:05:32.479> put<00:05:32.659> in

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
this one is the black one so I put in

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.159 
this one is the black one so I put in
there<00:05:32.870> with<00:05:33.020> black<00:05:33.259> I<00:05:33.289> just<00:05:33.710> changed<00:05:33.979> out<00:05:34.159> the

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
there with black I just changed out the

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.899 
there with black I just changed out the
you<00:05:36.169> can<00:05:36.289> see<00:05:36.440> I<00:05:36.500> just<00:05:36.530> had<00:05:37.220> to<00:05:37.310> go<00:05:37.430> back<00:05:37.550> once<00:05:37.789> I

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:37.909 
you can see I just had to go back once I

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:39.339 
you can see I just had to go back once I
pay<00:05:38.090> some<00:05:38.300> hymns<00:05:38.449> go<00:05:38.659> back<00:05:38.780> and<00:05:38.960> change<00:05:39.199> the

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:39.349 
pay some hymns go back and change the

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:41.170 
pay some hymns go back and change the
last<00:05:39.530> part<00:05:39.830> of<00:05:39.949> it<00:05:40.069> so<00:05:40.370> it<00:05:40.430> makes<00:05:40.610> it<00:05:40.729> quicker

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
last part of it so it makes it quicker

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:49.379 
last part of it so it makes it quicker
and<00:05:41.539> then<00:05:42.530> I<00:05:42.560> miss<00:05:42.770> from<00:05:43.419> raspberry<00:05:46.300> writing

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:52.149 

and<00:05:50.389> so<00:05:50.630> we<00:05:51.139> were<00:05:51.199> doing<00:05:51.349> the<00:05:51.560> Navy<00:05:51.770> one<00:05:52.039> I'll

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
and so we were doing the Navy one I'll

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:54.249 
and so we were doing the Navy one I'll
go<00:05:52.280> ahead<00:05:52.370> and<00:05:52.550> set<00:05:52.699> the<00:05:52.940> variation<00:05:53.870> for<00:05:54.050> Navy

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:54.259 
go ahead and set the variation for Navy

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:56.469 
go ahead and set the variation for Navy
to<00:05:54.409> do<00:05:54.500> this<00:05:54.680> and<00:05:55.009> then<00:05:55.130> I<00:05:55.400> can<00:05:56.090> go<00:05:56.210> in<00:05:56.330> and

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
to do this and then I can go in and

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:59.529 
to do this and then I can go in and
really<00:05:56.569> quickly<00:05:56.900> grab<00:05:57.800> the<00:05:58.250> paper<00:05:58.789> bring<00:05:59.240> the

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
really quickly grab the paper bring the

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.439 
really quickly grab the paper bring the
black<00:05:59.750> and<00:05:59.960> paper<00:06:00.139> gray<00:06:00.409> and<00:06:01.400> now<00:06:02.000> the

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
black and paper gray and now the

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:09.969 
black and paper gray and now the
raspberry<00:06:02.930> gray<00:06:03.819> and<00:06:06.490> is<00:06:07.490> this<00:06:07.729> one<00:06:08.860> so<00:06:09.860> then

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:09.979 
raspberry gray and is this one so then

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:11.350 
raspberry gray and is this one so then
I've<00:06:10.069> got<00:06:10.250> all<00:06:10.370> the<00:06:10.460> variations<00:06:11.030> here<00:06:11.180> now<00:06:11.330> I

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
I've got all the variations here now I

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.330 
I've got all the variations here now I
need<00:06:11.509> to<00:06:11.569> put<00:06:11.719> the<00:06:11.960> prices<00:06:12.590> eventually<00:06:13.190> could

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
need to put the prices eventually could

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.550 
need to put the prices eventually could
do<00:06:13.460> this<00:06:13.610> choose<00:06:14.330> a<00:06:14.360> field<00:06:14.659> to<00:06:14.810> bulk<00:06:15.020> in<00:06:15.229> it<00:06:15.349> and

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
do this choose a field to bulk in it and

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.399 
do this choose a field to bulk in it and
the<00:06:16.520> price<00:06:16.729> is<00:06:17.030> the<00:06:17.150> retail<00:06:17.479> price<00:06:17.690> is<00:06:17.900> $49.99

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:18.409 
the price is the retail price is $49.99

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:24.129 
the price is the retail price is $49.99
so<00:06:19.340> I<00:06:19.400> click<00:06:19.639> go<00:06:19.669> I<00:06:20.120> type<00:06:21.219> 4990<00:06:22.509> and<00:06:23.509> then<00:06:23.870> I<00:06:23.930> can

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:24.139 
so I click go I type 4990 and then I can

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:25.749 
so I click go I type 4990 and then I can
also<00:06:24.199> go<00:06:24.560> up<00:06:24.680> in<00:06:24.860> our<00:06:24.979> sales<00:06:25.280> price<00:06:25.580> we

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 
also go up in our sales price we

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:27.370 
also go up in our sales price we
typically<00:06:26.029> will<00:06:26.240> drop<00:06:26.810> it<00:06:26.960> a<00:06:26.990> little<00:06:27.139> bit<00:06:27.289> from

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 
typically will drop it a little bit from

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.930 
typically will drop it a little bit from
the<00:06:27.529> retail<00:06:28.279> price<00:06:28.520> it'll<00:06:29.029> say<00:06:30.550> 46:56<00:06:31.550> price

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940 
the retail price it'll say 46:56 price

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.730 
the retail price it'll say 46:56 price
$20<00:06:32.750> off<00:06:32.979> is<00:06:33.979> I<00:06:34.250> get<00:06:34.610> off<00:06:34.759> for<00:06:34.940> today<00:06:35.090> and
