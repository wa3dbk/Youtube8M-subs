and<00:01:45.759> basically<00:01:46.759> what<00:01:47.450> we're<00:01:47.570> going<00:01:47.660> to<00:01:47.720> do

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
and basically what we're going to do

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.650 
and basically what we're going to do
with<00:01:48.050> these<00:01:48.200> rods<00:01:48.530> is<00:01:48.920> to<00:01:49.160> test<00:01:49.460> them<00:01:49.700> in<00:01:50.060> very

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
with these rods is to test them in very

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.660 
with these rods is to test them in very
arduous<00:01:51.050> conditions<00:01:51.350> because<00:01:52.070> on<00:01:52.220> rutland

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
arduous conditions because on rutland

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.820 
arduous conditions because on rutland
were<00:01:53.149> fishing<00:01:53.509> with<00:01:53.630> soft<00:01:53.960> plastic<00:01:54.470> lures

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
were fishing with soft plastic lures

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.160 
were fishing with soft plastic lures
in<00:01:54.950> 60<00:01:55.820> to<00:01:56.090> 70<00:01:56.570> feet<00:01:56.780> of<00:01:56.990> water<00:01:57.410> Zandar<00:01:58.340> now

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
in 60 to 70 feet of water Zandar now

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.600 
in 60 to 70 feet of water Zandar now
really<00:02:00.170> what<00:02:00.320> we're<00:02:00.530> looking<00:02:00.800> for<00:02:00.830> is<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.430> rod

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
really what we're looking for is the rod

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.639 
really what we're looking for is the rod
that<00:02:01.789> stiff<00:02:02.149> enough<00:02:02.300> to<00:02:02.479> work<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:03.380> soft

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
that stiff enough to work the soft

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.100 
that stiff enough to work the soft
plastic<00:02:04.130> baits<00:02:04.160> that<00:02:04.610> we're<00:02:04.789> using<00:02:05.030> but<00:02:05.780> soft

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
plastic baits that we're using but soft

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.680 
plastic baits that we're using but soft
enough<00:02:06.440> so<00:02:06.680> fish<00:02:07.399> won't<00:02:07.640> come<00:02:08.000> off<00:02:08.179> when<00:02:08.539> we

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
enough so fish won't come off when we

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.960 
enough so fish won't come off when we
hook<00:02:08.869> them<00:02:09.080> in<00:02:09.500> this<00:02:09.649> deep<00:02:09.890> water<00:02:10.130> and<00:02:10.580> bring

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
hook them in this deep water and bring

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.850 
hook them in this deep water and bring
them<00:02:11.180> up<00:02:11.330> through<00:02:11.570> the<00:02:11.720> depth<00:02:11.930> it<00:02:12.440> will<00:02:12.470> be<00:02:12.830> a

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
them up through the depth it will be a

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.710 
them up through the depth it will be a
test<00:02:13.160> with<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.430> equipment<00:02:13.730> it's<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.510> first

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
test with the equipment it's the first

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.210 
test with the equipment it's the first
time<00:02:14.989> we've<00:02:15.200> used<00:02:15.440> them<00:02:15.620> in<00:02:15.680> these<00:02:15.920> conditions

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
time we've used them in these conditions

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.949 
time we've used them in these conditions
and<00:02:16.940> it'd<00:02:17.060> be<00:02:17.150> interesting<00:02:17.269> to<00:02:17.660> see<00:02:17.810> how<00:02:17.900> we

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
and it'd be interesting to see how we

00:02:17.959 --> 00:03:04.970 
and it'd be interesting to see how we
get<00:02:18.230> on

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.470 

well<00:03:05.980> I'm<00:03:06.129> looking<00:03:06.249> a<00:03:06.489> slightly<00:03:06.819> better<00:03:07.120> fit

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
well I'm looking a slightly better fit

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.069 
well I'm looking a slightly better fit
here<00:03:08.099> we're<00:03:09.099> still<00:03:09.370> starting<00:03:09.909> to<00:03:10.329> drop<00:03:10.810> down

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
here we're still starting to drop down

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.190 
here we're still starting to drop down
below<00:03:11.319> the<00:03:11.620> yard<00:03:11.859> on<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:13.180> often<00:03:13.359> the<00:03:13.659> time<00:03:13.900> when

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
below the yard on so often the time when

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.890 
below the yard on so often the time when
predators<00:03:14.920> feed<00:03:15.489> we've<00:03:16.060> had<00:03:16.209> a<00:03:16.239> terrific<00:03:16.450> day

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
predators feed we've had a terrific day

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.509 
predators feed we've had a terrific day
actually<00:03:17.079> we've<00:03:17.409> caught<00:03:17.650> piles<00:03:18.099> and<00:03:18.459> piles

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
actually we've caught piles and piles

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.750 
actually we've caught piles and piles
and<00:03:18.939> Zandar<00:03:19.359> lots<00:03:19.930> of<00:03:20.139> small<00:03:20.409> ones<00:03:20.650> one<00:03:21.459> or<00:03:21.609> two

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
and Zandar lots of small ones one or two

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.229 
and Zandar lots of small ones one or two
bigger<00:03:22.209> for<00:03:22.989> a<00:03:23.049> medium-sized<00:03:23.859> fish<00:03:24.219> but<00:03:25.150> the

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
bigger for a medium-sized fish but the

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:26.849 
bigger for a medium-sized fish but the
main<00:03:25.420> point<00:03:25.629> was<00:03:25.870> we<00:03:26.139> wanted<00:03:26.409> to<00:03:26.530> put<00:03:26.709> this

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
main point was we wanted to put this

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.500 
main point was we wanted to put this
shame<00:03:27.159> in<00:03:27.340> an<00:03:27.430> Enka<00:03:27.760> rod<00:03:27.939> through<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:28.299> paces

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
shame in an Enka rod through the paces

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.199 
shame in an Enka rod through the paces
see<00:03:28.989> whatever<00:03:29.349> all<00:03:29.500> about<00:03:29.799> I<00:03:30.159> think<00:03:31.060> they've

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
see whatever all about I think they've

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.879 
see whatever all about I think they've
done<00:03:31.239> really<00:03:31.629> really<00:03:31.749> well<00:03:32.049> they've<00:03:32.560> proved

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
done really really well they've proved

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.670 
done really really well they've proved
that<00:03:33.099> for<00:03:33.340> this<00:03:33.730> finesse<00:03:34.180> style<00:03:34.359> fishing<00:03:35.049> is

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
that for this finesse style fishing is

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.429 
that for this finesse style fishing is
all<00:03:35.829> about<00:03:36.010> touch<00:03:36.609> and<00:03:36.819> feel<00:03:37.090> they've<00:03:38.079> got<00:03:38.319> the

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:38.439 
all about touch and feel they've got the

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:41.369 
all about touch and feel they've got the
necessary<00:03:38.620> backbone<00:03:39.519> to<00:03:39.760> work<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.239> jigs<00:03:40.510> but

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
necessary backbone to work the jigs but

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.229 
necessary backbone to work the jigs but
they're<00:03:41.530> soft<00:03:41.739> enough<00:03:42.040> not<00:03:42.489> to<00:03:42.639> move<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:43.030> fish

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
they're soft enough not to move the fish

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.199 
they're soft enough not to move the fish
so<00:03:44.069> I've<00:03:45.069> certainly<00:03:45.370> come<00:03:45.549> through<00:03:46.000> with

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
so I've certainly come through with

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.640 
so I've certainly come through with
