of<00:01:08.610> inner<00:01:08.850> frame<00:01:09.210> there<00:01:09.479> through<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.229> plastic

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
of inner frame there through the plastic

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
and adding an extra color app I'm always

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.149 
and adding an extra color app I'm always
a<00:01:12.330> big<00:01:12.570> fan<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.680> gray<00:01:13.830> parts

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
a big fan of that so the gray parts

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.530 
a big fan of that so the gray parts
there<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.430> are<00:01:14.490> gonna<00:01:14.610> be<00:01:14.760> on<00:01:14.790> either<00:01:15.090> side

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
there that are gonna be on either side

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.320 
there that are gonna be on either side
are<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.810> plus<00:01:16.590> down<00:01:17.400> here<00:01:17.670> for<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:17.970> actual

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
are a plus down here for the actual

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.640 
are a plus down here for the actual
parts<00:01:18.630> just<00:01:18.810> some<00:01:19.020> black<00:01:19.170> lining<00:01:19.560> around

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
parts just some black lining around

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.530 
parts just some black lining around
there<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.670> guess<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:20.909> those<00:01:21.240> seals

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
there and you can guess that those seals

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.090 
there and you can guess that those seals
are<00:01:21.689> going<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.869> be<00:01:21.960> adding<00:01:22.380> most<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.890> color

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
are going to be adding most of the color

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.890 
are going to be adding most of the color
down<00:01:23.340> there<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.790> that's<00:01:24.420> also<00:01:24.630> gonna<00:01:24.810> be

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
down there and that's also gonna be

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.749 
down there and that's also gonna be
applying<00:01:25.290> there<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.070> back<00:01:26.250> as<00:01:26.430> you've<00:01:26.580> got

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
applying there on the back as you've got

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.399 
applying there on the back as you've got
large<00:01:27.060> red<00:01:27.360> seals<00:01:27.659> going<00:01:27.990> around<00:01:28.170> all<00:01:28.380> over

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
large red seals going around all over

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:28.910 
large red seals going around all over
the<00:01:28.680> place

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
the place

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.100

the ankle mechanism itself is actually
going<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.060> be<00:01:33.150> pretty<00:01:33.299> cool<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:34.170> looks<00:01:34.500> good<00:01:34.710> no

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
going to be pretty cool it looks good no

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.230

in<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.239> back<00:04:09.419> down<00:04:09.659> there<00:04:09.870> you've<00:04:10.439> got<00:04:10.469> a

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
in the back down there you've got a

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.559 
in the back down there you've got a
shield<00:04:10.949> attachment<00:04:11.519> point<00:04:11.759> and<00:04:11.969> just<00:04:12.060> some

black lining and if you take a look down
at<00:04:14.549> the<00:04:14.609> bottom<00:04:14.759> you'd<00:04:15.180> think<00:04:15.359> that<00:04:15.539> this

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
at the bottom you'd think that this

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.120 
at the bottom you'd think that this
would<00:04:15.840> be<00:04:15.930> a<00:04:15.959> great<00:04:16.199> piece<00:04:16.469> but<00:04:16.709> instead<00:04:16.979> it's

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
would be a great piece but instead it's

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.159 
would be a great piece but instead it's
gonna<00:04:17.250> be<00:04:17.430> seals<00:04:17.759> down<00:04:18.060> there<00:04:18.299> around<00:04:18.989> the

wanted to go paint that up or line it
even<00:04:43.420> more<00:04:43.600> you<00:04:44.140> could<00:04:44.290> make<00:04:44.440> it<00:04:44.560> stand<00:04:44.770> out

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
even more you could make it stand out

even more you could make it stand out
but<00:04:45.160> I'm<00:04:45.250> a<00:04:45.340> fan<00:04:45.520> of<00:04:45.550> the<00:04:45.790> overall<00:04:46.180> shape<00:04:46.450> even

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
but I'm a fan of the overall shape even

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.270 
but I'm a fan of the overall shape even
though<00:04:47.200> it<00:04:47.320> is<00:04:47.380> going<00:04:47.500> to<00:04:47.590> be<00:04:47.680> pretty<00:04:47.920> simple

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
though it is going to be pretty simple

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.130 
though it is going to be pretty simple
in<00:04:48.520> its<00:04:48.640> construction<00:04:49.060> and<00:04:49.360> it<00:04:49.720> is<00:04:49.840> going<00:04:50.050> to

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
in its construction and it is going to

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.480 
in its construction and it is going to
have<00:04:50.230> this<00:04:50.410> part<00:04:50.650> here<00:04:50.860> which<00:04:51.070> is<00:04:51.220> going<00:04:51.400> to

there at the top but in terms of the
actual<00:05:08.770> mechanisms<00:05:09.310> you'll<00:05:09.520> see<00:05:09.730> that<00:05:09.940> you've

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
actual mechanisms you'll see that you've

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.060 
actual mechanisms you'll see that you've
got<00:05:10.120> these<00:05:10.480> indent<00:05:11.050> are<00:05:11.290> these<00:05:11.470> raised<00:05:11.770> parts

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
got these indent are these raised parts

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.130 
got these indent are these raised parts
here<00:05:12.280> that<00:05:12.430> can<00:05:13.000> go<00:05:13.180> so<00:05:13.210> you<00:05:13.480> can<00:05:13.540> also<00:05:13.810> do<00:05:14.110> a

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
here that can go so you can also do a

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.800 
here that can go so you can also do a
closed<00:05:14.650> up<00:05:14.920> shield<00:05:15.430> like<00:05:15.700> this<00:05:16.030> where<00:05:16.690> you're

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
closed up shield like this where you're

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.660 
closed up shield like this where you're
gonna<00:05:16.930> see<00:05:17.260> still<00:05:17.620> the<00:05:17.650> same<00:05:17.980> holes<00:05:18.250> there<00:05:18.490> but

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670 
gonna see still the same holes there but

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:19.830 
gonna see still the same holes there but
they're<00:05:18.790> just<00:05:18.850> gonna<00:05:19.000> be<00:05:19.180> provided<00:05:19.690> or

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
they're just gonna be provided or

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.450 
they're just gonna be provided or
displayed<00:05:20.500> in<00:05:20.620> a<00:05:20.680> slightly<00:05:20.950> different<00:05:21.190> way

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
displayed in a slightly different way

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.520 
displayed in a slightly different way
down<00:05:21.670> there<00:05:21.880> and<00:05:22.060> for<00:05:22.690> the<00:05:22.780> actual<00:05:22.900> attachment

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
down there and for the actual attachment

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.690 
down there and for the actual attachment
mechanism<00:05:23.620> here<00:05:24.100> you'll<00:05:24.280> see<00:05:24.430> that<00:05:24.520> you've

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
mechanism here you'll see that you've

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.030 
mechanism here you'll see that you've
got<00:05:24.850> a<00:05:24.880> range<00:05:25.180> of<00:05:25.600> swing<00:05:25.990> there<00:05:26.230> and<00:05:26.440> you<00:05:26.860> can

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
got a range of swing there and you can

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.580 
got a range of swing there and you can
rotate<00:05:27.280> this<00:05:27.670> part<00:05:27.880> around<00:05:28.270> and<00:05:28.630> you<00:05:29.200> can<00:05:29.380> plug

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
rotate this part around and you can plug

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.890 
rotate this part around and you can plug
that<00:05:29.740> into<00:05:30.040> the<00:05:30.250> actual<00:05:30.610> arm<00:05:30.850> itself<00:05:31.210> and<00:05:31.510> if

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
that into the actual arm itself and if

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.590

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
on the top it's gonna be unfortunate

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.300 
on the top it's gonna be unfortunate
that<00:06:16.870> it<00:06:16.990> is<00:06:17.230> a<00:06:17.260> seal<00:06:17.740> there<00:06:18.040> and<00:06:18.220> you're

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
that it is a seal there and you're

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.530 
that it is a seal there and you're
supposed<00:06:18.640> to<00:06:18.730> be<00:06:18.850> putting<00:06:19.150> it<00:06:19.240> over<00:06:19.330> a

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:19.540 
supposed to be putting it over a

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.690 
supposed to be putting it over a
relatively<00:06:20.170> rounded<00:06:20.860> some<00:06:21.130> somewhat

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:21.700 
relatively rounded some somewhat

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.220 
relatively rounded some somewhat
rectangular<00:06:22.240> surface<00:06:22.660> there<00:06:22.900> and

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.230 
rectangular surface there and

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.380 
rectangular surface there and
unfortunately<00:06:24.160> it's<00:06:24.310> gonna<00:06:24.430> look<00:06:24.640> pretty<00:06:24.880> so

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:25.390 
unfortunately it's gonna look pretty so

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.270 
unfortunately it's gonna look pretty so
so<00:06:25.660> whenever<00:06:25.930> you<00:06:26.290> look<00:06:26.320> at<00:06:26.560> that<00:06:26.680> you<00:06:27.250> are

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
so whenever you look at that you are

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.560 
so whenever you look at that you are
gonna<00:06:27.520> be<00:06:27.700> able<00:06:27.790> to<00:06:27.910> choose<00:06:28.150> though<00:06:28.360> if<00:06:28.480> you

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:28.570
