00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.870
In the 2110th year of the Earth calendar

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:03.985
Warning! 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:05.660
4 Urgal ships are approaching!

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.550
Prepare for battle!

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.200
Get ready to intercept!

00:00:10.445 --> 00:00:11.680
They’re coming!

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.450
Due to an invasion by an unknown alien race called Urgal, Earth fell into a fight for survival.

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:25.795
Humanity activated the MJP plan to oppose to this.

00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:30.550
They created a new breed of humans by genetic manipulation and sent them to the frontlines of the war.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
But...

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.525
Unit 1 has been shot down.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.695
Same for Unit 2.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.245
Unit 3 too...

00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:40.250
Morons.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.305
Their individual abilities are advanced, but Team Rabbits lacks cooperation.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.670
Why were they chosen?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.100
Where did the enemy come from?

00:00:53.645 --> 00:00:55.115
They’re not ready for this yet.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.510
Ally damage rate is 32.6%.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.310
We cannot continue to battle any further.

00:01:01.605 --> 00:01:04.425
Vice chief, please give us a retreat order!

00:01:04.565 --> 00:01:05.315
I won’t allow them to retreat!

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.215
How much do you think we’ve put into you all!

00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:15.160
I wonder why we’re here.

00:01:16.595 --> 00:01:19.705

00:01:22.825 --> 00:01:26.200
That’s right. If we don’t fight, we’ll die. We’ll die!

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.260
Children born to fight who are given no other purpose in life.

00:01:31.315 --> 00:01:33.100
What are your dreams at present?

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.805
I’ve never had any thought on what my dream is.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.405
You are the GDF’s dream.

00:01:40.465 --> 00:01:41.355
Believe

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.000
Your possibilities

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.935
Izuru

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.275
Survive with everyone!

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.720
Ginga Kikoutai: Majestic Prince

00:02:00.175 --> 00:02:03.810
