that<00:02:37.120> aside<00:02:37.769> it's<00:02:38.769> done<00:02:39.070> for<00:02:39.400> mental<00:02:40.150> reasons

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
that aside it's done for mental reasons

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.110 
that aside it's done for mental reasons
and<00:02:41.350> a<00:02:41.410> lot<00:02:41.620> of<00:02:41.739> people<00:02:41.890> psychologically<00:02:42.610> do

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
and a lot of people psychologically do

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.790 
and a lot of people psychologically do
better<00:02:43.360> on<00:02:43.450> these<00:02:43.720> body<00:02:43.930> parts<00:02:44.019> buts<00:02:44.500> they

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
better on these body parts buts they

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.979 
better on these body parts buts they
feel<00:02:45.280> like<00:02:45.310> they<00:02:45.760> can<00:02:45.940> put<00:02:46.090> more<00:02:46.300> focus<00:02:46.540> into<00:02:46.959> a

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
feel like they can put more focus into a

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.940 
feel like they can put more focus into a
given<00:02:47.260> muscle<00:02:48.720> by<00:02:49.720> dedicating<00:02:50.590> water<00:02:50.800> to

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
given muscle by dedicating water to

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.530 
given muscle by dedicating water to
muscle<00:02:51.310> groups<00:02:51.489> to<00:02:51.670> a<00:02:51.700> given<00:02:52.120> day<00:02:52.269> and

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
muscle groups to a given day and

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.059 
muscle groups to a given day and
therefore<00:02:52.930> since<00:02:53.319> they<00:02:53.500> feel<00:02:53.709> more<00:02:53.920> motivated

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
therefore since they feel more motivated

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.220 
therefore since they feel more motivated
and<00:02:54.610> they<00:02:54.730> get<00:02:54.880> that<00:02:55.060> psychological<00:02:55.810> response

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
and they get that psychological response

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.199 
and they get that psychological response
they<00:02:56.980> train<00:02:57.310> harder<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:57.819> if<00:02:57.880> you<00:02:57.970> train

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
they train harder and if you train

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.020 
they train harder and if you train
harder<00:02:58.540> you<00:02:58.630> generally<00:02:59.170> get<00:02:59.290> better<00:02:59.530> results

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
harder you generally get better results

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.180 
harder you generally get better results
the<00:03:01.030> reasons<00:03:01.450> are<00:03:02.069> psychological<00:03:03.069> they're

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
the reasons are psychological they're

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.720 
the reasons are psychological they're
not<00:03:03.340> physical<00:03:03.850> so<00:03:04.410> wherever<00:03:05.410> you<00:03:05.950> personally
