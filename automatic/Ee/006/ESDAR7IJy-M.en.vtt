actually size 11 so to fit about true to

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.850 
actually size 11 so to fit about true to
size<00:00:32.790> from<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.719> moldings<00:00:34.140> back<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.469> day<00:00:34.649> I

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860

size from the moldings back in the day I
do<00:00:35.340> have<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.520> pair<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.910> coppers<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:37.380> have

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
do have a pair of the coppers and I have

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.790 
do have a pair of the coppers and I have
to<00:00:37.680> bump<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:37.980> up<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.129> size<00:00:38.550> 12<00:00:39.440> because<00:00:40.440> I'm<00:00:40.770> a

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
to bump it up to size 12 because I'm a

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.549 
to bump it up to size 12 because I'm a
really<00:00:41.250> tight<00:00:42.239> narrow<00:00:42.540> as<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.989> remember<00:00:43.530> from

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
really tight narrow as you remember from

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.010 
really tight narrow as you remember from
my<00:00:43.739> other<00:00:43.860> videos<00:00:44.280> too<00:00:44.489> tight<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.879> narrow<00:00:45.120> for

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
my other videos too tight and narrow for

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.420 
my other videos too tight and narrow for
me<00:00:46.170> right<00:00:46.620> at<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.340> widest<00:00:47.940> part<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.480> my<00:00:48.750> feet

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
me right at the widest part of my feet

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.790 
me right at the widest part of my feet
so<00:00:50.430> size<00:00:51.000> 11<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.510> bearable<00:00:51.870> probably<00:00:52.379> 11<00:00:52.649> half

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
so size 11 is bearable probably 11 half

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.670 
so size 11 is bearable probably 11 half
will<00:00:52.980> be<00:00:53.010> best<00:00:53.340> but<00:00:53.690> loving<00:00:54.690> works<00:00:54.899> for<00:00:55.140> me<00:00:55.260> and

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.289 
tint of it so don't worry about it
yellowing<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.040> will<00:01:44.430> yellow<00:01:44.729> down<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.119> line

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
that the nike swoosh on gives a real

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.039 
that the nike swoosh on gives a real
great<00:02:00.780> accent<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:03.149> lot<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.780> people
