00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.670
 contemporary

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.220
 proud all of that and right now it's 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.549
 praise a little what are the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.330
 ingredients typical mexican kinds of 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:24.119
 a contemporary way you have a 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.750
 Banquet company if you are a 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.939
 recognized chef because you choose this 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.890
 dish to share where it comes from 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.439
 what is the origin of these taquitos and 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.320
 the shrimp that are here good look 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.869
 the shrimp are made with a marinade 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.299
 marinades there are now so for 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.299
 all of Mexico are made on the basis of 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.850
 dried chiles and well I like them 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.930
 very much since good they can go with 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.360
 all kinds of meats 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.090
 and I found the dish really the truth 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.520
 representative of as well as the coast 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.080
 of mexico also carries the 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.010
 shrimps take some beans from the 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.090
 of the pot with a sauce that is made 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.479
 based on butter of leaves 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.940
 avocado that the truth is rich and 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.130
 these shrimp are the most like 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.500
 northern style of the country that 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.300
 They are made with flour tortilla 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.060
 which is chorizo and go egg fillings 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.400
 because it's a breakfast and well 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.890
 Now there take a little bit of 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.690
 one side and the other of the kitchens of the 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.239
 country can where more or less treat 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:33.010
 some of these recipes for example the 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:35.290
 kitchen goes favorite you tried either the 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.450
 beans that present the shrimp or 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.760
 some of these preparations and the 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.770
 you have proven how good they are 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.900
 things to say and there but 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:48.000
 yes yes there is of this but well this is with 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.650
 a personal touch and they emerge good from 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.780
 Now that it is the adobo that 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.150
 yes I prepared it a lot I like it a lot 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.650
 do it and the shrimp well it is 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.090
 a combi of forgiveness the tacos 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.489
 a combination that I really like and 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.030
 I feel that Mexicans like it 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:06.430
 have breakfast as well as generally strong 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:12.670
 and well that is a good dish for 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:14.829
 breakfast breakfast lighter but in 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.980
 Overall, I think the taste of the Mexican 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.930
 it's a stronger breakfast 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.850
 if it helps us a little lighter but 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.280
 suddenly if I give myself a good breakfast 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.580
 and we try some of the dishes 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.460
 your colleagues for example the delicious 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.880
 cake that mariel brought us sent us 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.680
 of mariel that also takes a marinade and 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.140
 it's great I've tried 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.240
 several the cake is delicious I tried 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.610
 also the so much the roast meat that he made 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.560
 with a pumpkin flower tamale that 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.080
 it is very very rich there are also some 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.660
 toast by paula garduño for dinner 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.200
 are very rich and the base area of 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.690
 shrimp we also have a breast 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.910
 stuffed with huitlacoche to be good 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.160
 Now there are many dishes 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.990
 delicious that I highly recommend 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.060
 that they are going to program well and this 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.340

 it's October and November in all 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.030
 areas of the country so you come up with the 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.380
 idea nine years ago 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.130
 if there are what occurrences that occur 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.840

 you know what a delight it is to prepare to do all 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.260
 the production since when the chefs 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:04.000
 conceive the recipes and send it to us and 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.889

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.850
 according to what is waiting for 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.470
 the festival from there we started to 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.780
 taste and then we make a production 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.100
 photographic that almost every year the 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.500

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.330
 photographer to make the menus and others 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.400
 then when we are there and the chefs 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.050

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.430
 the Mexican chefs which we 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.410
 He is very proud as he said 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.020
 daisy now celebrating the one that the 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.610
 cuisine is a world heritage site and 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.560
 thus making the diners that 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.470
 attend we roast the whole country have 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.330
 different gourmet options and that 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.889
 let's say with the possibility of 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.770
 try many dishes in October and 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:32.090
 November and pairing with wines look 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.000
 that yes there comes in the letter what 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.050
 we mentioned a moment ago in 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.110
 another appointment 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.550
 makes a proposal of marriage always 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.280
 it's something new that we had not included 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.379
 in past festivals now if it comes 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.539
 on the menu and it's interesting that people 

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:50.879
 try that add-on not and as 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:52.500
 we talked about more or less a 

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:54.659
 price standard to make it 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.639
 accessible for everyone who approaches 

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:59.099
 to the different restaurants around the 

00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:00.599
 country so I think it makes a good 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:03.539
 effort for all of you have 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:06.449
 proposed wines from Madrid with the 

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:07.680
 recommendation of the wine of the berries 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:10.979

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:13.919
 you knew very well not him and I went to addition to 

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:17.400
 the winery in argentina and interesting 

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:22.680
 they have a very economical range up to one 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:25.139
 very high wines all in quality range and 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.090
 of awards so they do well with 

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:29.310
 our Mexican cuisine that of course 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:31.050
 and you know that it should also be noted that 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:33.449
 all the years of festival we have done 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.069
 a contribution to different causes 

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:37.139
 what is collected from the festival a 

00:07:35.069 --> 00:07:38.759
 percentage is donated last year what 

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:40.319
 We made ton seed to preserve the 

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:42.960
 corn so that's also good that 

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:43.920
 know how not to like this very fast year 

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.960

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:55.280
