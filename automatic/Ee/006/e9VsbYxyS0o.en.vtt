00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.120 

we<00:01:21.030> will<00:01:21.210> resume<00:01:21.570> with<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.990> technique<00:01:25.130> start

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
we will resume with the technique start

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.060 
we will resume with the technique start
side<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.119> side<00:01:27.390> instantly<00:01:28.200> going<00:01:28.680> into<00:01:29.040> a

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.170 
circular oval motion this circular oval
motion<00:01:33.360> forces<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.680> wheel<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.430> ride<00:01:35.670> upon<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
motion forces the wheel to ride upon the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.100 
motion forces the wheel to ride upon the
hard<00:01:36.930> steel<00:01:37.500> edges<00:01:38.180> thereby<00:01:39.180> rounding<00:01:39.990> them

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
hard steel edges thereby rounding them

and removing birds and coarse surface

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.649 
and removing birds and coarse surface
will<00:01:45.840> put<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.380> light<00:01:47.340> background<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.360> can

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
will put a light background so you can

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:55.100 
will put a light background so you can
see<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.439> technique<00:01:49.799> better
