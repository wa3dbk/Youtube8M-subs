going to make a nice flat surface to
clamp<00:04:08.550> to<00:04:08.820> but<00:04:09.510> a<00:04:09.540> lot<00:04:09.750> of<00:04:09.900> trucks<00:04:10.200> have<00:04:10.800> a

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
clamp to but a lot of trucks have a

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.699 
clamp to but a lot of trucks have a
flared<00:04:11.430> over<00:04:11.700> flange<00:04:12.390> at<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:13.110> bottom<00:04:13.440> edge<00:04:13.560> of

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
flared over flange at the bottom edge of

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.710 
flared over flange at the bottom edge of
that<00:04:13.830> sheet<00:04:14.100> metal<00:04:14.130> and<00:04:14.580> this<00:04:15.180> is<00:04:15.390> going<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.600> be

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
that sheet metal and this is going to be

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.000 
that sheet metal and this is going to be
important<00:04:16.200> when<00:04:16.290> you're<00:04:16.440> putting<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.739> clamp

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
important when you're putting the clamp

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.699 
important when you're putting the clamp
on<00:04:17.220> what's<00:04:18.120> going<00:04:18.299> to<00:04:18.330> happen<00:04:18.810> is<00:04:19.049> you<00:04:19.530> want

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
on what's going to happen is you want

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.490 
on what's going to happen is you want
the<00:04:19.859> clamp<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.940> clear<00:04:21.209> that<00:04:21.419> flange<00:04:21.810> so<00:04:22.380> the

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
the clamp to clear that flange so the

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.010 
the clamp to clear that flange so the
jaws<00:04:22.740> of<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:23.040> tee<00:04:23.310> are<00:04:23.610> on<00:04:24.180> this<00:04:24.330> nice<00:04:24.600> flat

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
jaws of the tee are on this nice flat

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.159 
jaws of the tee are on this nice flat
surface<00:04:25.430> if<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.700> jaws<00:04:26.940> of<00:04:26.970> the<00:04:27.270> clamp<00:04:27.450> end<00:04:27.900> up

surface if the jaws of the clamp end up

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.930 
surface if the jaws of the clamp end up
on<00:04:28.380> that<00:04:28.560> surface<00:04:29.040> it's<00:04:29.280> going<00:04:29.400> to<00:04:29.610> kick<00:04:29.790> the

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
on that surface it's going to kick the

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.629 
on that surface it's going to kick the
clamp<00:04:30.570> over

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
clamp over

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.040

is going to prevent the rail from

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.350 
is going to prevent the rail from
bolting<00:04:33.439> on<00:04:33.560> square<00:04:34.129> so<00:04:34.819> make<00:04:35.030> sure<00:04:35.060> when

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
bolting on square so make sure when

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.999 
bolting on square so make sure when
you're<00:04:35.479> clamping<00:04:35.960> that<00:04:36.379> the<00:04:36.499> jaws<00:04:36.740> of<00:04:36.770> the

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:37.009 
you're clamping that the jaws of the

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.309 
you're clamping that the jaws of the
tooth<00:04:37.280> are<00:04:37.669> clearing<00:04:38.479> that<00:04:38.599> flange<00:04:38.960> and

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:39.319 
tooth are clearing that flange and

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:41.739 
tooth are clearing that flange and
you're<00:04:39.620> clamping<00:04:40.069> those<00:04:40.219> flat<00:04:40.460> surfaces<00:04:41.120> so

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:41.749 
you're clamping those flat surfaces so

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:45.450 
you're clamping those flat surfaces so
the<00:04:41.870> rail<00:04:42.050> goes<00:04:42.289> on<00:04:42.499> square<00:04:42.949> now<00:04:43.909> on<00:04:44.389> the<00:04:44.900> Chevy

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
the rail goes on square now on the Chevy

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.149 
the rail goes on square now on the Chevy
it's<00:04:46.460> about<00:04:46.639> 10<00:04:46.969> inches<00:04:47.240> from<00:04:47.270> the<00:04:47.509> tailgate

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.159 
it's about 10 inches from the tailgate

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:51.010 
it's about 10 inches from the tailgate
you're<00:04:49.159> going<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:49.490> open<00:04:50.180> the<00:04:50.509> jaws<00:04:50.719> of<00:04:50.960> the

you're going to open the jaws of the

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.559 
you're going to open the jaws of the
clamp<00:04:51.310> you<00:04:52.310> insert<00:04:52.669> it<00:04:52.789> as<00:04:52.879> far<00:04:53.210> up<00:04:53.330> in<00:04:53.449> the

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:53.569 
clamp you insert it as far up in the

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:56.019 
clamp you insert it as far up in the
opening<00:04:53.930> as<00:04:54.080> possible<00:04:54.620> as<00:04:54.800> close<00:04:55.610> to<00:04:55.909> the

00:04:58.929 --> 00:04:58.939 
tailgate as it will get and then just

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:02.649 
tailgate as it will get and then just
when<00:04:59.150> the<00:04:59.349> clamp<00:05:00.349> starts<00:05:00.830> to<00:05:00.949> clamp<00:05:01.509> you<00:05:02.509> want

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:02.659 
when the clamp starts to clamp you want

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:04.899 
when the clamp starts to clamp you want
to<00:05:02.749> put<00:05:02.900> a<00:05:02.930> little<00:05:03.050> downforce<00:05:03.590> on<00:05:03.830> it<00:05:04.039> if<00:05:04.759> you

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909 
to put a little downforce on it if you

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:10.709 
to put a little downforce on it if you
give<00:05:05.060> it<00:05:05.090> a<00:05:05.180> little<00:05:05.210> pop<00:05:05.539> there<00:05:05.599> and<00:05:06.199> then<00:05:08.469> 1/2

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:10.719 
give it a little pop there and then 1/2

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:13.990 
give it a little pop there and then 1/2
3/4<00:05:11.719> of<00:05:11.810> a<00:05:11.900> turn<00:05:12.139> should<00:05:13.009> be<00:05:13.159> plenty<00:05:13.490> to

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
3/4 of a turn should be plenty to

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.600 
3/4 of a turn should be plenty to
tighten<00:05:14.330> that<00:05:14.419> clamp<00:05:14.500> sufficiently<00:05:15.610> then

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
tighten that clamp sufficiently then

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.640 
tighten that clamp sufficiently then
you're<00:05:16.729> going<00:05:16.879> to<00:05:16.939> do<00:05:17.060> the<00:05:17.180> same<00:05:17.449> at<00:05:18.379> the

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
you're going to do the same at the

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.100 
you're going to do the same at the
middle<00:05:19.120> loosen<00:05:20.120> the<00:05:20.180> clamp<00:05:20.419> enough<00:05:20.719> to<00:05:20.870> get<00:05:20.990> it

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
middle loosen the clamp enough to get it

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.129
