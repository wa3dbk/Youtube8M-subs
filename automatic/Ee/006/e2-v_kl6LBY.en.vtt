00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
 do not 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.320
 or negative as they are my name is see 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.570
 or we are back here in a world of 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.480
 crafts today we have how 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.279
 make delicious skewers 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.349
 using sausages and cherry tomatoes 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.710
 for that special little person so 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:26.090
 let's see how it is done 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.830
 rams 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.520
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.370
 they are boiled sausages and tomatoes 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.140
 cherrys these little ones 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.440
 sticks for skewers 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.120
 or the dressing that you like the most is what 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.590
 first thing we're going to do is cut the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.230
 ends of our sausages 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.780
 diagonally we will take care of measure 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.890
 a little finger and we cut 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.890
 we do the same 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.010
 d 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:11.079
 and for more a little heart you just turn it 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.079
 and there it is 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.700
 how can you see the little finger we had 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.789
 of measure helps us to do it 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.870
 our orbit of our heart and 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.870
 stay 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.870
 perfectly 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.920
 then we are going to cut our and 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.829
 cherry tomatoes this is the same they are going to be 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.590
 diagonally but we are not going to cut them 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:36.970
 in the middle but a part is going to have 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.970
 to give bigger than the other 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:48.030
 so you can see this part is more 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:52.850
 little girl and two missing 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.850
 and 31 now we give 4 chelsea 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:06.030
 and we already have two big parts now 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.030
 it's just flipped 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.650
 and finally we are going to form our 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.340
 skewer let's put first a 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.340
 cherry 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.650
 first one part and then 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:34.370
 and then we're going to put a sausage 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.370
 and so on until you fill everything 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.250
 and that's how our skewers are 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.590
 to give it the arrow shape you can 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.540
 use the cherry tomatoes and what 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.820
 your reverse sausage and you can 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.600
 accompany with cactus or the dressing that you 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.580
 you prefer 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.010
