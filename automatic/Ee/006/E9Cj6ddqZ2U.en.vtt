and I downloaded a couple of things so

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.910 
and I downloaded a couple of things so
it<00:01:54.060> comes<00:01:54.299> with<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.899> default<00:01:55.350> Android<00:01:55.649> web

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
it comes with the default Android web

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.740 
it comes with the default Android web
browser<00:01:56.189> but<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.909> went<00:01:57.240> ahead<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.540> installed

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
browser but I went ahead and installed

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.300 
browser but I went ahead and installed
the<00:01:58.110> Chrome<00:01:58.350> web<00:01:58.530> browser<00:01:58.770> which<00:01:59.130> works

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
the Chrome web browser which works

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.350 
the Chrome web browser which works
pretty<00:01:59.490> well<00:02:01.700> and<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.939> think<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.149> might<00:02:03.299> have

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
pretty well and I think I might have

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.600 
pretty well and I think I might have
locked<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.840> screen<00:02:04.079> orientation

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
locked the screen orientation

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.229 
locked the screen orientation
accidentally<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:06.229> let's<00:02:07.229> unlock<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.829> and

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
accidentally so let's unlock that and

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.729 
accidentally so let's unlock that and
now<00:02:09.239> we<00:02:09.300> can<00:02:09.509> see<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.170> Chrome<00:02:10.590> web

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
now we can see that the Chrome web

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.280 
now we can see that the Chrome web
browser<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:11.310> working

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290

to install Android 4.1 Amazon might not
like<00:03:58.549> that<00:03:58.579> but<00:03:58.939> it's<00:03:59.000> pretty<00:03:59.479> difficult<00:03:59.780> I

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.169 
like that but it's pretty difficult I

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.499 
like that but it's pretty difficult I
found<00:04:00.519> to<00:04:01.519> completely<00:04:01.879> turn<00:04:02.180> this<00:04:02.269> device

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:02.509 
found to completely turn this device

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:05.069 
found to completely turn this device
into<00:04:02.810> a<00:04:02.840> useless<00:04:03.139> brick<00:04:03.530> for<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.310> most<00:04:04.489> part

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
into a useless brick for the most part

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.839 
into a useless brick for the most part
anything<00:04:06.079> you<00:04:06.169> do<00:04:06.319> can<00:04:06.349> be<00:04:06.620> undone<00:04:07.040> which<00:04:07.609> is

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
anything you do can be undone which is

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.189 
anything you do can be undone which is
kind<00:04:08.269> of<00:04:08.329> a<00:04:08.389> nice<00:04:08.509> thing<00:04:08.720> about<00:04:08.750> a<00:04:08.959> lot<00:04:09.139> of

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:09.199 
kind of a nice thing about a lot of

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:11.020 
kind of a nice thing about a lot of
Android<00:04:09.469> devices<00:04:09.859> but<00:04:10.040> definitely<00:04:10.489> the

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
Android devices but definitely the

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.390 
Android devices but definitely the
Kindle<00:04:11.299> Fire<00:04:11.329> so<00:04:11.989> again<00:04:12.229> for<00:04:12.439> $1.99<00:04:12.979> I'm<00:04:13.219> not

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
Kindle Fire so again for $1.99 I'm not

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.379 
Kindle Fire so again for $1.99 I'm not
sure<00:04:13.519> that<00:04:13.549> I<00:04:13.699> would<00:04:13.819> recommend<00:04:14.000> picking<00:04:14.299> this

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
sure that I would recommend picking this

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.810 
sure that I would recommend picking this
up<00:04:14.479> instead<00:04:15.169> of<00:04:15.290> a<00:04:15.379> Google<00:04:15.680> Nexus<00:04:15.919> 7<00:04:16.130> but<00:04:16.729> if

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
up instead of a Google Nexus 7 but if

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.279 
up instead of a Google Nexus 7 but if
you<00:04:16.880> already<00:04:17.060> have<00:04:17.449> one<00:04:17.719> and<00:04:17.959> want<00:04:18.109> to<00:04:18.169> be<00:04:18.229> able

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
you already have one and want to be able

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:20.620 
you already have one and want to be able
to<00:04:18.380> run<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.650> latest<00:04:18.949> Android<00:04:19.489> software<00:04:20.000> you

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
to run the latest Android software you

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.170 
to run the latest Android software you
can<00:04:20.859> half<00:04:21.859> code<00:04:22.099> the<00:04:22.250> developer<00:04:22.639> who<00:04:22.849> first

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
can half code the developer who first

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.300 
can half code the developer who first
ported<00:04:23.659> Android<00:04:24.050> 4.1<00:04:24.560> to<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:24.740> Kindle<00:04:24.949> Fire<00:04:25.009> is

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.230 
ported Android 4.1 to the Kindle Fire is
still<00:04:25.580> working<00:04:25.820> on<00:04:26.030> it

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
still working on it

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.510 
still working on it
so<00:04:26.389> future<00:04:26.719> builds<00:04:26.990> might<00:04:27.229> include<00:04:27.979> working

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
so future builds might include working

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
required from you and and some other

required from you and and some other
information<00:04:33.409> that<00:04:33.800> might<00:04:33.919> make<00:04:34.070> it<00:04:34.099> a<00:04:34.250> little

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
information that might make it a little

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.640 
information that might make it a little
bit<00:04:34.490> easier<00:04:34.789> to<00:04:34.820> use<00:04:34.940> and<00:04:35.360> possibly<00:04:36.139> that<00:04:36.260> HD

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
video acceleration so you might want to

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.280 
video acceleration so you might want to
hold<00:04:38.449> off<00:04:38.659> a<00:04:38.690> little

hold off a little
