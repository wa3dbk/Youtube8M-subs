00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.719
 and other realities how many people like 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.480
 it was very interesting 20 percent of 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.760
 the Mexicans as he wants 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.360
 say that there are about 25 million 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.750
 Mexicans who eat outside their house 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:26.600
 here it is very curious because it does not involve 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.990
 this consumption much the subject for example 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:33.780
 of the jukeboxes or of certain positions 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.180
 I would dare to say that 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.460
 at least 60 to 70 percent 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.519
 Mexicans eat out but not what 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.739
 they do every day that is they do it 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:48.230
 on special occasions or very much alone 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:52.170
 for breakfast or a lot just for dinner and 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:55.140
 there are 5 million people who eat 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:00.420
 in street stalls with that gives us more 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:03.870
 or less 25% or 30% of the country that eats 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.930
 in this type of business 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.490
 now how much do they spend 23 percent of the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.700
 income of Mexicans is spent on 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.830
 food drink and tobacco very high this 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.890
 it means that 25 percent of the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.710
 economy we spend on those things is 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.140
 say if you see the numbers I want to 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.720
 be convinced that it is a business 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.909
 interesting as long as we know 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.190
 where is the opportunity kind of 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.470
 client the majority of customers are 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.630
 conservatives and some innovators to 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.479
 exception of the city mexico-monterrey 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.990
 and a little Guadalajara and other cities 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.560
 of the country alimajor tijuana the territory 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.470
 national are middle cities and in those 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.590
 medium cities the customers are very 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:53.850
 conservatives you will see very little 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:58.710
 that the average person in Mexico eat something 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:01.259
 very risky people in Mexico have 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.539
 very clear what I eat , I'm going to 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.050
 demonstrate a little bit later and in 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.190
 the case of some people 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.239
 mainly in big cities 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:15.420
 of the country let's say above 600 700 thousand 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.910
 the young people above all are 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.599
 starting to eat new things and things 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:25.650
 innovative if you go to the super many 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:28.470
 of the supers are trying to insert 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.140
 much more interesting meals 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.290
 innovators from other countries that both 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.680
 there is competition unfortunately there 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.830
 much what is the advantage of you that 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.440
 only 4% of its competitors from 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.750
 competence are franchises that 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.740
 yes they are the ones with the most money 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.620
 those who spend the most on promotions and who 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.650
 obviously it is impossible to compete against 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.080
 Franchise coffee shops that spend 6 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.270
 million and a half pesos or hire 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.580
 bar franchises that can reach 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.810
 spend 10 million pesos on a 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.150
 nightclub a nightclub 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.970
 therefore, it is very complex like 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:13.270
 restaurant chains can even 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.099
 give very low prices there are two types of 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.349
 We are going to practice the competition 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.970
 direct the one that is in your business by 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.750
 example if you want to start a 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.000
 seafood restaurant 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.670
 direct competition are all 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.670
 seafood of your city the competition 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.850
 indirect are people who sell things 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.550
 similar to yours, for example if 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.650
 there is some surpass near eleven they sell 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.709
 sardines or someone sells tacos 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.900
 sardines or sell toast on the street 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.880
 a toast cart that would be 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.220
 indirect competition that most 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.060
 of the things of the times I forgive the 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.060
 most of the time 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.489
 can not compete with us, that is to say, 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.299
 restaurant is not going to compete 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.780
 put because the post to for a guy 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:03.569
 of people while a restaurant 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:06.180
 attends in another type of people then the 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:10.140
 another kind of reality thing in 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:13.670
 Mexico is that money is very difficult 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.670
 get loans
