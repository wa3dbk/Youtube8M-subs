00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.910 
addition to that we've read timed and
and<00:01:41.450> redone<00:01:41.780> all<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:42.049> combos<00:01:42.439> for<00:01:42.500> saber

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
and redone all the combos for saber

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.249 
and redone all the combos for saber
combat<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:43.610> for<00:01:43.820> force<00:01:44.000> powers<00:01:44.390> to<00:01:44.929> really<00:01:45.110> go

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
combat and for force powers to really go

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.749 
combat and for force powers to really go
along<00:01:45.530> with<00:01:45.710> that<00:01:45.740> improved<00:01:46.159> targeting<00:01:46.640> and

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
along with that improved targeting and

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.580 
along with that improved targeting and
precision<00:01:47.240> we've<00:01:47.840> added<00:01:47.990> a<00:01:48.110> couple<00:01:48.229> of<00:01:48.439> new

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
precision we've added a couple of new

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.350 
precision we've added a couple of new
force<00:01:48.830> powers<00:01:49.189> at<00:01:49.429> the<00:01:49.729> one<00:01:49.880> I'm<00:01:50.060> really

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
force powers at the one I'm really

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.630 
force powers at the one I'm really
excited<00:01:50.570> about<00:01:50.780> is<00:01:50.990> mind<00:01:51.350> trick<00:01:51.649> now<00:01:52.459> just

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
excited about is mind trick now just

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.160 
excited about is mind trick now just
like<00:01:52.789> we've<00:01:53.270> reimagined<00:01:53.509> all<00:01:53.929> the<00:01:54.020> other

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
like we've reimagined all the other

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.779 
like we've reimagined all the other
force<00:01:54.409> powers<00:01:54.740> in<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:54.890> force<00:01:55.130> unleashed<00:01:55.310> so

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
force powers in the force unleashed so

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.309 
force powers in the force unleashed so
you<00:01:56.179> know<00:01:56.270> force<00:01:56.509> push<00:01:56.690> is<00:01:56.840> much<00:01:56.990> bigger<00:01:57.200> than

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
you know force push is much bigger than

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:58.990 
you know force push is much bigger than
you've<00:01:57.530> ever<00:01:57.560> seen<00:01:57.799> it<00:01:57.920> before<00:01:58.159> our<00:01:58.610> version

of them they even really weak will ones

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.930 
of them they even really weak will ones
will<00:02:09.709> make<00:02:10.069> a<00:02:10.100> beeline<00:02:10.310> for<00:02:10.519> the<00:02:10.729> nearest

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
will make a beeline for the nearest

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.610 
will make a beeline for the nearest
ledge<00:02:11.239> and<00:02:11.480> leap<00:02:11.780> over<00:02:12.200> or<00:02:12.410> they<00:02:12.560> will

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
ledge and leap over or they will

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.309 
ledge and leap over or they will
actually<00:02:12.739> throw<00:02:13.160> themselves<00:02:13.370> into<00:02:13.850> a<00:02:14.450> hazard

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
actually throw themselves into a hazard

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.410 
actually throw themselves into a hazard
like<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.500> spinning<00:02:15.920> fan<00:02:16.220> or<00:02:16.580> you<00:02:17.060> know<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.180> big

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
like a spinning fan or you know a big

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.170 
like a spinning fan or you know a big
giant<00:02:17.630> hot<00:02:18.019> engine<00:02:18.290> so<00:02:18.920> I<00:02:19.040> actually<00:02:19.519> rid<00:02:19.970> the

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
giant hot engine so I actually rid the

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.870 
giant hot engine so I actually rid the
rid<00:02:20.780> themselves<00:02:20.959> of<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:21.410> for<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:21.799> and<00:02:22.610> then

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
rid themselves of you for you and then

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.610 
rid themselves of you for you and then
at<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.120> highest<00:02:23.450> levels<00:02:23.840> when<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.200> you<00:02:24.500> get

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
at the highest levels when you you get

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.310

you're fighting and whirl around you so

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.949 
you're fighting and whirl around you so
