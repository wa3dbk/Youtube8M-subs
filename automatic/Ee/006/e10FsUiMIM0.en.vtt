memories<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:18.630> year

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.180 

yeah<00:01:37.610> I<00:01:37.640> think<00:01:38.049> in<00:01:39.049> the<00:01:39.140> past<00:01:39.380> two<00:01:39.590> seasons

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.340 

I've<00:01:43.190> started<00:01:43.820> to<00:01:43.940> feel<00:01:44.119> more<00:01:44.420> like<00:01:44.479> a<00:01:44.659> veteran

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
I've started to feel more like a veteran

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.609 
I've started to feel more like a veteran
last<00:01:45.740> season<00:01:46.159> because<00:01:46.400> I<00:01:47.150> was<00:01:48.020> on<00:01:48.170> a<00:01:48.200> team<00:01:48.500> with

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
last season because I was on a team with

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.139 
last season because I was on a team with
a<00:01:48.680> bunch<00:01:48.770> of<00:01:49.009> young<00:01:49.220> guys<00:01:49.430> a<00:01:49.460> bunch<00:01:49.759> of<00:01:49.909> rookies

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
a bunch of young guys a bunch of rookies

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.160 
a bunch of young guys a bunch of rookies
and<00:01:50.750> that<00:01:51.619> made<00:01:51.830> me<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.460> veteran<00:01:52.790> on<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:52.970> team

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
and that made me the veteran on the team

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.230 
and that made me the veteran on the team
whereas<00:01:54.170> this<00:01:54.409> year<00:01:54.470> it<00:01:55.220> was<00:01:55.399> just<00:01:55.430> I<00:01:56.030> guess

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
whereas this year it was just I guess

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.910 
whereas this year it was just I guess
the<00:01:56.270> next<00:01:56.570> logical<00:01:56.869> brew<00:01:57.259> got<00:01:57.440> progression

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
the next logical brew got progression

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.830 
the next logical brew got progression
after<00:01:58.040> that<00:01:58.280> so<00:01:58.490> I<00:01:58.549> mean<00:01:58.820> going<00:01:59.690> through

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
after that so I mean going through

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.840 
after that so I mean going through
however<00:02:00.530> many<00:02:00.799> you<00:02:01.100> know<00:02:01.220> that<00:02:01.430> 20<00:02:01.759> or

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
however many you know that 20 or

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.430 
however many you know that 20 or
whatever<00:02:01.940> win<00:02:02.299> season<00:02:02.659> in<00:02:02.750> New<00:02:02.840> Orleans<00:02:02.960> it

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
whatever win season in New Orleans it

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.980 
whatever win season in New Orleans it
wasn't<00:02:03.770> it<00:02:04.220> wasn't<00:02:04.460> necessarily<00:02:05.240> fun<00:02:05.660> from<00:02:05.869> a

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
wasn't it wasn't necessarily fun from a

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.660 
wasn't it wasn't necessarily fun from a
basketball<00:02:06.410> standpoint<00:02:06.740> but<00:02:07.460> it<00:02:07.520> was

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
basketball standpoint but it was

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.770 
basketball standpoint but it was
necessary<00:02:08.149> I<00:02:08.239> think<00:02:08.269> I<00:02:13.330> just<00:02:14.330> think<00:02:14.510> he<00:02:14.570> needs

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
necessary I think I just think he needs

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.650 
necessary I think I just think he needs
to<00:02:14.900> play<00:02:15.019> a<00:02:15.110> lot<00:02:15.320> of<00:02:15.350> basketball<00:02:16.450> so<00:02:17.450> he's

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
to play a lot of basketball so he's

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.479 
to play a lot of basketball so he's
already<00:02:17.840> got<00:02:18.170> great<00:02:18.680> touch<00:02:18.950> around<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.340> rim

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
already got great touch around the rim

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:20.979 
already got great touch around the rim
he<00:02:19.640> can<00:02:19.819> pass<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.269> ball<00:02:20.300> you<00:02:20.569> can<00:02:20.690> do<00:02:20.810> things

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
he can pass the ball you can do things

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.050 
he can pass the ball you can do things
