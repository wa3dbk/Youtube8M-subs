00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:14.420
 Hi my friend my friend, how are we? 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.270
 here back for another edition of the 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.160
 show is cold your traditional 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.140
 shows you can not miss 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.310
 and those horrific presentations that 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.530
 you have to avoid 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.820
 Let's start now with the tips of 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.820
 first week of December 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.449
 start with a really cool tip to 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.120
 those who like heavy metal and also to 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.460
 Who wants to start enjoying watching? 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.170
 I'm talking about the show of paradise shows 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.289
 Who in Brazil is one of the best? 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.870
 heavy metal bands today 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.350
 and this is that presepada and vocalistas 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.269
 extremely hysterical songs 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.339
 supersonic soils very fast nothing 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:00.920
 And it has nothing to do with 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.610
 gothic that a lot of people think sleep for 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.320
 10 knots is extremely melodious 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.170
 extremely cadenced full of 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.540
 Very cool melodies and harmonies 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.850
 so it's that show you're going to 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.240
 leave with the mouth open 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.240
 you bet 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:31.590
 now you can not believe a 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.780
 business of these 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.140
 But look seriously, I 'll tell you guys. 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.750
 You'll have a show, you know whose sweet face. 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.350
 Maria, this is one of the girls. 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.310
 members of that Chilean rebels and 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.530
 that it was a business simply 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.840
 terrible as these people are to pay the 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.850
 Tell me what happens when they come here to do it. 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.310
 a showzinho get the money from the fans 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.709
 suckers and completely dead 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.610
 who are sure to be drooling overhead 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:04.470
 the girl and not paying attention to the 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.080
 frightful songs she makes 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.229
 Thinking not to pay attention to the sound 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.920
 her is a good thing now 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:18.650
 escape it and prevent your children from 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.650
 Fill your bag to take it to the south. 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.330
 another show that I could recommend with 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:37.069
 A little more and vehemence here to 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:40.190
 You 're the red baron's turn. 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.500
 because it is after a long and acts 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.530
 including the frejat developing a 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.230
 good solo career including the guys 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.819
 are returning to active 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.010
 will surely recover that 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:56.329
 repertoire full of hits that they always 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.660
 they had and I imagine you see, I imagine 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:01.430
 that the guys are still playing well 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.940
 then this recommendation serves much more 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.760
 for you to check what is going on 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:11.620
 sound of the red baron these days 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.620
 it's worth taking a ladder 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.200
 j 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:28.150
 to finish our script here 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:33.340
 this week I'm going to counteract show 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:35.260
 Madonna is this surprise surprise because it is 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.800
 It turns out that Madonna's show today already 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:42.370
 lost much of the impact it had on 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.500
 songs have been much rarer in terms of 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.239
 so the discs continue to 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.010
 being very irregular and the 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.190
 madonna presentations on stage is 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.769
 that old thing choreographies 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.989
 pathetic dancers costumes that 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.300
 whole thing very much playback 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.370
 pseudo rebel speech 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.720
 I think it's time to 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.720
 Madonna gives a little time to see 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.290
 Okay, my friend threatens me so it was 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.790
 tips from the week that is not show and cold to 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.510
 respect the show that you can not 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.730
 lose 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.550
 Of those stolen you have to run away. 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.920
 very quickly but you want to leave your 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.410
 comment here below and already knows week 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.270
 that comes with another edition of the show is 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.340
 Cold here for you, it's good, I hug you 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.020
 for everybody until then it is necessary to take 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.020
 shock box
