00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 if you like me have prepared gods 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.029
 simple cookies like these but not 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.670
 you are very satisfied with the result 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.040
 because you consider them too trivial I could 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.750
 give you a very very interesting idea 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.880
 today in fact transposes renault dei 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.039
 simple sweets like these from 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.590
 real creations biscuits 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.539
 elegant and colorful as covering them 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.670
 with a very easy water glaze 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.039
 let's see together how to prepare for 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.189
 prepare the icing in water are 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.730
 needed 50 g of icing sugar 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.860
 about a tablespoon of water and gods 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.510
 dyes or used dye in 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.960
 gels can also use 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.940
 powdered dyes or even liquid la 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.340
 Water glaze preparation is 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.020
 really simple but also important 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.039
 respect some precautions 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:55.140
 for example if we always do it 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:01:01.199
 icing sugar ok so you have one 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:04.860
 more velvety final texture now 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.630
 I chose red gel dyes 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.230
 in this case then we take one 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:14.480
 thumbtack ok 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.480
 water we mix the dye in the water 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.400
 once the dye is dissolved we can 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:27.030
 pour everything here in the inter 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:29.010
 mix stir this mix 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.680
 the right consistency 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.780
 if you use liquid dyes io 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.490
 I advise you to reduce it a little and 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.810
 amount of water an important one 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.970
 trick that I didn't tell you before 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.400
 because I had meant to use it 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.980
 the warm water 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.400
 now let's proceed with the glaze of 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:52.910
 a cookie we take a part of 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:02:00.530
 glaze and spread it on the spoon 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:02:04.610
 so in the same way we can 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.610
 make class of all colors 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.020
 maybe to beautify even more 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.940
 our biscuit we can add 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.940
 also of white beads 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.570
 we made some cookies 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.600
 glazed now I'll show you too 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.230
 with the blue light blue glaze prepared to 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.230
 same way 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:37.430
 always with a spoon we see a 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.430
 spread our fat on top 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.860
 clearly I showed you how 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.930
 cover the biscuits with the icing 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.150
 you can also use water instead 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.430
 the same glaze recipe for 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.280
 to cover cream puffs like these gods 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.280
 muffins or even in inter cakes
