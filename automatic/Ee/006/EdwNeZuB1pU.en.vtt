hard work that your partner does and

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.210 
hard work that your partner does and

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
think to yourself it could be a lot

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.620 
think to yourself it could be a lot
worse<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.670> could<00:01:20.820> have<00:01:20.939> water<00:01:21.150> running<00:01:21.450> down

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
worse you could have water running down

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.410 
worse you could have water running down
your<00:01:21.689> horse<00:01:22.290> but<00:01:23.100> basically<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.820> has<00:01:24.240> not

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
your horse but basically that has not

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.910 
your horse but basically that has not
dampened<00:01:24.840> my<00:01:24.930> Christmas<00:01:25.380> spirit<00:01:25.590> at<00:01:25.799> all

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
dampened my Christmas spirit at all
