00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110

petty are they gonna swap those around

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.770 
petty are they gonna swap those around
I<00:02:32.650> understand<00:02:33.580> doing<00:02:33.970> that<00:02:34.120> at<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.390> start<00:02:34.690> of

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
I understand doing that at the start of

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.300 
I understand doing that at the start of
the<00:02:34.870> season<00:02:35.290> or<00:02:35.440> when<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.740> have<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:35.950> driver

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
the season or when you have a driver

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.790 
the season or when you have a driver
change<00:02:36.460> like<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.420> 44<00:02:37.870> is<00:02:38.050> going<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.350> have<00:02:38.530> I

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
change like the 44 is going to have I

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.530 
change like the 44 is going to have I
understand<00:02:39.370> that<00:02:39.580> but<00:02:39.730> in<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.180> mid<00:02:40.330> season

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
understand that but in the mid season

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.690 
understand that but in the mid season
okay<00:02:40.840> you're<00:02:41.560> out<00:02:41.680> so<00:02:41.890> you<00:02:41.980> get<00:02:42.100> my<00:02:42.280> points<00:02:42.640> and

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
okay you're out so you get my points and

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.040 
okay you're out so you get my points and
you<00:02:42.820> get<00:02:43.000> this<00:02:43.120> champions<00:02:43.570> from<00:02:43.660> library

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
you get this champions from library

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.150 
you get this champions from library
because<00:02:44.290> you<00:02:44.380> don't<00:02:44.560> need<00:02:44.680> it<00:02:44.830> over<00:02:45.010> here

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
because you don't need it over here

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.550 
because you don't need it over here
that's<00:02:45.580> pretty<00:02:45.760> that's<00:02:46.110> confusing<00:02:47.110> I<00:02:47.200> agree

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
that's pretty that's confusing I agree

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.750 
that's pretty that's confusing I agree
but<00:02:47.770> I<00:02:47.890> think<00:02:48.130> that's<00:02:48.310> gonna<00:02:48.490> be<00:02:48.640> the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
but I think that's gonna be the

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.630 
but I think that's gonna be the
challenge<00:02:49.030> for<00:02:49.780> NASCAR<00:02:50.020> and<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:51.040> don't<00:02:51.370> think

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
challenge for NASCAR and I don't think

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.250 
challenge for NASCAR and I don't think
that<00:02:51.790> would<00:02:51.910> be<00:02:52.030> right<00:02:52.180> I<00:02:52.240> think<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.660> only<00:02:53.020> way

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
that would be right I think the only way

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.140 
that would be right I think the only way
that<00:02:53.290> that<00:02:53.710> would<00:02:53.830> be<00:02:54.010> right<00:02:54.250> is<00:02:54.730> if<00:02:55.000> they

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
that that would be right is if they

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.290 
that that would be right is if they
absolutely<00:02:55.540> put<00:02:56.110> Kyle<00:02:56.380> Petty<00:02:56.710> in<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.370> 43<00:02:58.030> car

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
absolutely put Kyle Petty in the 43 car

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.270 
absolutely put Kyle Petty in the 43 car
with<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.540> 43<00:02:59.050> number<00:02:59.200> that's<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.680> only<00:03:00.100> way

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
with the 43 number that's the only way

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.430 
with the 43 number that's the only way
that<00:03:00.550> would<00:03:00.940> be<00:03:01.030> right<00:03:01.210> right<00:03:01.900> or<00:03:01.930> wrong<00:03:02.200> in

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
that would be right right or wrong in

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.350 
that would be right right or wrong in

NASCAR<00:03:26.560> has<00:03:26.710> the<00:03:26.860> rules<00:03:27.070> that<00:03:27.280> you<00:03:27.400> can<00:03:27.520> work

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
NASCAR has the rules that you can work

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.700 
NASCAR has the rules that you can work
within<00:03:27.940> so<00:03:28.690> there<00:03:28.900> could<00:03:29.110> be<00:03:29.140> some<00:03:29.440> monkey

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 
within so there could be some monkey

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.980 
within so there could be some monkey
motions<00:03:30.070> going<00:03:30.340> on<00:03:30.490> but<00:03:30.730> I<00:03:30.940> think<00:03:31.180> if<00:03:31.690> he's<00:03:31.780> got

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
motions going on but I think if he's got

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.150 
motions going on but I think if he's got
to<00:03:32.080> be<00:03:32.140> good<00:03:32.320> enough<00:03:32.530> to<00:03:32.680> get<00:03:32.770> in<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.010> race

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
to be good enough to get in the race

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.500 
to be good enough to get in the race
it's<00:03:33.400> fine<00:03:33.610> if<00:03:33.760> he's<00:03:33.880> not<00:03:34.030> that<00:03:34.090> he<00:03:34.300> needs<00:03:34.480> to

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
it's fine if he's not that he needs to

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.250 
it's fine if he's not that he needs to
go<00:03:34.630> to<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.840> house

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
go to the house

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.840 
go to the house
