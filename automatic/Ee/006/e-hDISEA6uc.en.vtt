duh but you got to recharge the
individual<00:00:18.840> batteries<00:00:19.140> inside<00:00:19.770> these<00:00:19.890> cases

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
individual batteries inside these cases

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.099 
individual batteries inside these cases
there<00:00:20.609> are<00:00:20.640> lead-acid<00:00:21.029> batteries<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.869> are

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
there are lead-acid batteries that are

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.140 
there are lead-acid batteries that are
not<00:00:22.619> just<00:00:22.800> one<00:00:22.949> solid<00:00:23.430> battery<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.000> from

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
not just one solid battery this is from

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.179 
not just one solid battery this is from
a<00:00:24.240> Newton<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:25.109> can<00:00:25.260> probably<00:00:25.410> do<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.619> Black<00:00:26.010> and

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
a Newton you can probably do a Black and

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.670 
a Newton you can probably do a Black and
Decker<00:00:26.240> to<00:00:27.240> sod<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.840> as<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:27.990> took<00:00:28.320> out<00:00:28.439> these<00:00:28.560> two

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
Decker to sod it as I took out these two

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.910 
Decker to sod it as I took out these two
screws<00:00:29.750> detached<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.199> contacts<00:00:32.960> here<00:00:33.989> what

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
screws detached the contacts here what

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.680 
screws detached the contacts here what
does<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.190> connect<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.239> see<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.540> this

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
does is connect and I see that this

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.630 
does is connect and I see that this
couple<00:00:37.230> wires<00:00:37.530> which<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.920> really<00:00:38.219> easy<00:00:38.489> to

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
couple wires which is really easy to

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.610 
couple wires which is really easy to
take<00:00:39.149> off<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:40.500> going<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.770> get<00:00:40.890> some

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
take off so it's going to get some

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.790 
take off so it's going to get some

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
you know nose pliers just like easier

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.310 
you know nose pliers just like easier
but<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.200> forgot<00:00:50.000> all<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.059> electrode<00:00:52.020> out<00:00:52.140> here

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
but I forgot all that electrode out here

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.380 
but I forgot all that electrode out here
all<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.649> does<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:52.920> make<00:00:53.100> sure<00:00:53.820> electricity

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
all this does is make sure electricity

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.010 
all this does is make sure electricity
goes<00:00:54.539> into<00:00:54.780> all<00:00:55.340> then<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.460> can<00:00:56.640> easily<00:00:56.789> pull<00:00:57.780> out

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
goes into all then I can easily pull out

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:20.109 
goes into all then I can easily pull out
all<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.660> batteries<00:01:09.020> oops<00:01:10.020> sorry

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.300

so<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:27.090> can<00:01:27.299> see<00:01:27.450> inside<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.869> there<00:01:28.140> was<00:01:28.289> just

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
so you can see inside of there was just

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.389 
so you can see inside of there was just
three<00:01:29.039> 12-volt<00:01:30.030> 10<00:01:30.899> amp<00:01:31.140> hour<00:01:31.409> batteries<00:01:31.979> that

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
three 12-volt 10 amp hour batteries that

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:38.149 
three 12-volt 10 amp hour batteries that
combine<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.450> make<00:01:33.479> 36<00:01:33.869> volts<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:37.159> these

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
combine to make 36 volts and these

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.620 
combine to make 36 volts and these
actually<00:01:38.399> air<00:01:38.670> your<00:01:38.909> place<00:01:39.149> because<00:01:39.390> my<00:01:39.509> other

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
actually air your place because my other

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.120 
actually air your place because my other
batteries<00:01:40.079> were<00:01:40.229> dead

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.749 
a H UPS or sealed lead acid battery
these<00:01:52.709> are<00:01:52.860> about<00:01:53.069> maybe<00:01:54.770> 12<00:01:55.770> 15<00:01:56.399> dollars

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
these are about maybe 12 15 dollars

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.229 
these are about maybe 12 15 dollars
maybe<00:01:57.090> $18<00:01:57.720> shipped<00:01:57.959> to<00:01:58.920> get<00:01:59.069> a<00:01:59.099> new<00:01:59.310> new<00:01:59.939> set

maybe $18 shipped to get a new new set

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:03.440 
maybe $18 shipped to get a new new set
so<00:02:00.509> these<00:02:00.659> were<00:02:00.840> brand<00:02:01.140> new<00:02:01.670> this<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.729> my<00:02:03.060> my

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
so these were brand new this is my my

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.539 
so these were brand new this is my my
better<00:02:03.659> battery<00:02:03.989> now<00:02:04.170> those<00:02:04.860> are<00:02:05.039> all<00:02:05.099> set<00:02:05.429> up

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
better battery now those are all set up

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.449 
better battery now those are all set up
in<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:06.090> series<00:02:06.539> so<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.750> equals<00:02:07.289> 12<00:02:07.979> 24<00:02:08.429> 36

I<00:02:33.150> numbered<00:02:33.989> these<00:02:34.109> one<00:02:34.709> two<00:02:34.950> three<00:02:35.810> so<00:02:36.810> when<00:02:36.930> I

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
I numbered these one two three so when I

I numbered these one two three so when I
put<00:02:37.170> them<00:02:37.260> back<00:02:37.410> in<00:02:37.680> I'll<00:02:38.250> probably<00:02:38.549> do<00:02:38.760> three

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
put them back in I'll probably do three

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290

that the first two batteries will

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.530 
that the first two batteries will
