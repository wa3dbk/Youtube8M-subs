I was expecting a run and I totally fell

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.890 
I was expecting a run and I totally fell
for<00:03:10.050> that<00:03:10.950> play<00:03:11.370> action<00:03:11.640> pass<00:03:11.880> as<00:03:12.360> he<00:03:12.540> beats<00:03:12.780> me

for that play action pass as he beats me
deep<00:03:13.200> I<00:03:13.440> believe<00:03:13.860> that<00:03:13.890> Kyle<00:03:14.280> Rudolph<00:03:14.960> yeah

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.020 
deep I believe that Kyle Rudolph yeah
Kyle<00:03:16.590> Rudolph<00:03:16.860> beats<00:03:17.280> me<00:03:17.459> deep<00:03:17.670> he<00:03:17.850> looked

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
Kyle Rudolph beats me deep he looked

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.760 
Kyle Rudolph beats me deep he looked
like<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.209> frickin<00:03:18.660> wide<00:03:18.840> receiver<00:03:19.380> right<00:03:19.560> there

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770
