00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.340
 your Majesty 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.650
 the army of the devilish surf ox 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.490
 want to have on the edge of the case your camp 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.920
 pitched 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.410
 our customers report that his 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.810
 Army is eaten this name at noon 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.789
 we can only wait and ours now 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.820
 improve defense 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.880
 the delicacies are in waves from pvc 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.039
 exude general protection 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.710
 of the castle and our population 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.899
 towers would have to be built to build Romans 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.989
 to ward off enemy balls with it only 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:41.149
 higher is defenders of a still one 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:48.379
 this unthinkable tower defense crown 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:51.010
 Well not quite our army 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.859
 prepare for counterattack 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.719
 Only destroy the enemy base 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:59.079
 when we meet you with our soldiers 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.859
 take on counterattack with your own 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.930
 soldiers 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.309
 really heard is actually playing 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.379
 defenders of kenya like one 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.509
 real-time strategy title just after 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.520
 the rules of tower defense instead 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.200
 we deduct defense towers a base high 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.700
 and at the same time send troops to the 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:22.539
 So we determine the battle 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:24.280
 enemy fortress until the defenders of 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.020
 kenya drives in the course of his round 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.149
 six-hour campaign even one 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.590
 little story in which we as 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.509
 ruler of a little man 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.289
 kingdom of an undead plague 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.869
 hunt down 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.720
 on our linear journey across the 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.670
 fantasy continent adonia we turn 18 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.580
 free missions by making new allies 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.530
 how to find dwarves magicians or elves like 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.280
 At the end we fight for the last one 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.280
 prepare 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.400
 with increasing game progress 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.920
 the game mechanics and the leveldesign 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.480
 getting more complex for the beginning of it 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.050
 for example, a boss hero monster 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.360
 like here 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.550
 but it does not stay that way 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.500
 extensive units and tower upgrades 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.120
 We also receive spells or 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.920
 the levels are more and more similar to one another 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.899
 labyrinth in which we take the path our 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.910
 units must choose carefully 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.410
 Unfortunately, the opponent does this too 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.330
 The ki does not stand out too much 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.880
 bright so that we are only at the very end 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.890
 The campaign will be challenged a little 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.630
 Scalable difficulty is missing 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.640
 It also excels in many missions 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.260
 very early defense the respective 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.660
 will decide for itself 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.280
 We can do that every online 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.900
 in multiplayer mode 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.730
 the alignment on multiplayer duels 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.620
 is also good in the campaign 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.330
 recognize the symmetrical levels 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.930
 all in the occasional four player 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.580
 mission 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.980
 Here we fight for example at the 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.290
 side of a ki-controlled magician order 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.700
 against the undead and a breakaway 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.709
 magician school uses the ki allies 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.930
 defenders on alenia for some nice 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.670
 We should bear tasks here, for example 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.600
 they protect us but hostile 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.280
 face 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.660
 So we have to look at it at the same time 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.400
 Be careful not to lose too many 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.019
 suffer and that we do not 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.330
 accidentally decimate yourself 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.340
 only when we were one of the undead fortresses 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.320
 crumbles are the bears of ours 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.730
 good intentions convinced and put 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.380
 your attacks on us 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.330
 that's a pretty idea but unfortunately 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.980
 Does not hold every card that level was 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.940
 many people just say they storm 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.940
 enemy fortress 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.579
 technically defenders of a day makes one 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.530
 solid impression 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.359
 Although the game wins no prize in 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.680
 things detail degree but everything is clean 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.450
 and harmoniously designed 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.620
 even if it floods in the face of the effect 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.219
 occasionally a little confusing 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.510
 or can be jerky 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:37.299
 We especially liked it 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.590
 the music and the setting of the 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.849
 unspectacular dialogues with us 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.560
 english version a tick better 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.719
 like as the german but 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.790
 decide for yourself 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:51.169
 And this is the story of the leap 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.010
 in the short version damn there is one 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:58.280
 problem 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:04:00.669
 master of all adviser history of the 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.669
 fish 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.019
 prove watson study Problem 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.290
 defenders of kenya wins with the 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.820
 real-time strategy component the tower 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.130
 Defense genre actually one 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.660
 refreshing new aspect from even though 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.520
 he does not understand the potential of this idea 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.800
 exhausted and something with missing 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.320
 The title has to fight 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.630
 for tower defense fans quite happy 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.430
 at the cheap price of around 15 euros 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.430
 So there is no reason to moan 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.370
 here
