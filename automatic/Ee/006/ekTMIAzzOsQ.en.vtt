world this indicates that there there

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.830 
world this indicates that there there
wouldn't<00:02:23.250> be<00:02:23.370> any<00:02:23.610> wasted<00:02:24.090> time<00:02:24.360> for<00:02:24.690> them<00:02:24.810> to

wouldn't be any wasted time for them to

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.370 
wouldn't be any wasted time for them to
make<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:26.040> tutorial<00:02:26.880> worlds<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.810> have<00:02:28.020> two

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
make to tutorial worlds to have two

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.360 
make to tutorial worlds to have two
different<00:02:28.620> disks<00:02:29.190> so<00:02:30.030> this<00:02:30.270> has<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.720> be<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.470> huge

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
different disks so this has to be a huge

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.430 
different disks so this has to be a huge
indicator<00:02:32.700> that<00:02:33.180> there's<00:02:33.630> going<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:33.990> be<00:02:34.020> a

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
indicator that there's going to be a

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.270 
indicator that there's going to be a
huge<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.670> massive<00:02:36.480> title<00:02:37.140> update<00:02:37.380> change<00:02:37.950> in

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
huge a massive title update change in

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.880 
huge a massive title update change in
the<00:02:38.940> next<00:02:39.090> couple<00:02:39.390> of<00:02:39.570> days<00:02:39.890> specifically

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
the next couple of days specifically

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.130 
the next couple of days specifically
around<00:02:41.270> Minecon<00:02:42.270> so<00:02:42.480> I'm<00:02:42.780> gonna<00:02:42.900> talk<00:02:43.050> about

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
around Minecon so I'm gonna talk about

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.110 
around Minecon so I'm gonna talk about
Minecon<00:02:43.590> in<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:43.920> little<00:02:44.130> bit<00:02:44.340> here<00:02:44.520> however

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
Minecon in a little bit here however

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.640 
Minecon in a little bit here however
let's<00:02:45.360> get<00:02:45.780> back<00:02:45.990> here<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.380> this<00:02:46.500> tutorial

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
let's get back here to this tutorial

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.730 
let's get back here to this tutorial
world<00:02:47.100> so<00:02:47.310> for<00:02:47.820> J<00:02:48.000> Steve<00:02:48.420> actually<00:02:48.780> tweeted

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
world so for J Steve actually tweeted

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.350 
world so for J Steve actually tweeted
out<00:02:49.770> he<00:02:49.890> confirm<00:02:50.160> that<00:02:50.340> they<00:02:50.430> did<00:02:50.580> not<00:02:50.790> touch

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
out he confirm that they did not touch

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.840 
out he confirm that they did not touch
anything<00:02:51.780> about<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.410> toe<00:02:52.920> looks<00:02:53.310> real<00:02:53.640> world

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
anything about the toe looks real world

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.090 
anything about the toe looks real world
so<00:02:54.330> I<00:02:54.360> was<00:02:54.750> correct<00:02:54.930> nothing<00:02:55.440> was<00:02:55.560> changed<00:02:55.590> we

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
so I was correct nothing was changed we

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.310 
so I was correct nothing was changed we
need<00:02:56.220> expert<00:02:56.580> completely<00:02:57.180> exactly<00:02:58.110> where

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
need expert completely exactly where

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.760 
need expert completely exactly where
they<00:02:58.470> were<00:02:58.650> their<00:02:58.860> state<00:02:59.100> play<00:02:59.370> um<00:03:00.090> so<00:03:00.600> now<00:03:01.230> we

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
they were their state play um so now we

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.530 
they were their state play um so now we
actually<00:03:01.920> jump<00:03:02.370> forward<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:02.940> little<00:03:03.120> bit<00:03:03.270> and

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
actually jump forward a little bit and

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.800 
actually jump forward a little bit and
we<00:03:04.230> actually<00:03:04.410> find<00:03:05.070> out<00:03:05.460> if<00:03:06.330> you<00:03:06.480> guys<00:03:06.630> did<00:03:06.780> not

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
we actually find out if you guys did not

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.810 
we actually find out if you guys did not

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
however they did indicate that we were

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.040 
however they did indicate that we were
going<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:18.030> be<00:03:18.120> getting<00:03:18.300> some<00:03:18.690> different

going to be getting some different
biomes<00:03:19.410> based<00:03:20.070> on<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.460> image<00:03:20.820> they<00:03:21.030> they

biomes based on the image they they

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.550 
biomes based on the image they they
tweeted<00:03:22.860> out<00:03:23.070> a<00:03:23.130> couple<00:03:23.400> days<00:03:23.550> ago<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:24.230> so<00:03:25.230> we

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
tweeted out a couple days ago and so we

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.830 
tweeted out a couple days ago and so we
are<00:03:25.710> missing<00:03:25.980> those<00:03:26.280> biomes<00:03:26.640> on<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.540> title

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840

studios<00:03:34.220> to<00:03:35.220> my<00:03:35.340> understanding<00:03:35.610> they've

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
studios to my understanding they've

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.280 
studios to my understanding they've
never<00:03:36.990> made<00:03:37.710> a<00:03:38.010> mistake<00:03:38.900> tweeting<00:03:39.900> something

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
never made a mistake tweeting something

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.090 
never made a mistake tweeting something
out<00:03:40.470> or<00:03:41.120> like<00:03:42.120> indicated<00:03:42.720> something<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.320> in

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
out or like indicated something and in

out or like indicated something and in
not<00:03:44.730> been<00:03:45.030> in<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.510> game<00:03:45.660> so<00:03:46.050> if<00:03:46.590> this<00:03:46.890> is<00:03:47.100> a

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
not been in the game so if this is a

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.060 
not been in the game so if this is a
little<00:03:47.670> very<00:03:47.940> tiny<00:03:48.450> mistake<00:03:49.110> it<00:03:49.320> could<00:03:49.890> be

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
little very tiny mistake it could be

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.220 
little very tiny mistake it could be
definitely<00:03:50.970> a<00:03:51.030> little<00:03:51.120> easter<00:03:51.630> egg<00:03:51.780> they<00:03:51.960> put

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
definitely a little easter egg they put

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.800 
definitely a little easter egg they put
out<00:03:52.350> there<00:03:52.560> that<00:03:52.950> they<00:03:53.070> wanted<00:03:53.490> us<00:03:53.580> to<00:03:53.760> find

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
out there that they wanted us to find

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.480 
out there that they wanted us to find
eventually<00:03:54.810> but<00:03:55.410> there's<00:03:55.650> definitely<00:03:56.010> going

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
eventually but there's definitely going

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.460 
eventually but there's definitely going
