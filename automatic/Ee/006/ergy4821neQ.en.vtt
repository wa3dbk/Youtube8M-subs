technologies that were focused on voice

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.390 
technologies that were focused on voice
first<00:02:11.300> and<00:02:11.840> we<00:02:11.930> had<00:02:12.050> a<00:02:12.080> data<00:02:12.380> later<00:02:12.650> this<00:02:13.220> is

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
first and we had a data later this is

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.550 
first and we had a data later this is
data<00:02:13.610> from<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:13.940> ground<00:02:14.209> up<00:02:14.360> at<00:02:14.720> their<00:02:15.110> teenage

second<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:22.400> uploading<00:02:23.060> fun<00:02:23.980> so<00:02:24.980> now<00:02:25.190> I'm

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
second the uploading fun so now I'm

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.090 
second the uploading fun so now I'm
going<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.820> initiate<00:02:26.320> the<00:02:27.320> video<00:02:27.680> conferencing

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
going to initiate the video conferencing

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.940 
going to initiate the video conferencing
or<00:02:31.060> so<00:02:32.060> what<00:02:32.299> is<00:02:32.480> your<00:02:32.660> up<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.110> down<00:02:33.230> link<00:02:33.680> job

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
or so what is your up and down link job

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:43.350 
or so what is your up and down link job
over<00:02:34.610> there

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.370 

15

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.970 

so<00:02:48.380> same<00:02:48.680> thing<00:02:48.709> might<00:02:49.250> uplink<00:02:50.120> is<00:02:50.330> a<00:02:50.560> 7.48<00:02:51.560> and

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
so same thing might uplink is a 7.48 and

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.570 
so same thing might uplink is a 7.48 and
my<00:02:52.610> downlink<00:02:53.569> is<00:02:53.810> a<00:02:53.840> changing<00:02:54.560> between<00:02:54.740> 500

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
my downlink is a changing between 500

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.270 
my downlink is a changing between 500
and<00:02:55.730> 700<00:02:56.450> mega<00:02:56.750> we<00:02:56.900> depend<00:02:57.440> on<00:02:57.530> by<00:02:57.800> fading

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
and 700 mega we depend on by fading

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.400 
and 700 mega we depend on by fading
right<00:02:58.790> now<00:02:58.940> we're<00:02:59.209> three<00:02:59.900> and<00:03:00.020> a<00:03:00.050> half<00:03:00.080> miles

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
right now we're three and a half miles

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.680 
right now we're three and a half miles
away<00:03:00.740> from<00:03:00.800> the<00:03:01.040> site<00:03:01.310> into<00:03:01.700> a<00:03:01.730> deep<00:03:02.000> fade<00:03:02.330> so

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
away from the site into a deep fade so

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.540 
away from the site into a deep fade so
the<00:03:02.840> Omni<00:03:03.230> antennas<00:03:03.800> that<00:03:03.830> are<00:03:03.950> on<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.280> truck

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
the Omni antennas that are on the truck

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.150 
the Omni antennas that are on the truck
you<00:03:05.120> cannot<00:03:05.390> connect<00:03:05.870> or<00:03:06.530> you<00:03:06.709> can't<00:03:06.920> maintain

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
you cannot connect or you can't maintain

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.120 
you cannot connect or you can't maintain
any<00:03:07.550> throughput<00:03:08.120> so<00:03:08.390> what<00:03:08.540> we're<00:03:08.690> doing<00:03:08.720> is<00:03:09.200> we

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
any throughput so what we're doing is we

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.440 
any throughput so what we're doing is we
are<00:03:10.160> going<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.459> use<00:03:11.020> external<00:03:12.020> yeah<00:03:12.500> antennas

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
are going to use external yeah antennas

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.270 
are going to use external yeah antennas
with<00:03:14.450> various<00:03:14.900> gains<00:03:15.200> and<00:03:16.040> we're<00:03:16.130> going<00:03:16.250> to

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
with various gains and we're going to

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
point them back towards the site so that

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.080 
point them back towards the site so that
we<00:03:18.470> can<00:03:18.620> re-establish<00:03:18.830> a<00:03:19.340> connection<00:03:19.459> on<00:03:19.970> the

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
we can re-establish a connection on the

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.020 
we can re-establish a connection on the
uplink<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:21.650> then<00:03:21.890> we'll<00:03:22.250> see<00:03:22.489> that<00:03:22.670> by<00:03:22.820> using

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
uplink and then we'll see that by using

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.630 
uplink and then we'll see that by using
these<00:03:23.330> high<00:03:23.750> gain<00:03:24.019> antennas<00:03:24.590> where<00:03:25.489> you

now establish a connection and get

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.750 
now establish a connection and get
