00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 sure of beautiful rockets of this 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.830
 brand new is plus of minecraft pocket 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.000
 edition 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.130
 then I 'm here in this new episode 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.480
 of the rai towards the network 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.639
 then I would say that we are already there 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.480
 approaching towards the last episodes of 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.580
 this series 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.320
 last year we left cricket 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.800
 Here in fact the mine as her network 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.930
 goodbye to dig enough harvest 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.480
 mineral like a bit of coal a little 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.760
 the reds are at home come this 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.320
 beautiful iron pickaxe today has 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.230
 I collect everything monetary well 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.790
 three diamonds that are quite counted 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.250
 that to make a mather reaktor ne 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.809
 need two so I really think so 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.059
 they need two but they are not really 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.309
 convinced I think so he can't 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.160
 see real of the house in the wall 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.960
 let's see immediately here it is not useful 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.270
 three buses the right perfect mini we have 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.700
 just argument that only served 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.559
 two tests however then there was the other 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.170
 iron that I finished doing last 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.899
 pickaxe iron well anyway to 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.000
 details now I would say to put back rather than before 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.489
 we sleep baby I spend the night 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.309
 and tomorrow we will do everything 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.140
 place I did already morning I would say of 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.760
 put our own in order 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.380
 minerals like the raider that will be 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.990
 completely useless in this mini 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.930
 series or to whom the diamonds are aimed we put them 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.330
 here the small hint is ok 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.430
 when we should also see some where 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.430
 building the I don't know net is a reaktor 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.580
 because the type we build nearby 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.579
 van gaal type invades us the house and it 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.020
 I see well but we do not care either 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.060
 so much because when we go 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.640
 in the lands the series and will end there 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.860
 maybe far away now we have to see a little 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.600
 where to do it anyway better than I am 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.060
 by doing these you are then commented 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.680
 always leave me always like under the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.110
 video anyway the time 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.000
 now in this episode I would say about 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.650
 maybe you can do I would say we have 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.260
 almost everything we have a beautiful but you there 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.030
 we have a pick we have the tools 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.030
 in stone still has to pay some 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.850
 Strapless type lover like that would be 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.890
 cool to prepare apple then we'll see some 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.660
 how to do swords called because 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.460
 honestly I also put a mess in it 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.320
 dig because I went all the way 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.140
 galleries that were going were created 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.209
 all to the left and type the worst 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.160
 anyway, then, in the speeches 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.590
 video I promised I wanted to have a 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.350
 dog you can indeed we had found a 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.910
 in fact, I wanted him to have nothing 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.790
 inspired to have a dog 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.530
 however I would say to do serves year 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.200
 let's wait for the night so you have to go 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.060
 chasing monsters maybe killing 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.700
 also of the dirani to make us pay the 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.590
 marco and then also the bones for ours 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.800
 little dog that now I don't see any more 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.800
 I don't see anyone around either 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.680
 it's an asshole bandana ok it's going down 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.040
 right now the night so we're ready 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.320
 there are monsters to fight 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.030
 active we check immediately maybe then 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.370
 I would say to use then in the near zone 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.500
 home two moves we risk dying there 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.600
 we take refuge abroad and no stimulation 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.269
 inside here are two spiders we go 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.420
 immediately to kill them practically should 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:06.180
 be easy enough out of everyone 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.630
 deserving bastards you perfect god 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.980
 here we collect some 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.049
 call it a bit of thread as we can 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.299
 create perhaps an arch that can be used 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.340
 when we go into the ether then to the 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.440
 this is not all this rainet thing is 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.260
 but let's say that a little bit of a scene 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.360
 preparation from the cc st oddio qua ma 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.519
 all with half life i am foreigner of 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.200
 shit places names if I don't need them 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.110
 killing them therefore give me nothing 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.840
 so I would say don't kill them and bet 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.269
 especially to spiders and skeletons 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.580
 a fine cost of the sword so yes 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.890
 make up the shit and I want to aim at 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.340
 scudetto because I want his bones dies 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.010
 ok maybe i'm with any of you 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.630
 that if they help you, get nothing out of it 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.360
 An invasion of all zombie husband 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.250
 strong set of shit a spider and too much 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.250
 people didn't remind me that this was the case 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.350
 difficult to play pious enemies with 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.720
 a difficult truth not quite as good as not 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:03.110
 I play less with the young plant 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.980
 he dies that seems to ruin madonna maybe 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.220
 die vol 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.290
 no no no no no no no no no no no I have 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.730
 finished the sword and there is a clip is not one 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.680
 good thing or chicago that the fine 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:22.160
 nice little sword because I 'm here 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:25.730
 we remain dry 9 afraid of turning and 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.540
 I can't sleep and I don't know how 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.260
 do ok 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:33.190
 one is dead circles for now you are beautiful 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:44.810
 the one at the stampede flee 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:52.220
 oh she ran away to die die 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:54.350
 to me far away branches perfect ok 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.270
 is killed also the concrete lawn 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.890
 ion powder that even that won't help 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.270
 however , we collect it anyway 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.970
 because we need it 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:05.540
 however it is time for her, oh, lander man 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.340
 no non-violent me yesterday to collect 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.130
 our plantation because really 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.720
 He gave us the many fruits 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.820
 let's plant these other trans emiles 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.770
 we have collected a Madonna song 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.840
 the carrots here are still very useful 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.510
 growing so we leave to do 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.150
 so by was the next episode I think 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.140
 be the last I'll try to go into 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.580
 mine 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.220
 digging as much as possible to find 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.530
 the last remaining pieces and then go 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.810
 in let her finally defeat 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.910
 all the big man zombies is there then yes 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.680
 will end the series that really is 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.050
 I really liked it so much 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.360
 as a series hopefully this 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.780
 episode I liked no next ecm 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.780
 video etc.
