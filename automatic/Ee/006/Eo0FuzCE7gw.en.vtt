00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
Philip Treacy we chose a castle actually

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.540 
Philip Treacy we chose a castle actually
the<00:03:49.920> ruin<00:03:50.400> of<00:03:50.610> castle<00:03:51.150> is<00:03:51.270> as<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:51.540> location<00:03:51.990> and

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
the ruin of castle is as a location and

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.390 
the ruin of castle is as a location and
just<00:03:53.550> as<00:03:53.730> we<00:03:53.880> arrived<00:03:54.300> a<00:03:54.780> ray<00:03:55.320> of<00:03:55.350> light<00:03:55.740> shot

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
just as we arrived a ray of light shot

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.600 
just as we arrived a ray of light shot
through<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:56.850> ceiling<00:03:57.330> it<00:03:57.750> was<00:03:57.990> like<00:03:58.610> an

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
through the ceiling it was like an

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.480 
through the ceiling it was like an
almost<00:04:00.180> divine<00:04:01.050> light<00:04:01.470> and<00:04:01.800> we<00:04:02.160> quickly

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
almost divine light and we quickly

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.900 
almost divine light and we quickly
realized<00:04:02.990> we<00:04:03.990> had<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.500> show<00:04:04.740> it<00:04:04.950> in<00:04:05.130> this<00:04:05.520> slide

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
realized we had to show it in this slide

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.260 
realized we had to show it in this slide
it<00:04:06.360> worked<00:04:06.810> out<00:04:07.080> just<00:04:07.370> perfectly<00:04:08.370> the

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
it worked out just perfectly the

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.750 
it worked out just perfectly the
photographs<00:04:09.810> look<00:04:10.800> as<00:04:10.920> if<00:04:11.070> the<00:04:11.190> lighting<00:04:11.610> was

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
photographs look as if the lighting was

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.480 
photographs look as if the lighting was
really<00:04:12.330> sophisticated<00:04:12.660> but<00:04:13.260> in<00:04:13.410> fact<00:04:13.710> it<00:04:14.100> all

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
really sophisticated but in fact it all

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.810 
really sophisticated but in fact it all
just<00:04:15.030> fell<00:04:16.020> into<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.440> place<00:04:16.770> at<00:04:17.520> the<00:04:17.670> right

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
just fell into the place at the right

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.060 
just fell into the place at the right
moment<00:04:18.299> that's<00:04:18.450> how<00:04:18.989> Dallas<00:04:19.200> or<00:04:19.500> Suzanne<00:04:19.799> get

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
moment that's how Dallas or Suzanne get

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.480 
moment that's how Dallas or Suzanne get
past

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490
