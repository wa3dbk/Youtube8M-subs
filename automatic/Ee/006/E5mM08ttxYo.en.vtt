quick update here are the boys in their
natural<00:00:12.900> form<00:00:13.250> this<00:00:14.250> is<00:00:14.429> what<00:00:14.610> they<00:00:14.759> do<00:00:14.820> they

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
natural form this is what they do they

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.410 
natural form this is what they do they
just<00:00:15.360> like<00:00:15.870> once<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:16.949> start<00:00:17.850> cleaning<00:00:18.270> their

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
just like once I start cleaning their

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.599 
just like once I start cleaning their
cage<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.650> minute<00:00:20.010> they<00:00:20.160> go<00:00:20.340> in<00:00:20.460> there

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
cage and the minute they go in there

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.380 
cage and the minute they go in there
little<00:00:20.760> carrier<00:00:21.300> they<00:00:21.630> just<00:00:21.930> like<00:00:22.170> chill<00:00:22.680> out

little carrier they just like chill out
which<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.600> super<00:00:24.779> funny<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.500> think<00:00:26.130> it's<00:00:26.369> just

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
which is super funny I think it's just

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.349 
which is super funny I think it's just
it<00:00:27.570> basically<00:00:28.050> just<00:00:28.170> shows<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.650> they're

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
it basically just shows that they're

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:35.920 
it basically just shows that they're
relaxed<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.539> gas<00:00:31.820> over<00:00:32.820> here<00:00:33.120> but<00:00:33.480> anyway<00:00:34.370> so

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
relaxed and gas over here but anyway so

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.090 
relaxed and gas over here but anyway so
