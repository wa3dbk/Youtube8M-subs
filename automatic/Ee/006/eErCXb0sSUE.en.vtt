computer bent so what you have to do is
just<00:00:55.640> get<00:00:55.850> a<00:00:55.880> corner<00:00:56.329> of<00:00:56.360> that<00:00:56.510> and<00:00:57.219> peel<00:00:58.219> that

just get a corner of that and peel that
coating<00:00:58.910> off<00:00:59.059> and<00:00:59.360> you<00:00:59.420> can<00:00:59.570> see<00:00:59.750> how

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
coating off and you can see how

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.020 
coating off and you can see how
underneath<00:01:00.379> it's<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.129> shiny<00:01:01.430> so<00:01:01.850> this

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
underneath it's the shiny so this

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.150 
underneath it's the shiny so this
coating<00:01:02.420> on<00:01:02.660> here<00:01:02.690> keeps<00:01:03.500> that<00:01:03.680> from<00:01:03.739> getting

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
coating on here keeps that from getting

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.520 
coating on here keeps that from getting
scratched<00:01:04.460> up<00:01:04.759> so<00:01:05.420> once<00:01:05.630> you<00:01:05.780> peel<00:01:05.990> it<00:01:06.050> all<00:01:06.289> off

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530
