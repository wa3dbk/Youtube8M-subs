so with the bris macrophotography
it's<00:00:24.580> a<00:00:24.640> great<00:00:24.820> way<00:00:24.970> to<00:00:25.000> get<00:00:25.720> those<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:27.220> get

much to do macro photography one of the

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.410 
much to do macro photography one of the
misconceptions<00:01:03.910> I<00:01:04.660> think<00:01:04.690> I<00:01:05.940> hear<00:01:06.940> a<00:01:07.240> lot

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
misconceptions I think I hear a lot

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.450 
misconceptions I think I hear a lot
about<00:01:07.479> it<00:01:07.810> is<00:01:07.899> you<00:01:08.350> need<00:01:08.500> to<00:01:08.530> reverse<00:01:09.100> prime

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
about it is you need to reverse prime

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.790 
about it is you need to reverse prime
lens<00:01:09.759> and<00:01:10.090> tons<00:01:10.300> of<00:01:10.450> extension<00:01:11.380> tubes<00:01:11.619> and

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
lens and tons of extension tubes and

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.109 
lens and tons of extension tubes and
stuff<00:01:12.039> it<00:01:12.789> really<00:01:12.940> isn't<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.360> case<00:01:14.850> I'm<00:01:15.850> often

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
stuff it really isn't the case I'm often

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:23.190 
stuff it really isn't the case I'm often
using<00:01:16.750> this<00:01:17.340> at<00:01:18.539> 200<00:01:19.539> millimeters<00:01:22.200> for

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
using this at 200 millimeters for

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.609 
using this at 200 millimeters for
flowers<00:01:23.649> and<00:01:24.039> such<00:01:24.569> he's<00:01:25.569> like<00:01:25.720> you<00:01:26.229> can<00:01:26.380> focus

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
flowers and such he's like you can focus

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.949 
flowers and such he's like you can focus
really<00:01:27.369> far<00:01:27.610> away<00:01:27.729> with<00:01:28.030> 200<00:01:28.509> millimeters

00:01:28.949 --> 00:01:28.959 
really far away with 200 millimeters

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:33.419 
really far away with 200 millimeters
reversed<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:32.039> really<00:01:33.039> gives<00:01:33.220> you<00:01:33.310> the

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
reversed it really gives you the

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.050 
reversed it really gives you the
flexibility<00:01:35.039> so<00:01:36.039> the<00:01:36.280> few<00:01:36.459> things<00:01:36.700> you<00:01:36.849> need

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
flexibility so the few things you need

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.639 
flexibility so the few things you need
you<00:01:38.520> don't<00:01:39.520> these<00:01:39.959> control<00:01:40.959> the<00:01:41.080> aperture<00:01:41.200> I

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
you don't these control the aperture I

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.410 
you don't these control the aperture I
just<00:01:42.069> drilled<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.369> hole<00:01:42.550> in<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:42.849> rear<00:01:43.240> lens

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
just drilled the hole in the rear lens

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:55.220 
just drilled the hole in the rear lens
cap<00:01:45.090> very<00:01:46.619> simple

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.580 

found<00:01:56.230> it

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
found it

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.390 
found it
the<00:01:57.010> a<00:01:58.530> little<00:01:59.530> reversing<00:01:59.980> rings<00:02:00.190> one<00:02:00.370> of

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
the a little reversing rings one of

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.320 
the a little reversing rings one of
these<00:02:00.960> cheapo<00:02:02.490> frittata<00:02:03.490> New<00:02:03.730> Yawk<00:02:03.970> or

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
these cheapo frittata New Yawk or

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.110 
these cheapo frittata New Yawk or
whatever<00:02:04.510> it's<00:02:04.780> called<00:02:04.920> things<00:02:05.920> and<00:02:06.160> for<00:02:06.970> this

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
whatever it's called things and for this

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.050 
whatever it's called things and for this
I<00:02:07.510> needed<00:02:08.290> the<00:02:08.530> 60<00:02:09.220> to<00:02:09.429> 255<00:02:10.210> step<00:02:10.929> down<00:02:11.140> green

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
I needed the 60 to 255 step down green

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:21.360 
I needed the 60 to 255 step down green
so<00:02:13.060> I<00:02:13.360> got<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.750> new<00:02:14.940> screw<00:02:15.940> this<00:02:16.090> thing<00:02:16.150> on<00:02:20.370> pop

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
so I got a new screw this thing on pop

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:31.710 
so I got a new screw this thing on pop
it<00:02:21.580> on<00:02:21.760> here<00:02:29.010> here<00:02:30.010> okay

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
it on here here okay

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:42.339 
it on here here okay
after<00:02:38.580> there<00:02:39.580> we<00:02:39.670> go

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.580 

so<00:02:42.799> it<00:02:42.920> looks<00:02:43.159> like<00:02:43.870> this<00:02:44.870> is<00:02:44.989> what<00:02:45.140> I<00:02:45.170> use<00:02:45.439> to

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
so it looks like this is what I use to

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.170 
so it looks like this is what I use to
take<00:02:45.769> all<00:02:45.980> my<00:02:47.620> flower<00:02:48.620> shots<00:02:49.069> and<00:02:49.519> such<00:02:50.150> a

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
take all my flower shots and such a

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.080 
take all my flower shots and such a
night<00:02:50.450> with<00:02:51.439> it<00:02:51.590> out<00:02:51.680> here<00:02:52.010> at<00:02:52.159> like<00:02:52.370> 100<00:02:52.879> 200

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
night with it out here at like 100 200

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.720 
night with it out here at like 100 200
millimeters<00:02:53.719> you<00:02:53.900> can<00:02:54.650> focus<00:02:54.889> really<00:02:55.340> far

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
millimeters you can focus really far

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.160 
millimeters you can focus really far
away<00:02:55.849> you're<00:02:56.389> really<00:02:56.659> close<00:02:58.900> you<00:02:59.900> might<00:03:00.019> even

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
away you're really close you might even

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.539 
away you're really close you might even
be<00:03:00.290> able<00:03:00.409> to<00:03:00.530> focus<00:03:00.739> I<00:03:01.010> like<00:03:01.189> nearly<00:03:01.609> infinity

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
be able to focus I like nearly infinity

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.449 
be able to focus I like nearly infinity
200<00:03:05.230> so<00:03:06.230> yeah<00:03:06.409> here<00:03:06.799> are<00:03:06.859> some<00:03:07.010> shots<00:03:07.189> I've

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
200 so yeah here are some shots I've

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:17.290 
200 so yeah here are some shots I've
taken<00:03:07.700> with<00:03:07.939> it<00:03:07.969> the<00:03:08.750> last<00:03:08.930> few<00:03:09.109> days

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:26.920 

you

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.800 

you<00:03:27.930> know<00:03:29.270> it<00:03:30.270> works<00:03:30.690> great<00:03:31.050> it<00:03:31.530> means

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
you know it works great it means

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.680 
you know it works great it means
sometimes<00:03:33.810> don't<00:03:34.050> even<00:03:34.319> need<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.470> flash<00:03:35.690> very

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
sometimes don't even need to flash very

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.920 
sometimes don't even need to flash very
easy<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:37.080> do<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:39.980> do<00:03:40.980> who's<00:03:41.250> all<00:03:41.459> manual<00:03:42.240> all

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
easy to do you do who's all manual all

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.280 
easy to do you do who's all manual all
you<00:03:43.319> all<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.340> camera<00:03:45.239> controls<00:03:45.780> so<00:03:46.080> you<00:03:46.170> have

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
you all the camera controls so you have

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.770 
you all the camera controls so you have
to<00:03:46.470> expel<00:03:47.250> lose<00:03:47.430> enough<00:03:47.819> focus<00:03:48.270> manually

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
to expel lose enough focus manually

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.840 
to expel lose enough focus manually
that's<00:03:49.650> not<00:03:49.800> a<00:03:49.830> problem<00:03:50.069> with<00:03:50.280> macro<00:03:50.700> you're

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
that's not a problem with macro you're
