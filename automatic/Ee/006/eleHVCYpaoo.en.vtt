group is functioning correctly and

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.650 
group is functioning correctly and
always<00:01:52.429> remember<00:01:52.880> you<00:01:53.119> want<00:01:53.300> to<00:01:53.420> wear<00:01:53.509> your

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
always remember you want to wear your

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.480 
always remember you want to wear your
beacon<00:01:54.050> directly<00:01:54.649> under<00:01:54.950> your<00:01:55.069> outermost

beacon directly under your outermost

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.210 
beacon directly under your outermost
layer<00:01:56.030> so<00:01:56.840> if<00:01:56.899> this<00:01:57.080> is<00:01:57.259> my<00:01:57.380> outer<00:01:57.560> layer<00:01:57.860> I'm
