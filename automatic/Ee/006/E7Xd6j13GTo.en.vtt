00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
around the door and that's what I've

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.450 
around the door and that's what I've
done<00:00:45.750> now<00:00:46.050> before<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.559> even<00:00:46.739> started<00:00:47.250> welding

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
done now before I even started welding

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.900 
done now before I even started welding
there's<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.850> few<00:00:48.030> things<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.600> did<00:00:48.870> as

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
there's a few things that I did as

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.869 
there's a few things that I did as
precaution<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.149> just<00:00:51.750> basic<00:00:52.170> prep<00:00:52.489> first<00:00:53.489> my

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
precaution and just basic prep first my

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.029 
precaution and just basic prep first my
gas<00:00:54.090> tank<00:00:54.120> has<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> bent<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.590> covered

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
gas tank has a bent on it so I covered

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.229 
gas tank has a bent on it so I covered
the<00:00:56.100> gas<00:00:56.280> tank<00:00:56.579> with<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> piece<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:56.969> rubber

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the gas tank with a piece of rubber

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.470 
the gas tank with a piece of rubber
because<00:00:57.649> it<00:00:58.649> only<00:00:58.800> takes<00:00:59.129> one<00:00:59.250> spark<00:00:59.670> it's<00:01:00.270> not

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
because it only takes one spark it's not

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.689 
because it only takes one spark it's not
even<00:01:00.719> worth<00:01:00.899> skipping<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.469> step<00:01:01.530> next<00:01:02.460> I

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
even worth skipping that step next I

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.100 
even worth skipping that step next I
grind<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.030> off<00:01:03.149> all<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.390> paint<00:01:03.750> around<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
grind it off all the paint around the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.260 
grind it off all the paint around the
perimeter<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> door<00:01:04.830> now<00:01:05.729> give<00:01:05.970> me<00:01:06.090> good

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
perimeter of the door now give me good

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.740 
perimeter of the door now give me good

contact and better wells now what I used

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.750 
contact and better wells now what I used

there's a lot of different types of
welders<00:01:38.130> out<00:01:38.370> there<00:01:38.580> that's<00:01:39.120> just<00:01:39.360> what<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.570> use

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
welders out there that's just what I use

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.060

and what I'm comfortable with

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.680 
and what I'm comfortable with
okay<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:41.580> it<00:01:41.820> took<00:01:42.000> me<00:01:42.150> several<00:01:42.360> years<00:01:42.480> to

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
okay so it took me several years to

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.450 
okay so it took me several years to
figure<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.110> one<00:01:43.170> out<00:01:43.350> but<00:01:43.590> get<00:01:44.070> yourself

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
figure this one out but get yourself

and<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.540> welding<00:01:48.900> helmet<00:01:49.260> so<00:01:49.830> what<00:01:49.980> I<00:01:50.010> use<00:01:50.280> is

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
and a welding helmet so what I use is

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.120 
and a welding helmet so what I use is
filler<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.030> weld<00:01:51.240> up<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.510> doors<00:01:51.750> with<00:01:52.130> 5/16

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.160 
filler to weld up the doors with 5/16
rod<00:01:53.400> there's<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.850> lot<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.210> different<00:01:54.630> things

you can use this filler you can use a

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.900 
you can use this filler you can use a
quarter<00:01:57.360> inch<00:01:57.570> rod<00:01:57.840> rebar<00:01:58.500> on<00:01:59.040> one<00:01:59.400> portion<00:01:59.640> of

quarter inch rod rebar on one portion of
the<00:02:00.000> door<00:02:00.150> I<00:02:00.180> actually<00:02:00.570> used<00:02:01.110> crank<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.950> came

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
the door I actually used crank that came

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.400 
the door I actually used crank that came
stock<00:02:02.430> with<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.760> car<00:02:02.970> for<00:02:03.150> the<00:02:03.300> tire<00:02:03.510> Jim<00:02:03.840> yeah

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
stock with the car for the tire Jim yeah

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.969 
stock with the car for the tire Jim yeah
it<00:02:04.800> happened<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.190> be<00:02:05.250> 5/16<00:02:06.150> as<00:02:06.270> well<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:07.020> once

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
it happened to be 5/16 as well and once

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.560 
it happened to be 5/16 as well and once
I<00:02:08.130> straightened<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.700> out<00:02:08.790> it<00:02:09.060> was<00:02:09.270> probably

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
I straightened it out it was probably

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.020 
I straightened it out it was probably
about<00:02:10.080> two<00:02:10.350> and<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.560> half<00:02:10.619> feet<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.670> ran<00:02:12.000> the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
about two and a half feet so I ran the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.940 
about two and a half feet so I ran the
rod<00:02:12.330> around<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.810> perimeter<00:02:13.320> welding<00:02:13.709> it<00:02:13.800> all

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
rod around the perimeter welding it all

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.220 
rod around the perimeter welding it all
up<00:02:14.160> some<00:02:15.000> places<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:15.540> didn't<00:02:15.780> use<00:02:15.930> rod<00:02:16.200> a

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
up some places I didn't use rod a

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.620 
up some places I didn't use rod a
tallish<00:02:16.739> if<00:02:17.430> there's<00:02:17.640> like<00:02:17.820> a<00:02:17.850> sixteenth<00:02:18.450> or

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
tallish if there's like a sixteenth or

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.199 
tallish if there's like a sixteenth or
an<00:02:18.900> eighth<00:02:19.050> inch<00:02:19.080> of<00:02:19.440> gap<00:02:19.709> I<00:02:19.920> just<00:02:20.190> just<00:02:20.880> welded

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
an eighth inch of gap I just just welded

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.280 
an eighth inch of gap I just just welded
up<00:02:21.390> without<00:02:21.630> filler

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
up without filler

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.979

now on your window frames in my opinion
is<00:02:25.140> not<00:02:25.620> necessary<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.760> waste<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.989> wire<00:02:28.230> and

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
is not necessary to waste the wire and

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.380 
is not necessary to waste the wire and
weld<00:02:28.860> all<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.250> way<00:02:29.459> around<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.880> window<00:02:30.150> frame

weld all the way around the window frame

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.870 
weld all the way around the window frame
I<00:02:30.739> don't<00:02:31.739> believe<00:02:32.010> you're<00:02:32.220> going<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.370> gain<00:02:32.610> any

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
I don't believe you're going to gain any

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.630 
I don't believe you're going to gain any
structural<00:02:33.390> integrity<00:02:33.870> from<00:02:34.080> this<00:02:34.260> in<00:02:34.920> fact<00:02:35.489> a

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
structural integrity from this in fact a

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.250 
structural integrity from this in fact a
lot<00:02:35.820> of<00:02:35.850> people<00:02:36.180> just<00:02:36.209> run<00:02:36.600> duct<00:02:36.900> tape<00:02:37.110> around

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
lot of people just run duct tape around

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.250 
lot of people just run duct tape around
there<00:02:37.709> I<00:02:37.890> am<00:02:38.250> gonna<00:02:38.459> weld<00:02:38.790> it<00:02:39.000> but<00:02:39.299> but<00:02:39.780> not<00:02:40.049> all

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
there I am gonna weld it but but not all

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.810 
there I am gonna weld it but but not all
the<00:02:40.380> way<00:02:40.530> around<00:02:40.830> I'm<00:02:41.250> actually<00:02:41.459> going<00:02:41.760> to

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
the way around I'm actually going to

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.870 
the way around I'm actually going to
take<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.090> quarter<00:02:42.630> inch<00:02:42.840> plate<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:44.610> put<00:02:44.790> it

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
take a quarter inch plate and put it

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.020 
take a quarter inch plate and put it
right<00:02:44.910> here<00:02:45.060> at<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.390> top<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:47.160> well<00:02:47.670> around

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
right here at the top and well around

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.650 
right here at the top and well around
that<00:02:48.239> and<00:02:48.870> I'm<00:02:48.989> going<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.200> put<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.410> low<00:02:49.620> here<00:02:50.660> and

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
that and I'm going to put a low here and

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.800 
that and I'm going to put a low here and
weld<00:02:51.959> here<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:53.130> that's<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.580> that's<00:02:54.390> all<00:02:54.630> that

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
weld here and that's it that's all that

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.990 
weld here and that's it that's all that
I<00:02:54.870> believe<00:02:55.200> it's<00:02:55.380> necessary<00:02:56.070> some<00:02:56.730> people

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
I believe it's necessary some people

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.150 
I believe it's necessary some people
bake<00:02:57.209> different<00:02:57.750> but<00:02:58.200> really<00:02:58.500> that's<00:02:58.950> all<00:02:59.100> I

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
bake different but really that's all I

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.600 
bake different but really that's all I
do

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
do

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.039 
do
I've<00:02:59.760> even<00:02:59.940> taped<00:03:00.330> them<00:03:00.480> up<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:00.720> couple<00:03:00.900> of

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
I've even taped them up a couple of

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.350 
I've even taped them up a couple of
times<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:01.560> works<00:03:01.799> too<00:03:02.070> after<00:03:02.820> I<00:03:03.030> got<00:03:03.209> it

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
times and that works too after I got it

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.900 
times and that works too after I got it
all<00:03:03.480> welded<00:03:03.810> up<00:03:04.080> since<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.590> am<00:03:04.680> using<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.220> flux

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
all welded up since I am using the flux

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.820 
all welded up since I am using the flux
core<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.420> it's<00:03:06.570> really<00:03:06.750> messy<00:03:07.140> I<00:03:07.170> took<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.560> wire

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
core and it's really messy I took a wire

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.620 
core and it's really messy I took a wire
brush<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.549> whole<00:03:08.730> thing<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.269> got<00:03:09.390> all<00:03:09.600> of

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
brush to the whole thing and got all of

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.380 
brush to the whole thing and got all of
that<00:03:09.780> soot<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.410> slag<00:03:10.739> off<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:12.000> cleaned<00:03:12.269> up

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
that soot and slag off and I cleaned up

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.280 
that soot and slag off and I cleaned up
pretty<00:03:12.570> nicely

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
pretty nicely

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.460 
pretty nicely
it<00:03:13.440> was<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.650> little<00:03:13.920> bit<00:03:14.040> of<00:03:14.130> actual<00:03:14.400> work<00:03:14.549> but

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
it was a little bit of actual work but

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.410 
it was a little bit of actual work but
works<00:03:16.470> for<00:03:16.739> me<00:03:16.890> on<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.280> gas<00:03:17.489> door<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:17.940> added

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
works for me on the gas door I added

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.789 
works for me on the gas door I added
three<00:03:18.690> little<00:03:18.959> welds

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
three little welds

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.770 
three little welds
just<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.489> hold<00:03:20.700> it<00:03:20.850> in<00:03:20.970> place<00:03:21.120> so<00:03:21.540> it's<00:03:21.720> not

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
just to hold it in place so it's not

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:22.699 
just to hold it in place so it's not
flapping<00:03:22.080> around

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
flapping around

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:23.990 
flapping around
you're<00:03:22.950> not<00:03:23.099> going<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.310> gain<00:03:23.489> anything<00:03:23.790> by

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
you're not going to gain anything by

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.149 
you're not going to gain anything by
welding<00:03:24.540> all<00:03:24.659> the<00:03:24.750> way<00:03:24.870> around<00:03:25.140> that<00:03:25.349> just<00:03:25.890> get

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
welding all the way around that just get

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.369 
welding all the way around that just get
it<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.400> where<00:03:26.580> it<00:03:26.879> doesn't<00:03:26.909> go<00:03:27.269> anywhere<00:03:27.480> you

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
it to where it doesn't go anywhere you

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.410 
it to where it doesn't go anywhere you
can<00:03:28.500> even<00:03:28.739> take<00:03:28.890> it<00:03:28.920> off<00:03:29.129> if<00:03:29.370> you<00:03:29.459> want<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:29.819> but

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
can even take it off if you want to but

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.910 
can even take it off if you want to but
that's<00:03:30.540> pretty<00:03:30.810> much<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.200> for<00:03:31.230> welding<00:03:31.620> up<00:03:31.769> the

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
that's pretty much it for welding up the

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.190 
that's pretty much it for welding up the
doors<00:03:32.159> what<00:03:32.940> I<00:03:32.970> do<00:03:33.090> next<00:03:33.510> step<00:03:33.690> so<00:03:33.900> it<00:03:34.019> really

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
doors what I do next step so it really

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.930 
doors what I do next step so it really
depends<00:03:34.680> on<00:03:34.739> if<00:03:34.890> I<00:03:35.010> get<00:03:35.159> my<00:03:35.310> torch<00:03:35.549> is<00:03:35.610> back

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
depends on if I get my torch is back

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.750 
depends on if I get my torch is back
from<00:03:36.150> Larry<00:03:36.390> or<00:03:36.569> not<00:03:37.069> one<00:03:38.069> option<00:03:38.459> I<00:03:38.549> have<00:03:38.730> is

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
from Larry or not one option I have is

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.520 
from Larry or not one option I have is
I'm<00:03:39.209> going<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.450> I'm<00:03:39.870> going<00:03:40.019> to<00:03:40.079> cut<00:03:40.290> out<00:03:40.409> the

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
I'm going to I'm going to cut out the

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.949 
I'm going to I'm going to cut out the
back<00:03:40.739> portion<00:03:41.040> behind<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.519> tire<00:03:41.959> for

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
back portion behind the tire for

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.319 
back portion behind the tire for
clearance<00:03:43.409> and<00:03:43.590> in<00:03:43.799> the<00:03:43.860> front<00:03:44.190> or<00:03:44.640> I<00:03:44.700> might<00:03:45.180> be

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
clearance and in the front or I might be

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.509 
clearance and in the front or I might be
doing<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.690> exhaust<00:03:45.989> system<00:03:46.349> I'm<00:03:46.799> showing<00:03:47.400> you

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
doing the exhaust system I'm showing you

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.780 
doing the exhaust system I'm showing you
how<00:03:47.640> to<00:03:47.670> cut<00:03:48.030> that<00:03:48.239> where<00:03:48.599> to<00:03:48.750> cut<00:03:48.989> it<00:03:49.110> and

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
how to cut that where to cut it and

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.580 
how to cut that where to cut it and
possibly<00:03:50.790> even<00:03:50.940> put<00:03:51.360> it<00:03:51.420> on<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.659> headers<00:03:51.989> so

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
possibly even put it on the headers so

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.960 
possibly even put it on the headers so
for<00:03:52.769> those<00:03:52.890> of<00:03:52.950> you<00:03:53.099> that<00:03:53.400> already<00:03:53.549> know<00:03:53.819> what

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
for those of you that already know what

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.610 
for those of you that already know what
you're<00:03:54.150> doing<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:54.599> are<00:03:54.989> watching<00:03:55.319> this<00:03:55.440> video

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
you're doing and are watching this video

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.710 
you're doing and are watching this video
if<00:03:56.190> you<00:03:56.430> disagree<00:03:56.879> with<00:03:56.970> anything<00:03:57.239> that<00:03:57.599> I'm

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
if you disagree with anything that I'm

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.890 
if you disagree with anything that I'm
doing<00:03:57.750> or<00:03:58.349> if<00:03:58.680> you<00:03:58.769> have<00:03:58.890> ideas<00:03:59.370> for

doing or if you have ideas for

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.839 
doing or if you have ideas for
improvement<00:04:00.900> or<00:04:01.250> just<00:04:02.250> a<00:04:02.370> different<00:04:02.670> way<00:04:02.819> of

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
improvement or just a different way of

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.030 
improvement or just a different way of
doing<00:04:03.150> something<00:04:03.540> let<00:04:04.140> me<00:04:04.170> know<00:04:04.260> about<00:04:04.560> it<00:04:04.709> and

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
doing something let me know about it and

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.009 
doing something let me know about it and
I'll<00:04:05.549> discuss<00:04:06.150> it<00:04:06.299> on<00:04:06.390> a<00:04:06.450> different<00:04:06.930> episode

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
I'll discuss it on a different episode

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.680 
I'll discuss it on a different episode
and<00:04:07.590> for<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.040> rookies<00:04:08.400> really<00:04:08.760> if<00:04:09.269> you<00:04:09.480> don't

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
and for the rookies really if you don't

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.319 
and for the rookies really if you don't
know<00:04:09.780> how<00:04:09.959> to<00:04:10.019> well<00:04:10.760> find<00:04:11.760> something<00:04:11.849> too<00:04:12.180> well

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
know how to well find something too well

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.159 
know how to well find something too well
before<00:04:12.720> you<00:04:12.840> really<00:04:13.590> is<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:13.859> way<00:04:14.010> to<00:04:14.069> go<00:04:14.310> and

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.169 
before you really is the way to go and

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:17.930 
before you really is the way to go and
let<00:04:16.169> me<00:04:16.199> know<00:04:16.350> what<00:04:16.500> you'd<00:04:16.650> like<00:04:16.680> to<00:04:16.919> see<00:04:17.160> if

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
let me know what you'd like to see if

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.159 
let me know what you'd like to see if
there's<00:04:18.239> something<00:04:18.449> that<00:04:18.720> I'm<00:04:18.780> not<00:04:18.810> covering

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
there's something that I'm not covering

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.959 
there's something that I'm not covering
so<00:04:19.889> I<00:04:19.919> guess<00:04:20.160> that's<00:04:20.430> it<00:04:20.609> so<00:04:21.000> until<00:04:21.510> next<00:04:21.690> time
