adding pieces to you know already good
team<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:33.200> think<00:02:34.200> that's<00:02:34.350> what<00:02:34.500> this<00:02:34.590> draft

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
team and I think that's what this draft

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.670 
team and I think that's what this draft
is<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.340> don't<00:02:35.550> think<00:02:35.580> it's<00:02:35.820> terrible<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.720> gave

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
is I don't think it's terrible I gave

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.850 
is I don't think it's terrible I gave
one<00:02:37.800> last<00:02:37.830> year's<00:02:38.220> draft<00:02:38.459> think<00:02:39.420> what<00:02:39.600> like<00:02:40.410> 14

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
one last year's draft think what like 14

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.310 
one last year's draft think what like 14
out<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.160> 30<00:02:41.400> first-round<00:02:41.970> picks<00:02:42.239> were<00:02:42.450> in

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
out of the 30 first-round picks were in

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.720 
out of the 30 first-round picks were in
the<00:02:43.440> d-league<00:02:43.590> or<00:02:43.920> something<00:02:44.190> like<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.310> so

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
the d-league or something like that so

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.970 
the d-league or something like that so
if<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.120> look<00:02:45.239> at<00:02:45.390> that<00:02:45.600> so<00:02:46.560> most<00:02:46.769> people

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
if you look at that so most people

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.259 
if you look at that so most people
that's<00:02:47.160> been<00:02:47.370> in<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.519> d-league<00:02:47.700> or<00:02:48.000> whatever

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
that's been in the d-league or whatever

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.740 
that's been in the d-league or whatever
so<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.540> don't<00:02:48.840> really<00:02:49.080> start<00:02:49.830> really<00:02:49.980> fair<00:02:50.250> to

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
so I don't really start really fair to

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.539 
so I don't really start really fair to
to<00:02:51.750> say<00:02:51.959> it's<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.530> terrible<00:02:53.010> draft<00:02:53.280> class<00:02:53.519> that

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
to say it's a terrible draft class that

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.940 
to say it's a terrible draft class that
we<00:02:53.790> haven't<00:02:53.970> even<00:02:54.060> played<00:02:54.299> yet<00:02:54.360> so<00:02:55.019> what<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.709> few

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
we haven't even played yet so what a few

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.080 
we haven't even played yet so what a few
years<00:02:56.220> after<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.579> guys<00:02:56.700> have<00:02:56.910> been<00:02:57.030> playing

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090

years after you guys have been playing
exactly<00:02:57.959> i<00:02:57.989> think<00:02:58.350> i<00:02:58.470> start<00:02:58.799> i<00:02:59.010> think<00:02:59.280> if<00:02:59.430> after

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
exactly i think i start i think if after

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.550 
exactly i think i start i think if after
a<00:03:00.209> couple<00:03:00.450> years<00:03:00.570> if<00:03:00.870> we<00:03:00.900> are<00:03:01.110> producing

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
a couple years if we are producing

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.770 
a couple years if we are producing
that's<00:03:02.340> fair<00:03:02.489> to<00:03:02.549> say<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:02.730> who<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.390> guys<00:03:03.540> who

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
that's fair to say that who the guys who

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.750 
that's fair to say that who the guys who
will<00:03:04.019> be<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.380> ones<00:03:04.530> disproving<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.340> you

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
it's fair to him either a lot of people

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.290 
it's fair to him either a lot of people
saying<00:04:11.280> he's<00:04:11.430> not<00:04:11.520> gonna<00:04:11.640> be<00:04:11.790> a<00:04:11.820> great<00:04:12.000> pair<00:04:12.180> in

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
saying he's not gonna be a great pair in

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.510 
saying he's not gonna be a great pair in
the<00:04:12.360> NBA<00:04:12.600> but<00:04:12.860> you<00:04:13.860> know<00:04:13.980> you<00:04:14.130> never<00:04:14.160> know<00:04:14.370> to

the NBA but you know you never know to

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.800 
the NBA but you know you never know to
the<00:04:14.700> game<00:04:14.880> start<00:04:15.180> i<00:04:15.390> have<00:04:15.570> a<00:04:15.630> lot<00:04:15.750> of

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
the game start i have a lot of

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.440 
the game start i have a lot of
confidence<00:04:16.140> in<00:04:16.320> him<00:04:16.470> and<00:04:16.590> he<00:04:16.650> was<00:04:20.030> it<00:04:21.030> was<00:04:21.299> like

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
confidence in him and he was it was like

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.070 
confidence in him and he was it was like
me<00:04:22.320> Jordan<00:04:22.950> Darius<00:04:23.720> I'm<00:04:24.720> from<00:04:24.960> Michigan

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
me Jordan Darius I'm from Michigan

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.190 
me Jordan Darius I'm from Michigan
jeremy<00:04:25.740> Tyler<00:04:26.160> a<00:04:26.420> whole<00:04:27.420> team<00:04:27.660> I<00:04:27.810> was<00:04:27.900> on<00:04:28.020> with

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
jeremy Tyler a whole team I was on with

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.430 
jeremy Tyler a whole team I was on with
it<00:04:28.290> was<00:04:28.380> pretty<00:04:28.590> stacked<00:04:28.890> and<00:04:29.600> I<00:04:30.600> think<00:04:31.260> that's

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
it was pretty stacked and I think that's

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.690 
it was pretty stacked and I think that's
probably<00:04:31.590> a<00:04:31.740> little<00:04:31.890> bit<00:04:32.070> why<00:04:32.220> I<00:04:32.250> wasn't

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
probably a little bit why I wasn't

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.090 
probably a little bit why I wasn't
getting<00:04:33.210> noticed<00:04:33.690> too<00:04:33.840> much<00:04:34.020> but<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.920> same

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
getting noticed too much but the same

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.400 
getting noticed too much but the same
time<00:04:35.630> you<00:04:36.630> have<00:04:36.660> to<00:04:36.780> give<00:04:37.020> up<00:04:37.140> you<00:04:37.260> have<00:04:37.350> to

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
time you have to give up you have to

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.290 
time you have to give up you have to
give<00:04:37.620> in<00:04:37.740> sometimes<00:04:37.919> notes<00:04:38.610> to<00:04:38.910> win<00:04:39.090> and

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
give in sometimes notes to win and

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.700 
give in sometimes notes to win and
succeed<00:04:39.660> and<00:04:39.870> I<00:04:39.990> think<00:04:40.230> that<00:04:40.380> that's<00:04:40.410> what<00:04:40.680> I

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
succeed and I think that that's what I

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.970 
succeed and I think that that's what I
did<00:04:40.980> and<00:04:41.190> did<00:04:41.730> the<00:04:41.850> little<00:04:42.000> things<00:04:42.330> and<00:04:42.660> I

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
did and did the little things and I

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.170 
did and did the little things and I
think<00:04:43.980> that's<00:04:44.100> what<00:04:44.250> made<00:04:44.400> me<00:04:44.430> maybe<00:04:44.850> who<00:04:45.000> I<00:04:45.030> am

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
think that's what made me maybe who I am

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.680 
think that's what made me maybe who I am
today
