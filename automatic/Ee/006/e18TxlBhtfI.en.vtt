00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
the tie rod ends first I already have

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.640 
the tie rod ends first I already have
the<00:00:09.000> tire<00:00:09.179> off<00:00:09.450> and<00:00:09.860> I've<00:00:11.509> got<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.809> some

the tire off and I've got the some

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.000 
the tire off and I've got the some
penetrating<00:00:14.190> oil<00:00:14.429> on<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:15.299> threads<00:00:15.780> so<00:00:16.049> before

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
penetrating oil on the threads so before

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.790 
penetrating oil on the threads so before
I<00:00:17.039> take<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:17.490> off<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.970> them<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.650> loosen<00:00:19.650> this

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
I take this off of them to loosen this

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:28.670 
I take this off of them to loosen this
up<00:00:23.449> and<00:00:24.449> just<00:00:25.609> half<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.730> turn<00:00:27.380> that<00:00:28.380> was<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
up and just half a turn that was the

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.680 
up and just half a turn that was the
seven<00:00:29.039> eighths<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:30.449> top<00:00:30.689> bolt<00:00:31.050> is

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690 
seven eighths and the top bolt is

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:53.819 
seven eighths and the top bolt is
fifteen<00:00:33.690> millimeter

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.069 

and<00:00:55.030> since<00:00:56.030> these<00:00:56.210> are<00:00:56.269> old<00:00:56.570> and<00:00:56.780> I'm<00:00:56.870> not

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
and since these are old and I'm not

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.349 
and since these are old and I'm not
reusing<00:00:57.949> I<00:00:57.980> don't<00:00:58.399> care<00:00:58.579> about<00:00:58.670> mashing<00:00:59.269> up

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
reusing I don't care about mashing up

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:12.580 
reusing I don't care about mashing up
the<00:00:59.479> threads<00:01:10.090> then<00:01:11.090> just<00:01:11.899> four<00:01:12.170> so<00:01:12.470> you're

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
the threads then just four so you're

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.100 
the threads then just four so you're
close<00:01:12.799> to<00:01:12.860> alignment<00:01:13.580> this<00:01:14.299> should<00:01:14.539> move<00:01:14.750> but

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
close to alignment this should move but

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.889 
close to alignment this should move but
usually<00:01:15.649> just<00:01:16.060> count<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.210> number<00:01:17.240> of<00:01:17.630> turns

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
usually just count the number of turns

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:33.500 
usually just count the number of turns
you<00:01:18.399> take<00:01:19.399> this<00:01:19.549> off

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.810 

twelve<00:01:34.510> and<00:01:34.630> a<00:01:34.750> half<00:01:34.930> turns<00:01:35.260> and<00:01:35.650> these<00:01:36.640> are

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
twelve and a half turns and these are

00:01:36.820 --> 00:02:25.380 
twelve and a half turns and these are
site-specific<00:01:37.440> right<00:01:38.440> hand<00:01:38.680> left<00:01:38.890> hand

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:53.960 

the<00:02:26.390> new<00:02:26.569> nut<00:02:26.810> came<00:02:27.560> with<00:02:27.739> is<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:27.950> 17<00:02:28.550> millimeter

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.270 

probably<00:02:54.720> should<00:02:54.840> use<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.170> default<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:56.160> then

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
probably should use the default and then

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.670 
probably should use the default and then
just<00:02:58.730> lock<00:02:59.730> the<00:03:00.000> other<00:03:00.090> nut<00:03:00.390> back<00:03:01.020> up<00:03:01.230> against

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
just lock the other nut back up against

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.020 
just lock the other nut back up against
there<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:04.010> go<00:03:05.010> somewhere<00:03:05.520> and<00:03:05.610> get<00:03:05.910> an

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
there and go somewhere and get an

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:13.030 
there and go somewhere and get an
alignment<00:03:08.300> basically<00:03:09.300> all<00:03:09.450> there<00:03:09.690> is<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:10.170> it

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.880 

alright<00:03:14.040> so<00:03:14.400> video<00:03:14.760> um<00:03:15.140> this<00:03:16.140> is<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.500> old<00:03:16.650> one

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
alright so video um this is the old one

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.510 
alright so video um this is the old one
and<00:03:18.140> should<00:03:19.140> not<00:03:19.380> be<00:03:19.440> this<00:03:19.860> easy<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.280> move

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
and should not be this easy to move

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.250 
and should not be this easy to move
around<00:03:20.670> you<00:03:21.060> should<00:03:21.240> have<00:03:21.420> quite<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:21.870> bit<00:03:22.140> of

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
around you should have quite a bit of

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.890 
around you should have quite a bit of
effort<00:03:24.980> this<00:03:25.980> wasn't<00:03:26.280> bad<00:03:27.209> enough<00:03:27.270> for<00:03:27.660> the

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
effort this wasn't bad enough for the

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.220 
effort this wasn't bad enough for the
wheel<00:03:28.140> to<00:03:28.170> be<00:03:28.800> able<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.490> wobble<00:03:29.990> like<00:03:30.990> the

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
wheel to be able to wobble like the

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.000 
wheel to be able to wobble like the
driver's-side<00:03:31.680> did<00:03:32.120> I<00:03:33.590> replaced<00:03:34.590> this<00:03:34.800> one

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
driver's-side did I replaced this one

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.040 
driver's-side did I replaced this one
just<00:03:35.280> because<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.970> driver's<00:03:36.330> side<00:03:36.480> was<00:03:36.780> that

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
just because the driver's side was that

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.930 
just because the driver's side was that
bad<00:03:37.290> didn't<00:03:37.830> know<00:03:37.920> this<00:03:38.070> one<00:03:38.280> was<00:03:38.430> this<00:03:38.670> bad

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
bad didn't know this one was this bad

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.420 
bad didn't know this one was this bad
but<00:03:41.240> no<00:03:42.240> good
