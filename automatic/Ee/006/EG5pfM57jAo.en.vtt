corner

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.460

it's<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.890> very<00:00:38.190> very<00:00:38.430> slow<00:00:38.700> hairpin<00:00:39.150> and<00:00:39.720> then

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
it's a very very slow hairpin and then

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.960 
it's a very very slow hairpin and then
immediately<00:00:41.010> we're<00:00:41.160> shifting<00:00:41.520> up<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.790> gear

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
immediately we're shifting up the gear

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.870

rejoin the circuit into a double
sequence<00:01:07.780> of<00:01:07.870> corners<00:01:08.170> which<00:01:08.290> is<00:01:08.410> a<00:01:08.440> bit

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
sequence of corners which is a bit

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.179 
sequence of corners which is a bit
faster

into an extremely difficult left-hand
corner<00:01:27.600> combination<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.320> fast<00:01:28.530> entry<00:01:29.070> and

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
corner combination of fast entry and

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.539 
corner combination of fast entry and

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
very very slow apex speed very easy to

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.710 
very very slow apex speed very easy to
have<00:01:32.670> more<00:01:32.850> spin<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.299> exit<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.630> that

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
have more spin on the exit of that

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.930 
have more spin on the exit of that
corner<00:01:34.250> then<00:01:35.250> we<00:01:35.369> head<00:01:35.490> along<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.790> back

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
corner then we head along the back

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.910 
corner then we head along the back
straight<00:01:36.210> towards<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.930> corner<00:01:37.259> which<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.649> quite

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
straight towards a corner which I quite

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.399 
straight towards a corner which I quite
enjoy<00:01:38.280> it's<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.610> third<00:01:39.030> gear<00:01:39.299> medium<00:01:40.110> speed

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
enjoy it's a third gear medium speed

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.080 
enjoy it's a third gear medium speed
left<00:01:40.860> hand<00:01:41.100> down<00:01:41.220> which<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.490> opening<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.000> the

exit

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.680 

there<00:01:45.340> we<00:01:45.460> go<00:01:45.580> through<00:01:45.790> a<00:01:45.820> very<00:01:45.970> fast<00:01:46.330> part<00:01:46.600> of

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
there we go through a very fast part of

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.270 
there we go through a very fast part of
the<00:01:46.750> track<00:01:46.960> really<00:01:47.350> exposed<00:01:47.680> you<00:01:47.860> can<00:01:47.920> see<00:01:48.160> the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
the track really exposed you can see the

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.760 
the track really exposed you can see the
desert<00:01:48.460> in<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.760> background

into the penultimate corner very

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.030 
into the penultimate corner very
important<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.170> get<00:01:55.260> a<00:01:55.290> good<00:01:55.500> exit<00:01:55.650> over<00:01:55.920> there

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
important to get a good exit over there

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.859 
important to get a good exit over there
as<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.430> have<00:01:56.549> another<00:01:56.790> long<00:01:57.030> straight<00:01:57.390> the

as you have another long straight the
wind<00:01:58.080> conditions<00:01:58.290> play<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.740> big<00:01:58.950> role<00:01:59.159> in

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
wind conditions play a big role in

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.830 
wind conditions play a big role in
borrowing<00:01:59.729> with<00:01:59.850> your<00:01:59.970> top<00:02:00.180> speeds<00:02:00.510> and<00:02:00.690> also

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
borrowing with your top speeds and also

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.560 
borrowing with your top speeds and also
your<00:02:01.080> cornering<00:02:01.470> performance<00:02:02.000> braking<00:02:03.000> for

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
the last corner slightly blind entry

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.990 
the last corner slightly blind entry
very<00:02:07.470> easy<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.920> run<00:02:08.039> out<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.250> Road<00:02:08.429> on<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.670> exit
