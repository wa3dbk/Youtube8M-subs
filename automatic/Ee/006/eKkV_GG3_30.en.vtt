bit because everyone's got it on ps3
they<00:00:13.860> were<00:00:13.920> really<00:00:14.250> enjoying<00:00:14.340> through<00:00:14.790> 14

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
they were really enjoying through 14

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.740 
they were really enjoying through 14
what<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.529> ps4<00:00:16.859> gonna<00:00:17.279> offer<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:17.789> is<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:18.090> little

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
what is ps4 gonna offer that is a little

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.570 
what is ps4 gonna offer that is a little
bit<00:00:18.869> more<00:00:19.020> special<00:00:19.320> yeah<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.859> mean<00:00:20.010> before<00:00:20.340> we

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
bit more special yeah I mean before we

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.890 
bit more special yeah I mean before we
do<00:00:20.730> that<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:20.910> just<00:00:21.029> think<00:00:21.359> it's<00:00:21.449> important<00:00:21.869> to

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
do that I just think it's important to

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.330 
do that I just think it's important to
point<00:00:22.109> out<00:00:22.350> because<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.830> different

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
point out because this is different

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.890 
point out because this is different
potentially<00:00:24.000> other<00:00:24.119> track<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.600> than<00:00:24.750> other

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
potentially other track that than other

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.080 
potentially other track that than other
transitions<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.740> all<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.460> great<00:00:26.670> cool

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
transitions is all the great cool

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.700 
transitions is all the great cool
features<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:27.599> all<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.199> major<00:00:28.439> features

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
features that all the major features

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.609 
features that all the major features
that<00:00:29.010> are<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.160> PlayStation<00:00:29.730> 3<00:00:29.970> are<00:00:30.090> also<00:00:30.240> on

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
that are on PlayStation 3 are also on

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.959 
that are on PlayStation 3 are also on
PlayStation<00:00:31.619> 4<00:00:31.890> we<00:00:32.099> haven't<00:00:32.340> haven't<00:00:32.790> always

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
PlayStation 4 we haven't haven't always

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.120 
PlayStation 4 we haven't haven't always
seen<00:00:33.059> fully<00:00:33.540> featured<00:00:33.780> games<00:00:34.140> in<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:35.100> know

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
seen fully featured games in it you know

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.830 
seen fully featured games in it you know
in<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.399> first<00:00:35.610> year<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.030> new<00:00:36.149> transition<00:00:36.630> so

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
in the first year in a new transition so

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.630 
in the first year in a new transition so
really<00:00:37.500> important<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.890> make<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.160> point<00:00:38.399> and

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
really important to make that point and

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.880 
really important to make that point and
then<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.450> top<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.930> we<00:00:40.200> really<00:00:40.559> wanted<00:00:40.829> to

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
then on top of that we really wanted to

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.310 
then on top of that we really wanted to
innovate<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.120> number<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.540> key<00:00:42.719> areas<00:00:42.989> aspect

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
innovate in a number of key areas aspect

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.139 
innovate in a number of key areas aspect
especially<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.860> gameplay<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.820> we<00:00:44.879> wanted<00:00:45.090> to

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
especially in gameplay and we wanted to

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.180 
especially in gameplay and we wanted to
really<00:00:45.450> try<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.719> rework<00:00:46.230> how<00:00:46.500> presentation

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
really try and rework how presentation

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.860 
really try and rework how presentation
work<00:00:47.340> with<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.579> fifa's<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.390> give<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.690> the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
work with in fifa's to give you the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.049 
work with in fifa's to give you the
feeling<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:50.129> know<00:00:50.160> playing<00:00:50.700> something

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
feeling of you know playing something

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.400 
feeling of you know playing something
that<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.480> something<00:00:52.050> like<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.260> never

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
that you something like you never

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.560 
that you something like you never
experienced<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:52.949> FIFA<00:00:53.250> before<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:53.879> what<00:00:54.449> we're

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
experienced in FIFA before so what we're

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.270 
experienced in FIFA before so what we're
doing<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.899> we're<00:00:55.079> using<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.410> eSports<00:00:56.010> ignite

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
doing is we're using the eSports ignite

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.619 
doing is we're using the eSports ignite
engine<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.730> do<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.239> we're<00:00:57.329> innovating

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
engine to do that and we're innovating

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.720 
engine to do that and we're innovating
in<00:00:57.960> three<00:00:58.170> key<00:00:58.379> areas<00:00:58.530> we<00:00:59.190> call<00:00:59.370> human

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
in three key areas we call human

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.490 
in three key areas we call human
intelligence<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.359> true<00:01:00.539> player<00:01:00.750> motion<00:01:00.840> and

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
intelligence a true player motion and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.860 
intelligence a true player motion and
the<00:01:02.010> living<00:01:02.309> world<00:01:02.489> human<00:01:03.180> intelligence<00:01:03.480> is

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
the living world human intelligence is

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.350 
the living world human intelligence is
really<00:01:04.170> about<00:01:04.409> allowing<00:01:05.189> using<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.970> power<00:01:06.240> of

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
really about allowing using the power of

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.960 
really about allowing using the power of
the<00:01:06.450> PlayStation<00:01:07.020> 4<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.950> use<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> extra

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
the PlayStation 4 to use the extra

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.760 
the PlayStation 4 to use the extra
horsepower<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.630> do<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> lot<00:01:09.990> more<00:01:10.049> calculation

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
horsepower to do a lot more calculation

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.200 
horsepower to do a lot more calculation
about<00:01:10.920> four<00:01:11.159> times<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.520> calculations<00:01:12.090> you've

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
about four times the calculations you've

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.880 
about four times the calculations you've
previously<00:01:12.479> done<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:13.049> our<00:01:13.170> physics<00:01:13.500> system

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
previously done in our physics system

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.980 
previously done in our physics system
what<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.610> means<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.030> players<00:01:15.330> can<00:01:15.630> now<00:01:15.659> have

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
what that means is players can now have

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.249 
what that means is players can now have
have<00:01:16.920> real<00:01:17.479> anticipation<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.720> awareness<00:01:19.110> of

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
have real anticipation and awareness of

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.200 
have real anticipation and awareness of
what's<00:01:19.439> going<00:01:19.650> what's<00:01:20.400> going<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.759> around<00:01:20.970> them

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
what's going what's going on around them

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.300 
what's going what's going on around them
so<00:01:21.240> previously<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> viewer<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.619> run<00:01:22.799> into<00:01:23.040> me<00:01:23.189> in

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
so previously a viewer to run into me in

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.039 
so previously a viewer to run into me in
the<00:01:23.400> game<00:01:23.610> physics<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.390> take<00:01:24.570> over<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:24.960> would

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
the game physics to take over it would

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.660 
the game physics to take over it would
look<00:01:25.229> great<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.130> didn't<00:01:26.369> really<00:01:26.460> have<00:01:26.640> that

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
look great but I didn't really have that

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.969 
look great but I didn't really have that
anticipation<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.540> what<00:01:27.720> was<00:01:27.810> coming<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.740> now

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
anticipation of what was coming so now

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.499 
anticipation of what was coming so now
if<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.340> run<00:01:29.520> into<00:01:29.549> me<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.880> could<00:01:30.060> brace<00:01:30.270> for

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
if you run into me I could brace for

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.260 
if you run into me I could brace for
impact<00:01:30.710> if<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.829> try<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.130> tackle<00:01:32.310> me<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
impact if you try and tackle me in the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.179 
impact if you try and tackle me in the
game<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.780> will<00:01:34.290> actually<00:01:34.409> maybe<00:01:34.680> try<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.009> ride

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
game I will actually maybe try and ride

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.520 
game I will actually maybe try and ride
that<00:01:35.220> tackle<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.780> then<00:01:36.930> where<00:01:37.110> it's<00:01:37.259> really

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
that tackle and then where it's really

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.120 
that tackle and then where it's really
working<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.820> really<00:01:39.000> change<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.540> game<00:01:40.130> in

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
working it to really change the game in

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.249 
working it to really change the game in
a<00:01:41.490> big<00:01:41.520> way<00:01:41.880> as<00:01:42.090> those<00:01:42.270> physical<00:01:42.720> interactions

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
a big way as those physical interactions

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.139 
a big way as those physical interactions
between<00:01:43.320> two<00:01:43.710> players<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.250> as<00:01:44.520> we<00:01:44.850> as<00:01:45.060> you

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
between two players so as we as you

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.359 
between two players so as we as you
jostle<00:01:45.509> for<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.720> ball<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.560> also<00:01:46.740> means<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.220> i

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
jostle for the ball it also means that i

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.249 
jostle for the ball it also means that i
can<00:01:47.399> now<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.759> news<00:01:47.970> body<00:01:48.210> position<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.840> try<00:01:49.020> and

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
can now a news body position to try and

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.600 
can now a news body position to try and
win<00:01:49.290> back<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.770> ball<00:01:49.950> from<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.399> we're<00:01:50.520> not

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
win back the ball from you so we're not

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.370 
win back the ball from you so we're not
as<00:01:50.759> reliant<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.329> tackle<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.320> really

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
as reliant on tackle and it's really

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.889 
as reliant on tackle and it's really
changed<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.009> feeling<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.729> game<00:01:53.939> within

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
changed the feeling of the game within

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.990 
changed the feeling of the game within
the<00:01:55.110> true<00:01:55.320> player<00:01:55.530> motion<00:01:55.649> we've<00:01:56.219> got<00:01:56.460> we've

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
the true player motion we've got we've

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.090 
the true player motion we've got we've
completely<00:01:57.360> reworked<00:01:57.780> how<00:01:58.100> precision

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
completely reworked how precision

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.760 
completely reworked how precision
movement<00:01:59.250> works<00:01:59.640> so<00:02:00.110> you<00:02:01.110> know<00:02:01.229> players<00:02:01.500> now

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
movement works so you know players now

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.100 
movement works so you know players now
you<00:02:01.829> see<00:02:02.100> every<00:02:02.369> step<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.180> biomechanical

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
you see every step is that biomechanical

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.790 
you see every step is that biomechanical
movement

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
movement

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.820 
movement
one<00:02:04.920> as<00:02:05.180> players<00:02:06.180> transfer<00:02:06.750> weight<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.590> then

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
one as players transfer weight and then

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.109 
one as players transfer weight and then
we<00:02:07.890> have<00:02:08.010> what<00:02:08.130> we<00:02:08.160> call<00:02:08.370> a<00:02:08.400> leak<00:02:08.670> technique

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
we have what we call a leak technique

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.330 
we have what we call a leak technique
which<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.830> hundreds<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:10.890> hundreds<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.220> new

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
which is hundreds of hundreds of new

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.060 
which is hundreds of hundreds of new
animations<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.390> not<00:02:13.170> only<00:02:13.290> give<00:02:13.500> variety

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
animations that not only give variety

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.680 
animations that not only give variety
but<00:02:14.250> change<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.580> feeling<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.240> game<00:02:15.420> so

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
but change the feeling of the game so

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.120 
but change the feeling of the game so
previously<00:02:16.050> like<00:02:16.380> we'd<00:02:16.560> only<00:02:16.650> have<00:02:16.770> two<00:02:17.040> or

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
previously like we'd only have two or

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.850 
previously like we'd only have two or
three<00:02:17.190> tackle<00:02:17.580> animations<00:02:18.060> now<00:02:18.240> we<00:02:18.300> have

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
three tackle animations now we have

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.930 
three tackle animations now we have
Crossfield<00:02:19.860> Tapia<00:02:20.340> in<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.550> cross<00:02:20.730> bill

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
Crossfield Tapia in the cross bill

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.630 
Crossfield Tapia in the cross bill
passes<00:02:21.470> we<00:02:22.470> have<00:02:22.560> three<00:02:22.830> balls<00:02:23.040> we<00:02:23.280> have<00:02:23.370> chip

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
passes we have three balls we have chip

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.120 
passes we have three balls we have chip
lob<00:02:24.000> through<00:02:24.480> balls<00:02:24.720> we<00:02:25.020> have<00:02:25.140> little<00:02:25.830> outside

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
lob through balls we have little outside

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.430

of the foot passes touch passes you know
what<00:02:28.740> this<00:02:28.920> does<00:02:29.160> is<00:02:29.460> it<00:02:29.490> really<00:02:29.910> helps<00:02:30.330> that

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
what this does is it really helps that

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.300 
what this does is it really helps that
synergy<00:02:30.840> between<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.800> know<00:02:31.890> pressing<00:02:32.250> the

fluid<00:02:37.200> filled<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:37.740> game<00:02:38.010> we've<00:02:38.580> also<00:02:38.700> got

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
fluid filled to the game we've also got

new shooting you heading chest passes

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.370 
new shooting you heading chest passes
you<00:02:41.550> can<00:02:41.700> also<00:02:41.850> now<00:02:42.150> have<00:02:42.390> multiple<00:02:43.170> players

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
you can also now have multiple players

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.840 
you can also now have multiple players
going<00:02:43.620> off<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:43.920> try<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:44.220> win<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.400> ball<00:02:44.580> and

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
going off to try and win the ball and

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.670 
going off to try and win the ball and
then<00:02:45.450> within<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.810> living<00:02:46.080> world<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.590> was

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
then within the living world it was

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.680 
then within the living world it was
creating<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:47.670> atmosphere<00:02:47.730> of<00:02:48.360> feel<00:02:48.660> to

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
creating that atmosphere of feel to

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.990 
creating that atmosphere of feel to

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
create feel like it was real and there's

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000 
create feel like it was real and there's

a number of key elements to this the

a number of key elements to this the

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
first is the crowd we've never been able

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.720 
first is the crowd we've never been able
to<00:02:54.990> do<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.170> 3d<00:02:55.500> crowd<00:02:55.830> before<00:02:56.010> we<00:02:56.280> just<00:02:56.430> didn't

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
to do a 3d crowd before we just didn't

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.760 
to do a 3d crowd before we just didn't
have<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.910> power<00:02:57.270> to<00:02:57.360> do<00:02:57.660> it<00:02:57.690> when<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:58.470> had<00:02:58.590> to
