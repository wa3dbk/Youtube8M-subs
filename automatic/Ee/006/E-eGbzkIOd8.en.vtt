00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 hi to all video from tuesday april 15th 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.880
 I start my day doing the 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.490
 full of vitamins it's very important 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.750
 vitamin c for bodybuilding and 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.529
 wider 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.119
 when we want to be healthy so 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:19.080
 it's still orange grapefruit 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.769
 mandarin 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.750
 according to what I have on hand then 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.859
 when it comes to very very hot 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.010
 good sensations at the level of 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.080
 pronation pulls especially with a 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.430
 reduced amplitude I can mount the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.800
 easily small modes at the level of 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.329
 running small things to note if 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.370
 you see at the level of the scapula 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.219
 right it does not move almost 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.270
 compare my left dish and I 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.610
 I realized it during 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.010
 execution I took everything to the level of 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.390
 biceps and I felt like my 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.010
 dorsal did not work absolutely 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.680
 it's because I locked 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.210
 all the pieces on the right side and this 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.899
 something it's a little something 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.149
 thing to avoid 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.300
 I want to see a little apprehension at 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.580
 level of sensations of the right shoulder 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.229
 start going to space and for the 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.390
 back to tractions and I have everything 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.729
 lock the right side it was the 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.110
 little thing to avoid 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.630
 the word flat must be able to move 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.820
 freely during the execution 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.650
 provided of course to have the shoulders 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:26.299
 back and low little posing at 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.939
 now I am quite satisfied with 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.920
 volume of pecs and shoulders 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.740
 dorsal too which leaves something to be desired 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.710
 again it's arms and there I 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.049
 am at 41 centimeters and half and that's 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.509
 especially you see the volume the 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.329
 difference in volume between the biceps and 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.009
 triceps especially on the left side it's 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.470
 really blatant 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.479
 normally these two-thirds one-third a 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.079
 shutter a balanced arm that's pretty much 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:58.710
 two thirds of triceps and one third biceps 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.450
 and evra call and there the biceps 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.600
 they are not a third they are in 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.340
 eighths or if it's not a tenth and 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.129
 I'm really looking forward to it 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.470
 pulls back supine and 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.680
 to be able to work 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.440
 optimally the biceps to have 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.750
 a harmonious volume an aesthetics 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.670
 harmonious at the arm and blow 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.720
 it will help me win quickly 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.130
 centimeters of arm circumference for what 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.410
 is such a very good pumps 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.480
 sensations 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.780
 less than 13 and 14 validated this week 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.810
 without any worries so I continued to 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.060
 set the modes at the pumps 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.070
 I hope to come from a 17 or 18 mode to 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.750
 less so you'll see that over 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.320
 weeks 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.720
 flexibility now so flexibility 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:52.110
 the flexibility I did it so 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.550
 regular in 2010 when I was preparing my 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.200
 competition for the championships of 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.900
 la France 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.910
 I had just stopped viet vo dao and the 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.620
 Thai boxing at the time so I still had 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.380
 the habit of making an area 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.030
 stretching almost every day I 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.360
 a little lost this habit I do 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.860
 always stretching but simply 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.720
 to release the tensions after the 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.440
 bodybuilding and not so much in a 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.440
 optical gain gains and I have 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.489
 really hurt in quotation marks because 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.040
 I'm not a regular enough 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.190
 found a good flexibility especially at 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.150
 hip flexor level 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.550
 sitting for hours sitting 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.730
 in front of the computer or by car 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.440
 does not help the situation so very 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.610
 very important the flexor of the 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.950
 hip 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.410
 especially for the position of the basin and the 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.019
 pond position it's an impact 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.600
 on the aesthetics of abdominals 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.980
 on the form that will have between 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.440
 quotes the belly and the entire abdomen 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.549
 and that's something I 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.100
 will develop in the next videos 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.080
 because especially for the category 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.720
 fitness model that can be interesting 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.630
 to have a full belly 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.960
 draw here is next week 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.960
 ciao 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.870
 he 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.870
