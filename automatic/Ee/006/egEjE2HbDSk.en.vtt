00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.850
 Hello I would like to separately remove 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:09.040
 on a little motor means people face 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:16.050
 such a problem as this 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:19.869
 motors means it slips itself 

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:24.519
 say the rope itself slips 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:26.789
 otherwise how i solved this problem first 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:31.149
 I will show who does not know how 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:34.720
 adjustment here like yes here's this 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:36.570
 the flange of which a bang it snaps 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.190
 how does it work 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.670
 it turns out when it snaps 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.990
 he comes into engagement with this big like 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:50.920
 would gears yes there are contacts and 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:55.110
 when your cable turns out 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.340
 or this gear comes in scrolling but 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.550
 this drummer rolls over 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.260
 it turns out and there are won contacts here 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.929
 maybe not visible there is here here 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.990
 these are contacts and at a certain moment 

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:09.009
 when he gets a contact here let's say 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.679
 here are the grooves 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:17.679
 if I can see I will try to make here the grooves yes 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:19.119
 and in these grooves reach contacts contact 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:21.549
 all motor snaps into place 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:25.119
 stop so come back now 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:27.700
 to the problem when we slipped 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:31.569
 the cable on this motors also slipped 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.759
 cable as I solved this problem but lubrication 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:37.079
 it goes without saying 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:40.959
 so you need to lubricate the cable, I like 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:46.600
 I thought that my gear is worn 

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:49.869
 here are 1 on the gears in my 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.600
 but that's not the point I don't remember for a long time 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:56.840
 parsed us look right here 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:00.240
 it turns out there is a nut 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:05.970
 by this here i have broken you will 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:08.880
 the whole is obtained here is this resting testicle by 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.090
 essentially on the go as well as how to control 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:16.140
 and puff since yes I took it from me 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:19.140
 it was slightly released 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.510
 time may just as soon as possible 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.180
 all over the time I went down I know 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.240
 it unscrewed brightened up 6 from me 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.500
 normal wear and there well, as if special 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:34.370
 this did not see there all the teeth are intact 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.440
 It means and with further about removing the cover 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.890
 put back the lid tightened well 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.440
 this bolt see from the greased cable and all 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.580
 as if the cable works normally anywhere 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.050
 does not slip 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:51.860
 as it is now I can not show but there was 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.420
 I will not try to lie 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.709
 everything seems to be normal under load 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:02.870
 really did not check but it works 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:07.430
 how would you like to show on the motor itself 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.430
 thank you all bye
