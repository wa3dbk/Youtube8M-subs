00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:14.439
 Musikmesse 2011 in Frankfurt We are here at the booth of SDL at anno mid-v 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:18.919
 Study Kückmann at its finest as Celle Zach Hello good day 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:20.770
 what does he have special then 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.360
 as of novelties this year so the newest one was fresh and was obvious 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.210
 buy quasi today really built for the first 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.829
 is he never out that the a20 Canadians Sumi come who should I now 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:32.670
 Yes normal 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.680
 but neither admit it 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.230
 Sophie is he the new 24 channel Sumerian Eros called the new highlight of the 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.450
 Company SDR 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.100
 Lettieri Peterzell sometimes what the device can do and a few 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.690
 technical details wants 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.870
 very happy so as I said the otherwise yes for what several 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.550
 Percentage of each channel then spears and mono operated it first at 12 channel 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.720
 In total, sterile months are 24 channels 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.150
 Percent of each channel has its own Momo button 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.610
 But that's not the case in the Panorama 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.000
 a place or Modern Tottenham JUZ Seiter 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.910
 An eleven-year-old sent feature is the only monitor-based feature 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.300
 if I always have Mixa on reference track 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.360
 where I want to orient myself 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.730
 Percent that I would like to have in Endenich Suisse and not at all 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.150
 second Brüggemann 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.180
 then I have this track 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.930
 Percent in my mode to section with the listeners but that does not become 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.040
 Breakout 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.480
 bleeding means he did not show up with 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.110
 ie values ​​between 1 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.040
 I'm waiting for monitor reader for a reference number 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.730
 but still nothing else the next one continues and as soon as you go 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.210
 the button presses then the thing is not heard in the end result 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.770
 so you can hear Teuscher Labbé or 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.830
 are missing circumstances 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.660
 that's how it is in Durban, of course 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.840
 that are additives solid so wait what so i can have several slices and 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.130
 then the traces that are on all 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.710
 Hey that's in Mono Solo what's gonna happen to us, no one does the mono 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.880
 just because the design technique is so sure 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.370
 It has become easier the good and much bigger 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.469
 Germany coach 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:10.409
 the most important thing about the pulse 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.959
 «From our point of view, therefore, I just wanted to see the buildings or they already 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.229
 our funny goals with other devices we have 

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:20.159
 and that will cause us to say very very good about value 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.619
 than in the previous month 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:23.719
 we have 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:27.290
 Percent min the Namib circumference of at least 0 25 db 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.779
 and absolutely distortion free it works even to the channel to the absolute 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:33.039
 Limit drives 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:35.450
 Perthes a little trade so very good values 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.379
 and if I have a track heavier so Loewe 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.589
 A Reichert further, the feisty it is crazy 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:44.839
 so far at other switch band what were evaluating 

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:49.180
 Will be the best when it's about the need to kill action 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:50.279
 sound engineers 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:52.769
 As it looks there in the world we had a very nice one 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.400
 Story tells you everywhere 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.020
 What a mixer, if you like, goes to the limit 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.650
 with the sound does not make you turn on now with Becker l at some point 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.849
 started the lectern 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.649
 to change the fence 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:06.279
 Look that ass 

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:09.459
 He clearly said Damons goes to Sa and 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.749
 and Slomka have thanked our guys like that and then have 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:18.359
 Beumer he no longer way to achieve percent in the Master Section a play 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.879
 Meter or compressor installed the old but not very eighth initiated 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.289
 already in the direction of Münster is going for a permanent job always has and 

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:29.679
 can make out the EM helps it when Mans has turned on with the master 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:33.809
 Feather mixed in the south of India so really interesting to drive the cars 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:36.809
 may also mitlief on you with similar plaster work or SSL 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.069
 especially with large analog and one drives the master important legislation 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.580
 shown is the number and that he has tried 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.990
 Dr and just the best so that I also found very well 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:49.430
 the device has to the entrance 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.409
 perhaps the condemned was the so-called d 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:55.409
 Franz Rauch which subsequently station Munich 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:00.040
 So for me that's the word we're puzzling about now even if 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.549
 Experience with mixing the first mixes you've made times test it 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.780
 is due to the situation due to smoking as that has got around to that 

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:12.329
 nothing and again such a fun 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.359
 and the emotional power one does not stick with the technology but 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.309
 you just have 

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:18.799
 to stand over 20 o'clock 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.130
 thanks a lot of money you still have shock in nine pence for 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.840
 guitarists 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.330
 yes we saw with him that is a device which is on the piano Lette 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.010
 on board similar in principle but still somewhat slimmed down 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.120
 at the age of 16 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.529
 So I have it now 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:35.699
 Piquet this is now the predecessor of the KEV he continues and 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.960
 this is a new device now that's the producer 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.180
 yes the principle is a very simple one 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.999
 Per cent, many musicians know this in front of a guitarist 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:47.949
 Percent one of the notorious Marshal fights the sounds only cool and Bootz 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:49.599
 Plans are on l 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:53.289
 English setting because of this setting correctly all switches to 11 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:54.229
 the problem is 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.759
 sda depending on what environment play up the boat not too loud 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:00.490
 in good weather, stagnant on the third floor 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.110
 at Schroders 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.410
 There's no such thing in the kitchen, and it does not stop there 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.949
 the Cadillac have 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.979
 such and power sog is that means the time between which he contains and 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:12.949
 he sucks the box 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:15.650
 Percent because they have the electricity 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.839
 make magic and rain 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:22.569
 Patricks tricks and gimmicks Tata Steel Automotive Lamon set the performance in 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:25.069
 Heat implemented independent have such an afp 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:29.020
 The roads were loud but with the sound of a full-blown Enz 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.589
 Hertwig www SWM but still everything is different in the world stronger 

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:34.439
 make provisions 

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:38.210
 we also want a deal exit just below the Beletage 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.870
 and has a bike in motion 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.450
 and Dr with Uster is the slimmed-down version of it in ferrari look 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:50.129
 for particularly fast Etelsen Kerner Fahrrads Bregenz at the color 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:53.029
 the principle is a very simple one 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:55.689
 just one input and one output 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.190
 the first draft 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.949
 neither Graber a kennel but from box Norbert Winkels in between 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:05.180
 But none of many experts has an eid-function 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.099
 just set to tooth 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:11.009
 and then you have percent three options either 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:13.509
 that's the signal as it is 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:18.710
 he produces satiated and optional - EUR -5 bb or clever is on 

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:20.800
 variable 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.800
 and then, of course, the reduction 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.960
 that means I have to take a monkey from Irma Microphone I would take 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.530
 yes even the DAX rose amazed correctly 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.770
 yes, but then very quiet and forth 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.069
 the volume the area could get out of it
