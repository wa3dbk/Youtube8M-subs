 Absolutely coming Japan Motorsport z z super gt reporter 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:33.510
 I'm Yuri Hinaguchi 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:39.300
 German gt race dtm from 2014 in super gt 500 class 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:45.000
 The unification of the regulations was decided and became a big topic, but at this Suzuka Circuit 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:48.360
 The new machine will be unveiled in line with the new regulation, and new from next year 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.070
 The fight is attracting attention 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:56.660
 What does this new regulation mean to the team 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.660
 I want to hear a story 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:08.640
 We've been leading the Japan of motor sport in a wide range of categories 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:10.070
 We would like to hear from Mr. Shinpei, President of Toms Inc. 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.600
 I will 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.070
 How about the unification of regulation of this super gt and dtm 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.940
 Are you thinking 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.900
 That's right 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.130
 This change is 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:30.520
 Well, there have been various circumstances that regulation has changed so far 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:35.890
 As for this time, I would like to further transmit the gt of Japan to the world, or more 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:37.570
 I think that was one if there is a mutual sense of wanting to global category Well now 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.100
 Japan's gt 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:44.390
 Well 500 and in particular in the case of 500 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:48.290
 That Honda, Toyota and Nissan 3 makers are out there 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:54.770
 Toka is in, for example, German manufacturer beyond to us to come more full of it 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:58.340
 We as also a large number of that manufacturer in which way to go Toka I really sense maybe 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.090
 It sounds like it's going to be interesting, but I guess there 's a variety 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.229
 People are excited about cars 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.070
 After all I think that it is attractive to one of the races that say variety 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.570
 In 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:12.870
 I think so Well if you can put together that exchange game 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:18.330
 I hope to hold the World Cup somewhere 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:20.520
 World Cup of ne motor sport but I feel that the more fun think Given mark 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:25.060
 But it is like to see Te push 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:31.920

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:36.750
 Thank you if you have that outlook, such as overseas expansion is Negaeru to specifically listen to if 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.470
 I already always I quite'm I'm I want to go abroad 's the exit category 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.720
 Absent 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:48.090
 In that sense , which gt may take some time now 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:51.940
 Been able to exchange war with the United States there is no exchange game with a and Europe and unified 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:56.260
 But there is a world cup in there somewhere 1 by all means 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:59.580
