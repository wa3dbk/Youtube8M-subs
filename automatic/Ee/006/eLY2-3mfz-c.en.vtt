styling of the
feels<00:02:12.010> I<00:02:12.310> do<00:02:13.000> think<00:02:13.420> they're<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:13.690> little<00:02:14.020> bit

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.290 
glass so that's something you may want

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.810 
glass so that's something you may want
to<00:06:12.560> make<00:06:12.740> sure<00:06:12.770> you<00:06:13.100> have<00:06:13.250> covered<00:06:13.700> in

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
to make sure you have covered in

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.220 
to make sure you have covered in
insurance<00:06:14.390> and<00:06:14.630> everything<00:06:14.660> like<00:06:15.170> that

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.230 
insurance and everything like that

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.910 
insurance and everything like that
because<00:06:15.650> it<00:06:16.270> seems<00:06:17.270> like<00:06:17.420> the<00:06:17.720> glass<00:06:18.020> may<00:06:18.650> have

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:18.920 
because it seems like the glass may have

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.270 
because it seems like the glass may have
the<00:06:19.070> tendency<00:06:19.340> to<00:06:19.730> crack<00:06:20.120> pretty<00:06:20.540> easy<00:06:21.280> with

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 
the tendency to crack pretty easy with

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.690 
the tendency to crack pretty easy with
any<00:06:22.490> kind<00:06:22.790> of<00:06:23.320> you<00:06:24.320> know<00:06:24.380> severe<00:06:24.890> or<00:06:25.130> decent

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:25.700 
any kind of you know severe or decent

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.390 
any kind of you know severe or decent
impact<00:06:26.330> from<00:06:26.660> a<00:06:26.930> rock<00:06:27.590> or<00:06:27.890> something<00:06:27.950> like

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
impact from a rock or something like

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.580 
impact from a rock or something like
that<00:06:28.460> so<00:06:29.420> just<00:06:29.570> keep<00:06:29.750> that<00:06:29.810> in<00:06:30.020> mind<00:06:30.290> if<00:06:30.500> you

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.590 
that so just keep that in mind if you

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.220 
that so just keep that in mind if you
decide<00:06:30.950> to<00:06:31.070> buy<00:06:31.190> one<00:06:31.460> of<00:06:31.490> these

I've had in quite a while just out of
the<00:06:45.140> box<00:06:45.380> it<00:06:46.340> feels<00:06:46.880> like<00:06:47.090> a<00:06:47.330> car<00:06:47.780> that<00:06:48.230> has

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:48.500 
the box it feels like a car that has

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:54.840 
the box it feels like a car that has
been<00:06:48.950> upgraded<00:06:49.880> I<00:06:50.540> mean<00:06:50.990> going<00:06:51.380> from<00:06:51.890> a<00:06:53.260> 2014

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:54.850 
been upgraded I mean going from a 2014

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:59.020 
been upgraded I mean going from a 2014
WRX<00:06:55.850> which<00:06:56.150> I<00:06:56.300> drove<00:06:56.890> modified<00:06:57.890> and<00:06:58.460> it<00:06:58.760> still

00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.030 
WRX which I drove modified and it still

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.060 
WRX which I drove modified and it still
still<00:06:59.630> doesn't<00:06:59.960> feel<00:07:00.050> as<00:07:00.200> tight<00:07:00.440> as<00:07:00.620> this<00:07:00.800> car

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:01.070 
still doesn't feel as tight as this car
