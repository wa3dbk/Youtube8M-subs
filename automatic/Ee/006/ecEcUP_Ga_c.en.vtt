00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.340
 hello everyone with you gleb and a new review on 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.369
 the tenth level, we have already seen 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.250
 and to all cutlass lil 40 p today as 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.110
 promised American f-86 saber 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.480
 as usually we will consider strong and weak 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.210
 sides we will analyze the tactics of combat and 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.940
 much more in the history of the cathedral had 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.580
 more than 20 different modifications and consisted 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.010
 in service until the 70s in 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.989
 our game, he occupies line 10 level 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.180
 American fighters having with them 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.089
 excellent speed, good maneuverability 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.190
 and medium weapons let's detail 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:47.729
 on strength our fighter is far from 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.610
 the worst 

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:53.430
 and has 410 hit points with a mass of 6 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.989
 Half tons of saber weapon costs 6 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.760
 heavy machine guns with 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.739
 1,200 rounds of fire at 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.199
 minute and initial bullet speed 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.600
 900 meters per second sorry 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.030
 the amount does not justify itself and f-86 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.640
 has the weakest weapons of tenths 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.920
 levels inflicting only 126 per second 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.960
 damage but luckily these machine guns have 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.490
 their advantages overheat almost 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.110
 unreal that gives the opportunity to lead 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.380
 continuous fire until destruction 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.940
 goals speed is probably the only 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.130
 parameter and which server can 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.930
 brag but again strongly 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.300
 rejoice not worth the speed though 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.520
 good but not better at the optimum 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.620
 at an altitude of 2400 meters its optimum 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.930
 speed of 550 kilometers per hour 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.480
 occupies middle ground in tenths 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.909
 levels of maneuverability quite good again 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.380
 parameter but again not good enough to 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.729
 Fortunately, the optimum height is 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.159
 fear only one german 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.320
 fighter map 1101 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.440
 only he is able to fasten north to 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.750
 his height perhaps with characteristics we 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.570
 figured out let's talk about tactics 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.640
 combat sailor high altitude fighter 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.590
 from respectively the beginning of the fight is 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.110
 occupy a height of 3-4 thousand meters 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.180
 to fight best on the vertical as 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.760
 all American fighter our 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.350
 priority only one german 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.989
 easy aim and second in importance 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.549
 opponent swift fortune british 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.290
 heavy fighters we easily 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.989
 twist them especially wary not 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.730
 but should not relax and they 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.980
 can easily drive us in a straight line to 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.779
 Unfortunately, our weapons do not give us 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.760
 the assurance that we are easily 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:25.790
 we will kill opponents therefore 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.129
 use our machine guns to the maximum 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.569
 putting on them incendiary ammunition them 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.480
 the amount and rate of fire will be but 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.319
 very often set fire to opponents 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.989
 optimum shooting distance for 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.299
 machine guns is 200 500 meters now 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.670
 important information go down below 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.409
 optimum height not recommended there 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.329
 there is a number of opponents who us 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:47.269
 easily twist and overtake a 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.799
 now very bad news to kill 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.439
 stormtroopers whether us banned 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.120
 weapons are too weak for them and us 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:55.340
 will have to do more than three visits 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.379
 to cut down the enemy while we 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.349
 very much we get the selection arrow 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:02.540
 let's take a look at the service as I have already 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.579
 spoke our heavy machine guns 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.909
 forced to put incendiary ammunition 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:10.730
 we take them further we put pneumatic 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:12.859
 restarting purified kerosene increasing 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.019
 its aerodynamic parameters and in 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:17.389
 take the last slot fire extinguisher now 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.069
 go to the additional modules immediately take 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.750
 sight because we are very much 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.180
 machine guns and does not need precision 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.340
 firing further improve our 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.040
 aerodynamics polishing put plating and 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.030
 the last slot the same trim strengthen 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.919
 now the last part is crew perks 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.049
 first perk we study the review it to us 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:38.569
 It is very useful to further learn the connoisseur 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.209
 motor you are a sniper again improving our 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.190
 basic parameters and 4 perk worth 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.319
 put the veteran since we often 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.659
 will meet with games and fight with 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.269
 their bunch of machine guns and in 5 perk 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:52.639
 choice of first aid kit and fire extinguisher let 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.019
 results of sibur high-altitude fighter with 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:56.299
 excellent speed quite good 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.769
 maneuverability using these parameters 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.349
 you will achieve the desired results 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.709
 but unfortunately the plane will not like it 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.530
 to all 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.120
 Perhaps on this and finish next 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.340
 you will see the British heavy 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.319
 the fighter is swamped and today I am with you 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.540
 say goodbye speak to new meetings 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.319
 subscribe to channel like 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.319
 and good luck in the air
