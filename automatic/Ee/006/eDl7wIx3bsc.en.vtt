 playing as ten poles between himself and his 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.679
 frank as much as as your character 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.440
 main 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.930
 on the one hand it's silly goofy silly goofy 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.990
 immature and many more adjectives than 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.109
 fit the funny game or be 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.220
 do you like malicious jokes 16 earthquake 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.289
 casual 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.390
 if not then deco the character of the game 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.910
 It'll take you like a knife trying. 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.890
 cut a kit from the other big side 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.620
 part of the gameplay experience of the 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.149
 technician is formulaic and safe as 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.129
 sure you may think that the 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.440
 developer rhythm studios is 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.500
 playing some kind of self reference 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.719
 was not the only one as normal, but in the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.820
 truth is not a doctor speaks like a great 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.980
 game but offers an action experience 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.980
 which is the limit of the parody of the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.809
 video game and he himself is the parody for 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.270
 those that are not formalized with the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.059
 glory of a just mexico one mouth o 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.489
 spam puff dex depp is a parody 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.560
 of an anti-hero the pillars of the marvel 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.200
 in comics it was given 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.180
 a cure factor of gun x boys 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.890
 the same as the wolverine in a 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.500
 experimental procedure that left 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.720
 proven insan and self-conscious 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.909
 that he is actually a character from 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.159
 comics for this reason of pupo 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.850
 also knows that he is a character from 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.549
 video game 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.619
 in fact and the story begins the little 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.079
 that there is forcing one more to do 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.140
 a game over and then threw away the 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.430
 script for approval is an approach 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.570
 appropriately insane that is true to 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.630
 Tupi character 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.640
 even if it does not make a strong story 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.130
 behind the deco move the third 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.869
 creative and brilliant jokes errors 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.540
 is a fairly conventional action game 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.189
 and shenelle cunani but it is not 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.020
 particularly good without large 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.880
 number of hidden secrets or 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.590
 items locked to release not 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.869
 really no reason to play 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.579
 again as soon as I have finished 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.469
 developer raimo understood the 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.290
 character and brought the funny part 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.670
 but none of the fineness of action that would 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.469
 of sacavÃ©m pulse 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.840
 if you are a stupid rock fan 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.510
 initially repetitively but with a 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.220
 slightly fun gameplay 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.049
 which offers a fun weekend 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.049
 and full of bullshit 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.740
 ae
