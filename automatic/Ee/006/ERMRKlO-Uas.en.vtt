because I think with kimonos if you go
bit<00:01:20.759> louder<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.420> means<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.720> can<00:01:21.869> just<00:01:22.049> wear

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
bit louder it means you can just wear

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
like a simple dress or simple pair of

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.940 
like a simple dress or simple pair of
shorts<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.570> kind<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.810> got<00:01:25.409> like<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.650> jazzy

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
shorts and you kind of got like a jazzy

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.160 
shorts and you kind of got like a jazzy
thing<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.460> go<00:01:26.580> over<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.330> when<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.960> really

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
thing to go over it and when I really

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.240 
thing to go over it and when I really
like<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.380> pattern<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.829> think<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.070> really

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
like the pattern I think it's really

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.219 
like the pattern I think it's really
unique<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.759> kind<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.119> vintage-inspired<00:01:30.509> I

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
unique and kind of vintage-inspired I

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.660 
unique and kind of vintage-inspired I
let's<00:01:31.560> pick<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:31.860> simple<00:01:32.460> black<00:01:32.640> dress

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
let's pick this simple black dress

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.670 
let's pick this simple black dress
purely<00:01:33.180> because<00:01:33.390> it's<00:01:33.659> really<00:01:33.840> lightweight<00:01:34.170> I

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
purely because it's really lightweight I

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.469 
purely because it's really lightweight I
think<00:01:35.250> if<00:01:35.400> festivals<00:01:35.909> wearing<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.270> little

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
think if festivals wearing a little

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.300 
think if festivals wearing a little
lightweight<00:01:36.869> dress<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.710> then<00:01:37.799> just<00:01:38.009> jazzing

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
lightweight dress and then just jazzing

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.880 
lightweight dress and then just jazzing
up<00:01:38.430> with<00:01:38.610> like<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> kimono<00:01:39.210> or<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:40.560> those<00:01:40.740> of

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
up with like a kimono or just those of

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.499 
up with like a kimono or just those of
accessories<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> headband<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.119> think<00:01:42.299> that's<00:01:42.420> a

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
accessories a headband I think that's a

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.060 
accessories a headband I think that's a
really<00:01:42.540> nice<00:01:42.899> kind<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.290> look<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.680> think<00:01:43.890> that's

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
really nice kind of look I think that's

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.219 
really nice kind of look I think that's
just<00:01:44.250> kind<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.520> like<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> really<00:01:45.030> strong<00:01:45.509> look

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
just kind of like a really strong look

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.660 
just kind of like a really strong look
and<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.590> just<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.979> don't<00:01:47.100> know<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.310> really<00:01:47.399> like

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
and I just I don't know I really like

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.069 
and I just I don't know I really like
that<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.270> bit<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.570> risky<00:01:48.930> pick

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
that this is a bit of a risky pick

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.690 
that this is a bit of a risky pick
especially<00:01:49.560> with<00:01:49.680> festivals<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.220> mind<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:50.640> I

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
especially with festivals in mind but I

out wing isn't the most easy thing in
the<00:02:02.219> world<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:02.820> if<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:02.969> did<00:02:03.090> wear<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.509> a

the world so if you did wear this to a

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.850 
the world so if you did wear this to a
festival<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.110> probably<00:02:04.350> would<00:02:04.469> have<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.740> get

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
know i love monochrome stuff so this

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.500 
know i love monochrome stuff so this
fits<00:02:10.410> perfectly<00:02:10.920> into<00:02:11.129> my<00:02:11.340> kind<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.730> normal

another simple summery dress which I

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.640

think<00:02:17.570> would<00:02:17.720> look<00:02:17.780> really<00:02:18.110> good<00:02:18.230> with<00:02:18.380> a<00:02:18.470> pair

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
think would look really good with a pair

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.620 
think would look really good with a pair
of<00:02:18.680> boots<00:02:19.070> and<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.820> green<00:02:20.030> jacket<00:02:20.420> that<00:02:20.540> I've

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
of boots and that green jacket that I've

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.330

already<00:02:20.780> shown<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:21.140> I<00:02:21.470> think<00:02:21.980> it's<00:02:22.130> just<00:02:22.190> a

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340

lace broderie thing I really really like
this<00:02:27.290> I<00:02:27.650> think<00:02:27.710> it's<00:02:28.100> just<00:02:28.190> to<00:02:28.430> come<00:02:28.580> if<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:28.760> like

this I think it's just to come if I like

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.130 
this I think it's just to come if I like
wearing<00:02:29.240> white<00:02:29.510> in<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.780> summer<00:02:29.990> because

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
wearing white in the summer because

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.720 
wearing white in the summer because
obviously<00:02:30.380> it<00:02:30.740> kind<00:02:31.100> of<00:02:31.130> enhances<00:02:31.640> your

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
obviously it kind of enhances your

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.430 
obviously it kind of enhances your
natural<00:02:31.850> tan<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:32.720> I<00:02:32.840> think<00:02:33.020> it's<00:02:33.110> really<00:02:33.230> cool

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
natural tan and I think it's really cool

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.810 
natural tan and I think it's really cool
it's<00:02:33.680> really<00:02:33.890> nice<00:02:34.010> lightweight<00:02:34.310> material

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
it's really nice lightweight material

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.780 
it's really nice lightweight material
and<00:02:34.970> it's<00:02:35.480> also<00:02:35.690> line<00:02:36.140> so<00:02:36.590> if<00:02:36.860> you<00:02:37.190> hate

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
and it's also line so if you hate

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.980 
and it's also line so if you hate
wearing<00:02:38.090> white<00:02:38.330> dresses<00:02:38.570> because<00:02:38.810> they

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
wearing white dresses because they

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.930 
wearing white dresses because they
always<00:02:39.170> show<00:02:39.380> your<00:02:39.500> pants<00:02:39.770> through<00:02:39.980> then<00:02:40.370> this

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
always show your pants through then this

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.480 
always show your pants through then this
is<00:02:41.210> probably<00:02:41.390> a<00:02:41.750> pant<00:02:42.260> save<00:02:42.530> option<00:02:43.040> next<00:02:43.460> I

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
is probably a pant save option next I

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:44.680 
is probably a pant save option next I
pick<00:02:43.670> something<00:02:43.970> that<00:02:44.000> I<00:02:44.150> probably<00:02:44.360> wouldn't

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
pick something that I probably wouldn't

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.870 
pick something that I probably wouldn't
normally<00:02:44.780> choose<00:02:45.230> but<00:02:45.680> it's<00:02:46.220> this<00:02:46.490> sort<00:02:46.790> of

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
normally choose but it's this sort of

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.210 
normally choose but it's this sort of

it's<00:04:15.980> not<00:04:16.160> like<00:04:16.340> too<00:04:16.820> much<00:04:17.030> stuff<00:04:17.450> I<00:04:17.660> feel<00:04:17.810> like

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
it's not like too much stuff I feel like

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.420 
it's not like too much stuff I feel like
I<00:04:17.989> wouldn't<00:04:18.229> over<00:04:18.620> pack<00:04:18.830> because<00:04:19.010> I<00:04:19.160> have<00:04:19.400> a

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
I wouldn't over pack because I have a

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.219 
I wouldn't over pack because I have a
tendency<00:04:19.880> to<00:04:20.030> do<00:04:20.150> that<00:04:20.299> very<00:04:20.660> like<00:04:20.780> backpacks

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
tendency to do that very like backpacks

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:22.450 
tendency to do that very like backpacks
and<00:04:21.410> then<00:04:21.500> I<00:04:21.620> think<00:04:21.770> they<00:04:21.830> look<00:04:21.950> really<00:04:22.160> cute

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.980 
and then I think they look really cute
especially<00:04:22.700> with<00:04:23.060> little<00:04:23.240> dresses<00:04:23.690> I<00:04:23.810> think

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
especially with little dresses I think

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.379 
especially with little dresses I think
they<00:04:24.080> just<00:04:24.169> add<00:04:24.380> like

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389
