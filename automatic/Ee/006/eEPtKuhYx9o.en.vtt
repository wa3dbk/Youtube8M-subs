about some of the challenges that the
engineers<00:00:27.210> had<00:00:27.419> to<00:00:27.539> overcome<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.740> down<00:00:29.039> thank

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
engineers had to overcome so down thank

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.579 
engineers had to overcome so down thank
you<00:00:29.730> one<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.449> key<00:00:30.749> things<00:00:30.779> we<00:00:31.199> needed<00:00:31.380> to

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:31.589 
you one of the key things we needed to

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.220 
you one of the key things we needed to
do<00:00:31.740> was<00:00:32.369> first<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.880> all<00:00:32.970> manage<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.990> side

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
do was first of all manage the side

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.560 
do was first of all manage the side
impact<00:00:34.740> on<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.010> normal<00:00:35.490> vehicle<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.360> have<00:00:36.540> a

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
impact on a normal vehicle you have a

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.480 
impact on a normal vehicle you have a
pillar<00:00:37.080> call<00:00:37.380> here<00:00:37.590> we<00:00:37.740> call<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.010> b-pillar

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:38.490 
pillar call here we call it the b-pillar

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.150 
pillar call here we call it the b-pillar
and<00:00:38.970> that<00:00:39.240> pillar<00:00:39.800> creates<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.860> lot<00:00:41.010> of

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
and that pillar creates a lot of

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.010 
and that pillar creates a lot of
strength<00:00:41.490> so<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:42.060> the<00:00:42.090> input<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.780> side

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
strength so that in the input in a side

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.260 
strength so that in the input in a side
impact<00:00:43.470> I<00:00:43.740> will<00:00:44.340> not<00:00:44.550> protrude<00:00:44.850> into<00:00:45.060> the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
impact I will not protrude into the

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.290 
impact I will not protrude into the
vehicle<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.710> for<00:00:47.310> this<00:00:47.400> vehicle<00:00:47.850> we

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
vehicle and so for this vehicle we

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.420 
vehicle and so for this vehicle we
needed<00:00:48.810> to<00:00:48.930> recreate<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.070> actually

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
needed to recreate that so we actually

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.230 
needed to recreate that so we actually
built<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.910> pillar<00:00:51.240> into<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.230> two<00:00:52.410> doors<00:00:52.710> and

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:53.240 
built that pillar into the two doors and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.640 
built that pillar into the two doors and
that's<00:00:54.240> made<00:00:54.450> of<00:00:54.570> extremely<00:00:54.960> high<00:00:55.290> strength

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
that's made of extremely high strength

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.030 
that's made of extremely high strength
boron<00:00:56.160> steel<00:00:56.630> and<00:00:57.630> together<00:00:58.110> with<00:00:58.500> special

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
boron steel and together with special

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.460 
boron steel and together with special
latches<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.610> are<00:01:00.390> specially<00:01:00.900> designed<00:01:00.930> to

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
latches that are specially designed to

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.310 
latches that are specially designed to
clamp<00:01:01.950> in<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.400> crash<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:03.210> get<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.480> same<00:01:03.720> crash

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
clamp in a crash you get the same crash

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.410 
clamp in a crash you get the same crash
performance<00:01:04.890> inside<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> impact<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.270> you

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
performance inside the impact that you

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.570 
performance inside the impact that you
would<00:01:06.630> on<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.900> normal<00:01:06.990> car<00:01:07.409> we<00:01:08.010> also<00:01:08.160> needed<00:01:08.430> to

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
would on a normal car we also needed to

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.520 
would on a normal car we also needed to
make<00:01:08.760> sure<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.450> vehicles<00:01:09.900> stiffness

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
make sure that the vehicles stiffness

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.190 
make sure that the vehicles stiffness
was<00:01:10.740> maintained<00:01:11.250> because<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.540> leads<00:01:12.750> to

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
was maintained because that leads to

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.560 
was maintained because that leads to
dynamics<00:01:14.160> and<00:01:14.370> handling<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:14.940> gives<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
dynamics and handling and gives the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.660 
dynamics and handling and gives the
whole<00:01:15.720> character<00:01:16.050> of<00:01:16.230> the<00:01:16.410> car<00:01:16.620> and<00:01:16.800> dynamics

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
whole character of the car and dynamics

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.640 
whole character of the car and dynamics
and<00:01:17.820> handling<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.300> something<00:01:18.690> that<00:01:18.810> we<00:01:18.990> in

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
and handling is something that we in

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.820 
and handling is something that we in
part<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.040> our<00:01:20.190> DNA<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.760> Ford<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.840> again<00:01:22.170> we<00:01:22.590> used

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
part of our DNA in Ford so again we used

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.830 
part of our DNA in Ford so again we used
those<00:01:23.070> high<00:01:23.370> strength<00:01:23.730> or<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.120> steals<00:01:24.510> and

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
those high strength or on steals and

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.750 
those high strength or on steals and
also<00:01:25.440> the<00:01:25.590> latching<00:01:25.950> system<00:01:25.980> when<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> doors

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
also the latching system when the doors

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.210 
also the latching system when the doors
are<00:01:26.970> shut<00:01:27.030> they<00:01:27.690> very<00:01:28.200> tightly<00:01:28.560> clamped<00:01:28.950> to

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
are shut they very tightly clamped to

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.640 
are shut they very tightly clamped to
the<00:01:29.250> body<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.610> they<00:01:29.760> become<00:01:30.060> part<00:01:30.330> of<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
the body and they become part of the

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.020 
the body and they become part of the
stiffness<00:01:31.650> structure<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.190> the<00:01:32.340> car<00:01:32.550> so<00:01:33.000> you

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
stiffness structure of the car so you

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.810 
stiffness structure of the car so you
still<00:01:33.479> maintain<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.650> dynamics<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.400> handling

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
still maintain the dynamics and handling

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.630 
still maintain the dynamics and handling
that<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.060> expect<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.900> Ford<00:01:37.170> car<00:01:37.430> for<00:01:38.430> this

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
that you expect in a Ford car for this

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.610 
that you expect in a Ford car for this
vehicle<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:39.180> needed<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.540> design<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:40.140> quality

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
vehicle we needed to design in quality

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.040 
vehicle we needed to design in quality
from<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.040> start<00:01:41.340> one<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.150> cornerstones

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
from the start one of the cornerstones

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.969 
from the start one of the cornerstones
of<00:01:43.560> our<00:01:43.710> philosophy<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:45.350> driving<00:01:46.350> quality<00:01:46.770> and

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
of our philosophy is driving quality and

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.710 
of our philosophy is driving quality and
design<00:01:47.430> quality<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.150> we<00:01:48.240> want<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.510> car<00:01:48.690> to

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
design quality and we want the car to

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.250 
design quality and we want the car to
feel<00:01:49.140> like<00:01:49.830> a<00:01:49.860> new<00:01:50.100> vehicle<00:01:50.780> even<00:01:51.780> when<00:01:52.110> it's

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
feel like a new vehicle even when it's

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.020 
feel like a new vehicle even when it's
ten<00:01:52.470> years<00:01:52.680> old<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:53.250> it's<00:01:53.430> important<00:01:53.880> for

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
ten years old and so it's important for

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.120 
ten years old and so it's important for
us<00:01:54.150> that<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.750> maintain<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.380> stiffness<00:01:55.710> and

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
us that you maintain that stiffness and

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.670 
us that you maintain that stiffness and
rigidity<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.820> designing<00:01:57.540> from<00:01:57.900> the<00:01:57.990> start<00:01:58.320> so

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
rigidity and designing from the start so

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.039 
rigidity and designing from the start so
you<00:01:58.740> heard<00:01:59.130> about<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.580> extra<00:01:59.970> steals<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.659> the

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
you heard about the extra steals and the

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.719 
you heard about the extra steals and the
stiffness<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.560> gives<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.159> car<00:02:02.340> that

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
stiffness that gives to the car that

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.550 
stiffness that gives to the car that
gives<00:02:02.940> a<00:02:03.030> great<00:02:03.210> basis<00:02:03.720> for<00:02:03.900> the<00:02:03.960> dynamics<00:02:04.409> and

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
gives a great basis for the dynamics and

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.940 
gives a great basis for the dynamics and
handling<00:02:04.950> we've<00:02:05.820> built<00:02:06.090> in<00:02:06.270> much<00:02:06.750> more<00:02:07.049> noise
