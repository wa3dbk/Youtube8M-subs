00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello this video I'm going to show you 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.640
 the universal steering wheel replica 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.010
 harley 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.460
 I'm Rodrigo and you are in your in 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.460
 Paris 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.029
 the steering wheel is old and worn out or just 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.529
 does not like the original model 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.019
 So how about giving a touch of 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.180
 modernity in its snapper and put the 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.340
 steering wheel replica of the goal there he is 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.230
 that is, it will serve in any 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.300
 car model to install this 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.980
 steering wheel you need the hub that is 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.500
 sold separately 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.540
 This sim is specific to each car 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.840
 As an example I have here a cube for 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.670
 the Corsican year 94 to 2002 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.430
 first you will put the body in the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.430
 car tighten and then put the steering wheel 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.980
 They will remove the center of the steering wheel to have 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.140
 access to the holes, the steering wheel and 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.989
 cube comes with the screws but you 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.730
 find in any hardware store 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.979
 you can tell that the steering wheel covers 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.990
 the whole cube leaving the assembly with 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.090
 finish very nice 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.490
 then you'll put the steering wheel on 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.970
 according to the correct calculation and 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.970
 The screws 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.939
 the original model is the goal but nothing 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.820
 prevents being placed in another car 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.649
 along with it comes the logo of Volvo, but 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.780
 You want to put it on the Ford? 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.479
 chevrolet or any other automaker 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.560
 here on the steering wheel it 's just docked it's not 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.090
 used lap 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.729
 so you can trade easily 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.039
 Do you want to put this wheel in your car? 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.630
 then there will also visit the store part 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:44.920

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.079
