00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello friends with you brutman in this 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.810
 issue we will talk about how 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.790
 improve your skill in shooters a with 16 and 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.530
 hut immediately explain it goes 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.809
 just about shooting i will share with you 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.960
 experiences that gained over 12 years of this 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.970
 the sphere we start think sob is the most important thing 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.890
 up everyone's personal experience you must yourself 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.869
 Understand the basis of data shooter physics 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.060
 geometry shooting u next we'll talk 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.099
 about mindfulness mindfulness is 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.019
 I think the most important thing in the field of ks 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.599
 if you listen carefully in step 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.369
 shot diffuse bomb setting a bomb then 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.260
 it will be much easier for you without leaving 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.420
 mindfulness let's talk about hearing 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.700
 need headphones for every gamer 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.530
 shooters need headphones without them we 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.360
 let's make a lot of blunders 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.730
 thanks to the headphones we will be able to recognize 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.250
 exactly to the unit where is our against 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.989
 Immediately, we will need experience with each 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.250
 we will repeat only more precisely 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.710
 determine the movement of the enemy 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.219
 The second point in importance is of course 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.320
 shooting 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.300
 it needs to be trained like muscles for a long time and 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.039
 difficult vks thank God there are dedicated 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.820
 servers for such workouts are called 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.410
 ccd 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.719
 but this mod has its own 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.270
 species have pistol dm have headshots 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.280
 dm is normal dm is and in pdm i am to you 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.229
 I advise you to play 2 mods by turns 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.450
 starting with the gun on the pond and of course 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.100
 only there we will learn accuracy in 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.770
 aiming at the enemy 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.869
 took 15 minutes pistol go further 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.490
 on headshots dn take a collage and lymph by 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.070
 your discretion and puzzle 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.930
 the enemy we need to learn patience 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.759
 shoot one or two rounds with 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.350
 break per second so we work 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.329
 shooting accuracy 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.369
 we need to learn builder strafe it 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.590
 movement left right you met such 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.750
 people so it will be harder for you to get in 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.590
 head a couple of bullets and arrows do the same 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.110
 on screen 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.820
 after a couple of months you will raise your 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.399
 shooting skill is much higher 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.229
 we pay dm server for 30 minutes a day 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.420
 that's enough not to lose your on 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.340
 but we go higher means we do not need 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.470
 stability in this case we increase 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.000
 time if possible or just starting 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.720
 twice a day to train shooting 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.939
 dm server 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.189
 since we have touched fashion at the end then i 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.820
 wanted to talk about mods like joel 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.310
 ditran 17 n milk replacer here we extract 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.829
 henna mod only with or also it is called 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.660
 hide and seek attention hide and seek does not apply to 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.940
 collecting only ks16 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.640
 since caesars hide and seek changed have 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.460
 different meaning 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.470
 about out of 16 and to the huts what will help us 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.209
 hide and seek you ask so that we 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.340
 learn to jump right and far 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.830
 quickly climb the stairs we learn 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.990
 new jumps the rest of the mods is fan or 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.319
 Simply put entertainment and we talk with 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.569
 gilette 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.550
 now we will touch upon human qualities in 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.900
 accuracy to be able to listen 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.850
 listen to every person who 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.610
 gives you advice and handle the game 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.890
 filter out the necessary tips and shit not 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.020
 moving away from the topic if you are playing a mix or 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.330
 same sare again listen to the team captain 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.280
 and do what he tells you if 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.770
 no captain listen to smarter 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.630

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.930
 Of course, not everything said, I did not much 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.060
 mentioned but most importantly i said 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.890
 little things come to you with experience guys 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.170
 finally leave the skill and learn 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.030
 adequacy if you are killed do not need 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.400
 shouting to him mike every heresy 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.530
