this<00:00:09.990> is<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.469> wicking<00:00:10.950> bucket<00:00:11.280> system<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:11.880> had

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
this is the wicking bucket system I had

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.190 
this is the wicking bucket system I had
this<00:00:12.210> one<00:00:12.420> we<00:00:12.540> were<00:00:12.599> looking<00:00:12.660> at<00:00:12.870> right<00:00:13.019> now<00:00:13.139> is

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
this one we were looking at right now is

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.240 
this one we were looking at right now is
pumpkin<00:00:13.849> everything<00:00:14.849> seems<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.299> do<00:00:15.920> okay<00:00:16.920> in

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
pumpkin everything seems to do okay in

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.570 
pumpkin everything seems to do okay in
these<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.820> still<00:00:18.119> have<00:00:18.330> some<00:00:19.220> concerns<00:00:20.220> like

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
these I still have some concerns like

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.060 
these I still have some concerns like
this<00:00:20.760> one<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.210> can<00:00:21.390> see<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.900> got<00:00:22.710> some<00:00:22.740> yellow

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
this one you can see I got some yellow

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.029 
this one you can see I got some yellow
leaves<00:00:23.369> gone<00:00:23.640> it's<00:00:24.630> growing<00:00:25.019> nicely<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.650> lot<00:00:25.859> of

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
leaves gone it's growing nicely a lot of

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.740 
leaves gone it's growing nicely a lot of
new<00:00:26.189> leaves<00:00:26.430> coming<00:00:26.849> in<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.330> they're<00:00:27.449> green

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
new leaves coming in and they're green

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.259 
new leaves coming in and they're green
but<00:00:28.050> gimps<00:00:28.980> lot<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.279> yellow<00:00:29.460> leaves<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:30.090> don't

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
but gimps lot of yellow leaves I don't

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.889 
but gimps lot of yellow leaves I don't
know<00:00:30.359> if<00:00:30.480> it's<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.689> nitrogen<00:00:31.260> deficiency<00:00:32.130> or

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
know if it's a nitrogen deficiency or

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.540 
know if it's a nitrogen deficiency or
its<00:00:33.899> maybe<00:00:34.140> soaking<00:00:34.590> up<00:00:34.649> too<00:00:34.829> much<00:00:34.980> water<00:00:35.309> but

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
its maybe soaking up too much water but

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.130 
its maybe soaking up too much water but
I<00:00:35.610> don't<00:00:35.760> think<00:00:36.030> that's<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.570> issue<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:37.110> I

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
I don't think that's the issue so I

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.819 
I don't think that's the issue so I
might<00:00:37.410> try<00:00:37.559> doing<00:00:37.890> adding<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.340> little<00:00:38.460> bit<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.670> a

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
might try doing adding a little bit of a

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.440 
might try doing adding a little bit of a
fish<00:00:40.829> emulsion<00:00:40.980> or<00:00:41.340> something<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:42.030> give<00:00:42.420> a

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
fish emulsion or something to give a

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.920 
fish emulsion or something to give a
little<00:00:42.570> more<00:00:42.660> nitrogen<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.410> thought<00:00:44.190> the

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
little more nitrogen I thought the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.959 
little more nitrogen I thought the
potting<00:00:45.930> mix<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.770> had<00:00:46.980> would<00:00:47.190> have<00:00:47.370> enough<00:00:47.730> for

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
potting mix I had would have enough for

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.360 
potting mix I had would have enough for
it<00:00:48.059> for<00:00:48.300> at<00:00:48.450> least<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.750> little<00:00:48.809> while<00:00:49.370> here's

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
it for at least a little while here's

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.020 
it for at least a little while here's
the<00:00:50.610> watermelons<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.629> didn't<00:00:51.960> seed<00:00:52.760> these<00:00:53.760> guys

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
the watermelons I didn't seed these guys

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.319 
the watermelons I didn't seed these guys
I'm<00:00:54.360> still<00:00:54.750> doing<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.170> little<00:00:55.469> bit<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:56.329> surface

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
I'm still doing a little bit of surface

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.139 
I'm still doing a little bit of surface
watering<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.199> get<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.100> roots<00:00:59.520> established

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
watering I get the roots established

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:08.390 
watering I get the roots established
down<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.539> there<00:01:05.780> nicely<00:01:07.100> getting<00:01:08.100> ready<00:01:08.280> to

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
down in there nicely getting ready to

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.190 
down in there nicely getting ready to
come<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.700> with<00:01:08.909> some<00:01:09.119> more<00:01:09.270> leaves<00:01:09.510> here<00:01:12.200> and

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
come in with some more leaves here and

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.179 
come in with some more leaves here and
these<00:01:13.650> are<00:01:13.950> honeydew<00:01:15.560> you<00:01:16.560> know<00:01:16.619> I'm<00:01:16.830> same

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
these are honeydew you know I'm same

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.690 
these are honeydew you know I'm same
thing<00:01:18.229> they're<00:01:19.229> rolling<00:01:19.799> well<00:01:20.009> getting<00:01:20.460> new

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
thing they're rolling well getting new

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.499 
thing they're rolling well getting new
growth

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
growth

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.920 
growth
but<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.259> lower<00:01:22.500> leaves<00:01:23.330> actually<00:01:24.330> might<00:01:24.780> have

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
but the lower leaves actually might have

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.899 
but the lower leaves actually might have
some<00:01:25.170> critter<00:01:25.560> action<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.220> there<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.759> might

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
some critter action on there so I might

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.190 
some critter action on there so I might
have<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.180> do<00:01:27.299> some<00:01:29.270> some<00:01:30.270> spraying<00:01:31.049> or

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
have to do some some spraying or

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.760 
have to do some some spraying or
something

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
something

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.280 
something
Organic<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.880> course<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.810> try<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.020> keep<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
Organic of course you try to keep the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.880 
Organic of course you try to keep the
critters<00:01:34.500> away

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
critters away

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.899 
critters away
he's<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.490> liquid<00:01:36.119> soap<00:01:36.560> spray

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
he's on liquid soap spray

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.370 
he's on liquid soap spray
I'll<00:01:39.909> leave<00:01:40.150> this<00:01:40.799> pinched<00:01:41.799> off<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.899> this<00:01:44.320> is

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
I'll leave this pinched off and this is

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.679 
I'll leave this pinched off and this is
another<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:46.270> do<00:01:46.479> much<00:01:47.170> better<00:01:48.420> still<00:01:49.420> have<00:01:49.630> a

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
another we do much better still have a

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:51.090 
another we do much better still have a
little<00:01:49.810> bit<00:01:49.899> of<00:01:49.990> evidence<00:01:50.170> of<00:01:50.500> perhaps<00:01:50.920> some

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
little bit of evidence of perhaps some

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.850 
little bit of evidence of perhaps some
critters<00:01:51.460> there<00:01:51.610> so<00:01:51.970> I<00:01:52.240> can<00:01:53.229> do<00:01:53.320> something<00:01:53.710> for

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
critters there so I can do something for

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.370 
critters there so I can do something for
that<00:01:54.210> one<00:01:55.210> problem<00:01:55.450> banging<00:01:55.810> outside<00:01:55.960> I'm

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
that one problem banging outside I'm

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.090 
that one problem banging outside I'm
inside<00:01:56.860> a<00:01:56.920> ring<00:01:57.159> house<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:59.170> next<00:01:59.920> one

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
inside a ring house this next one

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.100 
inside a ring house this next one
cantaloupe<00:02:00.759> they're<00:02:01.390> really<00:02:01.689> got<00:02:01.960> me

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
cantaloupe they're really got me

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.350 
cantaloupe they're really got me
concerned<00:02:02.700> they're<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.850> first<00:02:04.000> ones<00:02:04.149> I

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
concerned they're the first ones I

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.649 
concerned they're the first ones I
planted<00:02:05.880> surface<00:02:06.880> water<00:02:07.090> now<00:02:07.330> and<00:02:07.479> then

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
planted surface water now and then

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.979 
planted surface water now and then
hopefully<00:02:08.410> good<00:02:08.649> roots<00:02:09.250> are<00:02:09.369> going<00:02:09.989> original

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
hopefully good roots are going original

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.809 
hopefully good roots are going original
leaves<00:02:11.170> have<00:02:11.319> died<00:02:11.500> off<00:02:11.739> got<00:02:12.340> some<00:02:12.489> new<00:02:12.610> leaf

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
leaves have died off got some new leaf

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.030 
leaves have died off got some new leaf
grown<00:02:13.090> still<00:02:13.420> but<00:02:13.660> there's<00:02:13.810> still<00:02:14.019> the<00:02:14.769> same

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
grown still but there's still the same

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.400 
grown still but there's still the same
size<00:02:15.310> they've<00:02:15.760> always<00:02:16.120> been<00:02:16.260> haven't<00:02:17.260> really

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
size they've always been haven't really

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.039

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
week or two ago and this one again is

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.520 
week or two ago and this one again is
getting<00:03:21.489> new<00:03:22.329> flowers<00:03:22.690> in<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:22.870> marigold<00:03:23.260> and

getting new flowers in the marigold and

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.309 
getting new flowers in the marigold and
it's<00:03:23.650> growing<00:03:24.239> not<00:03:25.239> as<00:03:25.329> fast<00:03:25.569> as<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.810> ones<00:03:26.109> in

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
it's growing not as fast as the ones in

it's growing not as fast as the ones in
the<00:03:26.410> hydroponic<00:03:27.269> and<00:03:28.269> it's<00:03:28.450> got<00:03:28.630> blossoms<00:03:29.170> I

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
the hydroponic and it's got blossoms I

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.190 
the hydroponic and it's got blossoms I
think<00:03:31.480> this<00:03:31.630> one<00:03:31.840> is<00:03:31.870> the

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.180

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
pear cherry and this one is the early

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.680 
pear cherry and this one is the early
girl<00:03:39.860> tomato<00:03:40.860> and<00:03:41.850> over<00:03:42.060> here<00:03:42.270> I<00:03:42.300> have<00:03:42.540> the

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
girl tomato and over here I have the

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.770 
girl tomato and over here I have the
Armenian<00:03:43.170> cucumbers<00:03:44.030> which<00:03:45.030> they<00:03:45.360> are<00:03:45.569> doing

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
Armenian cucumbers which they are doing

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.320 
Armenian cucumbers which they are doing
better<00:03:46.230> than<00:03:46.770> they<00:03:47.550> were<00:03:47.610> when<00:03:47.850> I<00:03:47.910> first<00:03:48.209> put

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
better than they were when I first put

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.860 
better than they were when I first put
him<00:03:48.420> in<00:03:48.510> here

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
him in here

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.420 
him in here
I<00:03:48.900> had<00:03:49.590> a<00:03:49.620> plant<00:03:50.100> issue<00:03:50.630> bug<00:03:51.630> issue<00:03:51.840> I<00:03:52.370> think<00:03:53.370> he

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
I had a plant issue bug issue I think he

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.770 
I had a plant issue bug issue I think he
was<00:03:53.640> earwigs<00:03:54.060> or<00:03:54.240> something<00:03:54.510> at<00:03:54.600> night

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
was earwigs or something at night

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.180 
was earwigs or something at night
because<00:03:55.080> I<00:03:55.230> never<00:03:55.350> saw<00:03:55.620> anything<00:03:55.860> during<00:03:56.100> the

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
because I never saw anything during the

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.640 
because I never saw anything during the
day<00:03:56.400> sprayed<00:03:57.330> it<00:03:57.450> with<00:03:57.480> a<00:03:57.600> liquid<00:03:57.870> soap<00:03:58.730> mix

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
day sprayed it with a liquid soap mix

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.059 
day sprayed it with a liquid soap mix
and<00:04:02.000> he<00:04:03.000> seemed<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.209> be<00:04:03.270> doing<00:04:03.480> a<00:04:03.510> lot<00:04:03.630> better

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
and he seemed to be doing a lot better

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.440 
and he seemed to be doing a lot better
this<00:04:05.069> one<00:04:05.310> always<00:04:05.489> always<00:04:05.760> been<00:04:05.970> doing<00:04:06.209> good

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
this one always always been doing good

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.910 
this one always always been doing good
so<00:04:06.720> it's<00:04:06.930> rolling<00:04:07.730> nicely<00:04:09.170> no<00:04:10.170> I'll<00:04:10.470> say<00:04:10.739> not

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
as fast as a hydroponics but it's still

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:20.289 
as fast as a hydroponics but it's still
going<00:04:14.360> so<00:04:15.360> let's<00:04:15.510> switch<00:04:15.750> over<00:04:15.989> to<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:17.100> other

concern<00:04:43.800> is<00:04:43.830> are<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.310> carrots<00:04:44.880> I<00:04:45.350> guess

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
concern is are the carrots I guess

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.840 
concern is are the carrots I guess
carrots<00:04:46.650> take<00:04:46.830> a<00:04:46.860> long<00:04:47.040> time<00:04:47.220> and<00:04:47.370> grow<00:04:47.550> but

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
carrots take a long time and grow but

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.330 
carrots take a long time and grow but
this<00:04:48.000> has<00:04:48.180> been<00:04:48.560> it's<00:04:49.560> been<00:04:49.710> four<00:04:49.950> weeks<00:04:50.190> now

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
this has been it's been four weeks now

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.670 
this has been it's been four weeks now
and<00:04:50.760> that's<00:04:51.690> as<00:04:51.870> high<00:04:52.020> as<00:04:52.050> the<00:04:52.229> carrot<00:04:52.560> of

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
and that's as high as the carrot of

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.200 
and that's as high as the carrot of
cotton<00:04:53.010> I'm<00:04:53.669> in<00:04:54.090> them<00:04:54.240> out<00:04:54.390> I<00:04:54.780> know<00:04:55.620> that<00:04:56.210> and

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
cotton I'm in them out I know that and

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:04.460 
cotton I'm in them out I know that and
over<00:04:57.390> here<00:04:57.600> we<00:04:57.720> got<00:05:00.200> onions<00:05:01.200> even<00:05:03.470> getting

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
over here we got onions even getting

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.659 
over here we got onions even getting
these<00:05:04.530> mushrooms<00:05:05.130> I<00:05:05.250> don't<00:05:05.400> know<00:05:05.460> if<00:05:05.550> they

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669

came<00:05:05.850> in<00:05:05.970> with<00:05:06.060> the<00:05:06.150> seeds<00:05:06.510> to<00:05:07.970> mulch<00:05:08.970> or<00:05:11.210> what

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
came in with the seeds to mulch or what

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.050 
came in with the seeds to mulch or what
I<00:05:12.360> think<00:05:12.540> in<00:05:12.630> mushrooms<00:05:13.290> popping<00:05:13.740> in<00:05:13.860> here
