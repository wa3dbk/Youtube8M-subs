well<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.260> we<00:01:10.439> kind<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.680> thought<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.860> we've

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
well and we kind of thought that we've

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.160 
well and we kind of thought that we've
gotten<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:11.939> much<00:01:12.119> from<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.390> community<00:01:12.900> but

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
gotten so much from the community but

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.170 
gotten so much from the community but

now it's our time to play that and

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.249 
now it's our time to play that and
that's<00:01:15.479> why<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.659> would<00:01:15.780> have<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.990> put<00:01:16.140> this

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.790 

well<00:03:09.460> first<00:03:10.450> of<00:03:10.570> all<00:03:10.690> like<00:03:10.840> for<00:03:11.470> us<00:03:11.560> I<00:03:11.770> think

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
well first of all like for us I think

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.740 
well first of all like for us I think
the<00:03:12.010> first<00:03:12.220> priority<00:03:12.520> is<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:13.300> always<00:03:13.480> has

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
the first priority is and always has

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.350 
the first priority is and always has
been<00:03:13.960> economy<00:03:14.740> each<00:03:15.160> new<00:03:15.460> players<00:03:15.700> we<00:03:15.940> have<00:03:16.120> so

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
been economy each new players we have so

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.970 
been economy each new players we have so
whatever<00:03:16.630> we<00:03:16.810> do<00:03:16.960> we<00:03:17.140> can<00:03:17.320> try<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.530> think<00:03:17.830> those

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
whatever we do we can try to think those

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.090 
whatever we do we can try to think those
people<00:03:18.520> first<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:19.770> that's<00:03:20.770> the<00:03:20.860> first

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
people first and that's the first

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.650 
people first and that's the first
priority<00:03:21.310> so<00:03:21.670> therefore<00:03:22.060> like<00:03:22.270> still<00:03:22.540> the

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
priority so therefore like still the

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.510 
priority so therefore like still the
most<00:03:22.840> of<00:03:23.020> the<00:03:23.080> investment<00:03:23.620> goes<00:03:24.220> to<00:03:24.430> the

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
most of the investment goes to the

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.190 
most of the investment goes to the
existing<00:03:25.210> games<00:03:25.390> and<00:03:25.660> just<00:03:25.840> making<00:03:26.020> them

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
existing games and just making them

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.900 
existing games and just making them
making<00:03:26.530> them<00:03:26.800> better<00:03:26.980> for<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.370> existing

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
making them better for the existing

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.520 
making them better for the existing
users<00:03:28.180> but<00:03:28.360> of<00:03:28.480> course<00:03:28.690> we<00:03:28.780> are<00:03:28.810> like

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
users but of course we are like

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.230
