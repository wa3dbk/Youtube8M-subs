00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.039
 hi very good people vctor 35 and good 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.500
 in this commented video I wanted 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.900
 and propose how 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.180
 as a new series of the channel that deals 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.520
 of 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.680
 I do not know yet the name exactly not 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.230
 I'm thinking but I want to try 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.260
 rare weapons for example here a 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.980
 Subscriber and friend told me with fabrics 16 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:39.090
 food by itself and look for 6 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.090
 silencer and live 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:46.190
 in a game then I took the game 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.340
 that then I do not know how I'm going to call 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:53.739
 the series but it 's just a fixed role in 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:56.390
 white 2 tell me you weird classes like 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.980
 like playing trying to play with weapons 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.680
 that you say to me for example in 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.220
 this case as it has been said the m16 is 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:08.420
 can you tell me the sv with a look 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.200
 by four and straight bolt although it is not 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.050
 rare but 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.090
 but it has gone to me to download something 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.409
 Well, although it is not rare but you can 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.689
 say for example I that the 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.390
 mixed 200 military victories but 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:28.810
 here not but for example the 60 that has 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.810
 sense with with look of x 8 and 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.940
 and me that according to and grip whatever 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.100
 the weapons that you tell me so good the 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.350
 video I do not know which part I do not know I think I 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.659
 I am more than two or almost two of ratio in 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.569
 this part plus two 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.490
 in this game the truth that happens a 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:50.399
 fucking weapon that I did not like or 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.759
 if the m16 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.340
 these accessories and flip in colors but 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.649
 but good even though I did not like it 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.649
 much the weapon or anything like that there is a 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.509
 decent half game so good 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.450
 I wanted to start with this series because 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.220
 that aguilar mÃ©ndez with the capturing 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.479
 I hope he's still letting a swim 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.269
 little more time now than to do 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.819
 this series I hope that you 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:18.660
 participate and tell me many weapons 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.700
 and you can tell in the comments 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.099
 of the video of this video can you tell me 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.650
 and say some kind and I'll put the 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:29.080
 start of the video the cut of the 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:32.560
 person who has told me and the gun 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.060
 and the games will be in live so 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.940
 I hope this proposal does not stay 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.450
 back and that you at least tell me in 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.989
 the video 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.800
 We took 2 minutes and 35 seconds almost 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:49.620
 videos are 756 and good the game the 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.110
 truth is that for me I was playing 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.349
 while I was with this one called 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.760
 Romans the two to call them and I was 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.900
 playing while he 's going with him and the 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.650
 I was telling him that I was 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.170
 a good game was coming out 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.280
 so good I have nothing else 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.569
 what to say I leave you with 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.030
 with the video 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.489
 since this is not a life I will leave with the 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.069
 video and next I'll talk live 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.189
 whole if it's crap about something like 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.530
 goal I'll talk about and if it's a gun crap 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:22.959
 that surely is telling me to tell me 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.090

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.020

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:37.220

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:40.160
 those other agreements and there was another 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.720
