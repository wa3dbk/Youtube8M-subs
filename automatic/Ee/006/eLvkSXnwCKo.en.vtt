00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
mechanism of turning on and off the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.000 
mechanism of turning on and off the
speakers<00:02:33.380> in<00:02:35.020> order<00:02:36.020> to<00:02:36.170> turn<00:02:36.410> it<00:02:36.560> on<00:02:36.709> you<00:02:36.950> just

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
speakers in order to turn it on you just

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.760 
speakers in order to turn it on you just
have<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:37.520> press<00:02:37.760> it<00:02:37.940> down<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:39.080> blue<00:02:39.260> LED

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
wheel it up if you want to turn it off

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.080 
wheel it up if you want to turn it off
you<00:02:42.350> just<00:02:42.620> have<00:02:42.739> to<00:02:42.860> press<00:02:43.040> it<00:02:43.190> down<00:02:43.220> again<00:02:43.820> and

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
you just have to press it down again and

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.500 
you just have to press it down again and
the<00:02:44.390> blue<00:02:44.540> LED<00:02:45.080> will<00:02:45.260> be<00:02:45.380> off<00:02:46.000> now<00:02:47.000> I'd<00:02:47.209> like<00:02:47.330> to

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
the blue LED will be off now I'd like to

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.750 
the blue LED will be off now I'd like to
talk<00:02:47.630> about<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:48.170> lighting<00:02:48.380> mods<00:02:48.770> the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
talk about the lighting mods the

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.430 
talk about the lighting mods the
lighting<00:02:50.090> modes<00:02:50.300> function<00:02:50.930> once<00:02:51.290> the

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
lighting modes function once the

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.340 
lighting modes function once the
speakers<00:02:51.860> are<00:02:52.070> power<00:02:52.280> on<00:02:52.959> basically<00:02:53.959> it<00:02:54.170> has

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
speakers are power on basically it has

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.390 
speakers are power on basically it has
two<00:02:54.620> conditions<00:02:55.220> one<00:02:55.630> USB<00:02:56.630> plug<00:02:57.050> in<00:02:57.400> second

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
two conditions one USB plug in second

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.449 
two conditions one USB plug in second
USB<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.180> plant<00:02:59.450> as<00:02:59.780> you<00:03:00.560> can<00:03:00.709> see<00:03:00.950> in<00:03:01.130> front<00:03:01.310> of

will not blinking move on to the second
condition<00:03:15.900> when<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:17.050> battery<00:03:17.350> is<00:03:17.380> in<00:03:17.560> use<00:03:17.980> it

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
condition when the battery is in use it

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.990 
condition when the battery is in use it
has<00:03:18.640> a<00:03:18.670> blue<00:03:19.380> LED<00:03:20.460> when<00:03:21.460> the<00:03:21.610> battery<00:03:21.970> has

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
has a blue LED when the battery has

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.800 
has a blue LED when the battery has
lesser<00:03:22.420> campus<00:03:22.930> and<00:03:23.110> charge<00:03:23.410> it<00:03:23.770> has<00:03:24.550> red<00:03:25.150> LED

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
lesser campus and charge it has red LED

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.620 
lesser campus and charge it has red LED
and<00:03:26.140> when<00:03:26.770> the<00:03:26.920> battery<00:03:27.220> is<00:03:27.250> depleted<00:03:27.580> it<00:03:28.360> has

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
and when the battery is depleted it has

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.740 
and when the battery is depleted it has
no<00:03:29.020> LED<00:03:29.620> lights<00:03:30.000> so<00:03:31.000> that's<00:03:31.240> all<00:03:31.450> for<00:03:31.660> the

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
no LED lights so that's all for the

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.860 
no LED lights so that's all for the
lighting<00:03:31.960> modes<00:03:33.150> so<00:03:34.150> now<00:03:34.300> I'd<00:03:34.420> like<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.600> talk

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
lighting modes so now I'd like to talk

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.800 
lighting modes so now I'd like to talk
about<00:03:35.110> the<00:03:35.230> pros<00:03:35.440> and<00:03:35.500> cons<00:03:35.980> of<00:03:36.100> the<00:03:36.250> speakers

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
about the pros and cons of the speakers

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.910 
about the pros and cons of the speakers
firstly<00:03:37.810> I<00:03:37.840> would<00:03:38.050> like<00:03:38.140> to<00:03:38.230> talk<00:03:38.560> about<00:03:38.680> the
