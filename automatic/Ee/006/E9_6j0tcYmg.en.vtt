00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.650
 hello girls that such birds for our 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.000
 next craft we will use 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.600
 what I have here in these 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.009
 crystals that I've already tired of seeing 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:21.770
 there and we are going to use what is the 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.970
 crystals these 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.250
 OK 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.710
 so I'll go in and take them out when we 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.449
 have prepared we see you well 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.989
 we are going to be the craft I have already taken 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.230
 all hospitals with good crystals 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.530
 it's like pasta, you can buy it in 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.769
 the all Chinese I imagine that in 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.019
 the decoration stores also go in 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:49.079
 small packages then to 60 or 70 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:51.840
 cents and in large bags about two 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.630
 euros two euros and something 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.150
 I'm going to take advantage of the ones I have 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.610
 in the cup for the moment has taken some 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.040
 how many are we going to need our 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.780
 glue gun 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:09.960
 and Christmas balls we are 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:13.050
 as it is is that they are damaged 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.210
 no longer serve but we will not throw them away 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.650
 We can take advantage of them to do 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.540
 Christmas centers or for something else 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.630
 good 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.310
 this is easy to remove because you know 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.280
 that this stands out a bit 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.650
 it just cuts it and it's cut very 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.480
 easy 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.780
 Well, what we are going to do is 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.400
 fill our crystal ball in 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.490
 text 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.220
 I'm going to start with the center 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.840
 best 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.840
 take our silicone 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.560
 and let's go 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.560
 putting our crystal 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:05.380
 it's easy if you leave gaps 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.380
 so better 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:19.720
 You see how it is staying 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.720
 and so we're going to fill everything 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.090
 and nothing I will continue to place 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.849
 you know why 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.920
 let's try 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.239
 complete the whole 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.690
 Well, I've already been half 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.130
 as you see 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.130
 and how it is staying 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:58.380
 in super easy and the effect is beautiful 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.650
 good girls, well, as you can see, it's almost 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:30.980
 almost almost 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.980
 finished there is no that is staying 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.980
 gorgeous 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.970
 the gothic silicone 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:57.379
 Well, we have already finished seeing it 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.930
 girls the balls I do not usually say 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.069
 before 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.180
 they do not work for the Christmas tree 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.659
 because once we put the 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:10.629
 crystals weigh a lot then like that 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:14.940
 we would throw the tree and well now I'm going to 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:19.840
 teach the ones that I have here made 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:23.860
 this is with the golden ball 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:27.310
 and this is with the blue ball is 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:31.030
 exactly the same as golden yellow and 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.400
 this ball in blue 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.200
 I was thinking that if you have to 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.540
 buy the crystals that you do not have 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.700
 at home the crystals are also in 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.460
 colors so if you put it underneath 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.170
 the balls for example is blue you 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.710
 you put the crystals in blue too 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:51.000
 It would be very cool it is very beautiful very 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:54.270
 pretty because this ball to be 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.870
 the silver ball, of course, look what 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:00.660
 Precious then nothing and good I love you 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:05.710
 say once you have your center 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:08.020
 for the decoration or I would place it 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.800
 can you have these strips in this case 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.220
 it would be for the blue 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.220
 Y 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:20.180
 in no 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:22.700
 you can also put 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.500
 hair this before 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.370
 hey 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.370
 who is coming 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:38.730
 for example if you put a plate 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:40.830
 and putting the ball is insane eyes 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:44.430
 your angel hair let's say the 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.230
 you make a bed and well I have here 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.430
 also that he had bought it for 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:52.560
 put it 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:55.030
 I had bought it for you 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.920
 if I had many holes left 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.920
 you can go putting him 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.350
 this 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.990
 the police 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:08.409
 but well I've seen that it stays very 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.689
 Well then , I'm not going to put them on 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:13.340
 but if you want to put it in a bowl 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:15.350
 it was up to that 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.010
 if for example you have the decoration in 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:22.729
 blue you can buy angel hair 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:26.690
 or you can also guide it, since each 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:29.070
 one to your imagination and decoration 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:32.910
 I have clear 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:36.950
 I 'm more or less idea this too 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.950
 I've taken it in case it 's not 

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:42.800
 it did not look good 

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:45.649
 then for the same to go putting 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:50.929
 this way if you want to complete more and 

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:54.280
 putting him well between the gaps guys and 

00:06:50.929 --> 00:06:56.680
 getting him guiding 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:07:01.440
 Well, this is also the same 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:04.980
 would be good to each 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.960
 do as I want to me personally 

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.090
 is that I am very simple very simple to 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.340
 the decoration 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.980
 I am very minimalist seems to concern 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:17.130
 and then he left her without putting 

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:20.310
 more nothing the only thing that does it equal 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:22.260
 an angel hair bed and place 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:26.670
 our balls 

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:30.200
 if I do not mean decoration so I do not 

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:32.460
 I would put nothing but good and each 

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:36.470
 so nothing, I hope that I have 

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.470
 liked our craft today 

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:42.490
 see you in the next girls goodbye
