00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.920
 following the video series is guitar and 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.440
 joão paulo today for people who are 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.570
 here is beginner not talking about it 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.710
 on power supply and 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.050
 properties I'll give some examples 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:23.029
 then back I think if the will of the 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:26.899
 pedal unless you buy a pedal is the 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.640
 photonics another electronic tag 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:32.090
 that comes from the side here is going to have 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.380
 nine goals until 18 laps to finish accepting 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.690
 this variation 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.210
 otherwise you will buy a thimble and note 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.210
 nine turns with a source 12 or take it there 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.190
 the beautiful funk a keyboard also reveal the 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.429
 mass source here from the 12 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.199
 volts will end up damaging the pedal 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:50.510
 to be the player in the hotel pedal again 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.190
 who bought the other thing then you have 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.679
 that if I call, I think it's more 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.749
 important right for you not to have pain 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:59.030
 head we can buy the fountain in the back 

00:00:56.749 --> 00:01:01.489
 access to very low contrast so 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:06.310
 how it will work to get the manual 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:08.930
 at the end of the form and I'll show here 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:14.560
 means take a look 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.560
 you have here the pedal consumption of the 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.979
 this is important in this case 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:30.729
 this is illegal stated the buffet both have 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.860
 a sleep of 3 million to 86 b is what 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.500
 happens in São José and the 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.659
 to the beaches is to take a course for 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.729
 use the pedal only to stay connected in the immense 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.539
 things that these values ​​do not even use 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.390
 right 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:46.210
 then you will have the higher the better not 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.700
 noticed the dry source the pedal consumes 8 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.149
 millions of people mean if they consumed 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:56.950
 10 my turn every hundred 100 amps was already going 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:02:00.250
 give you a call 10 pedals with umberto 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.789
 eco pedal but is much greater the 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.090
 have helped the source you end up at 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:09.399
 transformer dell ends up getting bigger and 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:13.720
 will pick up a 50-foot fountain in your 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:18.150
 work is going to be a path I did not 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:30.930
 because it has a source that the Fabian does 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:30.930
 head of São José dos Pinheiros in the 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:45.370
 round 1710 size is slightly larger than 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.859
 a good fan of charger source 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:52.269
 cell phone 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:55.239
 in this case the head 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:03:03.190
 one other here I am none of these 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:06.750
 funk marks but what does lyon do 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.350
 and he does these accounts 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.500
 interest does not wet a high price and 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.780
 quarantine 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.970
 Look, just back from the green wave. 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.210
 source of 300 thousand and ten if you want 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.390
 buy there for the short term is using 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.280
 only one pedal with 300 thousand for one pedal 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.400
 It's not going to give any problem. 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.560
 from the moment you start to 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.080
 buying more pedals should always be 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.080
 eyeing criminal consuming not only him 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.300
 the way it consumes 8 6 standing with the 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.300
 years and a few thousand 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.920
 more than 200 little then in this case here 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.870
 for a pedal to break a branch 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.540
 could use the source from that 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.760
 time you get get to buy 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.320
 more pedals when you turn on all the 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.470
 pieces and try you have to get a 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:59.310
 online manual and will make your 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.380
 Mother then you have six tolls going 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.170
 adding the sling 20 thousand gave another 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.780
 ten votes to 8 see if the sum does not pass 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.420
 that the temperament of your source of 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.070
 dwarf the sum of pedals that attended the 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.700
 at 300 my leg is already in the 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.859
 limit the conciliation of all criminal 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.940
 probably cracked or an effect 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.860
 it will not work then it's the process is 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.710
 simple is not easy to understand as 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:29.790
 it works and it's the tip if you want to look 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:33.210
 then on fd page they complain fd 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.100
 so check it out there you have this 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:46.500
 source I found it very cool release 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:53.010
 the mother of the little one she comes with several 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:55.650
 9 Battery Eliminator Adapters 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.740
 volts you want your pedal suddenly 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:02.760
 only have battery input do not like just 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:06.200
 Adapter has an adapter for 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:09.590
 input and the pedals 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.920
 The technical age pedals are given to us and 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.030
 other old pieces and entry to be 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.500
 like this here 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:22.790
 and here comes these female singers from 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:25.430
 hours rested 11.7 years remembered is 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.660
 recurring hell for you to stay 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.230
