00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.230
 in today's tutorial we will learn 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.169
 how to change a lock 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.180
 It is a lock on an interior door 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:18.340
 inside the house and the problem that 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.500
 we have is that as we see the knob is 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.860
 fallen the pier that has inside it 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.960
 it breaks and the slip does not fit 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:31.200
 in your site therefore if we try 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:33.960
 close the door the door told us 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.350
 to close it we would have to upload 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.330
 the knob and still she falls and 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.480
 it could be opened to us which is a 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.040
 little bother changing it is pretty 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.150
 simple then we 're going to have to 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.850
 to do is to remove the four screws 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.380
 who holds here the lock 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.330
 on this side the four screws that 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.620
 we have the other side and two screws 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:01.050
 that we are going to see now on the side 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.880
 We have already loosened the screws it 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.300
 now the only thing that we have left is the 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.300
 we remove 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.800
 and we are going to remove 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.760
 and we removed what would be the knob of the 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.760
 lock 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.720
 and we do the same from the other side 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.150
 we remove the four screws 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.450
 because this is the side where you have the 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.450
 latch 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.610
 We also regret 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.490
 the next thing we're going to have to do 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.200
 is going to be these two screws 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.619
 once we have loosened them 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.619
 we remove 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.799
 we help ourselves with the axis 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.619
 pulling here to get a 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.630
 little and when a 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.600
 we have to remove the shaft 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.049
 to be able to remove it since we already took it out 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.049
 outward 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.509
 outside we will be able to take out everything that is 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.850
 the lock 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.829
 well here we have the new lock to 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.340
 the left and the old one to the right of 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:13.519
 the difference what is it 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.700
 the old one fails us because the dock 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:19.760
 inside that has so much of both 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.400
 use it because it's enough you lose your 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.440
 properties and you have to change it equally 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.620
 that a shock absorber of a car with 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.390
 x time due to the cycles of the 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.459
 well, it goes away, we can go 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.330
 buy it easily by inserting the shaft that 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.160
 I opened the door we put it in the old man and 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.640
 we see that easily with the hand we can 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:45.080
 turn the shaft and slip the slip 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.080
 we try with the new 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.790
 and we find it impossible because of 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.159
 we say that the pier is new and 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.769
 it's a lot harder, that's why I do not know 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:57.599
 we will fall with the weight of the 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:00.250
 knob is not going to fall as we passed 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.500
 with the old lock 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.210
 here we have the old lock now 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.090
 that we have removed the two screws and 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.760
 we have opened it, this is inserted so 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.990
 remove the screws and here we have the 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.250
 interior the pier 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:19.590
 that creates resistance for us here 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.840
 ok and let's see that there is not 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.130
 lost only the properties but that 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.560
 is totally broken 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.730
 as we see is 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.730
 has opened here 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.310
 It's chipped and it's in two parts 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.760
 when it should be a piece the 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.760
 same pier 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.840
 we see that the springs to match these 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.730
 months is hard to find yes 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.620
 if you find it instead of 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.910
 change the whole lock you can 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.629
 change only this dock you turn it to 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.700
 put there and it would work perfectly in 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.709
 our case we have not found it and what 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.080
 What we have done is replace what 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.209
 would be the lock now we have opened 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.700
 the new lock and we see that it does not have 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:09.510
 nothing to see the pier that we have taken 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.900
 before it is one piece is worth only one 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.819
 piece and is in perfect condition not 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.630
 like this that we have taken before 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.859
 it was split into two sections 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.359
 another important thing that we have to 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:25.889
 times 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:28.229
 is the position of the slip if this is 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:32.460
 the part this will have to be looking 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:35.789
 always to the outside of the door 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:39.599
 since if here we have the stop this 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:41.340
 it has to come by the inclined part 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:43.199
 to get in and fit 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.790
 inside the door if we put it to 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:50.370
 backwards the door would not close 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.050
 we can easily change it if 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.260
 we from here take and throw towards 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.260
 outside 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.980
 we see we throw out is pretty 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.800
 hard 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:05.960
 we can turn it 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.960
 and change it in the other position 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.540
 and in that way we can without changing the 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.820
 whole lock just changing that 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.130
 then we can get the 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:20.000
 slip make your goal function and that 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:22.670
 inside the door frame is worth 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.870
 as we say the easiest thing pulling 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.570
 here is going to be a bit complicated if we 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:29.510
 is going to slide we push here in the part 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:32.630
 from behind with the lock removed 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.930
 because we see that pushing pushes 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.930
 this 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.350
 so we push from here we help each other 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.310
 the other hand 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.310
 and we turn it 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:47.599
 Now what are we going to have to do? 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:50.099
 to mount the lock is the same 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:52.919
 but with the opposite steps that we have 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:56.239
 done by disassembling it, we take our 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.239
 lock and we put it 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.370
 we put it well checking that it is 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.729
 well oiled 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:08.129
 I do not know what does not stand out 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:11.160
 ok here it looks very good what we have 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:14.689
 commented before the slip 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:18.799
 how we have put it out 

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:20.980
 when the door arrives and it would crash and get 

00:06:18.799 --> 00:06:23.230
 inward 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.090
 if we put it upside down said with the 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.740
 flat as not going to get to 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:30.210
 this and we had to turn it around what 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:33.199
 next thing we're going to do is 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.199
 put the shaft 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:39.350
 It also helps us to put it well 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:42.760
 lock and now let's put 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:45.630
 the screws that hold 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.630
 the new lock 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:07:00.330
 we no longer put the little take into account 

00:06:56.789 --> 00:07:02.430
 One thing if your lock has like 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.710
 the our bolt 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.900
 ok the head lock has to 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.900
 buy different since you have to have 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:12.230
 another hole for those who had the 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.230
 latch 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.310
 and we do the same with the outside part 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.770
 we have also put the crank by 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:31.050
 outside and as we see we have finished 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:33.460
 our 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:36.220
 perfectly our lock now 

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:38.990
 he knows that the knob is not off and 

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:43.130
 like when we 

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:45.920
 we activate it returns to its position 

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.780
 initial that we had fallen before 

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.110
 therefore the door has remained 

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.110
 open 

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.880
 good
