00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.930
 is that I bring you these days 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.590
 0.8 point one but good would download it 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.190
 it is not true 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.830
 as always and then I would leave the apk 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.309
 true good let's do the test 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:54.470
 once downloaded we will pass 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.840
 after the android not on the tablet 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.180
 cellular whatever in my case I already 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.540
 I have here the cell phone is going 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.200
 I'm going to create a new folder 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:09.800
 and for example I'm going to take you minecraft 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:13.850
 super addiction let's go in and as you see 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.230
 here then we are going to copy this version 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.630
 let's do the test with this is not 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.890
 true 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.890
 and what we do 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.670
 As you can see, there would be a certain 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.840
 ok now let's go to the cell phone and see 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.170
 how it is installed 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.039
 and well, we are already on the phone and 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:40.819
 as we did before then we passed the apk to 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:43.920
 the phone card so we're going to 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:46.470
 happen to go to our browser 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.049
 and to look for it in my case I had created 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.439
 a folder with minecraft as you see here 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.420
 is there 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.670
 and as you can see there is the installer as well 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.149
 that we're going to open it installer 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.149
 packages 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.600
 As you see here, it tells me that I already have a 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.869
 previous installed version but good the 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.050
 side install and install well now 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.690
 we come back as soon as I finish 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.990
 and good as you come here has already finished 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.470
 installed application and then you would have to 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.660
 give it done and then look for it in 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.490
 where they have everything installed not in 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.120
 the menu but good in this case we're going 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.120
 to put to open 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.480
 here 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.160
 good as you see here would already be here 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:48.750
 version and then we would give him play 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.750
 furniture of the world 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.260
 and good for example, it would be like 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.810
 come here this is too big to 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.470
 move the controls for that we will have 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:08.520
 that go to options 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.520
 options well let's go to the third 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.230
 a good moment well this here 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.550
 good excuse for that cut but good 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.850
 we are here in the second 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:30.720
 and then this here we will download it 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.720
 more or less out there 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:38.160
 because as you can see it is smaller, it is not 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.820
 true because nothing that leaves its criterion 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.850
 and to your liking and yes so nothing this 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.370
 it would be all as you see it is good that walk 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.980
 with the kitchen because it is already depends on your 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.100
 low device in the graphics 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.250
 etc 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.500
 so nothing this would be all I hope that 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.620
 you liked it in like if you want 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.920

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:07.690

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.690
