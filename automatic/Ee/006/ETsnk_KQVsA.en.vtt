liquids and and power through the

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.340 
liquids and and power through the
different<00:00:27.410> machineries<00:00:28.100> of<00:00:28.130> the<00:00:28.400> game<00:00:28.580> ah

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.350 
different machineries of the game ah

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.630 
different machineries of the game ah
let's<00:00:30.350> see<00:00:30.560> what's<00:00:30.890> coming<00:00:31.039> let's<00:00:31.520> get

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
let's see what's coming let's get

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.050 
let's see what's coming let's get
started<00:00:31.900> so<00:00:32.900> um<00:00:33.290> to<00:00:33.890> start<00:00:34.100> with<00:00:34.280> this<00:00:34.489> is<00:00:34.730> our

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.060 
started so um to start with this is our

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.430 
started so um to start with this is our
regular<00:00:35.810> on<00:00:36.610> our<00:00:37.610> ring<00:00:38.260> always<00:00:39.260> getting

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
regular on our ring always getting

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.800 
regular on our ring always getting
extracted<00:00:39.980> from<00:00:40.100> the<00:00:40.280> pump<00:00:40.489> here<00:00:41.000> and<00:00:41.180> getting

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:41.810 
extracted from the pump here and getting

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.470 
extracted from the pump here and getting
in<00:00:41.989> the<00:00:42.079> pipe<00:00:42.320> you<00:00:43.250> may<00:00:43.460> notice<00:00:43.880> that<00:00:43.910> the

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
in the pipe you may notice that the

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.569 
in the pipe you may notice that the
liquid<00:00:44.750> behave<00:00:45.350> a<00:00:45.380> little<00:00:45.530> bit<00:00:46.040> differently

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
liquid behave a little bit differently

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.470 
liquid behave a little bit differently
done<00:00:47.000> on<00:00:47.329> the<00:00:48.140> previous<00:00:48.530> releases<00:00:48.770> of<00:00:49.149> B<00:00:50.149> craft

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
done on the previous releases of B craft

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.650 
done on the previous releases of B craft
and<00:00:50.840> we'll<00:00:51.020> see<00:00:51.320> ah<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:52.940> exact<00:00:53.239> set<00:00:53.510> of

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
and we'll see ah the exact set of

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.200 
and we'll see ah the exact set of
changes<00:00:54.020> a<00:00:54.500> little<00:00:54.980> bit<00:00:55.160> later<00:00:55.489> so<00:00:56.000> let's

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
changes a little bit later so let's

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.110 
changes a little bit later so let's
first<00:00:56.570> are<00:00:57.020> for<00:00:57.590> this<00:00:57.739> pipe<00:00:58.040> and<00:01:00.579> see<00:01:01.579> where

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
first are for this pipe and see where

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.959 
first are for this pipe and see where
that<00:01:02.329> brings<00:01:02.719> us<00:01:06.009> okay<00:01:07.009> so<00:01:07.069> you<00:01:07.310> may<00:01:07.459> notice<00:01:07.789> as

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:07.969 
that brings us okay so you may notice as

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:09.899 
that brings us okay so you may notice as
well<00:01:08.179> that<00:01:08.450> the<00:01:08.600> pipes<00:01:08.840> look<00:01:09.139> little<00:01:09.469> bit

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
well that the pipes look little bit

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.929 
well that the pipes look little bit
different<00:01:11.469> now<00:01:12.469> there<00:01:12.799> is<00:01:12.889> going<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:13.249> be<00:01:13.280> three

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
different now there is going to be three

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.469 
different now there is going to be three
sets<00:01:14.539> of<00:01:14.780> pipes<00:01:15.469> dedicated<00:01:16.310> to<00:01:16.639> particular

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
sets of pipes dedicated to particular

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.590 
sets of pipes dedicated to particular
transportation<00:01:18.789> there's<00:01:19.789> going<00:01:19.999> to<00:01:20.090> be<00:01:20.119> pipes

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
transportation there's going to be pipes

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.099 
transportation there's going to be pipes
for<00:01:21.159> objects<00:01:22.159> for<00:01:22.310> items<00:01:22.749> which<00:01:23.749> is<00:01:23.990> the

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:24.109 
for objects for items which is the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:27.309 
for objects for items which is the
regular<00:01:24.409> ones<00:01:24.619> these<00:01:25.369> green<00:01:25.700> pipes<00:01:25.999> are<00:01:26.389> pipes

00:01:27.309 --> 00:01:27.319 
regular ones these green pipes are pipes

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:30.989 
regular ones these green pipes are pipes
that<00:01:27.950> are<00:01:28.279> used<00:01:28.759> to<00:01:28.909> transport<00:01:29.270> liquids<00:01:29.810> and

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:30.999 
that are used to transport liquids and

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:34.809 
that are used to transport liquids and
we'll<00:01:31.999> see<00:01:32.389> the<00:01:32.569> third<00:01:32.990> one<00:01:33.020> third<00:01:33.709> kind<00:01:34.549> a

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:34.819 
we'll see the third one third kind a

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:39.069 
we'll see the third one third kind a
little<00:01:34.969> bit<00:01:35.240> later<00:01:35.509> um<00:01:36.670> here<00:01:37.670> we<00:01:37.729> go<00:01:37.880> so<00:01:38.869> this

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
little bit later um here we go so this

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.129 
little bit later um here we go so this
um<00:01:39.590> pai<00:01:40.369> this<00:01:40.639> oil<00:01:40.880> ring<00:01:41.119> here<00:01:41.509> is<00:01:41.689> bringing

00:01:42.129 --> 00:01:42.139 
um pai this oil ring here is bringing

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:47.859 
um pai this oil ring here is bringing
oil<00:01:42.380> to<00:01:42.799> these<00:01:43.009> tanks<00:01:43.789> and<00:01:44.319> if<00:01:45.319> I<00:01:45.619> go<00:01:46.659> at<00:01:47.659> the

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
oil to these tanks and if I go at the

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.580 
oil to these tanks and if I go at the
bottom<00:01:48.259> you<00:01:48.380> can<00:01:48.529> see<00:01:48.649> that<00:01:49.039> there<00:01:49.880> are<00:01:50.590> wooden

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
bottom you can see that there are wooden

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.789 
bottom you can see that there are wooden
pipes<00:01:53.829> connected<00:01:54.829> to<00:01:54.950> these<00:01:55.039> tanks<00:01:55.729> ah<00:01:56.560> if<00:01:57.560> I

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
pipes connected to these tanks ah if I

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.459 
pipes connected to these tanks ah if I
activate<00:01:58.429> one<00:01:58.939> of<00:01:58.969> these<00:01:59.209> things<00:01:59.569> here<00:02:00.349> like

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
activate one of these things here like

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:05.080 
activate one of these things here like
so<00:02:01.039> I'm<00:02:01.549> going<00:02:01.909> to<00:02:01.969> extract<00:02:02.539> the<00:02:02.810> oil<00:02:02.840> from<00:02:04.090> the

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
so I'm going to extract the oil from the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.389 
so I'm going to extract the oil from the
tank<00:02:05.539> and<00:02:05.779> here<00:02:06.289> you<00:02:06.409> can<00:02:06.560> see<00:02:06.859> maybe<00:02:07.099> a<00:02:07.249> little

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
tank and here you can see maybe a little

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.140 
tank and here you can see maybe a little
bit<00:02:07.609> they're<00:02:07.789> different<00:02:08.330> in<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.570> model<00:02:08.990> um

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.150 
bit they're different in the model um

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.809 
bit they're different in the model um
once<00:02:11.150> again<00:02:11.270> liquid<00:02:11.780> has<00:02:12.050> been

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
once again liquid has been

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.449 
once again liquid has been
reviewed<00:02:13.480> now<00:02:13.930> it<00:02:14.799> doesn't<00:02:15.099> get<00:02:15.189> stuck

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
reviewed now it doesn't get stuck

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.319 
reviewed now it doesn't get stuck
anymore<00:02:15.730> in<00:02:16.329> the<00:02:16.510> pipes<00:02:16.749> even<00:02:17.650> small<00:02:17.920> amount

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
anymore in the pipes even small amount

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:23.399 
anymore in the pipes even small amount
can<00:02:19.329> can<00:02:19.870> be<00:02:20.019> carried<00:02:20.290> across<00:02:22.049> across<00:02:23.049> the<00:02:23.230> map

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
can can be carried across across the map

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:28.199 
can can be carried across across the map
and<00:02:24.010> we<00:02:24.609> follow<00:02:24.969> it<00:02:25.180> so<00:02:26.079> the<00:02:26.319> week<00:02:27.010> liquid<00:02:27.609> is

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
and we follow it so the week liquid is

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.089 
and we follow it so the week liquid is
going<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.629> get<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:29.230> go<00:02:29.349> all<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.590> way<00:02:29.739> through

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
going to get to go all the way through

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:36.449 
going to get to go all the way through
here<00:02:30.639> and<00:02:31.290> go<00:02:32.290> another<00:02:32.920> structure<00:02:33.549> here<00:02:35.099> if<00:02:36.099> we

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
here and go another structure here if we

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:43.409 
here and go another structure here if we
have<00:02:36.819> a<00:02:36.849> look<00:02:37.090> at<00:02:37.659> what's<00:02:38.019> coming<00:02:38.530> there<00:02:42.419> okay

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:43.419 
have a look at what's coming there okay

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:53.099 
have a look at what's coming there okay
so<00:02:44.109> here<00:02:44.409> comes<00:02:44.439> the<00:02:44.709> oil<00:02:45.069> underneath<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:52.109> oil

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109 
so here comes the oil underneath and oil

00:02:53.109 --> 00:03:01.259 
so here comes the oil underneath and oil
is<00:02:53.639> getting<00:02:56.639> on<00:02:57.639> the<00:02:57.879> top<00:02:58.180> there<00:02:58.810> and<00:03:00.269> it's

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
is getting on the top there and it's

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.189 
is getting on the top there and it's
going<00:03:01.629> to<00:03:02.669> fill<00:03:03.669> these<00:03:03.939> new<00:03:04.180> items<00:03:04.629> here<00:03:05.019> which

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:05.199 
going to fill these new items here which

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:11.550 
going to fill these new items here which
are<00:03:07.049> refineries<00:03:08.049> now<00:03:09.389> what<00:03:10.389> refineries<00:03:11.290> are

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
are refineries now what refineries are

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.759 
are refineries now what refineries are
going<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.129> do<00:03:12.340> is<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:14.370> convert<00:03:15.419> oil<00:03:16.419> into<00:03:17.349> fuel

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
going to do is to convert oil into fuel

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.710 
going to do is to convert oil into fuel
and<00:03:18.009> for<00:03:18.220> that<00:03:18.250> they<00:03:18.519> need<00:03:18.549> to<00:03:18.699> be<00:03:18.879> powered<00:03:19.359> and

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
and for that they need to be powered and

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.999 
and for that they need to be powered and
this<00:03:20.650> is<00:03:20.739> introducing<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:23.500> third<00:03:23.769> kind

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:24.009 
this is introducing the the third kind

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.659 
this is introducing the the third kind
of<00:03:24.299> pipe<00:03:25.299> that<00:03:25.989> is<00:03:26.109> available<00:03:26.199> here<00:03:26.949> which<00:03:27.489> is

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:27.669 
of pipe that is available here which is

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:30.839 
of pipe that is available here which is
this<00:03:27.909> red<00:03:28.840> thing<00:03:28.870> here<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:29.709> these<00:03:30.129> pipes<00:03:30.669> are

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
this red thing here and these pipes are

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.920 
this red thing here and these pipes are
going<00:03:31.419> to<00:03:31.689> allow<00:03:32.049> me<00:03:32.229> to<00:03:33.359> transport<00:03:34.359> power

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
going to allow me to transport power

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.050 
going to allow me to transport power
from<00:03:35.859> a<00:03:36.129> remote<00:03:36.549> engine<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:38.590> UM<00:03:38.889> any<00:03:39.459> location

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
from a remote engine to UM any location

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:48.270 
from a remote engine to UM any location
in<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.150> map<00:03:40.650> if<00:03:41.650> we<00:03:41.919> go<00:03:43.470> there<00:03:45.090> we've<00:03:46.090> got<00:03:47.280> some

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
in the map if we go there we've got some

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.509 
in the map if we go there we've got some
kind<00:03:48.879> of<00:03:49.919> power<00:03:50.919> plant<00:03:51.250> here<00:03:51.729> there<00:03:52.599> are<00:03:52.870> I

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
kind of power plant here there are I

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.439 
kind of power plant here there are I
guess<00:03:54.519> it's<00:03:54.699> 60<00:03:55.919> iren<00:03:56.919> engines<00:03:57.310> by<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:58.299> way

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:58.449 
guess it's 60 iren engines by the way

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:00.270 
guess it's 60 iren engines by the way
all<00:03:58.659> of<00:03:58.780> them<00:03:58.930> are<00:03:59.109> connected<00:03:59.919> through<00:03:59.949> this

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
all of them are connected through this

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.580 
all of them are connected through this
special<00:04:01.000> pipes<00:04:01.449> here<00:04:01.689> these<00:04:01.840> are<00:04:02.019> green<00:04:02.319> pipes

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
special pipes here these are green pipes

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.610 
special pipes here these are green pipes
so<00:04:02.979> they<00:04:03.099> transport<00:04:03.780> water<00:04:04.780> they'd<00:04:05.229> go<00:04:05.590> a

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
so they transport water they'd go a

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.729 
so they transport water they'd go a
little<00:04:05.829> bit<00:04:06.009> faster<00:04:06.219> than<00:04:06.810> other<00:04:07.810> ones<00:04:08.109> as<00:04:08.560> you

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
little bit faster than other ones as you

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.770 
little bit faster than other ones as you
may<00:04:08.889> guess<00:04:09.629> they<00:04:10.629> are<00:04:11.310> crafted<00:04:12.310> out<00:04:12.430> of<00:04:12.780> gold

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
may guess they are crafted out of gold

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.170 
may guess they are crafted out of gold
and<00:04:14.109> the<00:04:14.979> reason<00:04:15.250> why<00:04:15.370> I've<00:04:15.519> connected<00:04:15.819> these

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
and the reason why I've connected these

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.080 
and the reason why I've connected these
water<00:04:16.599> pipes<00:04:16.900> next<00:04:17.349> to<00:04:17.409> the<00:04:17.579> engines<00:04:18.579> is<00:04:18.789> that

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
water pipes next to the engines is that

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.539 
water pipes next to the engines is that
now<00:04:19.419> if<00:04:20.320> I<00:04:20.440> click<00:04:20.500> on<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:20.949> engine<00:04:21.250> I've<00:04:21.370> got

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
now if I click on the engine I've got

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.200 
now if I click on the engine I've got
two<00:04:22.380> tanks<00:04:23.380> there<00:04:23.889> is<00:04:23.979> the<00:04:24.099> coolant<00:04:24.550> tank

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
two tanks there is the coolant tank

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.559 
two tanks there is the coolant tank
and<00:04:25.300> the<00:04:25.660> fuel<00:04:26.259> tank<00:04:27.330> actually<00:04:28.330> there's<00:04:28.449> no

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:28.569 
and the fuel tank actually there's no

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:32.189 
and the fuel tank actually there's no
fuel<00:04:28.810> on<00:04:28.870> this<00:04:29.050> one<00:04:29.460> but<00:04:30.460> I<00:04:30.699> can<00:04:30.940> go<00:04:31.199> somewhere

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
fuel on this one but I can go somewhere

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
that's 10 and let's get some extra ones

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.159 
that's 10 and let's get some extra ones
just<00:05:04.150> to<00:05:04.300> get<00:05:04.449> a<00:05:04.479> stronger<00:05:05.849> stream<00:05:06.849> of<00:05:06.970> energy

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
just to get a stronger stream of energy

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.140 
just to get a stronger stream of energy
and<00:05:08.169> you<00:05:08.320> can<00:05:08.470> see<00:05:08.740> here<00:05:09.280> in<00:05:09.370> the<00:05:09.460> middle<00:05:09.759> on

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
and you can see here in the middle on

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.860 
and you can see here in the middle on
you<00:05:11.020> can<00:05:11.259> actually<00:05:11.710> see<00:05:11.949> the<00:05:12.580> energy<00:05:13.000> going

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
you can actually see the energy going

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.409 
you can actually see the energy going
from<00:05:14.800> the<00:05:15.160> engines<00:05:15.580> and<00:05:16.060> getting

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
from the engines and getting

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.040 
from the engines and getting
concentrated<00:05:16.780> on<00:05:17.409> the<00:05:17.919> pipes<00:05:18.190> are<00:05:19.050> to

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
concentrated on the pipes are to

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:27.059 
concentrated on the pipes are to
eventually<00:05:21.030> be<00:05:22.030> send<00:05:23.400> through<00:05:24.400> here<00:05:25.259> all<00:05:26.259> the

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:27.069 
eventually be send through here all the

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:29.790 
eventually be send through here all the
way<00:05:27.099> to<00:05:27.310> the<00:05:27.789> refineries<00:05:28.569> which<00:05:29.229> are<00:05:29.470> now

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
way to the refineries which are now

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.879 
way to the refineries which are now
operating<00:05:30.570> and<00:05:31.570> since<00:05:31.840> they<00:05:32.020> are<00:05:32.080> operating

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
operating and since they are operating

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:37.320 
operating and since they are operating
they<00:05:33.190> are<00:05:33.990> converting<00:05:35.310> refining<00:05:36.310> the<00:05:36.639> oil

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
they are converting refining the oil

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.010 
they are converting refining the oil
that<00:05:37.900> has<00:05:38.020> been<00:05:38.229> sent<00:05:38.470> to<00:05:38.650> them<00:05:38.800> into<00:05:39.490> arm<00:05:40.180> into

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
that has been sent to them into arm into

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.689 
that has been sent to them into arm into
fuel<00:05:41.469> and<00:05:41.800> see<00:05:42.039> that<00:05:42.219> there's<00:05:42.400> a<00:05:42.460> little

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:42.699 
fuel and see that there's a little

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.749 
fuel and see that there's a little
stream<00:05:43.120> of<00:05:43.240> fuel<00:05:43.570> getting<00:05:44.440> out<00:05:44.710> of<00:05:44.860> it<00:05:44.949> which

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:45.759 
stream of fuel getting out of it which

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:50.550 
stream of fuel getting out of it which
gets<00:05:46.180> gather<00:05:46.479> in<00:05:47.020> the<00:05:47.259> pipe<00:05:47.680> over<00:05:47.949> here<00:05:48.400> and<00:05:49.560> if

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
gets gather in the pipe over here and if

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.990 
gets gather in the pipe over here and if
you<00:05:50.800> follow<00:05:51.539> this<00:05:52.539> pipe<00:05:54.150> let's<00:05:55.150> see<00:05:55.449> that<00:05:55.750> it's
