00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
and scions and it's frankly embarrassing

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.699 
and scions and it's frankly embarrassing
you<00:02:28.820> know<00:02:28.940> so<00:02:29.450> why<00:02:29.750> we<00:02:29.930> didn't<00:02:30.170> we<00:02:30.260> never<00:02:30.470> went

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
you know so why we didn't we never went

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.310 
you know so why we didn't we never went
back<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.190> finish<00:02:31.760> that<00:02:31.940> part<00:02:32.239> of<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.480> trip<00:02:32.750> no

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.620 
back and finish that part of the trip no
we<00:02:33.560> didn't<00:02:33.920> because<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.000> edge<00:02:35.120> probably

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
we didn't because the edge probably

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.020 
we didn't because the edge probably
could<00:02:35.750> have<00:02:35.810> done<00:02:35.870> that<00:02:36.110> without<00:02:36.440> sanding

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
could have done that without sanding

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.200 
could have done that without sanding
exactly<00:02:37.960> so<00:02:38.200> so<00:02:38.740> the<00:02:39.340> question<00:02:39.730> is<00:02:39.910> I<00:02:40.150> don't

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
exactly so so the question is I don't

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.060 
exactly so so the question is I don't
have<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.660> err<00:02:40.840> on<00:02:40.870> in<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.500> edge<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:41.890> gone<00:02:42.040> up

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
have to err on in the edge and gone up

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.290 
have to err on in the edge and gone up
that<00:02:42.400> right<00:02:43.710> so<00:02:44.710> I<00:02:44.740> don't<00:02:45.250> understand<00:02:45.910> what

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
that right so I don't understand what

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.420 
that right so I don't understand what
what<00:02:46.720> what<00:02:46.990> is<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.640> key<00:02:49.050> you<00:02:50.050> know<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:51.190> speak
