side you see I'm moving my left foot
pivoting<00:00:42.630> with<00:00:42.840> my<00:00:42.989> right<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.470> you<00:00:43.530> got<00:00:43.710> of

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
pivoting with my right so you got of

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.170 
pivoting with my right so you got of
course<00:00:44.130> you<00:00:44.250> got<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.489> keep<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.670> pivot<00:00:45.149> foot

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
course you got to keep that pivot foot

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.420 
course you got to keep that pivot foot
down<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.720> start<00:00:45.960> your<00:00:46.200> dribble<00:00:46.530> keep<00:00:47.220> that

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
down you start your dribble keep that

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.250 
down you start your dribble keep that
dribble<00:00:47.670> though<00:00:47.910> try<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.210> keep<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.660> neat

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
dribble though try to keep it neat

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.830 
dribble though try to keep it neat
height<00:00:49.500> if<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.950> can<00:00:50.250> at<00:00:50.880> least<00:00:50.940> below<00:00:51.690> the

waist below the hips crossover so you

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.030 
waist below the hips crossover so you
see<00:00:54.720> almost<00:00:54.899> step<00:00:55.290> with<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.559> right<00:00:55.800> foot

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040

see almost step with that right foot
cross<00:00:56.340> over<00:00:56.760> then<00:00:56.910> with<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.180> spin<00:00:57.420> when<00:00:58.290> I

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
cross over then with that spin when I

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.930 
cross over then with that spin when I
take<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> spin<00:00:58.950> move<00:00:59.100> if<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.399> want<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.670> get<00:00:59.790> to

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940

that<00:01:30.960> big<00:01:31.260> step<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.770> what<00:01:31.950> gets<00:01:32.159> me<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.729> rim

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
that big step is what gets me to the rim

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.520 
that big step is what gets me to the rim
if<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.330> was<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.570> make<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.869> stuff<00:01:34.080> a<00:01:34.140> little<00:01:34.409> bit

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
if I was to make that stuff a little bit

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.340 
if I was to make that stuff a little bit
more<00:01:34.860> shallow<00:01:35.189> or<00:01:35.909> tighter<00:01:36.360> then<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.110> probably

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
more shallow or tighter then I probably

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.350 
more shallow or tighter then I probably
be<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.619> position<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:38.130> take<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> short<00:01:38.820> shot<00:01:39.119> or

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
be in a position to take a short shot or

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.120 
be in a position to take a short shot or
even<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.720> jump<00:01:39.990> shot<00:01:40.200> when<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.470> do<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.710> spin<00:01:40.979> move

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
even a jump shot when I do the spin move

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.740 
even a jump shot when I do the spin move
for<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.430> jump<00:01:41.670> shot<00:01:41.729> when<00:01:42.420> we<00:01:42.540> demonstrate

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
for the jump shot when we demonstrate

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.690 
for the jump shot when we demonstrate
and<00:01:43.350> moving<00:01:43.650> to<00:01:43.770> finish<00:01:44.100> spin<00:01:44.310> move<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.610> the

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
and moving to finish spin move in the

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.609 
and moving to finish spin move in the
jump<00:01:44.939> shot<00:01:45.150> is<00:01:45.299> how<00:01:45.600> deep<00:01:45.900> of<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.170> step<00:01:46.439> you

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
jump shot is how deep of a step you

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.859 
jump shot is how deep of a step you
decide<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.189> take<00:01:47.400> when<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.119> do<00:01:48.330> the<00:01:48.509> actual

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
decide to take when you do the actual

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.560 
decide to take when you do the actual
spin<00:01:49.229> move<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:50.400> the<00:01:50.610> thumbs<00:01:50.850> up<00:01:51.030> button<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.390> like

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570
