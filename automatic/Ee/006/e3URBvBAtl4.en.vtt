of give this a listen I'm using a PRS
513<00:01:40.420> today<00:01:40.690> and<00:01:40.959> I<00:01:41.200> like<00:01:41.440> that<00:01:41.619> because<00:01:41.979> it's

513 today and I like that because it's

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.550 
513 today and I like that because it's
single<00:01:42.579> coil<00:01:42.909> and<00:01:43.180> humbucker<00:01:43.570> so<00:01:43.899> can<00:01:44.380> show<00:01:44.530> a

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
single coil and humbucker so can show a

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.590 
single coil and humbucker so can show a
little<00:01:44.680> more<00:01:44.860> range<00:01:45.130> of<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.369> amp<00:01:45.549> so<00:01:45.789> now<00:01:46.270> I'm

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
little more range of the amp so now I'm

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.499 
little more range of the amp so now I'm
on<00:01:46.869> the<00:01:47.200> single<00:01:47.799> coil<00:01:48.100> setting<00:01:48.610> on<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:48.909> 513

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
on the single coil setting on the 513

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.690 
on the single coil setting on the 513
and<00:01:49.719> I<00:01:50.170> got<00:01:50.289> a<00:01:50.320> clean<00:01:50.530> setting<00:01:51.039> on<00:01:51.310> here<00:01:51.640> and

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
and I got a clean setting on here and

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.340 
and I got a clean setting on here and
you<00:01:51.789> can<00:01:51.820> see<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.119> gain<00:01:52.329> is<00:01:52.479> about<00:01:52.689> halfway<00:01:52.930> up

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
you can see the gain is about halfway up

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.319 
you can see the gain is about halfway up
and<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:54.310> volume<00:01:54.640> is<00:01:54.670> still<00:01:54.789> kind<00:01:55.090> of<00:01:55.180> low

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
and the volume is still kind of low

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.420 
and the volume is still kind of low
because<00:01:55.630> this<00:01:55.840> thing<00:01:56.049> is<00:01:56.079> really<00:01:56.380> loud<00:01:56.680> I<00:01:56.950> know

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
because this thing is really loud I know

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.920 
because this thing is really loud I know
I've<00:01:57.640> already<00:01:57.729> said<00:01:58.090> that<00:01:58.119> but<00:01:58.299> I'm<00:01:58.689> not

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
I've already said that but I'm not

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.890 
I've already said that but I'm not
kidding<00:01:59.259> this<00:01:59.439> thing's<00:01:59.619> really<00:01:59.859> loud

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:13.319 

you

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.329 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:15.309 

even<00:02:14.329> when<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:14.540> turn<00:02:14.719> the<00:02:14.840> gain<00:02:14.989> up<00:02:15.019> on<00:02:15.230> the

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
even when you turn the gain up on the

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.020 
even when you turn the gain up on the
clean<00:02:15.499> channel<00:02:15.829> it<00:02:15.920> doesn't<00:02:16.219> really<00:02:16.579> break<00:02:16.819> up

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
clean channel it doesn't really break up

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.479 
clean channel it doesn't really break up
that<00:02:17.060> much<00:02:17.389> in<00:02:17.599> fact<00:02:17.980> let's<00:02:18.980> listen<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.400> it

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
that much in fact let's listen to it

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:29.149 
that much in fact let's listen to it
with<00:02:19.609> the<00:02:19.700> gain<00:02:19.849> all<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.090> way<00:02:20.209> up

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.280 

just<00:02:30.159> got<00:02:30.310> a<00:02:30.340> little<00:02:30.640> bit<00:02:30.940> of<00:02:31.060> dirt<00:02:31.239> on<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.599> so

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
just got a little bit of dirt on it so

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.869 
just got a little bit of dirt on it so
there's<00:02:32.590> really<00:02:32.799> a<00:02:32.920> surprising<00:02:33.610> amount<00:02:33.700> of

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
there's really a surprising amount of

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.330 
there's really a surprising amount of
versatility<00:02:34.330> in<00:02:34.569> channel<00:02:35.019> 2<00:02:35.049> that's<00:02:35.799> one<00:02:36.250> of

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
versatility in channel 2 that's one of

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.500 
versatility in channel 2 that's one of
my<00:02:36.400> favorite<00:02:36.730> things<00:02:36.879> about<00:02:36.970> this<00:02:37.269> amp

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
my favorite things about this amp

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.449 
my favorite things about this amp
actually<00:02:37.930> we're<00:02:38.860> going<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.040> start<00:02:39.280> with<00:02:39.400> the

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
actually we're going to start with the

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.360 
actually we're going to start with the
gain<00:02:39.670> down<00:02:39.879> kind<00:02:40.180> of<00:02:40.239> low<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:41.890> know<00:02:42.010> fine

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
gain down kind of low and you know fine

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.729 
gain down kind of low and you know fine
roughly<00:02:42.849> the<00:02:42.970> same<00:02:43.180> about<00:02:44.140> as<00:02:44.260> loud<00:02:44.379> as<00:02:44.530> we<00:02:44.650> can

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
roughly the same about as loud as we can

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.509 
roughly the same about as loud as we can
take<00:02:44.890> it<00:02:44.950> in<00:02:45.129> this<00:02:45.190> little<00:02:45.519> room<00:02:46.290> so<00:02:47.400> check<00:02:48.400> it

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
take it in this little room so check it

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:49.530 
take it in this little room so check it
out<00:02:48.579> with<00:02:48.730> a<00:02:48.760> lower<00:02:48.940> amount<00:02:49.090> of<00:02:49.329> gain

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
out with a lower amount of gain

00:02:49.540 --> 00:03:15.940 
out with a lower amount of gain
humbucker<00:02:50.440> mode<00:02:50.560> going<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.879> neck<00:02:52.480> pickup

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.900 

so<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.040> can<00:03:17.160> see<00:03:17.310> it's<00:03:17.460> really<00:03:17.670> touch

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
so you can see it's really touch

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.760 
so you can see it's really touch
sensitive<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:18.860> very<00:03:19.860> versatile<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:21.770> check

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
sensitive and very versatile and check

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:23.420 
sensitive and very versatile and check
this<00:03:22.920> out

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
this out

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.730 
this out
a<00:03:23.460> little<00:03:23.790> more<00:03:23.940> gain<00:03:24.500> gets<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.590> little

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
a little more gain gets a little

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:40.470 
a little more gain gets a little
grittier

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:49.430 

you

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.570 

still<00:03:50.440> cleans<00:03:50.710> up<00:03:50.860> with<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.070> volume<00:03:51.400> knob

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
still cleans up with the volume knob

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.180 
still cleans up with the volume knob
super<00:03:52.240> responsive<00:03:52.930> so<00:03:53.740> a<00:03:53.770> higher<00:03:53.980> gain

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
super responsive so a higher gain

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.850 
super responsive so a higher gain
setting<00:03:54.610> on<00:03:54.700> channel<00:03:55.060> 2<00:03:55.470> again<00:03:56.470> it<00:03:56.650> still

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
setting on channel 2 again it still

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.560 
setting on channel 2 again it still
cleans<00:03:57.160> up<00:03:57.340> pretty<00:03:57.520> good<00:03:57.610> but<00:03:57.970> its<00:03:58.150> massive

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
cleans up pretty good but its massive

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:21.450 
cleans up pretty good but its massive
overdrive<00:03:59.320> check<00:03:59.710> it<00:03:59.830> out

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:21.460 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.470 

so<00:04:22.460> I<00:04:22.490> haven't<00:04:22.670> really<00:04:22.970> talked<00:04:23.180> about<00:04:23.270> the

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
so I haven't really talked about the

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.880 
so I haven't really talked about the
tone<00:04:23.660> controls<00:04:24.020> that<00:04:24.200> much<00:04:24.350> so<00:04:24.500> let's<00:04:24.620> kind<00:04:24.860> of

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
tone controls that much so let's kind of

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.670 
tone controls that much so let's kind of
get<00:04:25.010> into<00:04:25.190> that<00:04:25.280> each<00:04:26.060> channel<00:04:26.450> has<00:04:26.750> a<00:04:26.780> low<00:04:27.320> mid

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
get into that each channel has a low mid

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.040 
get into that each channel has a low mid
and<00:04:27.710> high<00:04:27.920> and<00:04:28.400> there's<00:04:28.880> a<00:04:28.970> master<00:04:29.510> presence

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
and high and there's a master presence

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.080 
and high and there's a master presence
and<00:04:30.260> a<00:04:30.410> master<00:04:30.800> resonance<00:04:31.280> control<00:04:31.730> the

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
and a master resonance control the

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.370 
and a master resonance control the
residence<00:04:32.480> control<00:04:32.780> is<00:04:32.870> actually<00:04:32.990> on<00:04:33.320> the

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
residence control is actually on the

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.860 
residence control is actually on the
back<00:04:33.560> and<00:04:33.950> it<00:04:34.370> controls<00:04:34.790> the<00:04:35.060> low<00:04:35.390> end<00:04:35.660> but

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
back and it controls the low end but

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.120 
back and it controls the low end but
let's<00:04:36.080> just<00:04:36.200> give<00:04:36.350> it<00:04:36.380> a<00:04:36.470> listen<00:04:36.590> here<00:04:36.770> on

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
let's just give it a listen here on

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.800 
let's just give it a listen here on
channel<00:04:37.580> let's<00:04:37.820> listen<00:04:38.060> on<00:04:38.150> channel<00:04:38.450> 2

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:05:17.340 

you

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.690 

you<00:05:18.350> can<00:05:18.500> see<00:05:18.650> the<00:05:18.770> resonance<00:05:19.190> control<00:05:19.550> is

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
you can see the resonance control is

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.300 
you can see the resonance control is
really<00:05:20.090> dramatic<00:05:20.560> yeah<00:05:21.560> there's<00:05:21.740> a<00:05:21.830> lot<00:05:22.190> of

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
really dramatic yeah there's a lot of

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.640 
really dramatic yeah there's a lot of
really<00:05:22.640> nice<00:05:22.880> Pro<00:05:23.420> features<00:05:23.870> on<00:05:24.080> the<00:05:24.200> back

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
really nice Pro features on the back

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.020 
really nice Pro features on the back
panel<00:05:25.040> back<00:05:25.070> here

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
panel back here

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.120 
panel back here
there's<00:05:26.300> parallel<00:05:26.780> speaker<00:05:27.140> out<00:05:27.320> which

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
there's parallel speaker out which

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.770 
there's parallel speaker out which
allows<00:05:28.430> you<00:05:28.640> to<00:05:28.670> run<00:05:28.910> an<00:05:29.060> extra<00:05:29.180> cabinet<00:05:29.690> if

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
allows you to run an extra cabinet if

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.000 
allows you to run an extra cabinet if
you<00:05:29.870> want<00:05:30.050> always<00:05:30.350> keep<00:05:30.530> the<00:05:30.680> ohm<00:05:30.800> load

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
you want always keep the ohm load

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.040 
you want always keep the ohm load
correct<00:05:31.430> on<00:05:31.580> the<00:05:31.670> amp<00:05:31.880> there's<00:05:32.690> an<00:05:32.780> impedance

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
correct on the amp there's an impedance

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.710 
correct on the amp there's an impedance
which<00:05:33.410> you<00:05:33.590> got<00:05:33.680> 16<00:05:34.130> 8<00:05:34.370> 4<00:05:34.400> ohms<00:05:34.910> and<00:05:35.240> the

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
which you got 16 8 4 ohms and the

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.030 
which you got 16 8 4 ohms and the
resonance<00:05:36.080> control<00:05:36.530> which<00:05:36.710> you<00:05:36.830> heard

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.040 
resonance control which you heard

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.000 
resonance control which you heard
there's<00:05:37.730> a<00:05:37.850> preamp<00:05:38.540> out<00:05:38.750> which<00:05:39.350> is<00:05:39.560> obviously

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
there's a preamp out which is obviously

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.130 
there's a preamp out which is obviously
just<00:05:40.310> off<00:05:40.460> the<00:05:40.610> preamp<00:05:41.030> so<00:05:41.210> you<00:05:41.300> can<00:05:41.630> process

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
just off the preamp so you can process

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.500 
just off the preamp so you can process
that<00:05:42.560> any<00:05:42.740> way<00:05:42.920> you<00:05:42.950> want<00:05:43.280> there's<00:05:43.880> an<00:05:44.120> effects

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
that any way you want there's an effects

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.490 
that any way you want there's an effects
loop<00:05:44.600> and<00:05:45.100> there<00:05:46.100> is<00:05:46.250> a<00:05:46.370> footswitch<00:05:46.820> jack<00:05:47.500> for

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
loop and there is a footswitch jack for

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.930 
loop and there is a footswitch jack for
the<00:05:48.530> included<00:05:48.980> foot<00:05:49.190> switch<00:05:49.430> which<00:05:49.640> allows

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
the included foot switch which allows

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.820 
the included foot switch which allows
you<00:05:50.120> to<00:05:50.240> change<00:05:50.420> channels<00:05:50.960> and<00:05:51.140> there's<00:05:51.770> a

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
you to change channels and there's a

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.710 
you to change channels and there's a
MIDI<00:05:52.070> in<00:05:52.310> which<00:05:52.640> will<00:05:52.790> also<00:05:53.120> do<00:05:53.360> all<00:05:53.570> the

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
MIDI in which will also do all the

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.740 
MIDI in which will also do all the
channel<00:05:54.080> changes<00:05:54.530> through<00:05:55.490> MIDI<00:05:55.730> there's<00:05:56.690> a

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
channel changes through MIDI there's a

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.120 
channel changes through MIDI there's a
couple<00:05:56.960> other<00:05:57.140> features<00:05:57.530> that<00:05:57.560> are<00:05:57.740> really

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
couple other features that are really

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.340 
couple other features that are really
worth<00:05:58.310> mentioning<00:05:58.660> one<00:05:59.660> is<00:05:59.780> the<00:05:59.930> headphone

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
worth mentioning one is the headphone

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.770 
worth mentioning one is the headphone
output<00:06:00.860> as<00:06:01.100> long<00:06:01.700> as<00:06:01.820> you<00:06:01.910> have<00:06:02.210> the<00:06:02.510> correct

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
output as long as you have the correct

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.900 
output as long as you have the correct
