showing<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.939> with<00:01:15.210> these<00:01:15.360> components<00:01:16.080> first

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
showing you with these components first

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.460 
showing you with these components first
of<00:01:17.040> all<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:18.000> man<00:01:18.240> will<00:01:18.420> take<00:01:18.570> three<00:01:19.020> forward

steps walk walk sit forward side and

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.359 
steps walk walk sit forward side and
then<00:01:27.590> closes<00:01:28.590> do<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.729> again<00:01:32.150> walk<00:01:33.150> walk

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
then closes do that again walk walk

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.060 
then closes do that again walk walk
forward<00:01:35.369> side<00:01:35.790> close<00:01:36.829> now<00:01:37.829> I'm<00:01:37.890> going<00:01:38.009> to

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
forward side close now I'm going to

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.980 
forward side close now I'm going to
demonstrate<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:38.909> because<00:01:39.270> there's<00:01:39.479> there's

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
demonstrate this because there's there's

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.660 
demonstrate this because there's there's
something<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:41.040> we're<00:01:41.159> going<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.340> be<00:01:41.460> doing

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
something that we're going to be doing

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.910 
something that we're going to be doing
here<00:01:41.970> that's<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.420> little<00:01:42.810> different<00:01:43.079> we're

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
here that's a little different we're

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.620 
here that's a little different we're
going<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.100> be<00:01:44.250> taking<00:01:44.670> two<00:01:44.880> or<00:01:44.909> three<00:01:45.210> walking

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
going to be taking two or three walking

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.080 
going to be taking two or three walking
steps<00:01:45.899> walk<00:01:46.640> walk<00:01:48.140> forward<00:01:49.140> side<00:01:49.950> now<00:01:50.759> as<00:01:50.939> we

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
steps walk walk forward side now as we

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.700 
steps walk walk forward side now as we
close<00:01:51.390> our<00:01:51.689> feet<00:01:51.990> we're<00:01:52.200> actually<00:01:52.380> going<00:01:52.619> to

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
close our feet we're actually going to

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.859 
close our feet we're actually going to
close<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.250> feet<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:53.820> not<00:01:54.090> switch<00:01:54.570> weight

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
close the feet but not switch weight

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.590 
close the feet but not switch weight
that's<00:01:55.590> important<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.460> sometimes<00:01:57.119> we<00:01:57.299> count

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
that's important and sometimes we count

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.530 
that's important and sometimes we count
this<00:01:58.009> by<00:01:59.009> spelling<00:01:59.490> out<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.640> word<00:01:59.909> tango<00:02:00.360> it

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
this by spelling out the word tango it

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:08.389 
this by spelling out the word tango it
goes<00:02:00.659> like<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.340> T<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:04.430> ng<00:02:05.430> o<00:02:06.469> and<00:02:07.469> remember<00:02:08.250> we

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
goes like this T a ng o and remember we

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.249 
goes like this T a ng o and remember we
don't<00:02:08.610> change<00:02:08.910> weight<00:02:09.179> on<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.629> o<00:02:09.660> we<00:02:10.020> just

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
don't change weight on the o we just

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.230 
don't change weight on the o we just
pull<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.649> foot<00:02:10.860> in<00:02:11.599> T

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
pull the foot in T

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.900 
pull the foot in T
a<00:02:14.370> ng<00:02:15.370> oh<00:02:15.780> if<00:02:16.780> we<00:02:17.560> use<00:02:17.770> counts<00:02:18.430> it<00:02:18.580> would<00:02:18.730> be

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
a ng oh if we use counts it would be

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.960 
a ng oh if we use counts it would be
slow<00:02:19.630> slow<00:02:20.110> quick<00:02:20.830> quick<00:02:20.860> slow<00:02:21.160> slow<00:02:22.290> slow

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
quick quick slow and we don't shift

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.690 
quick quick slow and we don't shift
weight<00:02:28.090> on<00:02:28.360> that<00:02:28.420> slow<00:02:29.290> now<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.560> lady<00:02:29.860> is

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
weight on that slow now the lady is

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.060 
weight on that slow now the lady is
going<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:31.750> be<00:02:31.810> doing<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.140> natural<00:02:32.320> opposite

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
going to be doing the natural opposite
