sturdier I prefer the design and
materials<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.939> were<00:01:48.060> used<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:48.899> case

leads<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.530> thermocouple<00:01:56.689> very<00:01:57.689> similar

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
leads and the thermocouple very similar

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.440 
leads and the thermocouple very similar
there<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:59.700> it's<00:02:00.450> got<00:02:00.570> padded<00:02:01.079> padded<00:02:01.829> inside

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450

going to be the size you mean this one

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.580 
going to be the size you mean this one
is<00:02:18.280> significantly<00:02:19.280> smaller<00:02:19.430> than<00:02:20.210> the<00:02:20.660> 800

same layout here almost exactly this one

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.570 
same layout here almost exactly this one
is<00:03:02.810> a<00:03:02.900> hold<00:03:03.080> button<00:03:03.290> over<00:03:03.560> here<00:03:03.590> this<00:03:04.310> one<00:03:04.460> has

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
is a hold button over here this one has

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.470 
is a hold button over here this one has
the<00:03:04.790> hold<00:03:04.970> button<00:03:05.240> here<00:03:05.540> on<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:07.180> South<00:03:08.180> wire

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
the hold button here on the South wire

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.130 
the hold button here on the South wire
the<00:03:09.230> hold<00:03:09.410> button<00:03:09.650> also<00:03:10.250> acts<00:03:11.180> as<00:03:11.420> a<00:03:11.480> back<00:03:11.750> to

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
the hold button also acts as a back to

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.050 
the hold button also acts as a back to
turn<00:03:12.380> on<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.650> backlight<00:03:13.070> whereas<00:03:13.760> this<00:03:13.850> one

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
turn on the backlight whereas this one

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.640 
turn on the backlight whereas this one
you<00:03:14.180> have<00:03:14.330> your<00:03:14.630> own<00:03:14.750> button<00:03:15.110> for<00:03:15.530> the

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
you have your own button for the

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.100 
you have your own button for the
backlight<00:03:16.040> yeah<00:03:16.850> like<00:03:17.270> an<00:03:17.390> orange<00:03:17.690> light<00:03:17.960> over

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
backlight yeah like an orange light over

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.510 
backlight yeah like an orange light over
here<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:18.410> it<00:03:18.470> looks<00:03:18.680> yellow<00:03:18.920> but<00:03:19.130> it's<00:03:19.250> orange

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
here and it looks yellow but it's orange

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.890 
here and it looks yellow but it's orange
in<00:03:19.790> a<00:03:19.970> light<00:03:20.600> blue<00:03:20.840> over<00:03:21.380> here

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
in a light blue over here

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.140 
in a light blue over here
ah<00:03:23.900> very<00:03:24.710> similar<00:03:25.070> at<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.370> bottom<00:03:25.790> nothing

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
ah very similar at the bottom nothing

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.570 
ah very similar at the bottom nothing
special<00:03:26.360> there<00:03:26.860> exactly<00:03:27.860> the<00:03:28.130> same<00:03:28.310> you<00:03:28.460> only

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
special there exactly the same you only

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.640 
special there exactly the same you only
have<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:29.060> two<00:03:29.240> leads<00:03:29.570> I<00:03:29.960> know<00:03:30.320> some<00:03:30.530> of<00:03:30.560> the

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
have the two leads I know some of the

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.410 
have the two leads I know some of the
more<00:03:30.770> expensive<00:03:30.950> ones<00:03:31.340> have<00:03:32.150> different<00:03:32.810> lead

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
more expensive ones have different lead

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.470 
more expensive ones have different lead
ports<00:03:35.420> for<00:03:35.990> different<00:03:36.560> functions<00:03:37.420> so<00:03:38.420> that

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
ports for different functions so that

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.500 
ports for different functions so that
you<00:03:38.690> can't<00:03:38.930> accidentally<00:03:39.610> plug<00:03:40.610> it<00:03:40.760> in<00:03:40.880> on<00:03:41.120> the

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
you can't accidentally plug it in on the

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:48.280 
you can't accidentally plug it in on the
wrong<00:03:41.660> setting<00:03:43.060> okay<00:03:46.060> one<00:03:47.060> thing<00:03:47.090> that<00:03:47.959> is

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
wrong setting okay one thing that is

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.000 
wrong setting okay one thing that is
different<00:03:48.530> about<00:03:48.770> these<00:03:49.130> two<00:03:49.870> is<00:03:50.870> that<00:03:51.230> this

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
different about these two is that this

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.850 
different about these two is that this
one<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:52.430> South<00:03:52.670> wire<00:03:52.970> has<00:03:53.480> a<00:03:53.870> non-contact

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
one the South wire has a non-contact

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.880 
one the South wire has a non-contact
voltage<00:03:55.340> detector<00:03:56.209> and<00:03:56.540> what<00:03:57.170> that<00:03:57.350> means<00:03:57.560> is

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
voltage detector and what that means is

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.400 
voltage detector and what that means is
when<00:03:58.670> you<00:04:00.880> when<00:04:01.880> you<00:04:01.970> have<00:04:02.120> voltage<00:04:02.390> near<00:04:03.140> the

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
when you when you have voltage near the

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.870 
when you when you have voltage near the
top<00:04:03.920> here<00:04:04.190> the<00:04:04.220> clamp

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
top here the clamp

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.300 
top here the clamp
it'll<00:04:05.660> sense<00:04:05.959> it<00:04:06.140> and<00:04:06.350> it'll<00:04:06.500> make<00:04:06.770> this<00:04:06.980> light

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
it'll sense it and it'll make this light

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.970 
it'll sense it and it'll make this light
blink<00:04:07.670> and<00:04:07.910> I<00:04:08.000> can<00:04:08.180> demonstrate<00:04:08.330> this<00:04:08.810> on<00:04:09.020> this

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
blink and I can demonstrate this on this

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.710 
blink and I can demonstrate this on this
outlet<00:04:10.550> right<00:04:10.760> here<00:04:10.970> put<00:04:11.360> it<00:04:11.450> up<00:04:11.540> to<00:04:11.630> the

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
outlet right here put it up to the

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.740 
outlet right here put it up to the
outlet<00:04:12.130> turn<00:04:13.130> it<00:04:13.250> on<00:04:13.370> on<00:04:13.700> any<00:04:14.510> function

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
outlet turn it on on any function

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.720 
outlet turn it on on any function
doesn't<00:04:15.740> matter<00:04:15.980> where<00:04:16.100> you're<00:04:16.190> at<00:04:16.250> but<00:04:16.640> you

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
doesn't matter where you're at but you

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.570 
doesn't matter where you're at but you
turn<00:04:16.970> it<00:04:17.090> on<00:04:17.209> it<00:04:17.900> will<00:04:17.930> detect<00:04:18.350> voltage<00:04:18.770> it

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
turn it on it will detect voltage it

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.400 
turn it on it will detect voltage it
doesn't<00:04:19.940> beep<00:04:20.120> but<00:04:20.570> it<00:04:20.690> gives<00:04:20.810> you<00:04:20.930> a<00:04:20.960> solid

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
doesn't beep but it gives you a solid

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.100 
doesn't beep but it gives you a solid
red<00:04:21.590> light<00:04:21.830> when<00:04:22.040> you<00:04:22.130> have<00:04:22.280> voltage

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
red light when you have voltage

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.760 
red light when you have voltage
and<00:04:23.560> that's<00:04:23.710> kind<00:04:23.889> of<00:04:23.919> nice<00:04:24.490> my<00:04:24.879> old<00:04:25.590> my<00:04:26.590> old

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
and that's kind of nice my old my old

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.129 
and that's kind of nice my old my old
meter<00:04:27.069> it<00:04:27.729> had<00:04:27.939> that<00:04:28.150> but<00:04:28.360> it<00:04:28.479> would<00:04:28.599> beep<00:04:28.840> I

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
meter it had that but it would beep I

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.499 
meter it had that but it would beep I
don't<00:04:29.949> know<00:04:30.129> if<00:04:30.280> that's<00:04:30.460> important<00:04:30.909> to<00:04:31.000> you<00:04:31.419> or

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
don't know if that's important to you or

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:33.240 
don't know if that's important to you or
not<00:04:31.659> but<00:04:32.080> it<00:04:32.289> was<00:04:32.349> a<00:04:32.439> very<00:04:32.650> important<00:04:33.069> feature

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
not but it was a very important feature

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.959 
not but it was a very important feature
to<00:04:33.370> me<00:04:33.689> so<00:04:34.689> that<00:04:34.840> I<00:04:34.870> don't<00:04:35.020> have<00:04:35.229> to<00:04:35.560> probe

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:35.969 
to me so that I don't have to probe

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:39.600 
to me so that I don't have to probe
every<00:04:36.969> time<00:04:37.180> to<00:04:37.599> make<00:04:37.750> to<00:04:38.110> check<00:04:38.710> to<00:04:39.430> make<00:04:39.550> sure

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
every time to make to check to make sure

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.850 
every time to make to check to make sure
that<00:04:39.879> the<00:04:40.090> power<00:04:40.479> is<00:04:40.659> off<00:04:40.870> mainly<00:04:41.530> it's<00:04:41.740> what

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
that the power is off mainly it's what

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.860 
that the power is off mainly it's what
I'd<00:04:41.949> use<00:04:41.979> that<00:04:42.340> for<00:04:42.550> you<00:04:43.210> know<00:04:43.330> you<00:04:43.419> don't<00:04:43.719> want

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
I'd use that for you know you don't want

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.070 
I'd use that for you know you don't want
to<00:04:43.930> go<00:04:44.050> fill<00:04:44.620> it<00:04:44.800> around<00:04:45.039> inside<00:04:45.340> a<00:04:45.879> hot<00:04:46.180> box<00:04:46.479> of

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
to go fill it around inside a hot box of

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.740 
to go fill it around inside a hot box of
live<00:04:47.650> wires<00:04:47.979> so<00:04:48.580> it's<00:04:48.819> very<00:04:48.969> good<00:04:49.210> even<00:04:49.479> if<00:04:49.629> you

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
live wires so it's very good even if you

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.670 
live wires so it's very good even if you
think<00:04:50.080> or<00:04:50.830> even<00:04:50.860> if<00:04:51.129> you're<00:04:51.900> 99.99%<00:04:52.900> or<00:04:53.349> 100

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
think or even if you're 99.99% or 100

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.129 
think or even if you're 99.99% or 100
percent<00:04:53.889> sure<00:04:54.099> that<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:54.819> power<00:04:55.090> is<00:04:55.240> off<00:04:55.419> it's

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
percent sure that the power is off it's

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:58.409 
percent sure that the power is off it's
always<00:04:56.229> good<00:04:56.560> to<00:04:56.860> just<00:04:57.280> have<00:04:57.460> another<00:04:58.120> way<00:04:58.300> of

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
always good to just have another way of

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.290 
always good to just have another way of
checking<00:04:58.599> it<00:04:58.870> other<00:04:59.379> than<00:04:59.620> using<00:05:00.550> yourself<00:05:00.879> as

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
checking it other than using yourself as

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:08.270 
checking it other than using yourself as
the<00:05:02.080> test<00:05:04.139> um<00:05:05.729> the<00:05:06.729> leads<00:05:06.969> are<00:05:07.300> very<00:05:07.629> similar

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
the test um the leads are very similar

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:14.010 
the test um the leads are very similar
this<00:05:09.280> is<00:05:09.520> the<00:05:09.969> soft<00:05:10.360> wire<00:05:10.569> leads<00:05:12.750> the<00:05:13.750> length

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
this is the soft wire leads the length

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.450 
this is the soft wire leads the length
here<00:05:14.139> is<00:05:15.569> I<00:05:16.569> know<00:05:17.110> you<00:05:17.139> can't<00:05:17.440> see<00:05:17.680> but<00:05:18.190> it's

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
here is I know you can't see but it's

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.080 
here is I know you can't see but it's
about<00:05:19.409> two<00:05:20.409> and<00:05:20.440> a<00:05:20.949> half<00:05:20.979> feet<00:05:21.520> of<00:05:22.509> lead<00:05:22.960> and

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
about two and a half feet of lead and

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.159 
about two and a half feet of lead and
the<00:05:25.110> craftsmen<00:05:26.110> professional<00:05:26.830> I<00:05:28.050> think<00:05:29.050> it's

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
the craftsmen professional I think it's

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:30.809 
the craftsmen professional I think it's
a<00:05:29.289> little<00:05:29.500> bit<00:05:29.710> longer<00:05:30.009> and<00:05:30.279> I<00:05:30.400> just<00:05:30.580> don't

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:30.819 
a little bit longer and I just don't

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:34.350 
a little bit longer and I just don't
shake<00:05:31.210> here<00:05:31.569> yeah<00:05:32.080> the<00:05:33.000> craftsman<00:05:34.000> gives<00:05:34.240> you

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
shake here yeah the craftsman gives you

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.350 
shake here yeah the craftsman gives you
an<00:05:34.449> extra<00:05:34.690> foot<00:05:35.490> so<00:05:36.490> you<00:05:36.550> got<00:05:36.729> about<00:05:36.909> three<00:05:37.180> and

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
an extra foot so you got about three and

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.450 
an extra foot so you got about three and
a<00:05:37.419> half<00:05:37.539> feet<00:05:37.779> with<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:38.589> craftsmen<00:05:39.039> or<00:05:39.190> three

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
a half feet with the craftsmen or three

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.399 
a half feet with the craftsmen or three
feet<00:05:39.639> maybe<00:05:39.819> this<00:05:40.029> is<00:05:40.180> two<00:05:40.389> feet<00:05:40.539> long<00:05:40.750> but<00:05:41.229> you

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
feet maybe this is two feet long but you

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:43.230 
feet maybe this is two feet long but you
get<00:05:41.560> you<00:05:42.009> get<00:05:42.129> you<00:05:42.339> get<00:05:42.460> the<00:05:42.580> idea<00:05:42.849> it's<00:05:42.969> a<00:05:43.029> lot

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
get you get you get the idea it's a lot

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.390 
get you get you get the idea it's a lot
longer<00:05:43.419> the<00:05:44.319> professional<00:05:45.009> one<00:05:45.190> seem<00:05:45.729> to<00:05:46.029> be

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
longer the professional one seem to be

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.189 
longer the professional one seem to be
about<00:05:48.400> the<00:05:48.550> same<00:05:48.759> grade<00:05:49.089> maybe<00:05:49.870> a<00:05:49.960> little

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 
about the same grade maybe a little

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:51.990 
about the same grade maybe a little
better<00:05:50.440> let's<00:05:50.949> say<00:05:51.099> the<00:05:51.370> professional<00:05:51.789> grade

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
better let's say the professional grade

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.149 
better let's say the professional grade
maybe<00:05:52.300> a<00:05:52.419> little<00:05:52.599> better<00:05:52.889> what<00:05:53.889> you'd<00:05:54.039> expect

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:54.159 
maybe a little better what you'd expect

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:57.540 
maybe a little better what you'd expect
you<00:05:54.490> paid<00:05:54.669> more<00:05:55.860> another<00:05:56.860> difference<00:05:57.250> between

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
you paid more another difference between

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.809 
you paid more another difference between
these<00:05:57.669> two<00:05:57.940> this<00:05:58.349> one<00:05:59.349> comes<00:06:00.039> with<00:06:00.219> double-a

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:00.819 
these two this one comes with double-a

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:03.779 
these two this one comes with double-a
batteries<00:06:01.240> included<00:06:01.990> and<00:06:02.110> this<00:06:03.039> one<00:06:03.279> takes<00:06:03.639> a

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:03.789 
batteries included and this one takes a

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:06.079 
batteries included and this one takes a
9-volt<00:06:04.180> battery<00:06:04.479> not<00:06:04.930> included<00:06:04.990> so

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:06.089 
9-volt battery not included so

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:08.579 
9-volt battery not included so
personally<00:06:07.089> I<00:06:07.150> use<00:06:07.539> rechargeable<00:06:07.779> batteries

00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:08.589 
personally I use rechargeable batteries

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:11.939 
personally I use rechargeable batteries
so<00:06:09.279> I<00:06:09.310> like<00:06:09.639> to<00:06:09.669> have<00:06:09.940> the<00:06:10.539> option<00:06:10.750> to<00:06:11.199> use

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:11.949 
so I like to have the option to use

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:17.850 
so I like to have the option to use
double<00:06:12.310> A's<00:06:12.460> or<00:06:12.759> triple<00:06:13.060> A's<00:06:16.050> C<00:06:17.050> thermocouples

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
double A's or triple A's C thermocouples

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.850 
double A's or triple A's C thermocouples
are<00:06:18.539> almost<00:06:19.539> identical<00:06:19.719> they<00:06:20.409> look<00:06:20.620> a<00:06:20.740> little

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
are almost identical they look a little

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.040 
are almost identical they look a little
just<00:06:21.729> a<00:06:21.789> little<00:06:21.940> bit<00:06:22.029> different<00:06:22.330> I<00:06:22.419> personally

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
just a little bit different I personally

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.200 
just a little bit different I personally

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
like this one this one has the positive

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.050 
like this one this one has the positive
and<00:06:25.659> negative<00:06:26.050> on<00:06:26.259> this<00:06:27.219> little<00:06:27.430> plastic

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
and negative on this little plastic

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.540 
and negative on this little plastic
piece<00:06:28.300> but<00:06:29.139> this<00:06:29.379> one<00:06:29.529> just<00:06:29.560> has<00:06:29.860> a<00:06:29.889> red<00:06:30.310> and<00:06:30.339> a

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
it's dark that might be difficult to

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.260 
it's dark that might be difficult to
really<00:06:38.410> make<00:06:38.650> sure<00:06:38.680> you<00:06:39.670> put<00:06:39.850> it<00:06:39.940> in<00:06:40.030> the<00:06:40.120> right
