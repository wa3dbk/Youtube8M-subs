00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:07.350
 and of course we would be happy 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.960
 thought that they attack again 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.719
 Yuna Kim is the radiant Olympic champion 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.089
 from vancouver has a long break 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.109
 and henry gzw I believe already 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.080
 a little bit curious what happens 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:23.670
 What is she waiting for? What more can she do? 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.080
 is still possible after the break the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.300
 extremely curious that you are in the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.640
 preparatory competitions showed her 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.050
 that she's a little bit like that 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.309
 she had lost spritzigkeit 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.920
 Often problems that the jumps not 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.240
 upwards were especially just one 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.700
 triple triple combination 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.930
 in your charisma, as much as I have 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.690
 I do not care about them from now on 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:52.210
 curious how much difficulty she goes 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.210
 and how angry are the languages 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:00.500
 the second home 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.240
 it was something like the art 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.300
 burnout even though she is still so young 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.880
 She was so in demand the articles 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.330
 in the shop then nothing there 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.220
 were energy 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.640
 yes, but you have to say that 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.920
 she probably also consciously this whole 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.480
 Dates or that you made the break 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.470
 has and at all the dates 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.470
 to be able to perceive 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.770
 just to complete that though 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.640
 you want to compare the special 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.990
 position of yona kim in South Korea with 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.880
 Steffi Graf in her best time in 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.619
 germany yes maybe yes maybe 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.170
 even no longer the dimension 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.920
 maybe you can guess 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.920
 to ask love 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.530
 hermann j they are has seen only once 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.600
 because one had a huge 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.520
 talent as looks like that later on 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.260
 did at the world championships and 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.410
 olympic games because you thought that will 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:34.370
 the scene dominates beyond years 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.620
 that did not happen then she got in 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.660
 the years will not be two years 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.100
 competitions contested 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.510
 when the korean occurred 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.750
 and graded then that was 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.710
 of course, always not really 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.280
 can take seriously 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:51.710
 but it is the approach already so 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.120
 yes still a year is the 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.190
 play Olympic and when in 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.709
 all seriousness concerns the matter 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.630
 then the japanese and the 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.180
 young russians are guaranteed again 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:05.420
 serious competition yes that's it 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.400
 because she clearly has improved 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.970
 definitely in this season 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.100
 now from the first appearances at 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.690
 the nrw trophy in dortmund and the 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.019
 Korean championship victory is 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.320
 become more lively and I believe with 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.340
 you can expect this year already 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.410
 and if there are no injuries 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.690
 come in between then in any case 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.950
 look good again next year 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.010
 we in slow motion again the 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.919
 Nationwide tour ups on small corner 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:37.070
 but not big enough to devalue that 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:40.220
 So there I would say everything soon 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.680
 as far as we can we also 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:46.759
 give backwards 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.590
 so that's amazing how 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:53.030
 Excellent presented here because 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.430
 that's not easy at all 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.639
 Go here after two years break 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:02.009
 just come back again 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:04.409
 there were almost 70 points that's eight 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:06.479
 points in just eight points less than 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:09.840
 your own best performance stands and that 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:12.629
 actually shows that with yuna 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.220
 kim can actually be expected again 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:16.729
 becomes 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.870
 she has a bit unfavorable 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:20.580
 That 's not what they do 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.240
 none in the last two years 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.879
 Products has risen in the rankings 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.069
 has slipped and therefore just in 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:32.719
 a relatively new group at the start 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:32.719
 had to give 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.530
 and she definitely has the measure 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.750
 put yu na kim and lead the 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.090
 contest currently in progress 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.010
 because it also declared frank the 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.500
 wienerin has the neat from the 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.780
 then pulled on the tenth 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:58.440
 very well qualified 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:01.260
 for the cows of sovereign 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.970
 Qualification for the KÃ¼r Qatar as 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.130
 weinzierl unfortunately not speak 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:08.190
 that has been a hangover very much 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:10.680
 very long now she has it as he has 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:13.220
 At the moment, the only ones who really pull the wine 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.220
 latest
