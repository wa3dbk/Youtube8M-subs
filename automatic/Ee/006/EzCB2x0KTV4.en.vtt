hi<00:00:01.620> I'm<00:00:02.010> Todd<00:00:02.310> tucky<00:00:02.790> and<00:00:02.970> here<00:00:03.959> we<00:00:04.170> have<00:00:04.440> a

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:04.970 
hi I'm Todd tucky and here we have a

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.150 
hi I'm Todd tucky and here we have a
possible<00:00:05.970> rare<00:00:06.299> item<00:00:06.779> we're<00:00:06.990> not<00:00:07.140> 100%<00:00:07.560> sure

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
possible rare item we're not 100% sure

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.060 
possible rare item we're not 100% sure
this<00:00:09.030> is<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.630> pinball<00:00:10.290> machine<00:00:10.320> made<00:00:10.860> by<00:00:11.040> a

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
this is a pinball machine made by a

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.419 
this is a pinball machine made by a
company<00:00:11.460> called<00:00:11.550> game<00:00:12.030> plan<00:00:12.389> in<00:00:12.769> 1978<00:00:13.769> we

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
company called game plan in 1978 we

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.849 
company called game plan in 1978 we
think<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:15.150> possibly<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.109> prototype

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
think this possibly is a prototype

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.730 
think this possibly is a prototype
simply<00:00:17.820> because<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.359> cabinet<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.529> this

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
simply because the cabinet that this

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.670 
simply because the cabinet that this
game<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.189> in<00:00:20.400> has<00:00:21.090> no<00:00:21.420> artwork<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.170> it's<00:00:22.560> a

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
game is in has no artwork and it's a

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.580 
game is in has no artwork and it's a
basically<00:00:23.340> wood<00:00:23.699> cabinet<00:00:24.330> that's<00:00:25.019> painted

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
basically wood cabinet that's painted

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.859 
basically wood cabinet that's painted
with<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.740> slight<00:00:26.250> coating<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.150> black<00:00:27.449> paint

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
with a slight coating of black paint

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.759 
with a slight coating of black paint
like<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.140> black<00:00:28.410> stain<00:00:29.900> sharp<00:00:30.900> shooter<00:00:31.230> was

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
like a black stain sharp shooter was

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.200 
like a black stain sharp shooter was
designed<00:00:32.279> by<00:00:33.090> Roger<00:00:33.420> sharp<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.610> this<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.969> him

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
designed by Roger sharp and this is him

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.410 
designed by Roger sharp and this is him
here<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.410> what<00:00:38.280> makes<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.579> kind<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.910> unique<00:00:39.180> is

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
here and what makes it kind of unique is

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.900 
here and what makes it kind of unique is
apparently<00:00:40.410> somebody<00:00:41.010> at<00:00:41.160> some<00:00:41.370> point<00:00:41.670> got

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
apparently somebody at some point got

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.209 
apparently somebody at some point got
him<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.270> sign<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.570> that's<00:00:43.379> Roger<00:00:43.800> Sharpe

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
him to sign it that's Roger Sharpe

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.479 
him to sign it that's Roger Sharpe
signature<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.120> we've<00:00:45.750> covered<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.500> mylar

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
signature and we've covered it in mylar

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.160 
signature and we've covered it in mylar
so<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.910> doesn't<00:00:48.270> get<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> race<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.930> looks<00:00:48.960> like

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
so it doesn't get a race it looks like

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.310 
so it doesn't get a race it looks like
it's<00:00:49.410> starting<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.920> rub<00:00:50.520> off<00:00:50.670> but<00:00:51.449> go<00:00:52.020> over<00:00:52.260> a

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
it's starting to rub off but go over a

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.520 
it's starting to rub off but go over a
few<00:00:52.530> things<00:00:52.710> about<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.309> machine<00:00:54.289> that<00:00:55.289> and

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
few things about the machine that and

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.709 
few things about the machine that and
show<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.129> how<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.579> cabinet<00:00:57.300> was<00:00:57.449> constructed

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
show you how the cabinet was constructed

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.280 
show you how the cabinet was constructed
basic<00:01:00.719> play<00:01:00.989> course<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:02.510> like<00:01:03.510> those<00:01:03.780> symbols

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
basic play course is like those symbols

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.910 
basic play course is like those symbols
of<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:05.010> late<00:01:05.400> 70s<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:07.380> case<00:01:07.650> there<00:01:07.860> were

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
of the late 70s in this case there were

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.190 
of the late 70s in this case there were
lots<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.310> drop<00:01:08.549> part<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.930> try<00:01:10.140> to

lots of drop part it and you try to

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.469 
lots of drop part it and you try to
spell<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.340> word<00:01:11.369> sharp<00:01:11.970> here<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:14.270> in<00:01:15.270> other

throughout the play field but let us
look<00:01:22.619> inside<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.460> machine<00:01:23.850> I'm<00:01:24.750> going<00:01:24.810> to

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
look inside the machine I'm going to

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.289 
look inside the machine I'm going to
show<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.170> some<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:27.170> cabinetry<00:01:28.170> here

still<00:01:30.299> have<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> manual<00:01:31.049> limit<00:01:31.259> we<00:01:31.350> got<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
still have the manual limit we got the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.980 
still have the manual limit we got the
machine<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.250> but<00:01:33.090> if<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.270> look<00:01:33.450> here<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
machine in but if you look here the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.760 
machine in but if you look here the
stain<00:01:34.290> stops<00:01:34.829> right<00:01:35.189> here<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:36.560> we're<00:01:37.560> pretty

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
stain stops right here and we're pretty

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.660 
stain stops right here and we're pretty
sure<00:01:38.329> that<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.960> was<00:01:39.990> made<00:01:40.680> possibly<00:01:41.460> at<00:01:41.610> a

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
sure that it was made possibly at a

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.030 
sure that it was made possibly at a
factory<00:01:42.060> simply<00:01:42.420> because<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.750> how<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.799> wood

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
factory simply because of how the wood

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.389 
factory simply because of how the wood
has<00:01:44.250> been<00:01:44.280> cut<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.320> how<00:01:46.320> all<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.680> wiring<00:01:47.100> has

has been cut and how all the wiring has

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.410 
has been cut and how all the wiring has
been<00:01:47.579> placed<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.180> here<00:01:49.909> why<00:01:50.909> we're<00:01:51.149> not<00:01:51.360> a

been placed in here why we're not a

been placed in here why we're not a

I'm<00:02:01.470> going<00:02:01.620> to<00:02:01.650> show<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.180> see<00:02:03.180> these<00:02:03.360> windows

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
I'm going to show you see these windows

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.980 
I'm going to show you see these windows
up<00:02:03.900> here<00:02:04.220> they<00:02:05.220> actually<00:02:05.670> say<00:02:05.880> 1<00:02:06.120> million<00:02:06.420> but

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
up here they actually say 1 million but

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.130 
up here they actually say 1 million but
behind<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:09.259> there's<00:02:10.259> no<00:02:10.500> bulb<00:02:11.570> that<00:02:12.570> indicate

behind it there's no bulb that indicate

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.830 
behind it there's no bulb that indicate
the<00:02:13.350> million<00:02:13.740> we<00:02:14.700> also<00:02:14.910> have<00:02:15.390> these<00:02:15.570> two

there's<00:02:19.140> no<00:02:19.350> window<00:02:20.070> here<00:02:20.490> so<00:02:20.670> we're<00:02:21.570> not<00:02:21.600> sure

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
there's no window here so we're not sure

the<00:02:28.770> head<00:02:29.450> this<00:02:30.450> metal<00:02:30.989> is<00:02:32.120> stapled<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.330> it

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
the head this metal is stapled and it

doesn't look like it was reused this

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.680 
doesn't look like it was reused this
looks<00:02:35.400> like<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.730> original<00:02:36.180> metal<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.630> they

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
looks like the original metal that they

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.199 
looks like the original metal that they
put<00:02:37.080> this<00:02:37.200> inside<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.770> machines<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.340> keep<00:02:39.030> the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
the machine and this looks like it was

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.790 
the machine and this looks like it was
never<00:02:45.000> used<00:02:45.330> before<00:02:45.570> and<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.350> was<00:02:46.470> literally

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
notice there's duct tape that was on the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.520 
notice there's duct tape that was on the
machine<00:02:54.300> when<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.840> machine<00:02:55.140> came<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.470> we

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
machine when the machine came and we

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.759 
machine when the machine came and we
left<00:02:55.830> it<00:02:56.040> now<00:02:56.670> you'll<00:02:56.850> notice<00:02:57.060> here<00:02:57.570> how

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
left it now you'll notice here how

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.710 
left it now you'll notice here how
everything<00:02:58.769> is<00:02:58.890> marked<00:02:59.160> with<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.400> pen<00:02:59.760> the

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
everything is marked with a pen the

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.660 
everything is marked with a pen the

the high score to date and the same

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.020 
the high score to date and the same
player<00:03:06.269> shoots<00:03:06.570> again<00:03:06.720> bulbs<00:03:08.030> they're

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
player shoots again bulbs they're

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.020 
player shoots again bulbs they're
handwritten<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:10.590> we're<00:03:10.739> not<00:03:10.830> sure<00:03:10.890> if<00:03:11.340> this

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
handwritten so we're not sure if this

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.020 
handwritten so we're not sure if this
panel<00:03:12.600> came<00:03:12.870> from<00:03:13.079> another<00:03:13.440> game<00:03:13.799> plan<00:03:14.160> maybe

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
panel came from another game plan maybe

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.479 
panel came from another game plan maybe
this<00:03:15.840> machine<00:03:16.350> fell<00:03:16.590> off<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:16.980> truck<00:03:17.220> and

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
this machine fell off the truck and

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.970 
this machine fell off the truck and
somebody<00:03:17.700> hand-built<00:03:18.600> this<00:03:18.870> cabinet<00:03:19.410> but<00:03:19.680> boy

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
somebody hand-built this cabinet but boy

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.460 
somebody hand-built this cabinet but boy
they<00:03:20.220> went<00:03:20.489> to<00:03:20.610> a<00:03:20.640> lot<00:03:20.880> of<00:03:20.940> effort<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:22.200> holes

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
they went to a lot of effort the holes

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.870 
they went to a lot of effort the holes
here<00:03:23.040> in<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.090> back<00:03:24.299> of<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.570> machine<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:25.880> can

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
here in the back of the machine you can

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.880 
here in the back of the machine you can
also<00:03:27.060> see<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:28.140> wood<00:03:28.410> grain<00:03:29.360> before<00:03:30.360> it<00:03:30.420> was

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
also see the wood grain before it was

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.030 
also see the wood grain before it was
lightly<00:03:32.090> stained<00:03:33.090> with<00:03:33.390> black<00:03:33.720> we<00:03:34.350> restained

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
lightly stained with black we restained

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.910 
lightly stained with black we restained
it<00:03:35.959> so<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:38.190> real<00:03:38.430> question<00:03:38.730> focuses<00:03:39.769> do<00:03:40.769> we

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
it so the real question focuses do we

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.819 
it so the real question focuses do we
have<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.430> rarity<00:03:41.970> here<00:03:42.360> or<00:03:43.200> do<00:03:43.470> we<00:03:43.530> have

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
have a rarity here or do we have

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:49.100 
have a rarity here or do we have
somebody's<00:03:44.690> homemade<00:03:46.280> work<00:03:47.280> of<00:03:47.489> art<00:03:47.700> I<00:03:48.110> guess

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
somebody's homemade work of art I guess

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.990 
somebody's homemade work of art I guess
we'll<00:03:49.290> never<00:03:49.440> really<00:03:49.769> know<00:03:49.950> game<00:03:50.489> plan<00:03:50.790> is

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
we'll never really know game plan is

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.710 
we'll never really know game plan is
long<00:03:51.329> gone<00:03:52.370> but<00:03:53.370> in<00:03:53.549> the<00:03:53.730> meantime<00:03:53.940> the

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
long gone but in the meantime the

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.050 
long gone but in the meantime the
collector<00:03:55.200> that<00:03:55.380> had<00:03:56.010> us<00:03:56.160> reconditioned

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
collector that had us reconditioned

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.840 
collector that had us reconditioned
machine<00:03:57.420> will<00:03:57.630> get<00:03:57.780> a<00:03:57.840> really<00:03:58.260> nice<00:03:58.850> playing

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
machine will get a really nice playing

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.309 
machine will get a really nice playing
game<00:04:00.270> and<00:04:01.760> thank<00:04:02.760> you<00:04:02.940> for<00:04:03.270> watching<00:04:03.930> the
