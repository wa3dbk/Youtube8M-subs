00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
give a quick virtual tour so to speak

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.100 
give a quick virtual tour so to speak
with<00:00:08.340> video<00:00:08.730> of<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.870> rotisserie<00:00:11.809> this<00:00:12.809> one's

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
with video of the rotisserie this one's

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.000 
with video of the rotisserie this one's
looking<00:00:13.769> kind<00:00:14.219> of<00:00:14.480> beat-up<00:00:15.480> it's<00:00:15.780> we've<00:00:16.710> had

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
looking kind of beat-up it's we've had

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.160 
looking kind of beat-up it's we've had
it<00:00:17.160> for<00:00:17.190> about<00:00:17.779> since<00:00:18.779> about<00:00:19.050> oh<00:00:19.080> five<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:19.800> think

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
it for about since about oh five I think

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.080 
it for about since about oh five I think
we<00:00:22.170> built<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:23.010> thing<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.699> one<00:00:23.939> was

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
we built this thing and this one was

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.689 
we built this thing and this one was
kind<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:25.220> experiment<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.849> speak<00:00:27.529> but

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
kind of a experiment so to speak but

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.700 
kind of a experiment so to speak but
just<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.820> give<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.179> quick<00:00:30.480> idea<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:31.349> what

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
just to give you a quick idea of what

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.490 
just to give you a quick idea of what
would<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.250> all<00:00:32.399> entails

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
would it all entails

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.420 
would it all entails
here's<00:00:34.500> your<00:00:35.210> body<00:00:36.210> mount<00:00:36.540> brackets<00:00:37.430> though

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
here's your body mount brackets though

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.069 
here's your body mount brackets though
that<00:00:38.850> that's<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.390> thing<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.750> sets<00:00:39.989> this

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
that that's the thing that sets this

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.020 
that that's the thing that sets this
thing<00:00:40.200> apart<00:00:41.750> the<00:00:42.750> way<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.489> these<00:00:44.489> can<00:00:44.760> move

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
thing apart the way that these can move

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.750 
thing apart the way that these can move
you<00:00:45.840> can<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.230> can<00:00:46.379> turn<00:00:46.590> them<00:00:46.739> around<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:47.340> any

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
you can you can turn them around in any

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.110 
you can you can turn them around in any
configuration<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.870> want<00:00:49.610> to<00:00:50.610> get<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.910> some<00:00:51.090> of

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
configuration you want to get to some of

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.970 
configuration you want to get to some of
those<00:00:51.270> hard-to-reach<00:00:51.870> body<00:00:52.410> mounts<00:00:52.860> on

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
those hard-to-reach body mounts on

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.220 
those hard-to-reach body mounts on
certain<00:00:53.340> cars<00:00:56.149> everything<00:00:57.149> everything<00:00:58.109> is

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
certain cars everything everything is

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.880 
certain cars everything everything is
adjustable<00:00:58.710> here's<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.370> tip<00:00:59.760> don't<00:01:00.750> if<00:01:01.109> if<00:01:01.739> you

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
adjustable here's a tip don't if if you

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.770 
adjustable here's a tip don't if if you
get<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:03.589> jack<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:05.150> raise<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.390> up<00:01:06.630> and

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
get the the jack to raise this up and

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.280 
get the the jack to raise this up and
down<00:01:06.930> don't<00:01:07.799> store<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.479> outside<00:01:09.479> with<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.020> RAM

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
down don't store it outside with the RAM

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.219 
down don't store it outside with the RAM
in<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.530> air<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.670> exactly<00:01:12.420> what<00:01:12.720> happens

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
in the air this is exactly what happens

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.990 
in the air this is exactly what happens
look<00:01:13.380> at<00:01:13.500> how<00:01:13.619> rusty<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.280> thing<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:15.409> but<00:01:17.000> you

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
look at how rusty that thing is but you

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.350 
look at how rusty that thing is but you
know<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:19.110> thing<00:01:19.409> right<00:01:19.619> here<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.360> was

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
know this this thing right here that was

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.690 
know this this thing right here that was
just<00:01:21.659> an<00:01:21.840> experiment<00:01:22.290> type<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.920> thing<00:01:23.159> where<00:01:23.430> I

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
just an experiment type of thing where I

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.280 
just an experiment type of thing where I
was<00:01:24.030> going<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.270> try<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.659> use<00:01:24.780> just<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:25.170> regular

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
was going to try and use just a regular

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.359 
was going to try and use just a regular
floor<00:01:25.860> jack<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:27.259> raise<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.650> up<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.920> down<00:01:29.100> it

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
floor jack to raise it up and down it

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.380 
floor jack to raise it up and down it
didn't<00:01:29.939> pan<00:01:30.240> out<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.659> greatest<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:32.369> at<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
didn't pan out the greatest and at the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.999 
didn't pan out the greatest and at the
time<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.630> was<00:01:33.990> building<00:01:34.350> these<00:01:34.470> things<00:01:34.799> for

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
time I was building these things for

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.850 
time I was building these things for
other<00:01:35.159> people<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.750> really<00:01:37.110> wanted<00:01:37.409> stuff<00:01:37.710> to

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
other people so I really wanted stuff to

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.270 
other people so I really wanted stuff to
work<00:01:38.070> right<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.670> kind<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:40.250> forgot<00:01:41.250> about

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
work right so I kind of forgot about

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.530 
work right so I kind of forgot about
that<00:01:41.549> idea<00:01:42.030> same<00:01:42.930> with<00:01:43.110> these<00:01:43.320> two<00:01:44.210> this<00:01:45.210> tube

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
that idea same with these two this tube

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.700 
that idea same with these two this tube
right<00:01:45.570> here<00:01:46.700> that<00:01:47.700> tube<00:01:48.030> right<00:01:48.060> there<00:01:48.710> that

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
right here that tube right there that

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.310 
right here that tube right there that
was<00:01:50.009> uh<00:01:50.479> that<00:01:51.479> was<00:01:51.540> kind<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.930> along<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.290> same

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
was uh that was kind of along the same

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.840 
was uh that was kind of along the same
lines<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:53.009> find<00:01:53.250> your<00:01:53.399> center<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.729> gravity

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
lines to find your center of gravity

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.899 
lines to find your center of gravity
with<00:01:54.500> with<00:01:55.500> just<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.890> standard<00:01:56.100> floor<00:01:56.579> jack

basically what I have drawn in the plans

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.090 
basically what I have drawn in the plans
and<00:02:23.570> dimension<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.260> there's<00:02:24.410> enough<00:02:24.680> room<00:02:24.950> in

and dimension and there's enough room in

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.170 
and dimension and there's enough room in
there<00:02:25.280> for<00:02:25.310> a<00:02:25.550> Jack<00:02:25.880> like<00:02:26.150> this<00:02:26.390> if<00:02:26.570> you<00:02:26.690> choose

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
there for a Jack like this if you choose
