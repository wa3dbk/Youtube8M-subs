00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.560 
and I want to show you guys some pretty
awesome<00:00:08.490> software<00:00:08.910> I've<00:00:09.179> just<00:00:09.389> recently

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
awesome software I've just recently

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.140 
awesome software I've just recently
found<00:00:09.990> it's<00:00:10.830> called<00:00:11.040> amaryllis<00:00:11.460> action<00:00:11.969> it<00:00:12.120> is

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
found it's called amaryllis action it is

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.789 
found it's called amaryllis action it is
actually<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.570> really<00:00:13.080> good<00:00:13.200> alternative<00:00:13.769> to

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
actually a really good alternative to

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.070 
actually a really good alternative to
fraps<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.549> even<00:00:14.969> dxtory<00:00:15.540> which<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.809> didn't

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
fraps and even dxtory which I didn't

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.740 
fraps and even dxtory which I didn't
think<00:00:16.109> was<00:00:16.230> possible<00:00:16.490> now<00:00:17.660> what<00:00:18.660> this

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
think was possible now what this

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.630 
think was possible now what this
software<00:00:19.050> does<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.560> pretty<00:00:20.100> much<00:00:20.160> exactly<00:00:20.310> the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
software does is pretty much exactly the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.490 
software does is pretty much exactly the
same<00:00:20.820> as<00:00:20.939> Dxtory<00:00:21.390> or<00:00:21.539> fraps<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.900> can<00:00:22.080> record<00:00:22.350> a

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
same as Dxtory or fraps it can record a

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.230 
same as Dxtory or fraps it can record a
gameplay<00:00:22.859> footage<00:00:23.460> as<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:23.789> can<00:00:23.910> see<00:00:24.029> here

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
gameplay footage as you can see here

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.790 
gameplay footage as you can see here
however<00:00:24.900> with<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.320> can<00:00:25.350> also<00:00:25.529> record

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
however with this you can also record

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.070 
however with this you can also record
your<00:00:25.949> desktop<00:00:26.460> either<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.240> entire<00:00:27.510> thing<00:00:27.539> or

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
your desktop either the entire thing or

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.500 
your desktop either the entire thing or
just<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.740> small<00:00:29.010> region<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.490> your<00:00:29.580> desktop<00:00:29.880> so

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
just a small region of your desktop so

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.880 
just a small region of your desktop so
it's<00:00:30.630> quite<00:00:30.779> flexible<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.439> can<00:00:31.500> record<00:00:31.769> a

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
it's quite flexible you can record a

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.100 
it's quite flexible you can record a
full<00:00:32.070> 1080p<00:00:32.460> or<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:33.540> can<00:00:33.660> just<00:00:33.750> set<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.079> a

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
full 1080p or you can just set it to a

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.569 
full 1080p or you can just set it to a
hundred<00:00:34.260> percent<00:00:34.410> size<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:35.010> if<00:00:35.130> your<00:00:35.250> desktop

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
hundred percent size so if your desktop

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.319 
hundred percent size so if your desktop
isn't<00:00:35.760> 1920<00:00:36.510> x<00:00:36.570> 1080<00:00:36.690> its<00:00:37.050> let's<00:00:37.290> say<00:00:38.120> 1366<00:00:39.120> x

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
isn't 1920 x 1080 its let's say 1366 x

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.600 
isn't 1920 x 1080 its let's say 1366 x
768<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.829> can<00:00:40.950> just<00:00:41.070> put<00:00:41.190> one<00:00:41.370> hundred<00:00:41.579> percent

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
768 you can just put one hundred percent

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.220 
768 you can just put one hundred percent
size<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.450> will<00:00:42.540> record<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.870> for<00:00:42.989> hold<00:00:43.110> that

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
size and it will record it for hold that

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.540 
size and it will record it for hold that
stuff<00:00:43.379> like<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:44.010> course<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.340> region

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
stuff like that and of course in region

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.029 
stuff like that and of course in region
size<00:00:44.700> over<00:00:44.910> here<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.539> video<00:00:45.840> frame<00:00:46.440> rate<00:00:46.620> you

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
size over here the video frame rate you

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.180 
size over here the video frame rate you
can<00:00:47.190> change<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.520> from<00:00:47.579> 30<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.969> 60<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.750> even<00:00:48.989> 24<00:00:49.469> I

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
can change it from 30 to 60 to even 24 I

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.040 
can change it from 30 to 60 to even 24 I
but<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.940> won't<00:00:51.120> affect<00:00:51.360> your<00:00:51.449> in-game<00:00:51.600> frame

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
but it won't affect your in-game frame

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.510 
but it won't affect your in-game frame
rate<00:00:52.230> if<00:00:52.350> you're<00:00:52.469> playing<00:00:52.649> games<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.219> like

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
rate if you're playing games so like

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.979 
rate if you're playing games so like
let's<00:00:53.820> see<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.000> playing<00:00:54.180> battle<00:00:54.660> for<00:00:54.809> 3

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
let's see you playing battle for 3

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.650 
let's see you playing battle for 3
regularly<00:00:55.649> at<00:00:55.800> 60<00:00:56.399> frames<00:00:56.430> per<00:00:56.640> second<00:00:57.030> you're

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
regularly at 60 frames per second you're

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.060 
regularly at 60 frames per second you're
probably<00:00:57.809> going<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.050> be<00:00:58.140> playing<00:00:58.260> around<00:00:58.469> 55

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
probably going to be playing around 55

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.340 
probably going to be playing around 55
frames<00:00:59.570> but<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> video<00:01:00.780> will<00:01:00.989> be<00:01:01.079> at<00:01:01.170> 30

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
frames but the video will be at 30

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.020 
frames but the video will be at 30
frames<00:01:01.469> per<00:01:01.649> second<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.309> really<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:02.789> not<00:01:02.969> a

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
frames per second so really it's not a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.880 
frames per second so really it's not a
huge<00:01:03.359> performance<00:01:03.719> hit<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.229> let's<00:01:04.830> say

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
huge performance hit like let's say

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.500 
huge performance hit like let's say
fraps<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:07.670> so<00:01:08.670> when<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.060> comes<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.270> quality

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
fraps is and so when it comes to quality

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.420 
fraps is and so when it comes to quality
its<00:01:09.900> quality<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.560> top<00:01:10.799> notch<00:01:11.040> I'll<00:01:11.220> be<00:01:11.310> showing

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
its quality is top notch I'll be showing

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.160 
its quality is top notch I'll be showing
you<00:01:11.520> guys<00:01:11.610> some<00:01:11.729> quality<00:01:12.180> videos<00:01:12.479> after<00:01:12.689> this

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.640 
show you guys also a little bit another
advantage<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:18.810> which<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.170> file<00:01:19.409> size

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
advantage of this which is a file size

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.649 
advantage of this which is a file size
here's<00:01:19.979> an<00:01:20.070> example<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.670> where<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.270> go<00:01:21.360> here

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
here's an example so where you go here

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.820 
here's an example so where you go here
on<00:01:22.369> minecraft<00:01:23.369> here<00:01:23.670> i<00:01:23.880> have<00:01:24.150> 31<00:01:24.710> minutes<00:01:25.710> of

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
31 minutes at 67 gigabytes so that's not

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.260 
31 minutes at 67 gigabytes so that's not
exactly<00:01:31.110> horrible<00:01:31.799> right<00:01:32.189> but<00:01:33.090> check<00:01:33.240> this

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
exactly horrible right but check this

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.200 
exactly horrible right but check this
