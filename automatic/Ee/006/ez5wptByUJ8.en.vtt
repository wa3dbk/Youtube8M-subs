like<00:00:38.760> this<00:00:38.910> one<00:00:39.120> I've<00:00:39.390> played<00:00:39.780> around<00:00:39.960> with<00:00:40.050> it

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
like this one I've played around with it

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.139 
like this one I've played around with it
a<00:00:40.290> little<00:00:40.379> bit<00:00:40.620> now<00:00:40.829> I've<00:00:41.100> upgraded<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:42.030> all

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
a little bit now I've upgraded it all

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.420 
a little bit now I've upgraded it all
the<00:00:42.300> way<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.690> definitely<00:00:43.530> prefer<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
the way I definitely prefer this to the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.369 
the way I definitely prefer this to the
normal<00:00:44.700> spin<00:00:45.000> fuser<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.570> don't<00:00:46.079> know<00:00:46.170> if<00:00:46.320> I

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
normal spin fuser I don't know if I

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.990 
normal spin fuser I don't know if I
prefer<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.070> gladiator<00:00:47.489> because<00:00:47.940> a

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
prefer to the gladiator because a

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.940 
prefer to the gladiator because a
gladiator<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.660> just<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:48.989> much<00:00:49.110> different<00:00:49.559> but

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
gladiator is just so much different but

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.500 
gladiator is just so much different but
overall<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.340> like<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.670> spin<00:00:50.910> fusers<00:00:51.270> better

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
overall I like to spin fusers better

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.240 
overall I like to spin fusers better
than<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.780> gladiator<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.530> just<00:00:52.739> depends<00:00:53.160> on

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
than the gladiator it just depends on

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.889 
than the gladiator it just depends on
what<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.850> I'm<00:00:54.059> doing<00:00:54.090> how<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.570> want<00:00:54.840> to

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.660 
what it is I'm doing how I want to
achieve<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.320> etc<00:00:55.469> etc<00:00:55.770> but<00:00:56.160> when<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.370> comes<00:00:56.550> to

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
achieve it etc etc but when it comes to

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.979 
achieve it etc etc but when it comes to
spin<00:00:56.910> shoes<00:00:57.090> reverses<00:00:57.539> spin<00:00:57.750> fuser

one-shot a lot of the medium classes if

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.510 
one-shot a lot of the medium classes if
they<00:01:06.659> have<00:01:06.780> upgraded<00:01:07.229> their<00:01:07.290> armor<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.890> then

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
they have upgraded their armor and then

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.420 
they have upgraded their armor and then
it'll<00:01:08.880> two-shot<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.900> heavy<00:01:10.409> class<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:11.280> know

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
it'll two-shot a heavy class you know

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.340 
it'll two-shot a heavy class you know
these<00:01:11.909> are<00:01:11.970> direct<00:01:12.299> hits<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.600> course<00:01:12.810> they<00:01:13.290> do

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
these are direct hits of course they do

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.170 
these are direct hits of course they do
a<00:01:13.439> little<00:01:13.650> bit<00:01:13.770> less<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.100> splash<00:01:14.460> but<00:01:15.030> has<00:01:15.150> a

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
a little bit less in splash but has a

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.539 
a little bit less in splash but has a
wider<00:01:15.540> splash<00:01:15.930> radius<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.560> overall<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.159> know

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
wider splash radius so overall you know

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.760 
wider splash radius so overall you know
the<00:01:17.759> direct<00:01:18.000> hit<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.810> lot<00:01:19.080> more<00:01:19.200> rewarding

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
the direct hit is a lot more rewarding

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.440 
the direct hit is a lot more rewarding
and<00:01:19.950> when<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.759> are<00:01:20.939> going<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.240> splash

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
and when you are going to splash

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.090 
and when you are going to splash
somebody<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.869> have<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> greater<00:01:22.259> radius<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.950> do

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
somebody you have a greater radius to do

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.580 
somebody you have a greater radius to do
it<00:01:23.220> with<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:23.700> overall<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.750> really<00:01:24.840> really<00:01:25.380> like

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
it with so overall I really really like

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.870 
it with so overall I really really like
the<00:01:25.799> new<00:01:25.920> spin<00:01:26.130> fuser<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.490> would<00:01:26.759> definitely

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
the new spin fuser I would definitely

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.609 
the new spin fuser I would definitely
suggest<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.479> pick<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.780> up<00:01:27.869> but<00:01:28.290> that's<00:01:28.500> just

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
suggest you pick it up but that's just

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.890 
suggest you pick it up but that's just
personal<00:01:28.860> preference<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:30.270> other<00:01:30.390> weapon<00:01:30.750> is

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
personal preference the other weapon is

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.770 
personal preference the other weapon is
a<00:01:30.930> variation<00:01:31.320> on<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:32.400> automatic<00:01:32.670> shotgun<00:01:33.180> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
a variation on the automatic shotgun the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.050 
a variation on the automatic shotgun the
hammer<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.110> nothing<00:01:34.530> special<00:01:34.650> honestly<00:01:35.430> when

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
hammer is nothing special honestly when

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.399 
hammer is nothing special honestly when
you<00:01:36.090> have<00:01:36.299> other<00:01:36.509> options<00:01:36.750> like<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.200> Nova

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
you have other options like the Nova

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.050 
you have other options like the Nova
cult<00:01:37.710> which<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.040> great<00:01:38.250> for<00:01:38.280> chasing<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:38.909> pick

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
cult which is great for chasing and pick

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
off enemies at a long distance and you

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.160 
off enemies at a long distance and you
have<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:42.000> know<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.240> plasma<00:01:42.689> cannon<00:01:43.049> which

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
have you know the plasma cannon which

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.030 
have you know the plasma cannon which
doesn't<00:01:43.500> feel<00:01:43.619> like<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.829> should<00:01:43.950> be<00:01:43.979> a

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
doesn't feel like it should be a

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.490 
doesn't feel like it should be a
secondary<00:01:44.549> at<00:01:44.759> all<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.570> hard<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.049> justify

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
secondary at all it's hard to justify

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.710 
secondary at all it's hard to justify
using<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.250> automatic<00:01:47.520> shotguns<00:01:48.149> because

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
using the automatic shotguns because

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.100 
using the automatic shotguns because
they<00:01:49.259> are<00:01:49.700> so<00:01:50.700> limited<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.270> their<00:01:51.390> range<00:01:51.689> and

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
they are so limited in their range and

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.499 
they are so limited in their range and
the<00:01:52.649> damage<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.100> good<00:01:53.280> but<00:01:53.490> mostly<00:01:53.909> up<00:01:54.149> against

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
the damage is good but mostly up against

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.530 
the damage is good but mostly up against
slow-moving<00:01:55.500> big<00:01:55.950> targets<00:01:56.460> otherwise<00:01:56.880> it's

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
slow-moving big targets otherwise it's

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.840 
slow-moving big targets otherwise it's
not<00:01:57.750> really<00:01:57.990> worth<00:01:58.170> using<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.920> shotgun<00:01:59.490> you're

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
not really worth using a shotgun you're

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.399 
not really worth using a shotgun you're
already<00:02:00.090> really<00:02:00.329> deadly<00:02:00.659> indoors<00:02:01.110> with<00:02:01.259> your

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
already really deadly indoors with your

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.760 
already really deadly indoors with your
explosives<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.219> your<00:02:02.310> grenades<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.880> whatnot

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
explosives and your grenades and whatnot

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.410 
explosives and your grenades and whatnot
it's<00:02:04.770> supposedly<00:02:05.250> more<00:02:05.640> ammo<00:02:05.820> efficient<00:02:06.329> I

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
it's supposedly more ammo efficient I

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.760 
it's supposedly more ammo efficient I
haven't<00:02:06.689> upgraded<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:07.170> all<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.320> way<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.469> can't

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
haven't upgraded it all the way I can't

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.160 
haven't upgraded it all the way I can't
really<00:02:07.860> say<00:02:08.129> if<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.429> or<00:02:08.610> isn't<00:02:08.940> but<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.750> acts

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
really say if it is or isn't but it acts

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.110 
really say if it is or isn't but it acts
and<00:02:10.619> feels<00:02:10.950> identical<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.000> other

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
and feels identical to the other

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.730 
and feels identical to the other
automatic<00:02:12.450> shotgun<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.080> really<00:02:13.410> doesn't

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
automatic shotgun it really doesn't

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.520 
automatic shotgun it really doesn't
or<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.890> purchase<00:02:14.550> whatsoever<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.510> then<00:02:16.170> lastly

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
or a purchase whatsoever and then lastly

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.920 
or a purchase whatsoever and then lastly
you<00:02:16.710> have<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.670> new<00:02:17.850> fractal<00:02:18.390> grenade<00:02:18.720> which

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
you have the new fractal grenade which

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.490 
you have the new fractal grenade which
is<00:02:19.170> orange<00:02:19.770> which<00:02:19.950> is<00:02:20.070> really<00:02:20.250> cool<00:02:20.750> but<00:02:21.750> the

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
is orange which is really cool but the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.200 
is orange which is really cool but the
difference<00:02:22.650> in<00:02:23.010> this<00:02:23.130> is<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.580> normal<00:02:23.760> fractal

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
difference in this is the normal fractal

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.080 
difference in this is the normal fractal
I<00:02:24.300> think<00:02:24.510> does<00:02:24.720> 410<00:02:25.350> roughly<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.730> new<00:02:26.880> one

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
I think does 410 roughly the new one

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.990 
I think does 410 roughly the new one
does<00:02:27.300> like<00:02:27.600> 390<00:02:28.440> it's<00:02:28.710> like<00:02:29.070> 20<00:02:29.370> damage<00:02:29.550> per

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
does like 390 it's like 20 damage per

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.790 
does like 390 it's like 20 damage per
shot<00:02:30.030> it's<00:02:30.540> hardly<00:02:30.870> noticeable<00:02:30.990> it's<00:02:31.620> still

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
shot it's hardly noticeable it's still

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.830 
shot it's hardly noticeable it's still
doing<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.160> massive<00:02:32.700> amount<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:32.970> damage<00:02:33.300> only<00:02:33.450> it

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
doing a massive amount of damage only it

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.770 
doing a massive amount of damage only it
lasts<00:02:34.580> significantly<00:02:35.580> longer<00:02:35.850> it<00:02:36.240> is

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
lasts significantly longer it is

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.610 
lasts significantly longer it is
actually<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.650> very<00:02:38.550> very<00:02:39.000> decent<00:02:39.660> upgrade<00:02:40.200> not

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
actually a very very decent upgrade not

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.620 
actually a very very decent upgrade not
even<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:40.950> variant<00:02:41.340> but<00:02:41.490> it<00:02:41.610> isn't<00:02:42.210> upgrade<00:02:42.600> I

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
even a variant but it isn't upgrade I

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.720 
even a variant but it isn't upgrade I
would<00:02:42.900> most<00:02:43.200> definitely<00:02:43.530> go<00:02:44.070> for<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.610> new

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
would most definitely go for the new

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.450 
would most definitely go for the new
Fratto<00:02:44.970> grenade<00:02:45.500> just<00:02:46.500> because<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.920> utility

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
Fratto grenade just because the utility

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.940 
Fratto grenade just because the utility
of<00:02:47.490> that<00:02:47.790> area<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.330> denial<00:02:48.750> is<00:02:49.020> just<00:02:49.590> so<00:02:49.800> much

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
of that area of denial is just so much

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.560 
of that area of denial is just so much
more<00:02:50.190> potent<00:02:50.670> it's<00:02:50.820> so<00:02:50.970> much<00:02:51.120> better<00:02:51.270> and

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
more potent it's so much better and

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.090 
more potent it's so much better and
you're<00:02:51.780> not<00:02:51.870> really<00:02:52.020> losing<00:02:52.470> much<00:02:52.590> damage<00:02:52.950> at

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
you're not really losing much damage at

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.040 
you're not really losing much damage at
all<00:02:53.220> you're<00:02:53.460> still<00:02:53.730> going<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.270> destroy

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
all you're still going to destroy

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.680 
all you're still going to destroy
anybody<00:02:55.380> who<00:02:55.650> gets<00:02:55.800> near<00:02:56.070> one<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.310> them

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
anybody who gets near one of them

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.120 
anybody who gets near one of them
overall<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:57.900> would<00:02:58.200> definitely<00:02:58.470> suggest<00:02:58.800> you

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
overall I would definitely suggest you

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.910 
overall I would definitely suggest you
pick<00:02:59.280> up<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.970> new<00:03:00.150> spin<00:03:00.420> fuser<00:03:00.660> it<00:03:00.900> is<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.740> lot

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
pick up the new spin fuser it is a lot

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.800 
pick up the new spin fuser it is a lot
of<00:03:02.040> fun<00:03:02.190> if<00:03:02.370> you<00:03:02.760> enjoy<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.360> normal<00:03:03.600> spin

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
of fun if you enjoy the normal spin

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.120 
of fun if you enjoy the normal spin
fuser<00:03:04.050> if<00:03:04.260> that<00:03:04.440> would<00:03:04.560> be<00:03:04.680> your<00:03:04.800> weapon<00:03:05.070> of

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
fuser if that would be your weapon of

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.190 
fuser if that would be your weapon of
choice<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:05.700> is<00:03:05.820> I<00:03:06.090> feel<00:03:06.660> an<00:03:06.840> upgrade<00:03:07.170> to

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
choice and this is I feel an upgrade to

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.280 
choice and this is I feel an upgrade to
it<00:03:07.560> but<00:03:08.220> mostly<00:03:08.610> just<00:03:08.820> different<00:03:09.180> i<00:03:09.360> would

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
it but mostly just different i would

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.560 
it but mostly just different i would
probably<00:03:10.800> neglect<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.490> new<00:03:11.610> shotgun<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.360> i

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
probably neglect the new shotgun and i

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.000 
probably neglect the new shotgun and i
would<00:03:12.720> definitely<00:03:12.960> pick<00:03:13.170> up<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.440> new<00:03:13.560> fractal

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
would definitely pick up the new fractal

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.740 
would definitely pick up the new fractal
i<00:03:14.160> know<00:03:14.880> guys<00:03:15.060> is<00:03:15.180> going<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.390> do<00:03:15.510> it<00:03:15.570> for<00:03:15.690> this
