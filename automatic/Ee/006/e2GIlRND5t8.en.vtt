00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.550
 hello how I'm twitterer prisoner 1984 and I bring you a video more than one that 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.160
 implies in this case is the moto gp video game 2011 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.570
 well rather season 2010/2011 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:27.449
 As you know this game brings three categories 125 cubic centimeters 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.890
 moto 2 and moto gp 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.910
 well there are see the game modes that brings this year 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.240
 I am going to play fast race mode in the circuit of montmeló cataluña in the 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.240
 125 cubic centimeters category 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.500
 I have to say it's the second race he did since I'm not a fan of 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.970
 this saga since it focuses its gameplay to a much more arcade audience so 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.400
 do not expect a super driving 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.870
 say that the game is licensed by all teams and drivers 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.870
 moto gp of the season 2010/2011 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.000
 visually the game is quite correct but in my opinion it is quite 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.540
 arcadi loses quite the title 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.000
 because if you are looking for a good motorcycle simulator, do not bother with this title 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.350
 recommend any videogame of the saga sbk in my videos you will find a 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.700
 scenario analysis 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.700
 if on the other hand 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.600
 together 0 8 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.370
 for twenty one of totally recommended criteria 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
 for me this title has disappointed me 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.850
 but they are still in 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.850
 already registered with the areas 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.880
 neighbors to canellis 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.880
 pfeifer against fujimori is that they have already fought 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.980
 The truth is that 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.980
 a motorcycle game gp 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:12.589
 uses the vote to withdraw to reduce resistance 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:21.999
 that's why this happens to me 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.629
 where are you going paschal 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.729
 fixing seven and a half of the year 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:38.729
 a title that has the license of said tenca championship 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:49.369
 the ps3 and xbox 360 of which this bentley has created 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.189
 say that if they want to play with this same teams 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.739
 year is a downloadable plc 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.369
 free mind 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:01.369
 I on the other hand I say goodbye and you 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:05.249
 that is, thanks for 

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:08.449
