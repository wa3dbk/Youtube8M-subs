sort<00:03:26.140> of<00:03:26.200> thing<00:03:26.260> I<00:03:26.830> felt<00:03:27.220> like<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.459> show<00:03:27.730> is

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
sort of thing I felt like the show is

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.789 
sort of thing I felt like the show is
gonna<00:03:28.060> lose<00:03:28.299> sting<00:03:28.630> as<00:03:28.840> well<00:03:28.870> you<00:03:29.380> know<00:03:29.530> saying

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
gonna lose sting as well you know saying

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.560 
gonna lose sting as well you know saying
I<00:03:29.920> don't<00:03:29.980> want<00:03:30.310> to<00:03:30.400> jinx<00:03:30.970> it<00:03:31.150> or<00:03:31.269> nothing<00:03:31.540> like

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
I don't want to jinx it or nothing like

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.990 
I don't want to jinx it or nothing like
that<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:32.140> it<00:03:32.650> could<00:03:32.830> quite<00:03:33.190> possibly<00:03:33.220> end<00:03:33.880> up

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
that and it could quite possibly end up

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.729 
that and it could quite possibly end up
being<00:03:34.330> better<00:03:34.540> than<00:03:34.660> any<00:03:34.930> season<00:03:35.350> who<00:03:35.500> knows

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
being better than any season who knows

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.039 
being better than any season who knows
how<00:03:36.070> we're<00:03:36.250> going<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.400> react<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:36.970> it<00:03:37.000> but<00:03:37.780> I

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
how we're going to react to it but I

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.550 
how we're going to react to it but I
feel<00:03:38.560> like<00:03:39.120> losing<00:03:40.120> aaron<00:03:40.750> mcgruder<00:03:40.870> is

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
feel like losing aaron mcgruder is

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.910 
feel like losing aaron mcgruder is
similar<00:03:42.250> to<00:03:42.370> how<00:03:42.549> when<00:03:43.239> and<00:03:44.200> this<00:03:44.380> is<00:03:44.440> this<00:03:44.799> is

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
similar to how when and this is this is

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.009 
similar to how when and this is this is
going<00:03:45.070> to<00:03:45.130> this<00:03:45.250> is<00:03:45.340> our<00:03:45.549> comparison<00:03:46.299> but<00:03:46.870> it

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
going to this is our comparison but it

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.690 
going to this is our comparison but it
sort<00:03:47.260> of<00:03:47.350> kind<00:03:47.709> of<00:03:47.799> makes<00:03:47.980> sense<00:03:48.190> similar<00:03:48.459> to

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
sort of kind of makes sense similar to

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.120 
sort of kind of makes sense similar to
how<00:03:48.850> back<00:03:49.540> when<00:03:49.780> dragon<00:03:50.110> ball<00:03:50.260> z<00:03:50.500> transition

anyway so they made GT which in my

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.070 
anyway so they made GT which in my
opinion<00:04:09.850> GT<00:04:10.570> turned<00:04:10.840> out<00:04:10.990> to<00:04:11.110> be<00:04:11.290> fucking<00:04:11.830> not

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
opinion GT turned out to be fucking not

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.110 
opinion GT turned out to be fucking not
horrible<00:04:14.080> but<00:04:14.140> wack<00:04:14.620> compared<00:04:15.520> to<00:04:15.730> Dragon

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
horrible but wack compared to Dragon

Ball Z I'm saying and I really hope that
doesn't<00:04:19.060> happen<00:04:19.090> with<00:04:20.049> the<00:04:20.200> boondocks

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709

doesn't happen with the boondocks
transitioning<00:04:21.519> from<00:04:21.640> his<00:04:21.820> third<00:04:22.060> season<00:04:22.390> 2

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
transitioning from his third season 2

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.600 
transitioning from his third season 2
its<00:04:23.170> fourth<00:04:23.470> season<00:04:23.740> because<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.370> third

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
its fourth season because the third

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.570 
its fourth season because the third
season<00:04:24.940> man<00:04:25.270> come<00:04:25.480> on<00:04:25.860> Atlas<00:04:26.860> most<00:04:27.130> that<00:04:27.490> was

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
season man come on Atlas most that was

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.060 
season man come on Atlas most that was
probably<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:28.000> best<00:04:28.300> season<00:04:28.810> period<00:04:29.260> of<00:04:29.830> the

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
probably the best season period of the

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.200 
probably the best season period of the
show<00:04:30.310> so<00:04:30.610> far<00:04:30.940> so<00:04:31.570> they<00:04:31.780> have<00:04:31.930> a<00:04:31.960> lot<00:04:32.380> of

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
show so far so they have a lot of

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.910 
show so far so they have a lot of
pressure<00:04:34.210> on<00:04:34.420> their<00:04:34.720> shoulders<00:04:35.140> going<00:04:35.350> going

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
pressure on their shoulders going going

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.440 
pressure on their shoulders going going
into<00:04:36.160> this<00:04:36.280> fourth<00:04:36.580> season<00:04:37.000> I<00:04:37.090> hope<00:04:37.240> they

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
into this fourth season I hope they

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.810 
into this fourth season I hope they
really<00:04:37.600> capitalize<00:04:38.260> on<00:04:38.290> it<00:04:38.680> and<00:04:38.860> what<00:04:39.370> not<00:04:39.610> and

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
really capitalize on it and what not and

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.730 
really capitalize on it and what not and
honestly<00:04:40.360> I<00:04:40.780> think<00:04:40.930> it's<00:04:41.230> going<00:04:41.290> to<00:04:41.380> be<00:04:41.530> good

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
honestly I think it's going to be good

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.070 
honestly I think it's going to be good
regardless<00:04:42.010> whether<00:04:42.640> he's<00:04:42.910> there<00:04:43.120> or<00:04:43.180> not<00:04:43.450> but

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
regardless whether he's there or not but

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.290 
regardless whether he's there or not but
it's<00:04:44.260> just<00:04:44.470> I<00:04:44.650> want<00:04:45.040> that<00:04:45.160> sting<00:04:45.730> that<00:04:46.000> it<00:04:46.120> had

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
it's just I want that sting that it had

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.150 
it's just I want that sting that it had
I'm<00:04:46.630> saying<00:04:46.960> and<00:04:47.260> it's<00:04:47.620> all<00:04:47.770> you<00:04:47.920> can<00:04:47.950> also

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
I'm saying and it's all you can also

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.460 
I'm saying and it's all you can also
compare<00:04:48.580> this<00:04:48.760> to<00:04:48.910> how<00:04:49.030> when<00:04:49.270> Chappelle<00:04:50.200> of

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
Chappelle's Show or I mean how

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.190 
Chappelle's Show or I mean how
Chappelle's<00:04:52.960> Show<00:04:53.080> would<00:04:53.500> have<00:04:53.680> been<00:04:54.100> if<00:04:54.430> he

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
Chappelle's Show would have been if he

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.930 
Chappelle's Show would have been if he
had<00:04:56.200> continued<00:04:56.830> with<00:04:57.040> the<00:04:57.160> 50<00:04:57.520> million<00:04:57.730> dollar

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
had continued with the 50 million dollar

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.570 
had continued with the 50 million dollar
deal<00:04:58.240> and<00:04:58.510> caught<00:04:59.050> that<00:04:59.290> dumb<00:04:59.830> down<00:05:00.040> effect

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
deal and caught that dumb down effect

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.310 
deal and caught that dumb down effect
that<00:05:01.030> i'm<00:05:01.150> pretty<00:05:01.390> sure<00:05:01.600> was<00:05:01.780> going<00:05:01.900> to<00:05:01.960> happen

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
that i'm pretty sure was going to happen

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.690 
that i'm pretty sure was going to happen
within<00:05:02.470> the<00:05:02.650> next<00:05:02.710> season<00:05:03.280> and<00:05:03.460> that's

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
within the next season and that's

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.580 
within the next season and that's
probably<00:05:03.880> why<00:05:04.150> she<00:05:04.330> felt<00:05:04.570> left<00:05:04.780> part<00:05:05.440> of<00:05:05.500> the
