00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.080
 hello guys and welcome to this new one 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.590
 video is always me diego of m with a 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:16.560
 tutorial today more than anything is let's say a 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:19.470
 way to tell you explain with works 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.990
 buffer battery in PCs and why 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:27.750
 change it and then when we start with 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.359
 you want to see the battery in this case 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.529
 swab is under the video card then 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.270
 nor tool and let me explain 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:39.920
 I'm going to remove the card for what it is used for 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.520
 what you need to change the buffer battery 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.739
 then the battery practically buffers 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:51.270
 keeps the things we have saved 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.390
 in the bios that is mainly so 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.719
 it's not a computer you overclock with 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:05.629
 or serious stuff there is only the date 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:05.629
 mainly and the boot or there is the 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.549
 selected the hard disk you have to do 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.299
 restart the operating system when there 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.100
 notice that the buffer battery 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.860
 discharge when every time he went by 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.380
 restarting your pc tells you it is not 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.860
 no hard disk was found or that 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.560
 however it is not does not start goes into 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.439
 bios because there is not a boot that was 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.710
 defined and there is not even the date and 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.920
 this of course even if someone 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.140
 power clock that also eliminates italy of 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.390
 overclock and in fact remove remits 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.130
 buffer battery is also used to make 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.960
 for cleaning or to reset 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.570
 everything that is inside the 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.550
 let's say the bios that can be a 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.560
 overclock went wrong then 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.210
 our principal does not start anymore and there is 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.690
 to remove the battery change 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.850
 buffer or by itself no charge from 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.640
 remove it and keep it detached for a 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:12.040
 minute and then put it back we go to 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:15.260
 take it off there is a lever so here it is 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.060
 many say they take it off with screwdrivers 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.170
 classes and okay I'm not interested 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.880
 anything 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.600
 here's the battery now let's go to 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.440
 apply the standard 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:36.980
 let's go and put the new battery 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:38.480
 here we are and now we have applied the 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.130
 our buffer battery but of course 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.900
 the video card has to be put back 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.560
 otherwise we could not see ours 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.160
 screen and here it is done is a passage 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.870
 very simple but let's say that 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.810
 it happens mainly in the PCs that they are 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.730
 been turned off for a very long time e 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.459
 so once given to restart that the 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.330
 buffer battery has been stopped for so long 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:05.900
 time and when not calling restart it from 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.370
 this thing that is not there is not there 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.280
 it is not marked then enough 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.090
 set it up once and then of course 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.000
 battery is new and will remain saved 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.010
 our date and our settings 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.420
 bios boys with this little saw for 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.420
 today everything is beautiful
