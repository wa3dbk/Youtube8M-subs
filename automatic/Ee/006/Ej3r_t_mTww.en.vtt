actually was able to see this

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.060 
actually was able to see this
information<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.289> was<00:00:25.439> scattered<00:00:25.830> on<00:00:25.949> the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
information that was scattered on the

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.859 
information that was scattered on the
map<00:00:26.279> now<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.849> information<00:00:27.029> actually<00:00:27.480> on<00:00:27.750> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
map now this information actually on the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.359 
map now this information actually on the
front<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.470> back<00:00:28.619> on<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.920> map<00:00:29.130> on<00:00:29.340> the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
front and the back on the map on the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.679 
front and the back on the map on the
front<00:00:29.670> they<00:00:29.760> have<00:00:29.789> something<00:00:30.179> like<00:00:30.300> their

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
front they have something like their

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.659 
front they have something like their
here<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.560> location<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.189> think<00:00:32.369> over<00:00:32.579> the

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
here and a location I think over the

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.700 
here and a location I think over the
ocean<00:00:33.090> implying<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:33.989> there's<00:00:34.170> some<00:00:34.290> aliens

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
ocean implying that there's some aliens

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.680 
ocean implying that there's some aliens
or<00:00:34.890> some<00:00:35.040> things<00:00:35.219> like<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.880> again<00:00:36.239> more

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
or some things like that and again more

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.869 
or some things like that and again more
different<00:00:36.989> locations<00:00:37.440> for<00:00:37.649> cars<00:00:37.950> or<00:00:38.370> hideouts

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
different locations for cars or hideouts

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.479 
different locations for cars or hideouts
in<00:00:39.120> places<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.930> go<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.260> didn't<00:00:40.469> do<00:00:40.559> things<00:00:40.800> but

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
in places to go and didn't do things but

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.830 
in places to go and didn't do things but
on<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.790> back<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.180> probably<00:00:42.420> one<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.660> most

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
on the back is probably one of the most

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.600 
on the back is probably one of the most
important<00:00:43.350> messages<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.829> here<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.190> part
