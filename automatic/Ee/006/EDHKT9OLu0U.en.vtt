00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
this year is vital there's going to be

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.889 
this year is vital there's going to be

pressure on DeRozan Vasquez kind of

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.420 
pressure on DeRozan Vasquez kind of
comes<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.619> he's<00:02:10.619> already<00:02:10.649> got<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.220> the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
comes in he's already got the the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.309

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
chemistry down with these guys he's a

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.790 
chemistry down with these guys he's a
disturbed

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
disturbed

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.500 
disturbed
the<00:02:14.160> ball<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.520> when<00:02:14.610> he<00:02:14.700> when<00:02:15.030> he<00:02:15.150> gets<00:02:15.180> hot

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
the ball and when he when he gets hot

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.840 
the ball and when he when he gets hot
from<00:02:15.810> three<00:02:16.140> look<00:02:17.100> out<00:02:17.280> because<00:02:17.670> that's

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
from three look out because that's

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.370 
from three look out because that's
that's<00:02:18.180> another<00:02:18.420> offensive<00:02:18.930> threat<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:19.350> I

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
that's another offensive threat so I

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.680 
that's another offensive threat so I
think<00:02:19.800> his<00:02:20.460> contribution<00:02:21.240> as<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:21.450> point

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
think his contribution as that point

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.530 
think his contribution as that point
guard<00:02:21.750> off<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.170> bench<00:02:22.350> this<00:02:22.560> year<00:02:22.620> is

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
guard off the bench this year is

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.790
