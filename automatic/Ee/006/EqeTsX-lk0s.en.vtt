00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.489
 to make it 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.230
 but one Sunday afternoon in November of the year 97 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.750
 when the talk came up among some young people of that time to create a group 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.950
 of music that praise goodbye 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.630
 counting it with no developed talent or any support from someone 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.960
 with experience in the field 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.870

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.130
 bought a second hand casyc keyboard player 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.690
 with which the first sounds of what today is the ministry sounded 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.160
 of praise created 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.140
 in the second attempt to form a musical group 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.380
 since the first of the attempts had failed in previous years 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.090
 the names that can be mentioned of those who initiated the ministry that 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.130
 task are

 Roberto Pereyra in San Fernando 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.969
 a few days later they reported on basel 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:21.140
 and some people were added 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.370
 being them garment rivera

 nor visa among others 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.020
 even the talent had not flowed 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.150
 but if something is left over in each of the people who were taking seriously the 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.490
 idea of ​​the ministry in the Canary Islands 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.200
 a commitment to them 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.179
 some of the members started 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:46.179
 to see how previous 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.320
 intimidates already the general bases of guitar agents to improve their technique 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.730
 enthusing like this

 also gives piano lessons could not miss 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.180
 and César Lara with Alfonso Gómez were the first teachers of extreme 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.520
 act of roberto 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.580
 the desire to improve by force 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.979
 the commitment to God was evident 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.629
 to such an extent that they were being relegated to the background many of 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.989
 the activities that I eat 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.019
 gral 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.940
 we talk about football meetings in case of the lookouts 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.029
 or the goings to the stadium grocery store 

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:28.459
 the organization of dramas for special events in the church 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:29.489
 etc 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.769
 everything remains and they have secondary because the priority will be music 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:34.629
 the quality 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.949
 this should have alcohol in the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ should be 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:40.299
 acceptable 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.429
 the need to have to make inroads between and was great 

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:47.459
 and the quality in the execution of the instruments that was minimal was chosen 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.299
 for singing accompanied by tracks produced by other carving artists 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.279
 National and international 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:57.649
 one of the first intoned praises with track musical background was initiated 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:58.269
 Y 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.489
 originally produced so mysterious 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.319
 the time came 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.319
 in which with the great support that always 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:11.439
 if followed by two participations, look at each of the services 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:12.909
 Sunday night 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.799
 and the president 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.679
 way was greater 

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:18.949
 then and to the keyboard 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.949
 and the classic flame brand jarque guitar had always been 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:28.329
 after a while 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.379
 taught me allowed the great blessing of the reconciliation of 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.679
 our dear brother 

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:36.089
 they entertained them to caracas 

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:39.089
 an invitation to join the ministry 

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:43.119
 in musical instruments 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.039
 always the idea of ​​getting to advance with excellence prevailing god 

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:51.609
 In that effort, it was thought to buy the first musical instruments for 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.679
 services I follow from the ministry of praise 

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:56.729
 if he bought the Mexican 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:59.789
 the colita battery that is secondary currently 

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:00.689
 Guitar 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.269
 white telematics a Corinth ship which has already been sold 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.399
 and the electroacoustic guitar that is currently in use 

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:11.969
 the money was provided by God through the sale of used clothing, food and 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:15.449
 generous offering of many of the brothers of this congregation 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:18.489
 and some others alien to our church 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.519
 the support of our pastor and his wife has always existed 

00:04:22.309 --> 00:04:25.309
 they have never left us alone and in the economic aspect 

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:29.240
 courteous donoso while the provision of the Lord comes 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.360
 it was crazy to think of a debt greater than 20 thousand that you leave in instruments that 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.259
 we had done 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.689
 as always the idea prevailed 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:40.849
 and they were left lady advances with demand 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:43.400
 and that has great implications 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.789
 It was also necessary to think about improving the sound equipment to understand 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.090
 Until that moment, only 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.080
 a 50-amp water amplifier stopped microphone 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.559
 nobody knows 

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:56.879
 and two bell horns commonly known as 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.099
 perhaps in actions in the rural area 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.099
 to communicate its activities to the population 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.129
 the initiative of the males 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:07.400
 is a manufacturer 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.339
 two lines with wooden drawer 

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:12.770
 they armed themselves and bought the speakers to improve the sound 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:14.960
 it was not the big thing 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.960
 they also got into debt a few days after the purchase of 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.180
 gomez loves sound for 24 channels 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.150
 which they adapted to the existing amplifier 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.349
 the purchase and how he does not have eleven that chávez in that time 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:28.599
 it was hell 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:32.620
 later it was verified other teachers and that destiny was much 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.909
 but if it will be reached ao and the voices 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:36.099
 everything was work 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:40.009
 both to improve the musical quality and to improve the team 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:43.009
 sales travel and debts could not miss 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:47.540
 but in everything and we have always seen the hand of God giving support 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.890
 and the stability to keep work that is good ten days 

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:53.410
 as days go by 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.869
 people will be integrating the ministry 

00:05:55.869 --> 00:05:59.179
 seeing the way they were not being used to restore their 

00:05:59.179 --> 00:05:59.919
 praise 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:04.090
 at that time it had been the first and the only evangelical church in santa 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.189
 cross of the quiche 

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:06.809
 brother carlos mejía 

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:10.729
 had started Sunday school a teaching and updating job 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:14.499
 musical to improve praise and learn so much new 

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:17.829
 this work was then succeeded by the praise ministry of our 

00:06:17.829 --> 00:06:18.520
 church 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.250
 since most of the cases honed by the ministry were modern and the 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.240
 congregation was not used to 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.020
 The explosion 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.789
 in the year 99 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:31.210
 my brother president of the capital city was transferred to work in 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.889
 the public ministry of the department 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:36.949
 this here has been a member of the church's praise ministry 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:38.080
 family of god 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.669
 in brothers pastor luis fernando suárez 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:44.219
 my real purpose of God in that transfer wants to come and teach us the 

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:47.219
 reason 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.330
 my brother Eduardo Rosales was not long has Santa Cruz del Quiché 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.330
 however he was always in costa rica family 

00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:58.789
 commitments to come and teach us with the word of God 

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:02.129
 the way of humala madrid will present the dance on the altar 

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:06.499
 there are many months he traveled on Saturday afternoon in his car 

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:09.990
 to come to support us and in no time there is an interest beyond 

00:07:09.989 --> 00:07:11.939
 of God's call to support them 

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:14.939
 and do it with ferrari 

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:20.800
 we pray to god for the restoration of his life he tithes blessings on his 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.949
 family wherever they 

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:27.189
 we also remember in a very special way the work that brother Javier 

00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:28.389
 Garcia made 

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:30.439
 with the work of improving things 

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:34.059
 At the beginning of the year 2006, the first attempt to improve things 

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:37.379
 the work of his brother Javier 

00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:41.310
 for some months neither the intention was to canonize the four voices for 

00:07:41.309 --> 00:07:44.110
 build the harmony of choirs in the works 

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.240
 undoubtedly the planting spycher the brothers mentioned 

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.960
 we more that escape from memory 

00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:55.839
 the Canadians a great effort made by each of them
