 try but listen to me be careful because 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.480
 after three months they are going to 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.730
 start charging seriously I thought that 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.350
 was there just three months and already a 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.640
 lots of people believe that but I'm going to 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.650

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.340

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.340

 you are enjoying your three months 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.640
 free of music a service that already 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.770
 we talked last week but you knew 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.290
 that when you finish your trial period you 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.000
 they will start charging automatically 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.340
 good calm then you 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.559
 We teach how to avoid it when 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.780
 You started using music you chose 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.870
 a free trial period that will last 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.660
 three months well, in case you were not 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.879
 aware part of this process included 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.670
 agree to pay for a subscription to hbo 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.640
 music once the period of 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.149
 try this for Peru means that it 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.610
 will charge 5 dollars a month to your monthly 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:14.700
 credit card without you going back 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.590
 to ask anything of course not all 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.720
 they will want to pay when the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.940
 free subscription so you 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.729
 we recommend disabling this option 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.430
 from her if you belong to the group 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.000
 of which I do not think to pay for this 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.180
 you must follow a few steps 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.100
 between the music and click on the icon 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.460
 profile located in the upper corner 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.060
 left there select to see Paul iby 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.190
 and enter your password if they ask you 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.550
 then go to the subscriptions section and 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.710
 click to manage here you can see that 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.140
 had your free trial and the 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.210
 renewal options so what 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.760
 you have to do is disable the button 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.770
 of automatic renewal and no longer you 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.800
 they will begin to collect at the end of the three 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.780
 months of course if you decide later 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.060
 if you want to pay to have the 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.850

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.369
 all these steps and enable the function 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.130
