how<00:00:05.540> you<00:00:05.570> can<00:00:05.990> create<00:00:06.230> such<00:00:06.710> objects<00:00:07.370> with

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.580 
how you can create such objects with

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.209 
how you can create such objects with
dynamesh<00:00:08.149> and<00:00:08.450> which<00:00:09.289> are<00:00:09.499> the<00:00:09.679> problems<00:00:10.129> that

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219 
dynamesh and which are the problems that

Shift F on the keyboard you can see

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.330 
Shift F on the keyboard you can see
dynamesh<00:01:19.869> created<00:01:20.380> polygroups<00:01:20.979> on<00:01:21.190> the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
dynamesh created polygroups on the

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.060 
dynamesh created polygroups on the

inside and another one on the outside
and<00:01:24.340> this<00:01:24.670> is<00:01:24.729> what<00:01:25.720> causes<00:01:26.170> problems<00:01:26.800> if<00:01:27.100> you

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
and this is what causes problems if you

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.950 
and this is what causes problems if you
want<00:01:27.520> to<00:01:27.670> subtract<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:29.619> backside<00:01:30.520> I<00:01:30.960> will

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
want to subtract this backside I will

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.400 
want to subtract this backside I will
duplicate<00:01:32.740> this<00:01:33.190> model<00:01:33.960> holding<00:01:34.960> ctrl<00:01:35.380> shift

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
duplicate this model holding ctrl shift

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.120 
duplicate this model holding ctrl shift
and<00:01:35.830> D

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.770

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.930 
brush selected and pressing alt again
I'm<00:01:47.369> just<00:01:47.940> drawing<00:01:48.299> out<00:01:48.630> cube<00:01:49.440> pressing<00:01:50.220> W<00:01:50.430> and

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
I'm just drawing out cube pressing W and

00:01:50.940 --> 00:02:02.170 
I'm just drawing out cube pressing W and
reposition<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:53.540> have<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.750> be<00:01:54.930> scaled

the<00:02:08.570> canvas<00:02:08.600> twice<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:11.030> should<00:02:11.450> subtract<00:02:12.200> this

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
the canvas twice it should subtract this

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.830 
the canvas twice it should subtract this
cube<00:02:12.950> from<00:02:13.250> this<00:02:13.430> endure<00:02:13.820> but<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:14.300> didn't<00:02:14.630> it

cube from this endure but it didn't it

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.500 
cube from this endure but it didn't it
just<00:02:15.110> closed<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.560> hole<00:02:15.800> and<00:02:16.100> added<00:02:16.880> this<00:02:17.150> cube

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
just closed the hole and added this cube

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.720 
just closed the hole and added this cube
to<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.780> cylinder<00:02:18.560> which<00:02:18.920> is<00:02:19.070> not<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.430> what<00:02:19.700> I

holding ctrl and click and drag on the
canvas<00:02:48.300> twice<00:02:48.990> it<00:02:49.470> will<00:02:49.830> subtract<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:51.060> cube

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
canvas twice it will subtract the cube

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.920 
canvas twice it will subtract the cube
from<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:52.050> cylinder<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.710> I<00:02:53.160> get<00:02:54.120> exactly<00:02:54.750> what

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
from the cylinder and I get exactly what

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.470 
from the cylinder and I get exactly what
I<00:02:54.960> was<00:02:55.230> looking<00:02:55.290> for<00:02:55.860> so<00:02:56.520> make<00:02:56.700> sure<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:57.210> have

I was looking for so make sure you have
only<00:02:57.840> one<00:02:58.410> polygroup<00:02:59.180> in<00:03:00.180> dynamesh<00:03:00.750> if<00:03:01.080> you

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
only one polygroup in dynamesh if you

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.460 
only one polygroup in dynamesh if you
want<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.620> make<00:03:02.430> additional<00:03:03.470> subtractions

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
want to make additional subtractions

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.330
