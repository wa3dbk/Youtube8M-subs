00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
fight here in Vegas in this fight I

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.440 
fight here in Vegas in this fight I
think<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.620> Takeya<00:00:38.040> Mizugaki<00:00:38.160> has<00:00:38.969> got<00:00:39.180> great

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
think that Takeya Mizugaki has got great

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.600 
think that Takeya Mizugaki has got great
hands<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.260> because<00:00:40.590> it's<00:00:40.860> got<00:00:40.980> very<00:00:41.340> very

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
hands and because it's got very very

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.270 
hands and because it's got very very
good<00:00:41.850> takedown<00:00:42.480> defense<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:43.290> think<00:00:43.890> Faber<00:00:44.160> is

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
good takedown defense I think Faber is

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.590 
good takedown defense I think Faber is
going<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.489> have<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.789> get<00:00:44.940> him<00:00:45.030> down<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.239> beat

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
going to have to get him down to beat

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.569 
going to have to get him down to beat
him<00:00:45.750> like<00:00:46.320> Faber<00:00:46.620> said<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.100> an<00:00:47.219> interview<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
him like Faber said in an interview the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.819 
him like Faber said in an interview the
other<00:00:47.610> day<00:00:47.700> Takeya<00:00:48.539> Mizugaki<00:00:48.660> can<00:00:49.379> take<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.710> to

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
other day Takeya Mizugaki can take it to

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.650 
other day Takeya Mizugaki can take it to
a<00:00:49.860> decision<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.579> win<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:50.850> decision<00:00:51.539> you

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
a decision and win that decision you

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.869 
a decision and win that decision you
know<00:00:51.780> by<00:00:52.289> out<00:00:52.469> striking<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.280> out<00:00:53.370> working

you he favored doesn't want that to
happen<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.250> think<00:00:56.460> for<00:00:56.610> favored<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.940> win<00:00:56.969> this

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
in WC and it was actually kind of a

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.149 
in WC and it was actually kind of a
fluke<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.750> mean<00:01:15.869> he<00:01:15.960> just<00:01:15.990> he<00:01:16.409> made<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> mistake

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
fluke I mean he just he made a mistake

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.710 
fluke I mean he just he made a mistake
and<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.430> guy<00:01:17.549> took<00:01:17.610> advantage<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.270> he's<00:01:18.689> a

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
and the guy took advantage of it he's a

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.170 
and the guy took advantage of it he's a
very<00:01:18.869> tough<00:01:19.350> fighter<00:01:19.619> very<00:01:19.979> calculated<00:01:20.700> he

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
very tough fighter very calculated he

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.480 
very tough fighter very calculated he
knows<00:01:21.390> what<00:01:21.540> he's<00:01:21.689> doing<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.710> think<00:01:22.740> Joseph

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
knows what he's doing and I think Joseph

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.539 
knows what he's doing and I think Joseph
on<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.119> other<00:01:24.270> hand<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.659> very<00:01:24.720> uncalculated

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
on the other hand is very uncalculated

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.590 
on the other hand is very uncalculated
certainly<00:01:26.549> knows<00:01:26.700> what<00:01:26.880> he's<00:01:27.000> doing<00:01:27.360> but<00:01:27.479> it

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
certainly knows what he's doing but it

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.289 
certainly knows what he's doing but it
is<00:01:27.689> very<00:01:27.950> sporadic<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.610> think<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.060> maybe

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
is very sporadic and I think that maybe

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.590 
is very sporadic and I think that maybe
what<00:01:31.009> where<00:01:32.009> he<00:01:32.189> can<00:01:32.340> win<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.670> fight<00:01:32.909> as<00:01:33.119> if

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
what where he can win that fight as if

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.810 
what where he can win that fight as if
