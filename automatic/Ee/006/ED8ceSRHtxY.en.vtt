CONTAINMENT HAS DECREASED TO 5%.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.780
THE NUMBER OF FIREFIGHTERS

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.320
BATTLING THE FLAMES HAS DOUBLED

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.720
FROM THIS TIME YESTERDAY.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.380
LINES ALONG THE SOUTH SIDE.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.650
BUT THIS IS THE NORTH SIDE OF

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.420
THE FIRE.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.050
THIS IS THE NORTH SIDE OF THE

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.990
AMERICAN RIVER CANYON WHERE THE

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.950
FIRE IS BLOWING UP AND AIR

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.160
TANKERS ARE TRYING TO PAINT A

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.190
LINE OF RETARDANT ON THE

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.990
RIDGELINE TO PROTECT THE HOMES

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.130
THAT ARE RIGHT ON THE RICHLAND.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.930
YOU WILL SEE A WHITE -- ON THE

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.630
RIDGE LINE.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.930
YOU WILL SEE A WHITE HOME WITH A

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.370
GREEN ROOF.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.070
YOU CAN SEE THE BLACK PLUME OF

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.540
SMOKE BUILDING BEHIND IT.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.110
THE GROUND CREWS ARE HAVING A

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.540
DIFFICULT TIME MAKING DIRECT

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.680
ACCESS TO THIS FIRE.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.140
THAT IS WHERE THE AIR TANKERS

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.550
ARE COMING IN.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.050
CREWS WORK ON THE GROUND TO

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.520
PROTECT THE SOUTH SIDE.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.720
FROM THE AIR AND DEEP

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.350
INTO THE

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.590
SMOKE-FILLED CANYON, FIRE CREWS

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.120
CONTINUED TO BATTLE AN INTENSE

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.960
AND DIFFICULT THINGS FIRE.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.330
EARNING ON BOTH SIDES OF THE

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.270
AMERICAN RIVER.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.730
WHILE -- BURNING

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.000
ON BOTH SIDES

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.770
OF THE AMERICAN RIVER, WHILE

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.940
RESIDENTS ON BOTH SIDES

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:04.470
SUFFER

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.810
SLEEPLESSNESS WITH WORRY.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:09.040
THIS IS THE VIEW

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.440
FROM ETHAN

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.210
SNYDER'S HOME.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.680
HE IS READY TO GO IF THE FLAMES

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.180
GET ANY CLOSER.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.220
IT WAS STAYING PUT FOR A DAY.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.820
THEN IN ABOUT TWO HOURS, IT

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.160
JUMPED HALF A MILE THIS WAY.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.790
DURING THE COOLEST HOURS OF

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.230
THE DAY, CREWS WORKED OVERNIGHT.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.790
THEY USED A METHOD CALLED BACK

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.300
BURNING.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.670
IT IS A WAY THAT WE FIGHT

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.300
FIRE WITH FIRE.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.500
WE ELIMINATE ALL THE FUELS

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.670
BETWEEN AN ESTABLISHED CONTROL

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.270
IN.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.470
IT IS THE -- CONTROL LINE.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.140
IT IS THE NORTH SIDE THAT IT

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.540
APPEARS TO BE RUNNING UP --

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.580
RUNNING UNCHECKED.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.280
IS IN MORE REMOTE AND RUGGED

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.420
CONTERRAIN.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.750
.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.630
WEATHER AND TERRAIN DICTATE THE

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.190
NEXT MOVE DID RESIDENTS AND

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.830
FIREFIGHTERS ALIKE PUT THEIR

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.530
HOPES ON THE EVER SHIFTING WIND.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.630
AS THE VALLEY HEATS UP,

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:05.200
WE

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.770
WILL SEE THE WIND SHIFT FROM

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:06.200
DOWN VALLEY TO RALLY WIND.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.800
.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.400
WE SEE IT COMING TOWARDS US

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.840
RIGHT NOW UP THE CANYON.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.010
THAT SHIFT IS UNDERWAY RIGHT

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.510
NOW.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.480
WE ARE AT THE HEAD OF THE FIRE,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.780
IN FRONT OF THE FIRE RIGHT NOW.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:22.420
YOU CAN SEE THE LEFT SIDE OF

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.020
YOUR SCREEN IS THE SOUTH SIDE OF

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.220
THE FIRE NEAR POLLOCK PINES.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.720
THE RIGHT SIDE OF YOUR SCREEN IS

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.190
THE NORTHERN SIDE OF THE

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.590
AMERICAN RIVER CANYON.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.790
THAT IS WHERE THOSE

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.790
HOMES ARE

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.200
ACROSS THE HILLSIDE AND THE FIRE

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.760
IS GETTING INTO DIFFICULT

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.000
TERRAIN FOR FIREFIGHTERS TO

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.170
ACCESS.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.800
NOT A LOT OF ROADS OUT THERE

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.100
MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.840
GET THERE.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.840
NOW THE WIND AND SMOKE WAS GOING

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.840
DOWN CANYON.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.070
YOU CAN SEE BEHIND US, CLEARLY

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.810
NOW, THAT IS COMING BACK UP

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.280
SLOPE, OF CANYON NOW.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.810
FLYING OVER MY HEAD IS THE DC-10

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.160
SETTING UP FOR A DROP.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.260
HE WILL BE COMING IN RIGHT DOWN

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.630
THIS RIDGELINE AND PUTTING SOME

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.960
RETIRED AND NEAR THOSE HOMES TO

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.500
PROTECT THEM.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.060
YOU HAVE BEEN OUT THERE SO

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.470
LONG.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.400
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR ME

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.770
WITH THE D.C. OVERHEAD -- THE

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.240
DC-10 OVERHEAD.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.440
IT IS AMAZING HOW THEY

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.870
HAVE BEEN

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:21.510
ABLE TO PROTECT THESE HOMES WITH

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.940
THE BREEZE OR CONDITIONS IN THE

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.280
LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.580
ABSOLUTELY.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.210
THEY CREDIT A LOT OF THAT TO THE

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.480
HOMEOWNERS ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.720
THE FIRE.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.280
FIRES ARE DRIVEN BY TWO THINGS,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.260
TERRAIN AND WEATHER.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.820
IT IS EXTREME HERE.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:38.320
IT IS VERY STEEP, RUNS THE FIRE

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.830
RIGHT UP THE HILLSIDES.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:40.160
THE WIND IS PUSHING IT RIGHT

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.600
ALONG AS WELL.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.100
YOU

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.470
HAVE TWO OF THE WORST-CASE

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.900
SCENARIOS HERE.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.500
RESIDENTS LOVE THIS AREA, BUT

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.740
THEY HAVE DONE THEIR PART TO

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:52.310
PROTECT THEIR HOMES BY BUILDING

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.610
THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AROUND

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.780
THEIR HOMES.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.240
FIRE CREWS HAVE THE SPACE THEY

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.780
NEED TO DO THEIR WORK.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.580
YOU SEE THE DC-10, PERHAPS

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.750
SETTING UP TO COME IN BEHIND

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:02.480
THIS RIDGE NOW, THE NORTHERN

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.720
SIDE OF THE FIRE.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.560
THIS IS THE GOLIATH OF THE

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.990
AIRFLEET.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.030
THIS PLAN CAN DROP THREE TO FOUR

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.590
TIMES THE LOAD OF THE SMALLER

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.060
PLANES.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.600
IF WE HAVE TIME TO STAY WITH

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.370
THIS, WE CAN GET THE SHOT.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.970
AN UNUSUAL SIGHT TO BE ABLE

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:23.140
TO SEE THIS AS THEY ARE DOING

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.270
IT.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.470
YOU DON'T SEE THAT ALL THAT

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.910
OFTEN.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:30.040
REMARKABLE, THERE AND

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.910
COME

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.210
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ARE TRY TO

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.910
FOCUS ON SUCH A SPECIFIC AREA,

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.280
RIGHT OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.950
THAT RIDGE, TRYING TO CREATE

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.280
EVEN MORE DEFENSIBLE SPACE

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.650
BETWEEN THE FIRE AND THE BACKS

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.190
OF THOSE HOMES.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.660
WHAT

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.290
YOU WILL SEE HERE COME A

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.490
FRONT OF ME, IS A SMALLER LEAD

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.090
LANE.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.300
-- PLANE.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.650
HE CIRCLES THAN DOES THE

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.540
SURVEILLANCE AND THAT

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.700
PRACTICE

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.470
RUN.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.070
HE WILL GUIDE IN THE PLANES.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.310
HE WILL LEAVE A PUFF OF SMOKE

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.580
LIKE AN AROMATIC LANE,

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.380
CONNECTING THE DOTS, LEADING

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.350
THAT LARGE PLANE IN.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.320
THIS POINT HAS COME HERE AND

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.550
ONCE.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.020
LOOKS LIKE HE IS SAID TO COME IN

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.990
ON THIS RUN RIGHT NOW.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.320
I AM TRYING TO LISTEN TO THE

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.530
RADIO TRAFFIC.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.860
LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE SETTING UP

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:19.960
FOR THE DROP.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.800
THEY HAVE TO BE RIGHT ON

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.000
TARGET AS WE CONTINUE

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.600
TO WATCH

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.230
THIS DC-10 FLY OVER THE SCENE.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.540
THERE WAS THE SMOKE TRAIL

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.100
RIGHT THERE.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.670
RIGHT HERE IS WHERE HE IS GOING

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.040
TO DROP STARTING RIGHT NOW.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.510
THERE

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:37.040
IS WHERE THE SMOKE TRAIL

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.150
STARTED, RIGHT ON TARGET.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.350
IT IS NOW BETWEEN THE

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.950
HOME, THE

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:42.150
RIDGELINE AND THE ACTIVE FIRE

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.380
LINE.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.020
HE PRETTY MUCH PAINTED THAT

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.350
ENTIRE RIDGELINE UP TO THE HOME.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.190
SMALLER AIR TANKERS HAVE DONE A

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:50.790
DIFFICULT PATH -- DIFFICULT TASK

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.430
OF GETTING DOWN IN THE CANYON.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.200
THE SMALLER PLANES CAN DO THAT.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.500
HE WAS CONNECTING THE DOTS

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.130
BETWEEN THE SMALLER DROPS AND

00:06:59.130 --> 00:06:59.300
PAINTING NOW ON RIGHT ALONG THE

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.200
TOP.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.300
HOPEFULLY THAT WILL GIVE CREWS

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:04.870
THE TIME THEY NEED TO GET SOME

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:05.340
DOZERS IN THERE AND MOVE IN

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.470
BEHIND THE RETARDANT.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.110
IF IT WAS NOT THERE, IT WOULD BE

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.610
TOO HARD FOR THEM.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:11.910
THAT IS A GREAT WAY TO

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:16.280
EXPLAIN IT.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:16.420
THEY ARE CONNECTING THE

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.320
DOTS

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:18.920
WITH THE LITTLE PLANES AND

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.320
CREATING A TARGET AND BRING IN

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.220
THE LARGER ONE.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.160
WHAT A.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:26.360
THANK YOU SO MUCH -- WHAT A

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.260
IM.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.140
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
