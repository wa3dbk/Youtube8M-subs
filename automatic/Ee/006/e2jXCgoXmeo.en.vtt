before he went to the air force and the
only<00:00:20.250> thing<00:00:20.430> that's<00:00:20.609> missing<00:00:20.820> on<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.300> is<00:00:21.600> the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
only thing that's missing on this is the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.689 
only thing that's missing on this is the
little<00:00:22.170> bridge<00:00:23.060> lost<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.269> many<00:00:24.510> years<00:00:24.689> ago

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.479 

so<00:00:29.699> yeah<00:00:30.289> pretty<00:00:31.289> good<00:00:31.529> scale<00:00:31.800> at<00:00:31.949> size<00:00:32.160> ship

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
so yeah pretty good scale at size ship

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:40.369 
so yeah pretty good scale at size ship
I'd<00:00:32.700> say<00:00:36.350> on<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.410> bottom<00:00:38.629> lost<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.809> stand<00:00:40.110> but

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379

I'm<00:00:40.710> assuming<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.700> where<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.030> would<00:00:42.090> go

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
I'm assuming this is where it would go

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.880 
I'm assuming this is where it would go
