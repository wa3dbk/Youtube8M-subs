00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.200 
figure and as you can tell the lakes
only<00:04:57.120> go<00:04:57.330> out<00:04:58.190> they'll<00:04:59.190> only<00:04:59.310> stay<00:04:59.730> in<00:04:59.910> about

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
only go out they'll only stay in about

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.900 
only go out they'll only stay in about
that<00:05:00.600> far<00:05:00.870> apart<00:05:01.190> Daniken<00:05:02.190> figure<00:05:02.550> you<00:05:02.730> can

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
that far apart Daniken figure you can

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.470 
that far apart Daniken figure you can
put<00:05:03.180> them<00:05:03.330> at<00:05:03.540> like<00:05:03.780> any<00:05:04.700> direction<00:05:05.700> so<00:05:06.180> this

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
put them at like any direction so this

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.870 
put them at like any direction so this
is<00:05:06.510> kind<00:05:07.410> of<00:05:07.530> limited<00:05:07.710> and<00:05:08.010> articulation<00:05:08.730> a

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
is kind of limited and articulation a

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.440 
is kind of limited and articulation a
lot<00:05:09.300> of<00:05:09.450> the<00:05:09.630> saga<00:05:10.460> figures<00:05:11.460> have<00:05:12.000> kind<00:05:12.390> of

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
lot of the saga figures have kind of

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.450 
lot of the saga figures have kind of
been<00:05:12.540> limited<00:05:12.990> in<00:05:13.080> articulation<00:05:13.650> that's<00:05:14.280> what

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
been limited in articulation that's what

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.120 
been limited in articulation that's what
kind<00:05:14.640> of<00:05:14.670> scared<00:05:15.000> me<00:05:15.090> about<00:05:15.330> getting<00:05:15.510> this

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
kind of scared me about getting this

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.090 
kind of scared me about getting this
like<00:05:17.130> I've<00:05:17.340> seen<00:05:17.610> a<00:05:17.640> bunch<00:05:17.940> work<00:05:18.270> like<00:05:19.110> I<00:05:19.470> think

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
like I've seen a bunch work like I think

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.880 
like I've seen a bunch work like I think
was<00:05:20.220> the<00:05:20.250> Jango<00:05:20.820> Fett<00:05:21.000> one<00:05:21.240> and<00:05:21.990> it<00:05:22.410> only<00:05:22.620> has

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
was the Jango Fett one and it only has

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.980 
was the Jango Fett one and it only has
like<00:05:23.100> five<00:05:23.460> points<00:05:24.000> of<00:05:24.090> articulation<00:05:24.180> and

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
like five points of articulation and

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.460 
like five points of articulation and
it's<00:05:25.260> just<00:05:25.440> like<00:05:25.500> an<00:05:25.680> opposing<00:05:26.160> i<00:05:26.250> i<00:05:26.520> i<00:05:27.140> i<00:05:28.140> like

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
it's just like an opposing i i i i like

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.650 
it's just like an opposing i i i i like
the<00:05:28.680> figures<00:05:29.070> but<00:05:29.310> i<00:05:29.370> hate<00:05:29.730> when<00:05:29.760> you<00:05:30.030> can't<00:05:30.270> do

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
the figures but i hate when you can't do

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.780 
the figures but i hate when you can't do
what<00:05:30.840> you<00:05:30.960> want<00:05:31.200> with<00:05:31.290> them<00:05:31.470> so<00:05:32.310> as<00:05:32.490> you<00:05:32.640> can

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
see um see if i can get Lingle you can

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.430 
see um see if i can get Lingle you can
see<00:05:38.220> he<00:05:38.490> is<00:05:38.520> a<00:05:38.640> little<00:05:38.910> shorter<00:05:39.480> and<00:05:39.690> he's<00:05:40.380> like

see he is a little shorter and he's like

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.610 
see he is a little shorter and he's like
much<00:05:40.770> more<00:05:40.800> thinner<00:05:41.370> um<00:05:41.960> he's<00:05:42.960> not<00:05:42.990> as<00:05:43.350> bulky

much more thinner um he's not as bulky
um<00:05:45.950> yeah<00:05:46.950> for<00:05:47.430> articulation<00:05:48.090> um<00:05:48.680> the<00:05:49.680> feet<00:05:50.190> do

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
um yeah for articulation um the feet do

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
the hand and one problem I have with

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.610 
the hand and one problem I have with
this<00:06:19.169> figure<00:06:20.090> if<00:06:21.090> you<00:06:21.120> turn<00:06:21.600> the<00:06:21.810> head<00:06:22.020> it<00:06:22.290> pops

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
this figure if you turn the head it pops

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.170 
this figure if you turn the head it pops
off<00:06:23.330> that<00:06:24.330> Samantha<00:06:24.840> me<00:06:24.930> because<00:06:25.320> the<00:06:25.710> neck

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
off that Samantha me because the neck

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.600 
off that Samantha me because the neck
doesn't<00:06:27.180> go<00:06:27.390> down<00:06:27.419> far<00:06:27.960> enough<00:06:28.010> to<00:06:29.010> grab<00:06:29.370> all

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
doesn't go down far enough to grab all

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.310 
doesn't go down far enough to grab all
the<00:06:29.760> way<00:06:29.880> around<00:06:30.030> those<00:06:30.450> bald<00:06:30.720> right<00:06:30.870> plus<00:06:31.169> the

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.320 
the way around those bald right plus the

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.680 
the way around those bald right plus the
ball<00:06:31.500> joint<00:06:31.770> I<00:06:31.890> think<00:06:32.100> is<00:06:32.220> a<00:06:32.250> little<00:06:32.340> um<00:06:32.700> it's

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 
ball joint I think is a little um it's

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.320 
ball joint I think is a little um it's
it's<00:06:34.050> not<00:06:34.650> curved<00:06:35.220> enough<00:06:35.580> at<00:06:35.729> the<00:06:35.850> bottom<00:06:36.210> it

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
it's not curved enough at the bottom it

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.950 
it's not curved enough at the bottom it
just<00:06:36.510> goes

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
just goes

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.680 
just goes
made<00:06:37.020> up<00:06:37.139> like<00:06:37.289> a<00:06:37.319> dome<00:06:38.900> but<00:06:39.900> it<00:06:40.139> holds<00:06:40.410> on<00:06:40.650> um

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:41.690 
made up like a dome but it holds on um

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.360 
made up like a dome but it holds on um
tight<00:06:42.690> enough<00:06:43.020> but<00:06:43.530> he<00:06:43.860> just<00:06:44.100> has<00:06:44.250> a<00:06:44.280> really

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.370 
tight enough but he just has a really

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.809 
tight enough but he just has a really
long<00:06:44.850> neck<00:06:45.380> you<00:06:46.380> know<00:06:46.530> you<00:06:47.130> can't<00:06:47.280> earn<00:06:47.550> it<00:06:47.699> by

00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:47.819 
long neck you know you can't earn it by

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:50.749 
long neck you know you can't earn it by
have<00:06:47.940> to<00:06:48.090> press<00:06:48.389> down<00:06:48.419> when<00:06:49.110> you<00:06:49.229> do<00:06:49.380> it<00:06:49.500> I'm<00:06:50.190> I

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 
have to press down when you do it I'm I

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:52.670 
have to press down when you do it I'm I
can<00:06:51.000> I<00:06:51.300> have<00:06:51.539> no<00:06:51.690> idea<00:06:51.960> if<00:06:52.050> that's<00:06:52.169> a<00:06:52.380> quality

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 
can I have no idea if that's a quality

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.240 
can I have no idea if that's a quality
control<00:06:53.220> issue<00:06:53.810> just<00:06:54.810> so<00:06:54.930> if<00:06:54.990> I<00:06:55.110> figure<00:06:55.410> it<00:06:55.620> it

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.250 
control issue just so if I figure it it

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.400 
control issue just so if I figure it it
probably<00:06:56.880> is<00:06:57.030> I<00:06:57.270> tend<00:06:57.720> to<00:06:57.810> get<00:06:57.990> a<00:06:58.050> lot<00:06:58.349> of

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.410 
probably is I tend to get a lot of

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.980 
probably is I tend to get a lot of
quality<00:06:58.949> control<00:06:59.250> figures<00:06:59.669> some<00:07:00.599> reason<00:07:00.919> um

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:02.990 
quality control figures some reason um

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.170 
quality control figures some reason um
all<00:07:03.990> knots<00:07:04.560> it's<00:07:05.099> a<00:07:05.220> pretty<00:07:05.430> nice<00:07:05.669> figure<00:07:06.090> I'm

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 
all knots it's a pretty nice figure I'm

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.760 
all knots it's a pretty nice figure I'm
still<00:07:06.479> looking<00:07:06.840> for<00:07:07.139> the<00:07:07.349> Vintage<00:07:07.740> Collection

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:07.770 
still looking for the Vintage Collection

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.400
