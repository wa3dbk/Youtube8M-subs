00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.930
 or not 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:14.349
 well I bring a gameplay of these a 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:20.060
 hard team in yemen good to fly 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:21.710
 in the 94 with unsheathed and hilt 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.300
 is what I have as the main 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.910
 secondary I carry the textuality is the 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:32.400
 from rafaela 22-23 r I think it's called yes 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:36.760
 but always and it's a normal and good 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:39.220
 good I have a streak or a sad v 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.700
 vector now then I will explain why 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:46.300
 we have more streaks to see what 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:48.489
 say good of this good first goal vtol 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.670
 and that's why I chose to upload it 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:55.000
 because it is quite difficult 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.219
 take out your cloud all in a game that does not 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.300
 you have to catch goal is how low 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:02.250
 confirmed that take the badges 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.100
 I know that you have to go to 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.980
 for the flags of 200 points are to have 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.460
 out for each little flag that you take 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.670
 your more at least for the streak of points 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.300
 well that 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:21.850
 what else to say I told you 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.850
 the gusts that I have good 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.800
 to start because the gusts are for 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.360
 that one streak takes you to the other 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.060
 that I told myself one of leads to the other 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.160
 Now, if you still give me points because 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.870
 my comrades kill and besides I 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.170
 they keep killing me it's easier for me 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:44.500
 kill then because he sees the enemy 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.010
 just then with tomato a little 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.650
 with the 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.200
 when it's there but they destroy but 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.170
 nothing happens although more than a little and with 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.570
 the points that they give me 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.320
 well get a chat because they do not 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.690
 is this the won game 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.909
 you know where the enemies come from 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.170
 They also give enough points as you can 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.450
 be a little careful you can get 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.209
 easy 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.660
 good to see here and I take out the v me what 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:16.050
 they have destroyed him cool yes and I'm going to put 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.870
 a button 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:25.200
 what else to say it to you because I have a 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:31.070
 what I wear hard line hardness and 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.070
 engineer because to see hard line so 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:38.380
 to give me nachos before because 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.380
 I always like forgetting 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:46.269
 for for good to shudder me so much 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.269
 when shooting you know 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.160
 we have a control the truth 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.750
 like all the times like all the 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.750
 charges of fact 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.140
 I'm going 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.020
 Well, that's why I'm wearing a nothing and commotion 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.090
 adore 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.630
 play more with c 4 the truth is a 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:24.590
 last four days ago and loaders that 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:27.319
 four barbarity ago 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.450
 that goes on the gameplay to see ya I've 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.200
 said because I've chosen it because quite 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.200
 difficult to draw you 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.170
 and here I go for the sad v right now 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.939
 I'm trying to stop, I'm not 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.659
 enough time without finding the 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:47.159
 I really do not know where they are I did not know where 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.159
 they were here he killed enough 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.370
 see what happens 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.460
 as it happened and now I'm more but now 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.100
 you will see if I stay here thinking 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:02.420
 they forgive coming and you see that it is towards 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.420
 that he was waiting for 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.040
 we were here I was not here right now 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.750
 of taking out the ub sad I just needed a 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.820
 pair of more casualties 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.940
 Now he is quite nervous because 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:18.459
 well I do not know 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.459
 has a good run and I did not want it 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.890
 this is my second gameplay that I upload to 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.890
 channel 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.419
 but it was a little the introduction look 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:34.190
 here in sangÃ¼esa and already with the chat you see 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.410
 where are people is much easier 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.310
 kill people with that see that a little 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.310
 of care here now 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.670
 good what the video said second for 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.160
 the channel 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:49.729
 and I'm now working on uploading 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:53.439
 some more I'm waiting to get out 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.439
 a job with chin network 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.460
 cr and some zombies 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:14.330
 I'm going with the low 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.909
 now the strip of our 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.039
 Well the truth is that everything was 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:22.879
 quite pretty bad very badly 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:26.560
 true because you can also hide 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:28.419
 anywhere is good 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.550
 the truth is that it is quite bad and very 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:33.490
 bad very few casualties I think I do myself 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.780
 I made six casualties seven as much very 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.020
 few 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.840
 now it explains a little 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.090
 this gameplay I think it ruins me with 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:47.289
 the cinema mode because you already know that if you 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:50.970
 goes then how I had the capturing 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:57.960
 turned on I had to turn off it's just going 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:06:01.050
 about 6 minutes on Saturday 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.660
 well a game now within a 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.750
 little will be finished has the button removed and 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:09.200
 I think he sent an uncle or something 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:12.350
 the good game is over you see it here 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:16.030
 the vtol is over and I go and I think that 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.030
 it was going to end the game
