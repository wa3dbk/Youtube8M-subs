00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
a personal perspective is this thing

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.509 
a personal perspective is this thing
although<00:00:28.869> it<00:00:29.080> looks<00:00:29.320> like<00:00:29.529> a<00:00:29.560> control<00:00:30.130> panel

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 
although it looks like a control panel

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.429 
although it looks like a control panel
from<00:00:30.640> the<00:00:30.820> Death<00:00:31.029> Star<00:00:31.359> it's<00:00:31.810> actually<00:00:32.320> the

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
from the Death Star it's actually the

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.560 
from the Death Star it's actually the
easiest<00:00:33.030> multi-effects<00:00:34.030> you're<00:00:34.180> ever<00:00:34.330> going

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
easiest multi-effects you're ever going

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.990 
easiest multi-effects you're ever going
to<00:00:34.660> find<00:00:34.840> and<00:00:35.170> actually<00:00:35.650> don't<00:00:35.860> know<00:00:36.070> how<00:00:36.340> boss

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
to find and actually don't know how boss

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.060 
to find and actually don't know how boss

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
or roland or anybody else are going to

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.180 
or roland or anybody else are going to
make<00:00:39.220> something<00:00:39.460> easier<00:00:40.120> than<00:00:40.300> this<00:00:40.450> to<00:00:40.660> use

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
make something easier than this to use

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.350 
make something easier than this to use
and<00:00:42.190> the<00:00:42.280> thing<00:00:42.460> that<00:00:42.610> really<00:00:42.790> amazes<00:00:43.120> me

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
and the thing that really amazes me

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.140 
and the thing that really amazes me
about<00:00:43.930> the<00:00:44.350> next-generation<00:00:45.100> Kazem<00:00:45.910> amp

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
about the next-generation Kazem amp

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.810 
about the next-generation Kazem amp
modeling<00:00:46.540> that's<00:00:46.780> in<00:00:46.930> this<00:00:47.170> thing<00:00:47.410> is<00:00:47.760> as<00:00:48.760> a

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
modeling that's in this thing is as a

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.730 
modeling that's in this thing is as a
guitar<00:00:49.270> player<00:00:49.300> what<00:00:50.140> I'm<00:00:50.260> looking<00:00:50.590> forward

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:50.740 
guitar player what I'm looking forward

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.580 
guitar player what I'm looking forward
at<00:00:50.890> amp<00:00:51.070> is<00:00:51.400> for<00:00:51.940> it<00:00:52.030> to<00:00:52.150> respond<00:00:52.720> to<00:00:53.170> my<00:00:53.290> plane

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
at amp is for it to respond to my plane

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
at amp is for it to respond to my plane
and<00:00:54.010> respond<00:00:54.970> in<00:00:55.060> a<00:00:55.120> natural<00:00:55.660> way<00:00:55.900> so<00:00:56.800> if<00:00:57.130> I<00:00:57.340> dig

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
and respond in a natural way so if I dig

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.850 
and respond in a natural way so if I dig
in<00:00:57.760> with<00:00:57.940> a<00:00:57.970> pickup<00:00:58.270> the<00:00:58.720> amp<00:00:59.020> will<00:00:59.260> respond<00:00:59.740> in

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
in with a pickup the amp will respond in

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.740 
in with a pickup the amp will respond in
a<00:00:59.950> certain<00:01:00.310> way<00:01:00.520> each<00:01:00.760> manufactured<00:01:01.540> amp

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
a certain way each manufactured amp

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.619 
a certain way each manufactured amp
responds<00:01:02.410> differently<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.670> a<00:01:03.700> Fender<00:01:04.420> for

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
responds differently so a Fender for

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.210 
responds differently so a Fender for
instance<00:01:04.989> doesn't<00:01:05.379> respond<00:01:05.710> the<00:01:05.800> same<00:01:05.830> as<00:01:06.190> a

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
instance doesn't respond the same as a

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.960 
instance doesn't respond the same as a
Marshall

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
Marshall

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.760 
Marshall
and<00:01:07.330> then<00:01:07.540> you<00:01:07.630> have<00:01:07.750> the<00:01:07.930> variations<00:01:08.500> within

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
and then you have the variations within

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.950 
and then you have the variations within
those<00:01:08.950> particular<00:01:09.340> brands<00:01:09.760> for<00:01:10.090> instance<00:01:10.480> so

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
those particular brands for instance so

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.380 
those particular brands for instance so
simply<00:01:11.230> taking<00:01:11.530> a<00:01:11.620> snapshot<00:01:11.890> of<00:01:12.190> the<00:01:13.120> sweet

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
simply taking a snapshot of the sweet

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.600 
simply taking a snapshot of the sweet
spot<00:01:13.540> from<00:01:13.930> an<00:01:14.050> amplifier<00:01:14.500> isn't<00:01:15.160> really<00:01:15.370> true

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
spot from an amplifier isn't really true

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.310 
spot from an amplifier isn't really true
modeling<00:01:16.060> and<00:01:16.540> that's<00:01:16.720> not<00:01:17.020> what<00:01:17.200> they're

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
modeling and that's not what they're

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.350 
modeling and that's not what they're
done<00:01:17.530> with<00:01:18.010> the<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.490> GT<00:01:18.760> 100

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
done with the the GT 100

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.230 
done with the the GT 100
it<00:01:19.720> literally<00:01:20.320> each<00:01:20.590> model<00:01:21.070> will<00:01:21.520> respond<00:01:22.000> at

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
it literally each model will respond at

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.840 
it literally each model will respond at
every<00:01:22.570> gain<00:01:22.840> stage<00:01:23.230> and<00:01:23.890> every<00:01:24.220> attack<00:01:24.550> of<00:01:24.730> the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
every gain stage and every attack of the

every gain stage and every attack of the

pickle back off of the volume control in

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.940 
pickle back off of the volume control in
the<00:01:27.820> way<00:01:28.000> that<00:01:28.570> that<00:01:28.690> particular<00:01:29.050> amp<00:01:29.530> model

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
the way that that particular amp model

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.580 
the way that that particular amp model
would<00:01:30.729> in<00:01:30.970> real<00:01:31.150> life<00:01:31.390> so<00:01:32.110> here<00:01:32.260> comes<00:01:32.470> the

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
would in real life so here comes the

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.730 
would in real life so here comes the
science<00:01:32.979> bit<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.880> boss<00:01:34.120> GT<00:01:34.540> 100<00:01:35.020> is<00:01:35.110> six<00:01:35.440> times

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
science bit the boss GT 100 is six times

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.190 
science bit the boss GT 100 is six times
more<00:01:35.950> powerful<00:01:36.490> than<00:01:36.820> its<00:01:37.479> predecessor<00:01:38.020> the

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
more powerful than its predecessor the

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.800 
more powerful than its predecessor the
boss<00:01:38.350> GT<00:01:38.710> 10<00:01:39.010> and<00:01:39.250> a<00:01:39.700> good<00:01:40.000> proportion<00:01:40.600> of<00:01:40.659> that

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
boss GT 10 and a good proportion of that

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.920 
boss GT 10 and a good proportion of that
power<00:01:41.140> is<00:01:41.380> going<00:01:41.710> into<00:01:41.950> turning<00:01:42.340> this<00:01:42.930> digital

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.710 
power is going into turning this digital
device<00:01:44.290> actually<00:01:45.159> into<00:01:45.460> something<00:01:45.940> that<00:01:46.150> can

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
device actually into something that can

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.649 
device actually into something that can
respond<00:01:47.290> like<00:01:47.710> a<00:01:47.770> an<00:01:48.250> analog<00:01:49.120> device<00:01:49.420> like<00:01:49.630> a

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
respond like a an analog device like a

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.860 
respond like a an analog device like a
valve<00:01:50.020> amplifier<00:01:51.330> and<00:01:52.330> what<00:01:52.479> our<00:01:52.600> clever

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
valve amplifier and what our clever

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.350 
valve amplifier and what our clever
boffins<00:01:53.320> back<00:01:53.620> in<00:01:53.799> Japan<00:01:54.100> have<00:01:54.250> done<00:01:54.460> is<00:01:54.729> that

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
boffins back in Japan have done is that

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.960 
boffins back in Japan have done is that
they've<00:01:55.600> created<00:01:55.930> an<00:01:56.470> actual<00:01:56.970> bespoke

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
they've created an actual bespoke

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.590 
they've created an actual bespoke
chipset<00:01:58.750> to<00:01:59.260> do<00:01:59.440> that<00:01:59.680> so<00:02:00.460> all<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.880> best<00:02:01.060> audio

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
chipset to do that so all the best audio

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
so what I'm going to do now is let me

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.690 
so what I'm going to do now is let me
show<00:02:33.670> you<00:02:33.940> how<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.840> GT<00:02:35.319> 100<00:02:35.830> responds<00:02:36.430> like<00:02:36.549> a

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
show you how the GT 100 responds like a

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.119 
show you how the GT 100 responds like a
real<00:02:37.000> amplifier<00:02:37.569> to<00:02:38.049> my<00:02:38.200> playing<00:02:38.500> dynamic<00:02:39.010> so

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
real amplifier to my playing dynamic so

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.350 
real amplifier to my playing dynamic so
I'm<00:02:39.190> going<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.370> play<00:02:39.489> with<00:02:39.700> my<00:02:39.819> fingers<00:02:40.269> I'm

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
I'm going to play with my fingers I'm

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.149 
I'm going to play with my fingers I'm
going<00:02:40.450> to<00:02:40.540> roll<00:02:41.079> back<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.470> volume<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:41.980> few

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
going to roll back the volume a few

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.550 
going to roll back the volume a few
times<00:02:42.400> probably<00:02:42.849> get<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.209> hold<00:02:43.569> of<00:02:43.660> it<00:02:43.690> pick<00:02:43.959> dig

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
times probably get a hold of it pick dig

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.289 
times probably get a hold of it pick dig
in<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.769> little<00:02:44.799> bit<00:02:45.129> with<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:45.489> and<00:02:46.090> I'm<00:02:46.180> going

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
in a little bit with that and I'm going

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.390 
in a little bit with that and I'm going
to<00:02:46.390> use<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.720> fender<00:02:47.110> probe<00:02:47.379> crunch<00:02:47.680> model

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400

to use the fender probe crunch model
that's<00:02:48.849> in<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.180> GT<00:02:49.510> 100<00:02:50.049> set<00:02:50.799> fairly<00:02:51.160> crunchy

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
that's in the GT 100 set fairly crunchy

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.819 
that's in the GT 100 set fairly crunchy
you<00:02:52.299> can<00:02:52.480> hear<00:02:52.599> the<00:02:52.690> difference<00:02:53.049> so<00:02:53.260> let<00:02:53.709> me

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829

you can hear the difference so let me
put<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.250> backing<00:02:54.489> track<00:02:54.609> up<00:02:54.910> before<00:02:55.120> you<00:02:55.180> play

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
put a backing track up before you play

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.720 
put a backing track up before you play
over<00:02:55.599> the<00:02:55.690> top<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.079> then<00:02:56.680> make<00:02:57.099> those<00:02:57.280> changes

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
over the top and then make those changes

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:23.320 
over the top and then make those changes
so<00:02:57.760> you<00:02:57.879> can<00:02:58.150> hear<00:02:58.359> it

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
and there on the Left screen I can see

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.719 
and there on the Left screen I can see
my<00:04:52.290> effects<00:04:52.590> chain<00:04:52.860> and<00:04:53.010> I<00:04:53.040> can<00:04:53.220> move<00:04:53.340> along

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
my effects chain and I can move along

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.390 
my effects chain and I can move along
throughout<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.330> chain<00:04:55.200> from<00:04:55.800> guitar<00:04:56.220> input

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
throughout the chain from guitar input

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.540 
throughout the chain from guitar input
to<00:04:57.080> eventual<00:04:58.080> output<00:04:58.560> I<00:04:58.740> can<00:04:59.010> move<00:04:59.340> the

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
to eventual output I can move the

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.330 
to eventual output I can move the
effects<00:04:59.850> around<00:05:00.650> anywhere<00:05:01.650> in<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:01.830> chain<00:05:02.100> I

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
effects around anywhere in the chain I

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.250 
effects around anywhere in the chain I
can<00:05:02.790> toggle<00:05:03.090> them<00:05:03.360> on<00:05:03.570> and<00:05:03.810> off

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
can toggle them on and off

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.560 
can toggle them on and off
and<00:05:04.620> when<00:05:04.740> I<00:05:04.770> do<00:05:04.890> so<00:05:05.130> the<00:05:05.729> right<00:05:06.000> hand<00:05:06.270> screen

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
and when I do so the right hand screen

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.290 
and when I do so the right hand screen
actually<00:05:07.050> behaves<00:05:07.380> like<00:05:07.530> the<00:05:07.830> real<00:05:08.300> stompbox

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
actually behaves like the real stompbox

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.960 
actually behaves like the real stompbox
and<00:05:10.200> this<00:05:10.350> applies<00:05:10.650> to<00:05:10.680> any<00:05:11.160> effects<00:05:11.550> that<00:05:11.700> you

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
and this applies to any effects that you

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.300 
and this applies to any effects that you
land<00:05:12.240> on<00:05:12.360> in<00:05:12.510> the<00:05:12.600> chain<00:05:12.840> you<00:05:13.080> can<00:05:13.289> alter<00:05:14.190> them

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
land on in the chain you can alter them

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.100 
land on in the chain you can alter them
as<00:05:14.400> you<00:05:14.490> would<00:05:14.640> do<00:05:14.760> on<00:05:14.880> a<00:05:14.910> regular<00:05:15.300> compact<00:05:15.539> you

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
as you would do on a regular compact you

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.650 
as you would do on a regular compact you
can<00:05:16.289> change<00:05:16.590> the<00:05:16.800> type<00:05:17.120> so<00:05:18.120> here<00:05:18.390> are<00:05:18.510> all<00:05:18.539> my

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
can change the type so here are all my

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.409 
can change the type so here are all my
delays<00:05:19.380> that<00:05:19.620> I've<00:05:19.770> got<00:05:19.950> a<00:05:19.979> choice<00:05:20.250> of<00:05:20.520> and<00:05:20.970> it

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
delays that I've got a choice of and it

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.330 
delays that I've got a choice of and it
just<00:05:21.570> makes<00:05:21.750> the<00:05:21.900> whole<00:05:21.930> thing<00:05:22.110> so<00:05:22.380> easy<00:05:23.130> to

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
just makes the whole thing so easy to

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.700 
just makes the whole thing so easy to
program<00:05:23.600> another<00:05:24.600> really<00:05:24.960> cool<00:05:25.140> feature<00:05:25.200> is

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
program another really cool feature is

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.760 
program another really cool feature is
the<00:05:25.860> easy<00:05:26.039> turn<00:05:26.340> button<00:05:27.410> one-click<00:05:28.410> takes<00:05:28.650> me

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
the easy turn button one-click takes me

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.980 
the easy turn button one-click takes me
to<00:05:28.890> this<00:05:28.979> feature<00:05:29.250> and<00:05:29.660> basically<00:05:30.660> what<00:05:30.870> it

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
to this feature and basically what it

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.650 
to this feature and basically what it
allows<00:05:31.260> me<00:05:31.470> to<00:05:31.500> do<00:05:31.770> is<00:05:32.070> create<00:05:32.490> a<00:05:32.520> patch<00:05:32.910> based

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
allows me to do is create a patch based

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.630 
allows me to do is create a patch based
on<00:05:33.930> the<00:05:34.080> genre<00:05:34.380> so<00:05:34.860> if<00:05:34.979> I<00:05:35.070> don't<00:05:35.130> know<00:05:35.370> how<00:05:35.580> to

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
on the genre so if I don't know how to

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.340 
on the genre so if I don't know how to
create<00:05:36.060> a<00:05:36.090> you<00:05:36.479> know<00:05:36.570> a<00:05:36.600> really<00:05:36.870> cool<00:05:37.080> blues

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.710 
create a you know a really cool blues
patch<00:05:37.650> and<00:05:37.950> I<00:05:38.729> can<00:05:38.910> go<00:05:39.060> in<00:05:39.210> and<00:05:39.360> change<00:05:39.570> your

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
patch and I can go in and change your

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.110 
patch and I can go in and change your
variation<00:05:40.320> there<00:05:40.610> and<00:05:41.610> there's<00:05:41.789> so<00:05:42.000> many

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
variation there and there's so many

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.969 
variation there and there's so many
different<00:05:42.270> genres<00:05:42.870> built<00:05:43.110> into<00:05:43.470> it<00:05:43.590> with<00:05:43.800> lots

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
of variations within it and I'll just

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.200 
of variations within it and I'll just
toggle<00:05:46.289> through<00:05:46.620> some<00:05:46.890> of<00:05:47.010> the<00:05:47.130> genre<00:05:47.940> so<00:05:48.090> you

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
you can save that and it creates all of

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.629 
you can save that and it creates all of
the<00:05:58.139> effects<00:05:58.470> in<00:05:58.650> the<00:05:58.740> right<00:05:58.919> order<00:05:59.190> for<00:05:59.490> you

will turn the active duty 100 into an
effects<00:06:08.100> board<00:06:08.460> basically<00:06:09.390> like<00:06:09.750> having<00:06:10.020> the

effects board basically like having the

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.250 
effects board basically like having the
stompboxes<00:06:10.680> in<00:06:10.860> front<00:06:11.099> of<00:06:11.220> you

that<00:06:17.010> on<00:06:17.160> the<00:06:17.280> other<00:06:17.400> screen<00:06:17.700> they've

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
that on the other screen they've

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.180 
that on the other screen they've
incorporated<00:06:18.690> a<00:06:19.110> metronome<00:06:19.590> which<00:06:19.800> is<00:06:19.920> really

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
incorporated a metronome which is really

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.460 
incorporated a metronome which is really
useful<00:06:20.550> for<00:06:20.580> practice<00:06:21.060> and<00:06:21.210> you<00:06:21.960> can<00:06:22.080> use<00:06:22.290> that

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
useful for practice and you can use that

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.300 
useful for practice and you can use that
actually<00:06:22.950> for<00:06:23.160> your<00:06:23.570> looping<00:06:24.600> because<00:06:25.440> built

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
actually for your looping because built

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.680 
actually for your looping because built
into<00:06:26.580> this<00:06:26.670> is<00:06:26.820> a<00:06:26.850> thirty<00:06:27.120> eight<00:06:27.240> second

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690 
into this is a thirty eight second

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.540 
into this is a thirty eight second
looper<00:06:28.020> with<00:06:28.140> a<00:06:28.230> dedicated<00:06:28.650> foot<00:06:29.130> switch<00:06:29.370> as
