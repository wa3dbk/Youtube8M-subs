00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.729 
so Caesar again we are coming with the
Monaco<00:02:27.610> v4<00:02:28.150> which<00:02:28.330> is<00:02:28.540> an<00:02:28.690> incredible<00:02:29.350> piece

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
Monaco v4 which is an incredible piece

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.180 
Monaco v4 which is an incredible piece
which<00:02:30.459> is<00:02:30.489> driven<00:02:30.880> by<00:02:31.090> belts<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.290> v4<00:02:32.890> name

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
which is driven by belts so the v4 name

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.170 
which is driven by belts so the v4 name
is<00:02:33.489> coming<00:02:34.500> from<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.800> four<00:02:36.220> barrels<00:02:36.850> which

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
is coming from the four barrels which

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.500 
is coming from the four barrels which
are<00:02:37.450> in<00:02:37.600> a<00:02:37.720> v-shape<00:02:38.350> and<00:02:38.620> C's<00:02:39.400> year<00:02:39.970> we<00:02:40.300> have<00:02:40.480> a

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
are in a v-shape and C's year we have a

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.720 
are in a v-shape and C's year we have a
new<00:02:40.600> execution<00:02:41.320> which<00:02:41.709> is<00:02:41.950> very<00:02:42.400> light

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
new execution which is very light

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.530 
new execution which is very light
because<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.840> case<00:02:44.080> is<00:02:44.380> made<00:02:44.650> in<00:02:44.860> CMC<00:02:45.850> which<00:02:46.270> we

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
because the case is made in CMC which we

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.170 
because the case is made in CMC which we
called<00:02:46.810> carbon<00:02:47.380> matrix<00:02:47.950> composites<00:02:48.670> which

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
called carbon matrix composites which

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.630 
called carbon matrix composites which
give<00:02:49.480> us<00:02:49.510> as<00:02:49.840> a<00:02:49.900> result<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.739> specific<00:02:51.340> case

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
give us as a result a specific case

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.670 
give us as a result a specific case
which<00:02:52.030> is<00:02:52.330> kind<00:02:52.720> of<00:02:52.900> nice

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
which is kind of nice

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.610 
which is kind of nice
I<00:02:53.709> would<00:02:54.130> say<00:02:54.340> look<00:02:54.720> very<00:02:55.720> light<00:02:55.989> but<00:02:56.350> also

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
I would say look very light but also

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.220 
I would say look very light but also
each<00:02:57.070> case<00:02:57.489> will<00:02:57.820> be<00:02:58.000> unique<00:02:58.480> thanks<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:59.049> this

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
each case will be unique thanks to this

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.809 
each case will be unique thanks to this
technology

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819
