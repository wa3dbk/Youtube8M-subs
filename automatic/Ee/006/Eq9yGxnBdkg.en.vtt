okay<00:00:02.220> so<00:00:02.280> here's<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.550> six<00:00:02.790> lengths<00:00:03.030> problem

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
okay so here's a six lengths problem

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.210 
okay so here's a six lengths problem
really<00:00:03.659> quickly<00:00:04.049> let's<00:00:04.259> write<00:00:04.560> some<00:00:04.589> stuff<00:00:05.040> in

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
really quickly let's write some stuff in

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.720 
really quickly let's write some stuff in
some<00:00:05.520> side<00:00:05.730> effects<00:00:06.120> x<00:00:07.109> x<00:00:07.470> equals<00:00:07.980> female

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.200 

chorus<00:00:11.730> XY<00:00:12.440> equals<00:00:13.440> male<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:14.250> just<00:00:14.910> keep<00:00:15.120> in

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
chorus XY equals male and just keep in

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.609 
chorus XY equals male and just keep in
mind<00:00:15.240> remember<00:00:15.690> there<00:00:15.839> are<00:00:15.870> no<00:00:15.960> matching

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
mind remember there are no matching

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.279 
mind remember there are no matching
chromosomes<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.550> are<00:00:17.699> similar<00:00:18.029> on<00:00:18.390> both

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
chromosomes that are similar on both

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.070 
chromosomes that are similar on both
sets<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.740> x<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.910> y<00:00:21.029> for<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.449> mail<00:00:21.630> there's<00:00:21.960> no

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
sets of x and y for the mail there's no

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.830 
sets of x and y for the mail there's no
matching<00:00:22.529> just<00:00:23.100> usually<00:00:23.670> no<00:00:23.820> matching<00:00:24.330> why

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
matching just usually no matching why

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.650 
matching just usually no matching why
gene<00:00:25.320> for<00:00:25.859> its<00:00:26.010> X<00:00:26.250> but<00:00:26.519> females<00:00:26.849> have<00:00:27.150> pair<00:00:27.390> so

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
gene for its X but females have pair so

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.250 
gene for its X but females have pair so
they're<00:00:27.810> all<00:00:27.960> good<00:00:28.230> okay<00:00:28.670> so<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.849> says<00:00:30.260> color

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
they're all good okay so it says color

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.959 
they're all good okay so it says color

buys haemophilia both located X
chromosome<00:00:33.480> with<00:00:33.809> no<00:00:33.960> corresponding<00:00:34.590> gene<00:00:34.770> on

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
chromosome with no corresponding gene on

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.880 
chromosome with no corresponding gene on
the<00:00:34.920> y<00:00:35.360> these<00:00:36.360> are<00:00:36.450> both<00:00:36.750> recessive<00:00:37.590> alleles

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
the y these are both recessive alleles

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.360 
the y these are both recessive alleles
so<00:00:38.280> here<00:00:38.489> we<00:00:38.579> go<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.600> let's<00:00:39.870> just<00:00:40.170> name<00:00:40.410> our<00:00:41.010> key

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
so here we go so let's just name our key

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.720 
so here we go so let's just name our key
here<00:00:41.700> which<00:00:42.090> we<00:00:42.300> shouldn't<00:00:42.540> matter<00:00:42.629> do<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.170> n

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
here which we shouldn't matter do is n

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.470 
here which we shouldn't matter do is n
little<00:00:44.730> n<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.120> going<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.510> equal

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
little n is going to equal

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:55.369 
little n is going to equal
colorblindness<00:00:48.480> okay<00:00:52.910> okay<00:00:54.050> and<00:00:55.050> obviously

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
colorblindness okay okay and obviously

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:03.979 
colorblindness okay okay and obviously
big<00:00:55.829> n<00:00:56.010> equals<00:00:58.039> regular<00:01:00.050> color<00:01:01.050> ok<00:01:02.629> alright<00:01:03.629> so

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
big n equals regular color ok alright so

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.200 
big n equals regular color ok alright so
for<00:01:04.949> man<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.250> woman<00:01:05.489> both<00:01:05.519> with<00:01:05.880> normal

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
for man and woman both with normal

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.609 
for man and woman both with normal
vision<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.590> have<00:01:07.939> normal<00:01:08.939> vision<00:01:09.409> the<00:01:10.409> man

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
vision so to have normal vision the man

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.570 
vision so to have normal vision the man
has<00:01:10.950> got<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.340> have<00:01:12.320> well<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.830> man<00:01:14.040> has<00:01:14.280> got<00:01:14.430> to

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
has got to have well the man has got to

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.050 
has got to have well the man has got to
have<00:01:14.760> X<00:01:15.409> big<00:01:16.409> n<00:01:16.680> does<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.280> make<00:01:17.490> sense<00:01:17.520> let's

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
have X big n does that make sense let's

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.030 
have X big n does that make sense let's
erase<00:01:18.299> them<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.540> make<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.840> bad<00:01:19.470> just<00:01:19.680> let<00:01:19.920> me

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
erase them to make that bad just let me

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.200 
erase them to make that bad just let me
go<00:01:20.250> since<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.670> guys<00:01:21.470> begin<00:01:22.470> yeah<00:01:23.280> and

there's nothing going to go there

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.260 
there's nothing going to go there
there's<00:01:28.380> no<00:01:28.650> chromosome<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.579> corresponds

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
there's no chromosome that corresponds

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.679 
there's no chromosome that corresponds
or<00:01:30.420> no<00:01:30.689> corresponding<00:01:31.619> X<00:01:31.770> chromosome<00:01:32.280> ok<00:01:32.689> so

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
or no corresponding X chromosome ok so

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.069 
or no corresponding X chromosome ok so
this<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.049> male<00:01:35.210> just<00:01:36.210> make<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.509> easy<00:01:36.630> for<00:01:36.840> you

to<00:01:41.280> have<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.430> double<00:01:41.759> X<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.890> it<00:01:43.890> says<00:01:47.570> it<00:01:48.570> also

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
to have a double X and it says it also

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.819 
to have a double X and it says it also
says<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.619> woman<00:01:51.290> bolton<00:01:52.290> over<00:01:52.500> vision

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
says that the woman bolton over vision

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.190

marry<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.460> have<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.610> colorblind<00:01:54.180> son<00:01:54.810> which

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
marry and have a colorblind son which

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.520 
marry and have a colorblind son which
means<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.979> she<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.689> key<00:01:57.899> here<00:01:57.930> that

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
means that she this is the key here that

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.899 
means that she this is the key here that
if<00:01:58.619> they<00:01:58.770> have<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:58.979> colorblind<00:01:59.520> son

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
if they have a colorblind son

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.030 
if they have a colorblind son
underlining<00:02:00.689> right<00:02:00.899> here<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.799> must<00:02:01.950> mean

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
underlining right here that must mean

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.889 
underlining right here that must mean
she<00:02:02.340> must<00:02:02.610> be<00:02:02.820> heterozygous<00:02:03.329> for

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
she must be heterozygous for

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.010 
she must be heterozygous for
colorblindness<00:02:04.500> on<00:02:04.799> our<00:02:04.950> X<00:02:05.130> chromosome<00:02:05.579> so

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
colorblindness on our X chromosome so

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.600 
colorblindness on our X chromosome so
just<00:02:07.020> keep<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.350> in<00:02:07.500> mind<00:02:07.530> here's<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.399> cross

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
just keep this in mind here's the cross

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.449 
just keep this in mind here's the cross
that<00:02:08.819> illustrates<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.860> so<00:02:10.860> yep<00:02:11.039> these<00:02:11.310> two

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
that illustrates that so yep these two

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.450 
that illustrates that so yep these two
are<00:02:11.489> getting<00:02:11.670> crossed<00:02:12.060> here<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.569> here

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
are getting crossed here and here

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.110 
are getting crossed here and here
the<00:02:14.460> cross<00:02:14.780> okay<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:16.440> like<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.770> big<00:02:16.950> X<00:02:17.160> ok

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
the cross okay this is like a big X ok

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.050 
the cross okay this is like a big X ok
this<00:02:18.630> is<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.870> cross<00:02:19.200> X<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.670> go<00:02:20.820> ahead<00:02:20.940> and

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
this is the cross X so I go ahead and

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.850 
this is the cross X so I go ahead and
cross<00:02:21.180> those<00:02:21.450> in<00:02:21.570> my<00:02:21.660> punnett<00:02:21.990> square<00:02:22.260> go

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
cross those in my punnett square go

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.590 
cross those in my punnett square go
ahead<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.160> do<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.280> in<00:02:23.490> red<00:02:23.670> show<00:02:24.270> that's<00:02:24.450> my

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
ahead and do that in red show that's my

is how they could have had a colorblind

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.390 
is how they could have had a colorblind
son<00:03:12.660> which<00:03:12.960> one<00:03:13.290> of<00:03:13.320> these<00:03:13.560> in<00:03:13.860> this<00:03:14.010> square<00:03:14.340> is

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
son which one of these in this square is

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.640 
son which one of these in this square is
the<00:03:14.790> color<00:03:14.970> blind<00:03:15.240> son<00:03:15.510> if<00:03:16.350> you<00:03:16.470> think<00:03:16.590> about

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
the color blind son if you think about

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.610 
the color blind son if you think about
it<00:03:16.830> it's<00:03:17.070> going<00:03:17.250> to<00:03:17.310> be<00:03:17.540> this<00:03:18.540> woman<00:03:18.990> is<00:03:19.230> the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
it it's going to be this woman is the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:27.260 
it it's going to be this woman is the
color<00:03:19.830> blind<00:03:20.160> female<00:03:23.959> and<00:03:25.700> this<00:03:26.700> one<00:03:27.000> would<00:03:27.240> be

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
color blind female and this one would be

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.600 
color blind female and this one would be
the<00:03:27.750> color<00:03:28.500> blind<00:03:30.770> son<00:03:31.770> and<00:03:32.160> in<00:03:32.280> case<00:03:32.430> you're

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
the color blind son and in case you're

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.949 
the color blind son and in case you're
confused<00:03:32.700> remember<00:03:33.360> there<00:03:33.630> is<00:03:33.660> no

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
confused remember there is no

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.100 
confused remember there is no
corresponding<00:03:34.370> allele<00:03:35.370> is<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:36.180> word<00:03:36.360> on<00:03:36.690> the

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
corresponding allele is the word on the

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.190 
corresponding allele is the word on the
Y<00:03:37.230> chromosome<00:03:37.740> ok<00:03:38.450> so<00:03:39.450> that's<00:03:39.660> results<00:03:40.080> of<00:03:40.140> the

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
Y chromosome ok so that's results of the

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.640 
Y chromosome ok so that's results of the
first<00:03:40.260> cross<00:03:40.709> ok<00:03:41.840> so<00:03:42.840> draw<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.230> punnett

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
first cross ok so draw the punnett

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.530 
first cross ok so draw the punnett
square<00:03:44.010> that<00:03:44.340> illustrates<00:03:44.820> this<00:03:44.970> this<00:03:45.240> is<00:03:45.390> the

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
square that illustrates this this is the

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.100 
square that illustrates this this is the
answer<00:03:45.660> so<00:03:46.200> this<00:03:46.380> is<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.590> first<00:03:47.840> this<00:03:48.840> is

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
answer so this is the first this is

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.270 
answer so this is the first this is
answered<00:03:50.810> way<00:03:51.810> down<00:03:52.290> here<00:03:52.590> this<00:03:52.740> is<00:03:52.920> answered

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
answered way down here this is answered

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
color blind son is right there he is ok

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.650 
color blind son is right there he is ok
and<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.520> next<00:04:02.730> question<00:04:02.820> says<00:04:03.180> if<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.480> man

her<00:05:07.610> husband<00:05:07.970> died<00:05:08.120> and<00:05:08.570> i<00:05:08.840> found<00:05:09.140> another<00:05:09.230> guy

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
her husband died and i found another guy

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.670 
her husband died and i found another guy
and<00:05:09.830> with<00:05:10.580> this<00:05:10.700> other<00:05:10.850> guy<00:05:11.290> he<00:05:12.290> happened<00:05:12.650> to

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
and with this other guy he happened to

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.980 
and with this other guy he happened to
be<00:05:12.740> colorblind<00:05:13.130> which<00:05:13.820> is<00:05:14.060> not<00:05:14.420> very<00:05:14.450> unlikely

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
be colorblind which is not very unlikely

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.800 
be colorblind which is not very unlikely
because<00:05:15.410> my<00:05:15.830> father's<00:05:16.280> is<00:05:16.400> a<00:05:16.430> cross<00:05:17.210> here<00:05:17.510> to

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
because my father's is a cross here to

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.720 
because my father's is a cross here to
separate<00:05:18.260> out<00:05:18.440> the<00:05:18.710> exes<00:05:19.100> for<00:05:19.370> you<00:05:19.490> so<00:05:19.640> you

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
separate out the exes for you so you

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.270 
separate out the exes for you so you
know<00:05:19.880> if<00:05:20.060> it's<00:05:20.240> actually<00:05:20.390> the<00:05:20.600> cross<00:05:20.870> and<00:05:21.280> we

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
know if it's actually the cross and we

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.490 
know if it's actually the cross and we
go<00:05:22.460> ahead<00:05:22.640> and<00:05:22.820> do<00:05:22.880> the<00:05:23.000> cross<00:05:23.240> and<00:05:23.660> website<00:05:24.350> if

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
go ahead and do the cross and website if

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.630 
go ahead and do the cross and website if
you<00:05:24.560> know<00:05:24.650> do<00:05:24.800> the<00:05:24.920> cross<00:05:25.450> we<00:05:26.450> know<00:05:26.660> that<00:05:27.640> he's

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
you know do the cross we know that he's

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.000 
you know do the cross we know that he's
colorblind<00:05:29.030> since<00:05:29.600> he's<00:05:29.780> colorblind<00:05:30.170> what

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
colorblind since he's colorblind what

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.980 
colorblind since he's colorblind what
must<00:05:31.220> his<00:05:31.430> genotype<00:05:32.000> be<00:05:32.210> well<00:05:32.480> you<00:05:32.690> can't<00:05:32.900> have

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
must his genotype be well you can't have

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.450 
must his genotype be well you can't have
anything<00:05:33.170> on<00:05:33.320> the<00:05:33.440> Y<00:05:33.560> so<00:05:34.010> he's<00:05:34.160> colorblind

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
anything on the Y so he's colorblind

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.910 
anything on the Y so he's colorblind
he's<00:05:34.730> got<00:05:34.880> to<00:05:34.940> have<00:05:35.030> a<00:05:35.090> what<00:05:35.300> on<00:05:35.450> the<00:05:35.570> X<00:05:35.920> that's

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:36.920 
he's got to have a what on the X that's

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.910 
he's got to have a what on the X that's
right<00:05:37.190> a<00:05:37.220> little<00:05:37.400> in<00:05:37.640> ok<00:05:38.440> so<00:05:39.440> given<00:05:39.890> that

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:39.920 
right a little in ok so given that

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.030 
right a little in ok so given that
situation<00:05:40.580> there<00:05:40.790> we<00:05:41.560> go<00:05:42.560> ahead<00:05:42.710> and<00:05:42.830> set<00:05:42.950> up

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
situation there we go ahead and set up

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.060 
situation there we go ahead and set up
our<00:05:43.160> cross<00:05:44.710> alright<00:05:45.710> and<00:05:46.340> put<00:05:46.700> X<00:05:46.910> 0<00:05:47.090> here<00:05:47.480> with

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
our cross alright and put X 0 here with

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.400 
our cross alright and put X 0 here with
Maxim<00:05:49.070> their<00:05:49.400> next<00:05:50.030> there<00:05:50.270> and<00:05:50.480> why<00:05:50.720> there<00:05:51.080> I'm

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
Maxim their next there and why there I'm

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.280 
Maxim their next there and why there I'm
just<00:05:51.620> gonna<00:05:51.860> feel<00:05:52.280> color<00:05:52.820> coordinated<00:05:53.480> she's

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
just gonna feel color coordinated she's

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.220 
just gonna feel color coordinated she's
a<00:05:54.320> heterozygote<00:05:55.160> good<00:05:55.640> and<00:05:56.000> he<00:05:56.600> is<00:05:56.930> obviously

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.230 
a heterozygote good and he is obviously

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.460 
a heterozygote good and he is obviously
colorblind<00:05:58.070> hence<00:05:58.640> this<00:05:58.850> genotype<00:05:59.350> put<00:06:00.350> them

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
colorblind hence this genotype put them

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.640 
colorblind hence this genotype put them
together<00:06:00.620> and<00:06:01.040> we<00:06:01.700> get<00:06:02.260> you<00:06:03.260> only<00:06:03.380> get<00:06:03.620> one

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
together and we get you only get one

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:09.100 
together and we get you only get one
carrier<00:06:04.930> he<00:06:05.930> had<00:06:06.020> a<00:06:06.050> colorblind<00:06:06.860> female<00:06:08.110> you

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
carrier he had a colorblind female you

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.270 
carrier he had a colorblind female you
get<00:06:09.350> another<00:06:10.390> regular<00:06:11.390> guy<00:06:11.570> and<00:06:11.980> finally<00:06:12.980> we

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
get another regular guy and finally we

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.790 
get another regular guy and finally we
get<00:06:13.430> a<00:06:13.490> color<00:06:13.910> blind<00:06:14.180> guy<00:06:15.040> ok<00:06:16.040> so<00:06:16.610> it<00:06:16.820> asks<00:06:17.800> how

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
get a color blind guy ok so it asks how

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.410 
get a color blind guy ok so it asks how
many<00:06:19.040> our<00:06:19.250> website<00:06:19.610> ends<00:06:19.730> of<00:06:19.850> each<00:06:19.970> could<00:06:20.270> be

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:20.420 
many our website ends of each could be

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.710 
many our website ends of each could be
expected<00:06:21.320> well<00:06:22.190> we<00:06:22.550> obviously<00:06:22.670> know<00:06:23.090> what<00:06:23.330> is

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 
expected well we obviously know what is

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.580 
expected well we obviously know what is
the<00:06:24.310> chance<00:06:25.310> that<00:06:26.110> we're<00:06:27.110> going<00:06:27.260> to<00:06:27.350> have<00:06:27.560> a

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
the chance that we're going to have a

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.560 
the chance that we're going to have a
color<00:06:27.860> blind<00:06:28.100> child<00:06:28.340> of<00:06:28.670> all<00:06:29.090> child<00:06:29.390> including

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:29.570 
color blind child of all child including

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.690 
color blind child of all child including
boys<00:06:29.930> and<00:06:30.110> girls<00:06:30.290> obviously<00:06:30.530> a<00:06:30.950> if<00:06:31.430> you<00:06:31.550> look

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:31.700 
boys and girls obviously a if you look

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.970 
boys and girls obviously a if you look
at<00:06:31.850> it<00:06:31.880> little<00:06:32.390> closely<00:06:32.750> here<00:06:32.960> you<00:06:33.650> can<00:06:33.800> see

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:33.980 
at it little closely here you can see

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.620 
at it little closely here you can see
that<00:06:34.010> which<00:06:34.550> one's<00:06:34.730> the<00:06:34.790> colorblind<00:06:35.180> these

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
that which one's the colorblind these

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.040 
that which one's the colorblind these
guys<00:06:35.870> are<00:06:36.110> colorblind<00:06:36.350> right<00:06:37.270> so

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
guys are colorblind right so

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.410 
guys are colorblind right so
and<00:06:41.460> these<00:06:42.460> other<00:06:42.670> two<00:06:42.850> on<00:06:42.940> this<00:06:43.090> are<00:06:43.240> not

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:43.420 
and these other two on this are not

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.530 
and these other two on this are not
color<00:06:43.630> blind<00:06:43.720> so<00:06:44.170> it's<00:06:44.350> a<00:06:44.470> fifty<00:06:45.070> percent

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:45.540 
color blind so it's a fifty percent

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:52.740 
color blind so it's a fifty percent
chance<00:06:46.540> of<00:06:49.590> colorblindness<00:06:50.590> okay<00:06:51.600> and<00:06:52.600> that's

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:52.750 
chance of colorblindness okay and that's

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.290 
chance of colorblindness okay and that's
if<00:06:52.960> you're<00:06:53.080> a<00:06:53.110> boy<00:06:53.350> or<00:06:53.740> a<00:06:53.800> girl<00:06:53.950> right<00:06:54.610> if

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
if you're a boy or a girl right if

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.030 
if you're a boy or a girl right if
you're<00:06:55.450> a<00:06:55.510> boy<00:06:55.720> you<00:06:56.380> have<00:06:56.560> fifty<00:06:56.860> percent

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:57.040 
you're a boy you have fifty percent

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.500 
you're a boy you have fifty percent
chance<00:06:57.220> of<00:06:57.400> being<00:06:57.550> colorblind<00:06:57.820> if<00:06:58.210> you<00:06:58.360> have<00:06:58.450> a

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:58.510 
chance of being colorblind if you have a
