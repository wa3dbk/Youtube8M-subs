00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:05.210
 the double glazing renovation it takes place only towards its most trashy of your 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.090
 wooden window 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.420
 we advise you to opt for a double glazing filled with gaza account the 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.409
 poorly emissive business behaviors 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:18.519
 this will allow you to benefit from optimal isolation performance 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:24.249
 before you start manufacturing to control the dimensions of the double 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:27.249
 glazing 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.020
 then did double glazing on both sides 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.500
 the phase of the renovation project including the track cages will begin 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.390
 the outside of the window 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.720
 the sacem removed six double glazing and generally cooperate because a 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.450
 pellet 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.450
 and must be minister of the interior of the window 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.510
 you must now proceed with cutting and profile with a saw at 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.720
 tab 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.470
 we advise you to bring a maximum of precision to this 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.470
 surgery 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.770
 m 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.360
 it is necessary to deduce from his school the profile career so 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.410
 that they adhere to double glazing 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.360
 the positioning of the double glazing return profiles and very simple to 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.360
 achieve 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.430
 in the particular case of saint-pry profits you will have to use some 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.130
 suitable brackets 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.490
 these gaps are entered fits easily into the grooves of each 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.490
 profile 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.900
 the storage room site to afford with a screwdriver 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:36.689
 for joining the straps right just insert flashes in the 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.509
 grooves and then correctly position the profile around the double 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:43.509
 glazing 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.019
 you can use a rubber mallet 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.019
 in order to adhere the profile to double glazing 

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:07.239
 for better work you can use crampons 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.429
 assembly 

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:12.719
 these allow to maintain bora-bora the angles of the profiles during 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:15.719
 that silicone poly hall 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:21.379
 the gaps in the back when we can be used with glue 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.379
 TV series 

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:37.599
 using a spatula you can indeed the surplus of silicone that 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.599
 could have exceeded the profit 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.149
 24 hours are needed to allow if the polymerized icon 

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:52.409
 the double glazing renovation then it will be ready to be placed on your 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.819
 window
