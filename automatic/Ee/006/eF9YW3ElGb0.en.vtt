00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600 

you<00:00:00.359> guys<00:00:00.510> better<00:00:00.810> /<00:00:01.140> here<00:00:01.410> and<00:00:01.620> I've<00:00:02.250> got<00:00:02.460> my

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
you guys better / here and I've got my

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.170 
you guys better / here and I've got my
tool<00:00:02.939> drive<00:00:03.270> /<00:00:03.510> and<00:00:04.250> I<00:00:05.250> put<00:00:05.460> together<00:00:05.609> a<00:00:05.910> little

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
tool drive / and I put together a little

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.530 
tool drive / and I put together a little
low<00:00:06.899> center<00:00:07.350> of<00:00:07.379> gravity<00:00:07.500> chassis<00:00:08.510> then<00:00:09.510> I

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
low center of gravity chassis then I

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.259 
low center of gravity chassis then I
kind<00:00:09.870> of<00:00:09.929> mocked<00:00:10.170> up<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:11.250> it's<00:00:11.610> not<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.059> best

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
kind of mocked up and it's not the best

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.930 
kind of mocked up and it's not the best
looking<00:00:12.389> thing<00:00:12.870> but<00:00:13.230> it<00:00:14.009> does<00:00:14.219> seem<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.759> help

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
looking thing but it does seem to help

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.410 
looking thing but it does seem to help
the<00:00:15.150> performance<00:00:15.750> so<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:17.119> just<00:00:18.119> put<00:00:18.180> this

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
the performance so I just put this

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.870 
the performance so I just put this
together<00:00:18.630> thinking<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.560> if<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.980> does<00:00:20.460> not<00:00:20.670> go

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
together thinking that if I does not go

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.359 
together thinking that if I does not go
good<00:00:21.510> then<00:00:21.900> i<00:00:22.140> can<00:00:22.710> just<00:00:22.800> go<00:00:22.920> ahead<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.160> get

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
good then i can just go ahead and get

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.160 
good then i can just go ahead and get
her<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.519> chassis<00:00:24.060> for<00:00:24.269> like<00:00:24.359> fifteen<00:00:24.779> dollars

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
her a chassis for like fifteen dollars

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.970 
her a chassis for like fifteen dollars
and<00:00:25.470> that's<00:00:25.619> not<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.460> much<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:27.769> just<00:00:28.769> thought

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
and that's not that much so just thought

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.160 
and that's not that much so just thought
I'd<00:00:29.130> go<00:00:29.580> ahead<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.849> try<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.300> knock<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.109> thing

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
I'd go ahead and try to knock this thing

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.760 
I'd go ahead and try to knock this thing
together<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:32.390> first<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.570> all<00:00:33.690> turn<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
together so first of all turn the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.880 
together so first of all turn the
outsides<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.820> chassis<00:00:36.320> knock<00:00:37.320> down<00:00:37.590> like

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
outsides the chassis knock down like

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.560 
outsides the chassis knock down like
half<00:00:38.430> inch<00:00:38.700> on<00:00:38.940> both<00:00:38.969> sides<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:40.879> as<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.030> can<00:00:42.149> see

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
half inch on both sides I as you can see

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.150 
half inch on both sides I as you can see
where<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.899> ESC<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.590> melted<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:45.140> cut<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.530> old

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
where the ESC is melted I cut the old

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.819 
where the ESC is melted I cut the old
EST<00:00:47.820> tray<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:49.020> that's<00:00:49.170> just<00:00:49.260> like<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> hole

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
EST tray and so that's just like a hole

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.580 
EST tray and so that's just like a hole
right<00:00:49.860> there<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.910> mounted<00:00:51.420> speed<00:00:52.230> control

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
right there that mounted speed control

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.790 
right there that mounted speed control
in<00:00:52.739> there<00:00:52.920> as<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.460> can<00:00:53.550> see<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.910> lot<00:00:54.059> lower

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
in there as you can see it's a lot lower

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.830 
in there as you can see it's a lot lower
and<00:00:56.180> then<00:00:57.320> see<00:00:58.320> what<00:00:58.530> else<00:00:58.770> did<00:00:58.949> we<00:00:59.010> get<00:00:59.219> here

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
and then see what else did we get here

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.399 
and then see what else did we get here
cut<00:01:00.840> out<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.230> main<00:01:01.559> battery<00:01:02.270> place<00:01:03.409> placement

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
cut out the main battery place placement

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.620 
cut out the main battery place placement
the<00:01:05.159> whole<00:01:05.309> thing<00:01:05.549> as<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.270> see<00:01:06.450> there's

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
the whole thing as you can see there's

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.800 
the whole thing as you can see there's
no<00:01:07.159> outside<00:01:08.159> Trey<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:08.610> all<00:01:08.760> just<00:01:08.970> flat<00:01:09.210> it's

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
no outside Trey it's all just flat it's

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.710 
no outside Trey it's all just flat it's
all<00:01:09.960> under<00:01:10.200> here<00:01:10.439> now<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.860> made<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:11.970> metal

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
all under here now I made this metal

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.060 
all under here now I made this metal
battery<00:01:13.409> box<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:14.119> have<00:01:15.119> like<00:01:15.330> hinge<00:01:15.780> steel<00:01:16.500> just

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
battery box I have like hinge steel just

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.929 
battery box I have like hinge steel just
cut<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.340> up<00:01:17.460> with<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> saw<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:19.070> i<00:01:20.070> JB<00:01:20.580> welded

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
cut it up with the saw and i JB welded

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.850 
cut it up with the saw and i JB welded
it<00:01:21.090> together<00:01:21.210> it's<00:01:21.869> really<00:01:22.080> strong<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.590> can't

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
it together it's really strong I can't

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.399 
it together it's really strong I can't
pull<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.100> apart<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.990> had<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.200> figure

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
pull it apart so I just had to figure

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.890 
pull it apart so I just had to figure
out<00:01:25.590> now<00:01:25.740> how<00:01:25.950> I'm<00:01:26.040> gonna<00:01:26.270> like<00:01:27.270> attach<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.869> to

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
out now how I'm gonna like attach it to

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.569 
out now how I'm gonna like attach it to
chassis<00:01:28.320> right<00:01:28.650> now<00:01:28.770> it's<00:01:28.979> just<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.310> wrapped

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
chassis right now it's just I wrapped

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.800 
chassis right now it's just I wrapped
but<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.479> will<00:01:30.570> work<00:01:30.720> for<00:01:30.930> now<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:32.060> mean<00:01:33.060> go

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
but it will work for now so I mean go

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.710 
but it will work for now so I mean go
ahead<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.170> show<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.439> battery<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.490> there

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
ahead and show you a battery in there

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.640 
ahead and show you a battery in there
because<00:01:36.720> I'm<00:01:36.900> going<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.110> fit<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.380> good

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
because I'm going to fit that good

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.700 
because I'm going to fit that good
because<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.950> had<00:01:38.100> tie<00:01:38.280> racks<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:38.670> there<00:01:38.850> but

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
because I had tie racks in there but

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.010 
because I had tie racks in there but
that's<00:01:40.710> what's<00:01:41.009> going<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.220> be<00:01:41.430> like<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:42.479> lots

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
that's what's going to be like so lots

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.630 
that's what's going to be like so lots
lower<00:01:43.500> center<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:43.979> gravity<00:01:44.040> because<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
lower center of gravity because the

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.060 
lower center of gravity because the
batteries<00:01:45.030> one<00:01:45.240> most<00:01:46.170> heaviest<00:01:46.500> things<00:01:46.770> in

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
batteries one most heaviest things in

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.249 
batteries one most heaviest things in
those<00:01:47.189> cars<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:48.180> as<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.869> can<00:01:48.960> see<00:01:49.140> the

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
those cars so as you can see the

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.899 
those cars so as you can see the
batteries<00:01:49.649> not<00:01:49.860> even<00:01:50.070> sticking<00:01:50.399> up<00:01:50.610> on<00:01:50.759> it

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
batteries not even sticking up on it

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.010 
batteries not even sticking up on it
which<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.479> really<00:01:51.509> nice<00:01:52.820> so<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:54.750> will<00:01:54.930> help

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
which is really nice so this will help

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.990 
which is really nice so this will help
you<00:01:55.229> out<00:01:55.259> once<00:01:55.890> i<00:01:55.979> get<00:01:56.130> my<00:01:56.159> suspension<00:01:56.790> good

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
you out once i get my suspension good

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.090 
you out once i get my suspension good
and<00:01:57.689> i'll<00:01:57.810> tune<00:01:58.020> its<00:01:58.290> kind<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.530> tuned<00:01:58.860> for

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
and i'll tune its kind of tuned for

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.330 
and i'll tune its kind of tuned for
bashing<00:01:59.369> right<00:01:59.700> now<00:01:59.880> but<00:02:00.890> let's<00:02:01.890> just<00:02:01.950> set<00:02:02.219> up

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
bashing right now but let's just set up

sky radio system so i guess that's about
it<00:02:48.020> guys<00:02:48.230> I'll<00:02:48.800> get<00:02:48.920> some<00:02:49.100> running<00:02:49.340> video<00:02:49.580> is
