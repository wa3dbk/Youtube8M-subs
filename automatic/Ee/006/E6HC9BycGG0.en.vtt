and then this first one here is another
90s<00:03:44.470> crate<00:03:44.739> so<00:03:45.700> that's<00:03:45.820> what<00:03:45.940> we<00:03:46.030> got<00:03:46.150> there

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
90s crate so that's what we got there

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.180 
90s crate so that's what we got there
and<00:03:46.690> then<00:03:46.870> most<00:03:47.410> of<00:03:47.500> them<00:03:47.650> pretty<00:03:47.829> much<00:03:47.890> go

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
and then most of them pretty much go

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.630 
and then most of them pretty much go
along<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:50.200> same<00:03:50.530> we<00:03:50.739> got<00:03:50.890> another<00:03:51.100> 90s

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
along the the same we got another 90s

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.680 
along the the same we got another 90s
crate<00:03:51.970> here<00:03:53.040> and

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
crate here and

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.510 
crate here and
another<00:03:56.690> 80s<00:03:57.140> crate<00:03:57.440> and<00:03:57.860> you<00:03:58.310> know<00:03:58.370> going

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
another 80s crate and you know going

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.100 
another 80s crate and you know going
back<00:03:58.640> to<00:03:58.910> this<00:03:59.030> one<00:03:59.090> I<00:03:59.510> don't<00:03:59.780> know<00:03:59.840> if<00:03:59.930> you<00:03:59.990> can

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
back to this one I don't know if you can

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.380 
back to this one I don't know if you can
see<00:04:00.260> that<00:04:00.410> this<00:04:00.620> is<00:04:00.800> Bobby<00:04:01.610> Jimmy<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:02.300> the

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
see that this is Bobby Jimmy and the

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.780 
see that this is Bobby Jimmy and the
critters<00:04:02.780> I<00:04:03.230> remember<00:04:04.040> Bobby<00:04:04.250> Jimmy<00:04:04.550> and<00:04:04.730> the

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
critters I remember Bobby Jimmy and the

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.280 
critters I remember Bobby Jimmy and the
critters<00:04:05.120> from<00:04:05.300> back<00:04:05.510> in<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.690> 80s<00:04:05.780> and<00:04:06.230> I

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
critters from back in the 80s and I

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.290 
critters from back in the 80s and I
think<00:04:06.530> they<00:04:06.620> need<00:04:06.770> to<00:04:06.800> come<00:04:07.010> back<00:04:07.160> and<00:04:07.460> release

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
think they need to come back and release

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.060 
think they need to come back and release
another<00:04:08.540> album<00:04:08.630> the<00:04:09.050> song<00:04:09.320> that<00:04:09.560> I<00:04:09.590> remember

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
another album the song that I remember

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.900 
another album the song that I remember
the<00:04:10.100> most

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
the most

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.250 
the most
I<00:04:10.940> guess<00:04:11.240> there's<00:04:11.390> actually<00:04:11.690> two<00:04:11.810> of<00:04:11.840> them<00:04:12.050> one

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
I guess there's actually two of them one

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.950 
I guess there's actually two of them one
was<00:04:12.410> called<00:04:12.710> we<00:04:13.190> like<00:04:13.370> ugly<00:04:13.820> women<00:04:13.970> and<00:04:14.390> the

other one was called roaches and you

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.430 
other one was called roaches and you
know<00:04:17.180> Bobby<00:04:17.390> Jimmy<00:04:17.720> the<00:04:17.810> critters<00:04:18.080> was<00:04:18.230> kind

guess<00:04:35.560> 2000<00:04:36.560> and<00:04:36.650> newer<00:04:36.740> in<00:04:37.010> this<00:04:37.190> crate<00:04:37.660> as

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
guess 2000 and newer in this crate as

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.190 
guess 2000 and newer in this crate as
well<00:04:38.870> as<00:04:39.050> this<00:04:39.170> one<00:04:39.790> there's<00:04:40.790> a<00:04:40.880> lot<00:04:41.090> more<00:04:41.360> 2000

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
well as this one there's a lot more 2000

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.980 
well as this one there's a lot more 2000
and<00:04:42.320> newer<00:04:42.470> than<00:04:42.770> I<00:04:42.920> originally<00:04:43.310> thought

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
and newer than I originally thought

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.460 
and newer than I originally thought
basically<00:04:46.060> you<00:04:47.060> know<00:04:47.180> there's<00:04:47.450> another<00:04:47.720> 2000

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
basically you know there's another 2000

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.080 
basically you know there's another 2000
a<00:04:48.530> newer<00:04:49.060> there's<00:04:50.060> another<00:04:50.450> one<00:04:51.880> this<00:04:52.880> whole

a newer there's another one this whole

00:04:53.090 --> 00:05:03.160 
a newer there's another one this whole

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
bin here and back here as well and same

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.700 
bin here and back here as well and same
thing<00:05:03.200> with<00:05:03.410> that<00:05:03.740> one<00:05:03.980> and<00:05:04.580> then<00:05:04.940> one<00:05:05.420> last

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
thing with that one and then one last

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.760 
thing with that one and then one last
80s<00:05:06.710> crate<00:05:07.010> right<00:05:07.970> here<00:05:08.390> so<00:05:08.990> I've<00:05:09.380> been<00:05:09.470> going

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
80s crate right here so I've been going

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.530 
80s crate right here so I've been going
through<00:05:09.800> everything<00:05:10.670> as<00:05:10.880> I've<00:05:11.000> been<00:05:11.120> sorting

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
through everything as I've been sorting

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.630 
through everything as I've been sorting
it<00:05:11.630> and<00:05:11.810> a<00:05:11.870> lot<00:05:12.020> of<00:05:12.050> stuff<00:05:12.320> that<00:05:12.350> I<00:05:12.470> recognize<00:05:13.010> a

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
it and a lot of stuff that I recognize a

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.280 
it and a lot of stuff that I recognize a
lot<00:05:14.000> of<00:05:14.060> stuff<00:05:14.270> that<00:05:14.300> I<00:05:14.420> don't<00:05:14.720> -<00:05:14.960> which<00:05:15.170> will

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
lot of stuff that I don't - which will

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.650 
lot of stuff that I don't - which will
actually<00:05:15.790> be<00:05:16.790> interesting<00:05:17.240> like<00:05:17.330> the<00:05:17.390> song

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
actually be interesting like the song

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.660 
actually be interesting like the song
like<00:05:17.930> through<00:05:18.110> Ron<00:05:18.290> I<00:05:18.590> didn't<00:05:18.950> recognize<00:05:19.400> it

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:19.670 
like through Ron I didn't recognize it

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.700 
like through Ron I didn't recognize it
but<00:05:20.030> I<00:05:20.390> thought<00:05:20.750> I<00:05:20.810> had<00:05:20.960> a<00:05:20.990> good<00:05:21.200> beat<00:05:21.350> to<00:05:21.560> it<00:05:21.590> a

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
but I thought I had a good beat to it a

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.130 
but I thought I had a good beat to it a
lot<00:05:21.890> of<00:05:22.010> good<00:05:22.300> sampling<00:05:23.300> of<00:05:23.420> some<00:05:23.660> some<00:05:23.990> old

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
lot of good sampling of some some old

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.100 
lot of good sampling of some some old
school<00:05:24.380> stuff<00:05:24.650> from<00:05:24.860> there<00:05:25.090> so<00:05:26.090> we're<00:05:26.990> gonna

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
school stuff from there so we're gonna

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.080 
school stuff from there so we're gonna
start<00:05:27.680> to<00:05:27.770> do<00:05:27.890> some<00:05:28.070> crate<00:05:28.250> dig<00:05:28.460> soon<00:05:28.760> but<00:05:29.000> what

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
start to do some crate dig soon but what

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.910 
start to do some crate dig soon but what
I<00:05:29.120> thought<00:05:29.390> would<00:05:29.570> be<00:05:29.720> a<00:05:29.750> lot<00:05:29.900> of<00:05:30.020> fun<00:05:30.230> is

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:30.920 
I thought would be a lot of fun is

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.290 
I thought would be a lot of fun is
instead<00:05:31.370> of<00:05:31.490> me<00:05:31.610> going<00:05:31.820> through<00:05:32.120> and<00:05:32.240> just

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
instead of me going through and just

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.840 
instead of me going through and just
kind<00:05:32.810> of<00:05:32.840> picking<00:05:33.140> a<00:05:33.200> crate<00:05:33.470> is<00:05:34.160> if<00:05:34.370> we<00:05:34.490> left<00:05:34.700> it

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
kind of picking a crate is if we left it
