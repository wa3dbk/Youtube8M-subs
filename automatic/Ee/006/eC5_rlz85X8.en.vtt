00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
controller team and don't see Magoffin

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.610 
controller team and don't see Magoffin
so<00:00:07.859> Scott<00:00:08.189> know<00:00:09.030> why<00:00:09.599> do<00:00:09.660> analog<00:00:10.200> sticks<00:00:10.469> on

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
so Scott know why do analog sticks on

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.089 
so Scott know why do analog sticks on
this<00:00:10.769> steam<00:00:11.190> controller<00:00:11.550> so<00:00:13.009> there's<00:00:14.009> plenty

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
this steam controller so there's plenty

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.499 
this steam controller so there's plenty
of<00:00:14.280> great<00:00:14.519> controllers<00:00:14.910> out<00:00:15.030> there<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.330> have

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
of great controllers out there that have

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.870 
of great controllers out there that have
great<00:00:15.990> dual<00:00:16.500> analog<00:00:16.710> sticks<00:00:17.130> but<00:00:17.340> our<00:00:17.730> main

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
great dual analog sticks but our main

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.900 
great dual analog sticks but our main
goal<00:00:18.060> with<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.390> steam<00:00:18.570> controller<00:00:18.890> there's

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
goal with the steam controller there's

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.269 
goal with the steam controller there's
over<00:00:20.910> 3,000<00:00:21.539> or<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:21.720> games<00:00:21.869> on<00:00:22.109> Steam<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.500> a

over 3,000 or so games on Steam and a
large<00:00:24.269> majority<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.869> them<00:00:25.109> were<00:00:25.380> never

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
large majority of them were never

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.019 
large majority of them were never
designed<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.609> be<00:00:26.699> played<00:00:26.849> with<00:00:26.880> the

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
designed to be played with the

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.990 
designed to be played with the
controller<00:00:27.330> period<00:00:28.130> so<00:00:29.130> when<00:00:29.609> we<00:00:29.699> set<00:00:29.880> out<00:00:29.970> to

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
controller period so when we set out to

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.359 
controller period so when we set out to
work<00:00:30.420> on<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.840> steam<00:00:31.500> controller<00:00:31.590> one<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.340> our

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
work on the steam controller one of our

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.250 
work on the steam controller one of our
main<00:00:32.520> goals<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.210> can<00:00:33.719> pick<00:00:34.020> up<00:00:34.140> any

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
game that I want two on steam might be

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.459 
game that I want two on steam might be
sitting<00:00:36.329> on<00:00:36.450> my<00:00:36.570> couch<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.079> can<00:00:37.230> go<00:00:37.320> and

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
sitting on my couch and I can go and

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.780 
sitting on my couch and I can go and
play<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.770> game<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.040> have<00:00:38.190> fun<00:00:38.340> playing<00:00:38.610> it

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
of people play that on seeing all the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.410 
of people play that on seeing all the
time<00:00:43.590> but<00:00:44.309> there's<00:00:44.489> no<00:00:44.789> way<00:00:44.820> right<00:00:45.120> now<00:00:45.149> then

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
time but there's no way right now then

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.610 
time but there's no way right now then
you<00:00:45.510> can<00:00:45.660> go<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.870> play<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.140> game<00:00:46.260> unless

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
you can go and play that game unless

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.170 
you can go and play that game unless
you're<00:00:46.829> sitting<00:00:47.520> at<00:00:47.579> your<00:00:47.640> desk<00:00:47.730> with<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.000> mouse

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
you're sitting at your desk with a mouse

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.569 
you're sitting at your desk with a mouse
I<00:00:48.390> mean<00:00:48.539> sure<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.079> can<00:00:49.350> kind<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.160> try<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.399> rig

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
I mean sure you can kind of try and rig

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.639 
I mean sure you can kind of try and rig
up<00:00:50.670> something<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.390> they<00:00:51.539> got<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.079> push<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
up something so they got to push on the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.900 
up something so they got to push on the
couch<00:00:52.829> or<00:00:53.010> whatever<00:00:53.219> but<00:00:53.370> it's<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.789> know<00:00:53.879> it's

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
couch or whatever but it's you know it's

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.380 
couch or whatever but it's you know it's
not<00:00:54.120> really<00:00:54.300> ideal<00:00:54.890> so<00:00:55.890> there's<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.030> part<00:00:57.270> of

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
not really ideal so there's that part of

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.639 
not really ideal so there's that part of
it<00:00:57.480> which<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.780> we<00:00:57.899> want<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.140> enable<00:00:58.289> all<00:00:58.530> these

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
it which is we want to enable all these

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.020 
it which is we want to enable all these
games<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.070> just<00:00:59.219> fundamentally<00:00:59.910> we're

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
games that just fundamentally we're

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.889 
games that just fundamentally we're
never<00:01:00.120> designed<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.510> be<00:01:00.600> played<00:01:00.750> with<00:01:00.780> a

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
never designed to be played with a

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.450 
never designed to be played with a
controller<00:01:01.199> like<00:01:01.440> here<00:01:01.980> we're<00:01:02.160> showing<00:01:02.280> off

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
controller like here we're showing off

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.640 
controller like here we're showing off
broken<00:01:02.789> age<00:01:02.910> as<00:01:03.719> well<00:01:03.870> which<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.619> know

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
broken age as well which is you know

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.649 
broken age as well which is you know
great<00:01:05.280> game<00:01:05.460> from<00:01:05.729> Tim<00:01:06.030> Schafer<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.450> double

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
fine again it's completely mouse

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.899 
fine again it's completely mouse
controls<00:01:09.150> which<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.990> fine<00:01:10.860> but<00:01:11.159> if<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.580> want<00:01:11.820> to

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
controls which is fine but if I want to

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.460 
controls which is fine but if I want to
go<00:01:12.030> just<00:01:12.420> kick<00:01:12.720> back<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:12.900> my<00:01:13.049> couch<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.320> play

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
go just kick back on my couch and play

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.590 
go just kick back on my couch and play
it<00:01:13.619> it's<00:01:13.799> kind<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.280> non-starter<00:01:14.760> but<00:01:15.509> with

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
it it's kind of a non-starter but with

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.359 
it it's kind of a non-starter but with
the<00:01:15.659> stream<00:01:15.840> controller<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.320> can<00:01:16.350> even<00:01:17.189> know

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
the stream controller you can even know

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.670 
the stream controller you can even know
you<00:01:17.430> critically<00:01:17.850> play<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.240> game<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.680> that's

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
you critically play that game so that's

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
you critically play that game so that's
a<00:01:19.740> big<00:01:19.890> part<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.310> then<00:01:20.430> there's<00:01:20.610> also

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
a big part of it but then there's also

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.340 
a big part of it but then there's also
the<00:01:20.880> other<00:01:21.180> side<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.420> things<00:01:21.570> which<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.930> just<00:01:22.259> a

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
the other side of things which is just a

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.380 
the other side of things which is just a
lot<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.470> gamers<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:23.040> come<00:01:23.729> from<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.909> pc<00:01:24.180> side

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
lot of gamers that come from the pc side

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.249 
lot of gamers that come from the pc side
that<00:01:24.630> maybe<00:01:24.780> they<00:01:24.869> play<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.020> lot<00:01:25.110> of

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
that maybe they play a lot of

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.429 
that maybe they play a lot of
first-person<00:01:25.530> shooters<00:01:27.020> some<00:01:28.020> amount<00:01:28.290> of

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
a controller that you know enables imbue

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.050 
a controller that you know enables imbue
so<00:02:29.769> made<00:02:29.920> it<00:02:30.040> up<00:02:30.099> until<00:02:30.340> that<00:02:30.430> point<00:02:30.489> they<00:02:30.940> were

so made it up until that point they were

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.449 
so made it up until that point they were

type of game and we're trying to provide

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.390 
type of game and we're trying to provide
something<00:02:40.690> that<00:02:40.900> like<00:02:41.110> at<00:02:41.590> least<00:02:41.950> opening<00:02:42.340> a

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
something that like at least opening a

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.819 
something that like at least opening a
new<00:02:42.549> avenue<00:02:42.700> for<00:02:42.910> other<00:02:43.840> types<00:02:43.989> of<00:02:44.140> games<00:02:44.319> you

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
new avenue for other types of games you

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.530 
new avenue for other types of games you
guys<00:02:44.980> you're<00:02:45.099> still<00:02:45.400> adjusting<00:02:45.700> the

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
guys you're still adjusting the

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.360 
guys you're still adjusting the
controller<00:02:46.959> a<00:02:47.380> little<00:02:47.860> bit<00:02:47.980> like<00:02:48.099> it's<00:02:48.250> not

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
controller a little bit like it's not

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.190 
controller a little bit like it's not
final<00:02:48.730> any<00:02:48.970> means<00:02:49.150> how<00:02:49.599> this<00:02:49.780> came<00:02:50.019> as

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
final any means how this came as

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.900 
final any means how this came as
community<00:02:50.590> feedback<00:02:50.739> helped<00:02:51.220> at<00:02:51.310> all<00:02:51.400> when

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
community feedback helped at all when

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.720 
community feedback helped at all when
you<00:02:51.970> first<00:02:52.239> announced<00:02:52.480> it<00:02:52.720> yeah<00:02:53.019> so<00:02:53.730> we're

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
you first announced it yeah so we're

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.430 
you first announced it yeah so we're
trying<00:02:54.910> to<00:02:54.970> treat<00:02:55.120> our<00:02:55.329> hardware<00:02:55.780> development

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
trying to treat our hardware development

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.190 
trying to treat our hardware development
more<00:02:57.190> like<00:02:57.670> our<00:02:58.000> software<00:02:58.569> development<00:02:59.049> then

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
more like our software development then

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.190 
more like our software development then
I<00:02:59.410> think<00:02:59.560> most<00:02:59.739> hardware<00:03:00.130> developers<00:03:00.489> do<00:03:01.200> so

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
I think most hardware developers do so

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.199 
I think most hardware developers do so
Chow<00:03:02.620> was<00:03:03.069> our<00:03:03.250> third<00:03:03.519> prototype<00:03:03.760> is<00:03:04.120> the

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
Chow was our third prototype is the

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.460 
Chow was our third prototype is the
person<00:03:04.420> when<00:03:04.510> we<00:03:04.600> showed<00:03:04.750> publicly<00:03:05.200> we<00:03:05.380> had

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
person when we showed publicly we had

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.599 
person when we showed publicly we had
Alex<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.549> best<00:03:06.819> deal<00:03:07.000> before<00:03:07.180> that<00:03:07.480> and<00:03:08.609> we

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
Alex and best deal before that and we

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.580 
Alex and best deal before that and we
not<00:03:10.450> only<00:03:10.480> were<00:03:10.810> we<00:03:10.840> working<00:03:11.200> on<00:03:11.260> additional

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
not only were we working on additional

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.199 
not only were we working on additional
changes<00:03:11.950> of<00:03:12.160> that<00:03:12.280> internally<00:03:12.819> but<00:03:12.970> we<00:03:13.090> also

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
changes of that internally but we also

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.970 
changes of that internally but we also
was<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.079> first<00:03:14.260> time<00:03:14.319> he'd<00:03:14.470> actually<00:03:14.590> tested

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
was the first time he'd actually tested

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.319 
was the first time he'd actually tested
out<00:03:15.069> more<00:03:15.250> of<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:15.370> real<00:03:15.519> production<00:03:15.850> run<00:03:16.060> we<00:03:16.209> had

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
out more of a real production run we had

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.030 
out more of a real production run we had
actual<00:03:16.720> real<00:03:16.870> molds<00:03:17.230> and<00:03:17.319> everything<00:03:17.650> like

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
actual real molds and everything like

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.620 
actual real molds and everything like
the<00:03:18.459> hardware<00:03:18.700> team<00:03:18.819> did<00:03:18.940> valve<00:03:19.150> is<00:03:19.269> new<00:03:19.420> so

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
the hardware team did valve is new so

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.030 
the hardware team did valve is new so
we're<00:03:19.750> still<00:03:19.930> trying<00:03:20.109> to<00:03:20.260> work<00:03:20.739> out<00:03:20.859> all<00:03:21.010> our

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
we're still trying to work out all our

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.650 
we're still trying to work out all our
processes<00:03:21.639> but<00:03:22.120> we<00:03:22.209> sent<00:03:22.389> that<00:03:22.450> at<00:03:22.540> that

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
processes but we sent that at that

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.479 
processes but we sent that at that
design<00:03:23.500> out<00:03:23.620> to<00:03:23.739> 300<00:03:24.100> people<00:03:24.310> in<00:03:24.400> the

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
design out to 300 people in the

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.129 
design out to 300 people in the
community<00:03:24.819> to<00:03:25.239> get<00:03:25.389> their<00:03:25.510> feedback<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:25.840> like

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
community to get their feedback and like

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.300 
community to get their feedback and like
see<00:03:26.350> what<00:03:26.470> things<00:03:26.590> they<00:03:26.769> were<00:03:26.829> liking<00:03:27.190> what

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
see what things they were liking what

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.059 
see what things they were liking what
things<00:03:27.459> they<00:03:27.579> weren't<00:03:27.910> and<00:03:28.680> even<00:03:29.680> by<00:03:29.799> the<00:03:29.859> time

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
things they weren't and even by the time

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:31.259 
things they weren't and even by the time
it<00:03:30.190> shipped<00:03:30.459> out<00:03:30.579> people<00:03:30.850> we<00:03:30.940> already<00:03:31.150> knew

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
it shipped out people we already knew

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.430 
it shipped out people we already knew
there<00:03:31.450> a<00:03:31.480> certain<00:03:31.660> number<00:03:31.870> of<00:03:32.019> changes<00:03:32.230> we're

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
there a certain number of changes we're

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.289 
there a certain number of changes we're
going<00:03:32.560> to<00:03:32.620> make<00:03:32.799> but<00:03:33.220> then<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:33.850> know<00:03:33.940> seeing

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
going to make but then you know seeing

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:35.910 
going to make but then you know seeing
feedback<00:03:34.630> link<00:03:34.840> community<00:03:35.200> helped<00:03:35.560> us<00:03:35.680> like

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
feedback link community helped us like

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.250 
feedback link community helped us like
realize<00:03:36.370> which<00:03:37.299> which<00:03:37.720> of<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:37.900> things<00:03:38.079> we

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
realize which which of the things we

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.900 
realize which which of the things we
knew<00:03:38.859> were<00:03:38.980> important<00:03:39.370> we're<00:03:39.730> being

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
knew were important we're being

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.190 
knew were important we're being
reinforced<00:03:40.180> in<00:03:40.540> which<00:03:40.630> things<00:03:40.810> were<00:03:41.019> new<00:03:41.170> to

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
reinforced in which things were new to

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.990 
reinforced in which things were new to
us<00:03:41.380> and<00:03:41.769> you<00:03:42.220> know<00:03:42.250> which<00:03:42.459> things<00:03:42.639> we<00:03:42.790> thought

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
us and you know which things we thought

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.250 
us and you know which things we thought
were<00:03:43.180> important<00:03:43.540> to<00:03:43.569> mentors<00:03:43.900> like<00:03:43.930> no<00:03:44.139> that's

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
were important to mentors like no that's

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.809 
were important to mentors like no that's
actually<00:03:44.410> not<00:03:44.620> problem<00:03:44.980> so<00:03:45.190> all<00:03:45.639> those<00:03:45.760> things

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
actually not problem so all those things

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:47.789 
actually not problem so all those things
going<00:03:46.120> to<00:03:46.180> go<00:03:46.269> together<00:03:46.389> and<00:03:46.810> need<00:03:47.139> to<00:03:47.170> change

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
going to go together and need to change

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.920 
going to go together and need to change
is<00:03:47.889> like<00:03:48.040> like<00:03:48.430> dog<00:03:48.639> where<00:03:48.910> you

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
is like like dog where you

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.569 
is like like dog where you
we<00:03:50.650> already<00:03:50.859> know<00:03:50.980> we're<00:03:51.219> going<00:03:51.340> to<00:03:51.400> make<00:03:51.489> this

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
we already know we're going to make this

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.280 
we already know we're going to make this
change<00:03:51.819> and<00:03:52.209> now<00:03:52.390> we<00:03:52.450> just<00:03:52.569> need<00:03:52.659> that<00:03:52.870> data<00:03:53.079> to

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
change and now we just need that data to

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.750 
change and now we just need that data to
know<00:03:53.439> is<00:03:53.799> it<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.069> right<00:03:54.189> change<00:03:54.400> to<00:03:54.489> make<00:03:54.640> or

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
know is it the right change to make or

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.360 
know is it the right change to make or
not<00:03:54.819> or<00:03:55.359> hey<00:03:56.140> guys<00:03:56.409> these<00:03:57.129> guys<00:03:57.189> are

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
not or hey guys these guys are

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.470 
not or hey guys these guys are
presenting<00:03:57.700> something<00:03:57.819> that<00:03:57.969> we<00:03:58.030> hadn't

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
presenting something that we hadn't

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.380 
presenting something that we hadn't
thought<00:03:58.510> of<00:03:58.629> let's<00:03:58.959> look<00:03:59.319> at<00:03:59.439> that<00:03:59.530> so<00:04:00.390> we

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
thought of let's look at that so we

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.729 
thought of let's look at that so we
imagine<00:04:01.780> there'll<00:04:02.109> be<00:04:02.140> some<00:04:02.379> additional

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
imagine there'll be some additional

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.940 
imagine there'll be some additional
changes<00:04:02.859> going<00:04:03.609> forward<00:04:03.849> but<00:04:04.319> for<00:04:05.319> now<00:04:05.409> dog<00:04:05.709> is

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
changes going forward but for now dog is

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.059 
changes going forward but for now dog is
is<00:04:06.280> where<00:04:06.519> we're<00:04:06.639> at<00:04:06.670> and<00:04:07.319> we're<00:04:08.319> going<00:04:08.920> to<00:04:08.980> get

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
is where we're at and we're going to get

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.399 
is where we're at and we're going to get
more<00:04:09.340> feedback<00:04:09.459> on<00:04:09.760> that<00:04:09.879> has<00:04:10.719> been<00:04:10.930> how<00:04:11.109> is<00:04:11.139> GC

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
more feedback on that has been how is GC

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.050 
more feedback on that has been how is GC
been<00:04:11.829> with<00:04:12.280> people<00:04:12.489> exceeding<00:04:12.819> their<00:04:12.909> hands

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
been with people exceeding their hands

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.610 
been with people exceeding their hands
out<00:04:13.180> of<00:04:13.239> the<00:04:13.329> controller<00:04:13.629> publicly<00:04:14.439> for<00:04:14.560> the

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
out of the controller publicly for the

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.349 
out of the controller publicly for the
first<00:04:14.680> time<00:04:14.950> have<00:04:15.189> they<00:04:15.340> been<00:04:15.519> receiving<00:04:16.269> it

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
first time have they been receiving it

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.680 
first time have they been receiving it
so<00:04:17.079> far<00:04:17.229> seems<00:04:17.440> really<00:04:17.620> good<00:04:17.880> you<00:04:18.880> know<00:04:18.970> the

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
so far seems really good you know the

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.999 
so far seems really good you know the
heft<00:04:20.169> of<00:04:20.259> the<00:04:20.350> controller<00:04:20.590> is<00:04:20.709> a<00:04:20.769> lot<00:04:20.919> better

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:21.009 
heft of the controller is a lot better

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:22.469 
heft of the controller is a lot better
has<00:04:21.220> batteries<00:04:21.579> in<00:04:21.789> it<00:04:21.880> now<00:04:22.030> which<00:04:22.270> the

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
has batteries in it now which the

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:23.640 
has batteries in it now which the
earlier<00:04:22.840> prototypes<00:04:23.169> didn't<00:04:23.410> have<00:04:23.500> people

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
earlier prototypes didn't have people

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.950 
earlier prototypes didn't have people
thought<00:04:24.009> it<00:04:24.070> was<00:04:24.190> kind<00:04:24.520> of<00:04:24.550> too<00:04:24.910> light<00:04:25.120> and<00:04:25.360> we

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
thought it was kind of too light and we

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.180 
thought it was kind of too light and we
always<00:04:26.050> knew<00:04:26.199> that<00:04:26.259> they<00:04:26.440> would<00:04:26.800> eventually

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
always knew that they would eventually

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
if we feel like we're really on the

00:04:58.449 --> 00:04:59.969 
if we feel like we're really on the
wrong<00:04:58.570> track<00:04:58.810> we<00:04:59.020> will<00:04:59.199> make<00:04:59.380> more<00:04:59.620> radical

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
wrong track we will make more radical

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.939 
wrong track we will make more radical
changes<00:05:00.280> but<00:05:00.490> if<00:05:01.300> it's<00:05:01.539> dumped<00:05:02.530> tailing<00:05:02.830> into

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
changes but if it's dumped tailing into

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:04.290 
changes but if it's dumped tailing into
something<00:05:03.220> that<00:05:03.250> looks<00:05:03.370> like<00:05:03.760> it's<00:05:03.940> on<00:05:04.060> on

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
something that looks like it's on on

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.300 
something that looks like it's on on
track<00:05:04.539> then<00:05:04.750> you<00:05:05.229> know<00:05:05.349> we'll<00:05:06.070> stick<00:05:06.280> with

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
track then you know we'll stick with

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.430 
track then you know we'll stick with
that<00:05:06.520> end<00:05:06.760> and<00:05:07.210> it<00:05:07.960> feels<00:05:08.139> like<00:05:08.229> it's<00:05:08.349> getting

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
that end and it feels like it's getting

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.890 
that end and it feels like it's getting
much<00:05:08.800> closer<00:05:09.010> at<00:05:09.220> this<00:05:09.310> point<00:05:09.520> so<00:05:09.900> hopefully

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
much closer at this point so hopefully

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.650 
much closer at this point so hopefully
we<00:05:11.260> will<00:05:11.380> have<00:05:11.470> it<00:05:11.590> out
