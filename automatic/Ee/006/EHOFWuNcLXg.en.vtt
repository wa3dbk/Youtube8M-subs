spring it has like a little spring in it
against<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.229> spring<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.299> load<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.509> bearings

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
against the spring and load the bearings

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.950 
against the spring and load the bearings
in<00:01:37.729> there<00:01:38.729> put<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.060> lot<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.270> grease<00:01:39.450> on<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.689> and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
in there put a lot of grease on it and

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.450 
in there put a lot of grease on it and
load<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.259> bearings<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.770> there<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.310> low

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
load the bearings in there on the low

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.999 
load the bearings in there on the low
spot<00:01:41.930> when<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.020> get<00:01:43.140> them<00:01:43.290> all<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.439> there<00:01:43.829> and

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
spot when you get them all in there and

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.250 
spot when you get them all in there and
they're<00:01:44.130> loaded<00:01:44.310> down<00:01:44.759> on

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
they're loaded down on

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.640 
they're loaded down on
low<00:01:45.530> spot<00:01:46.600> you<00:01:47.600> have<00:01:47.720> to<00:01:47.870> keep<00:01:48.020> it<00:01:48.200> turn<00:01:48.410> to<00:01:48.560> the

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
low spot you have to keep it turn to the

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.470 
low spot you have to keep it turn to the
left<00:01:48.830> when<00:01:49.640> you<00:01:49.670> get<00:01:49.880> it<00:01:50.000> all<00:01:50.180> done

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
left when you get it all done

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.700 
left when you get it all done
get<00:01:50.780> all<00:01:50.870> the<00:01:50.960> bearings<00:01:51.200> greased<00:01:51.470> in<00:01:51.590> there

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
get all the bearings greased in there

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.040 
get all the bearings greased in there
then<00:01:51.890> you<00:01:51.920> take<00:01:52.160> a<00:01:52.190> rubber<00:01:52.400> band<00:01:52.520> and<00:01:53.030> you<00:01:53.060> wrap

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
then you take a rubber band and you wrap

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.990 
then you take a rubber band and you wrap
it<00:01:54.080> around<00:01:54.290> here<00:01:54.740> tight<00:01:55.370> enough<00:01:55.640> for<00:01:55.880> it<00:01:55.940> to

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
it around here tight enough for it to

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.750 
it around here tight enough for it to
stay<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:56.750> it<00:01:57.590> says<00:01:57.830> to<00:01:58.010> go<00:01:58.160> ahead<00:01:58.280> and<00:01:58.520> put<00:01:58.640> it

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
stay and it says to go ahead and put it

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.180 
stay and it says to go ahead and put it
together<00:01:58.880> that<00:01:59.180> away<00:01:59.600> and<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.290> rubber<00:02:00.770> bands

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
together that away and the rubber bands

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.860 
together that away and the rubber bands
are<00:02:01.490> not<00:02:01.700> going<00:02:01.880> to<00:02:01.940> hurt<00:02:02.030> nothing<00:02:02.450> there<00:02:02.690> I

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
are not going to hurt nothing there I

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.780 
are not going to hurt nothing there I
guess<00:02:03.170> use<00:02:03.410> a<00:02:03.440> little<00:02:03.770> rubber<00:02:04.340> band<00:02:04.550> I<00:02:04.760> don't

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
guess use a little rubber band I don't

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.000 
guess use a little rubber band I don't
you<00:02:05.630> know<00:02:05.720> usually<00:02:06.080> standard<00:02:06.410> transmissions

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
you know usually standard transmissions

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.520 
you know usually standard transmissions
are<00:02:07.160> pretty<00:02:07.340> tough<00:02:07.600> and<00:02:08.600> I<00:02:08.750> don't<00:02:08.930> think<00:02:09.170> it

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
are pretty tough and I don't think it

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.200 
are pretty tough and I don't think it
would<00:02:09.740> hurt<00:02:09.860> anything<00:02:10.280> myself<00:02:10.460> but<00:02:10.970> that's

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
would hurt anything myself but that's

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.560 
would hurt anything myself but that's
the<00:02:11.390> only<00:02:11.690> thing<00:02:11.960> that<00:02:12.200> I<00:02:12.260> haven't<00:02:12.620> done<00:02:13.570> the

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
the only thing that I haven't done the

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.980 
the only thing that I haven't done the
problem<00:02:14.990> that<00:02:15.110> I'm<00:02:15.260> having<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:17.300> transmission

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
problem that I'm having the transmission

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.170 
problem that I'm having the transmission
works<00:02:18.230> perfect<00:02:21.280> well<00:02:22.280> he<00:02:22.460> don't<00:02:22.580> work<00:02:22.760> perfect

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
works perfect well he don't work perfect

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.360 
works perfect well he don't work perfect
because<00:02:23.390> I<00:02:23.540> will<00:02:23.690> drive<00:02:23.870> in<00:02:24.050> working<00:02:24.440> but<00:02:25.280> as

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
because I will drive in working but as

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.360 
because I will drive in working but as
far<00:02:25.640> as<00:02:25.670> 1st<00:02:26.060> 2nd<00:02:26.570> and<00:02:26.600> 3rd

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
far as 1st 2nd and 3rd

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.180 
far as 1st 2nd and 3rd
that's<00:02:28.370> what<00:02:28.610> I<00:02:28.640> rebuilt<00:02:29.120> on<00:02:29.360> it<00:02:29.540> I<00:02:29.980> don't<00:02:30.980> know

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
that's what I rebuilt on it I don't know

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.770 
that's what I rebuilt on it I don't know
what<00:02:31.310> happened<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.790> tranny<00:02:32.000> blew<00:02:32.270> up<00:02:32.450> on<00:02:32.630> him

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
what happened the tranny blew up on him

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.050 
what happened the tranny blew up on him
and<00:02:32.900> I<00:02:33.050> mean<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:33.410> had<00:02:33.620> gears<00:02:34.580> and<00:02:34.880> bearings

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
and I mean it had gears and bearings

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.750 
and I mean it had gears and bearings
everywhere<00:02:35.720> cleaned<00:02:36.020> it<00:02:36.140> all<00:02:36.260> out<00:02:36.640> we<00:02:37.640> went

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
everywhere cleaned it all out we went

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.610 
everywhere cleaned it all out we went
into<00:02:37.940> tall<00:02:38.209> soup<00:02:38.480> got<00:02:38.750> all<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.020> parts<00:02:39.230> brought

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
into tall soup got all the parts brought

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.020 
into tall soup got all the parts brought
him<00:02:39.709> back

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
him back

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.050 
him back
I<00:02:41.060> put<00:02:41.990> 2nd<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:45.680> main<00:02:45.920> input<00:02:46.160> shaft<00:02:46.700> and

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
I put 2nd and the main input shaft and

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.910 
I put 2nd and the main input shaft and
the<00:02:47.209> bearing<00:02:48.459> cleaned<00:02:49.459> it<00:02:49.580> up<00:02:49.670> real<00:02:49.910> good<00:02:50.920> put

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
the bearing cleaned it up real good put

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.360 
the bearing cleaned it up real good put
everything<00:02:52.190> together<00:02:54.070> put<00:02:55.070> all<00:02:55.220> this

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
everything together put all this

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.010 
everything together put all this
together<00:02:55.580> checked<00:02:56.150> everything<00:02:56.600> cleaned

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
together checked everything cleaned

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.800 
together checked everything cleaned
overdrive<00:02:57.530> put<00:02:57.770> it<00:02:57.860> all<00:02:57.980> together<00:02:58.160> and<00:02:58.810> you

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
overdrive put it all together and you

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.140 
overdrive put it all together and you
got<00:02:59.959> 1st<00:03:00.320> 2nd<00:03:00.769> and<00:03:00.830> 3rd<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.459> when<00:03:01.670> you<00:03:01.850> push

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
got 1st 2nd and 3rd and when you push

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.030 
got 1st 2nd and 3rd and when you push
the<00:03:02.360> cable<00:03:02.540> in<00:03:02.930> because<00:03:03.350> it's<00:03:03.470> got<00:03:03.620> a<00:03:03.650> cable

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
the cable in because it's got a cable

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.070 
the cable in because it's got a cable
that<00:03:04.190> goes<00:03:04.220> pulls<00:03:04.790> in<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:05.120> out<00:03:05.269> for<00:03:05.630> overdrive

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
that goes pulls in and out for overdrive

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.070 
that goes pulls in and out for overdrive
so<00:03:06.350> the<00:03:06.440> overdrive<00:03:06.830> will<00:03:07.010> work<00:03:07.720> it<00:03:08.720> pushes

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
so the overdrive will work it pushes

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.670 
so the overdrive will work it pushes
this<00:03:09.230> in<00:03:09.440> and<00:03:09.560> out<00:03:09.680> which<00:03:10.040> is<00:03:11.260> stays<00:03:12.260> up<00:03:12.470> here

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
this in and out which is stays up here

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.130 
this in and out which is stays up here
but<00:03:13.040> anyway<00:03:13.340> it<00:03:13.400> pushes<00:03:13.820> it<00:03:14.000> in<00:03:14.300> and<00:03:14.840> out<00:03:14.930> it

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
but anyway it pushes it in and out it

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.590 
but anyway it pushes it in and out it
works<00:03:15.380> this<00:03:15.530> collar<00:03:16.090> in<00:03:17.090> and<00:03:17.269> out<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:19.600> when

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
works this collar in and out and when

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.960 
works this collar in and out and when
you<00:03:20.720> push<00:03:20.959> the<00:03:21.140> cable<00:03:21.350> in<00:03:21.860> and<00:03:22.040> this<00:03:22.760> goes<00:03:23.030> in

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
you push the cable in and this goes in

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.300 
you push the cable in and this goes in
then<00:03:28.600> it<00:03:29.600> just<00:03:29.780> free<00:03:30.019> wheels<00:03:30.260> there's<00:03:30.800> nothing

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
then it just free wheels there's nothing

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.490 
then it just free wheels there's nothing
so<00:03:32.209> it's<00:03:32.360> telling<00:03:32.750> me<00:03:32.780> that<00:03:32.930> there's

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
so it's telling me that there's

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.080 
so it's telling me that there's
something<00:03:33.739> wrong<00:03:34.100> with<00:03:34.280> this<00:03:34.459> brag<00:03:34.790> but<00:03:35.000> I

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
something wrong with this brag but I

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.340 
something wrong with this brag but I
can't<00:03:35.330> find<00:03:35.510> anything<00:03:35.720> wrong<00:03:35.870> with<00:03:36.050> it's

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
can't find anything wrong with it's

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.590 
can't find anything wrong with it's
going<00:03:36.590> together<00:03:36.860> right<00:03:37.100> when<00:03:38.000> I<00:03:38.030> work<00:03:38.390> it

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
going together right when I work it

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.229 
going together right when I work it
manually<00:03:39.050> it<00:03:39.440> works<00:03:39.680> perfect<00:03:40.340> by<00:03:40.670> hand<00:03:40.970> I<00:03:41.120> can

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
manually it works perfect by hand I can

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.360 
manually it works perfect by hand I can
put<00:03:41.360> it<00:03:41.450> inside<00:03:41.600> here<00:03:41.900> by<00:03:42.110> hand<00:03:42.440> and<00:03:43.100> it<00:03:43.220> works

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
put it inside here by hand and it works

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.120 
put it inside here by hand and it works
perfect<00:03:43.760> it<00:03:43.970> locks<00:03:44.209> up<00:03:44.390> one<00:03:44.630> way<00:03:44.810> and<00:03:45.170> the

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
perfect it locks up one way and the

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.410 
perfect it locks up one way and the
other<00:03:46.280> way<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:46.550> doesn't<00:03:46.760> just<00:03:47.150> like<00:03:47.269> it's

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
other way it doesn't just like it's

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.240 
other way it doesn't just like it's
supposed<00:03:47.630> to<00:03:47.720> but<00:03:48.620> when<00:03:48.739> I<00:03:48.769> put<00:03:48.980> the<00:03:49.070> frame

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
supposed to but when I put the frame

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.069 
supposed to but when I put the frame
together<00:03:49.430> I<00:03:50.200> engage<00:03:51.200> the<00:03:51.440> overdrive<00:03:51.920> and<00:03:52.580> I

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
together I engage the overdrive and I

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.449 
together I engage the overdrive and I
