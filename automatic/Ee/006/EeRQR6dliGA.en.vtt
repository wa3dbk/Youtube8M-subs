unlock it it does take the place of your
repair<00:00:34.260> tool<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.070> won't<00:00:35.340> be<00:00:35.430> able<00:00:35.579> to

repair vehicles if you have 80 mines
equipped<00:00:38.040> but<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:38.520> worth<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.910> though

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
equipped but it's worth it though

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.479 
equipped but it's worth it though
because<00:00:39.360> man<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.440> thing<00:00:40.620> powerful<00:00:40.800> it

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
because man is this thing powerful it

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.040 
because man is this thing powerful it
only<00:00:41.610> takes<00:00:41.879> one<00:00:41.969> direct<00:00:42.450> hit<00:00:42.600> from<00:00:42.629> an<00:00:42.899> 80

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
only takes one direct hit from an 80

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.959 
only takes one direct hit from an 80
mind<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.530> disabled<00:00:43.980> tank<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.489> second<00:00:44.850> one

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
mind to disabled tank and a second one

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.000 
mind to disabled tank and a second one
will<00:00:45.149> completely<00:00:45.539> destroy<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:46.170> or<00:00:46.410> any<00:00:46.800> other

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
will completely destroy it or any other

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.860 
will completely destroy it or any other
line<00:00:47.219> vehicle<00:00:47.610> for<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:47.850> matter<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
line vehicle for that matter and the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.750 
line vehicle for that matter and the
best<00:00:49.079> part<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.890> mines<00:00:50.100> don't<00:00:50.280> disappear

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
best part is the mines don't disappear

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.029 
best part is the mines don't disappear
when<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.000> die<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.930> only<00:00:52.230> way<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.620> enemy<00:00:52.770> can

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
when you die the only way the enemy can

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.189 
when you die the only way the enemy can
get<00:00:53.309> rid<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.489> them<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.879> by<00:00:54.090> blowing<00:00:54.300> them<00:00:54.510> up<00:00:54.629> so

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
get rid of them is by blowing them up so

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.110 
get rid of them is by blowing them up so
here's<00:00:55.530> how<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.710> use<00:00:55.800> an<00:00:56.010> ATM<00:00:56.399> ina<00:00:56.579> fective<00:00:57.000> Lee

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
here's how to use an ATM ina fective Lee

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.360 
here's how to use an ATM ina fective Lee
I<00:00:57.390> find<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.079> best<00:00:58.199> game-mode<00:00:58.649> 480<00:00:59.010> minds

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
I find that the best game-mode 480 minds

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.569 
I find that the best game-mode 480 minds
is<00:00:59.609> conquest<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.719> conquest<00:01:01.199> people<00:01:02.070> use<00:01:02.219> Tanks

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
is conquest in conquest people use Tanks

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.460 
is conquest in conquest people use Tanks
to<00:01:02.670> traverse<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.239> maps<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.719> capture<00:01:04.229> flags

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
to traverse the maps and capture flags

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.950 
to traverse the maps and capture flags
alright<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.309> thanks<00:01:05.790> are<00:01:05.909> huge<00:01:06.150> right<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.750> they

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
alright so thanks are huge right so they

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.380 
alright so thanks are huge right so they
can<00:01:07.110> only<00:01:07.260> take<00:01:07.530> certain<00:01:08.010> specific<00:01:08.729> paths<00:01:09.030> if

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
can only take certain specific paths if

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.179 
can only take certain specific paths if
they<00:01:09.720> want<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.080> get<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.350> flag<00:01:10.590> capture<00:01:10.979> area

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
they want to get to a flag capture area

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.090 
they want to get to a flag capture area
so<00:01:11.640> all<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.000> have<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.390> do<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:13.070> create<00:01:14.070> a

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
so all you have to do is create a

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.890 
so all you have to do is create a
virtual<00:01:14.610> fence<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:15.090> mines<00:01:15.330> along<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
virtual fence of mines along the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.570 
virtual fence of mines along the
entrances<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.740> flag<00:01:16.950> capture<00:01:17.250> areas

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
entrances to the flag capture areas

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.520 
entrances to the flag capture areas
there's<00:01:18.000> usually<00:01:18.210> only<00:01:18.689> two<00:01:18.960> or<00:01:19.200> maybe<00:01:19.350> three

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
there's usually only two or maybe three

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.100 
there's usually only two or maybe three
entrances<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.580> tank<00:01:21.000> can<00:01:21.180> take<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.720> get<00:01:21.869> into

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
entrances a tank can take to get into

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.899 
entrances a tank can take to get into
the<00:01:22.200> flag<00:01:22.350> capture<00:01:22.710> region<00:01:23.159> oh<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.580> make<00:01:23.790> sure

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
the flag capture region oh and make sure

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.700 
the flag capture region oh and make sure
you<00:01:24.030> place<00:01:24.270> mines<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:24.900> level<00:01:25.259> ground<00:01:25.290> to

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
you place mines on level ground to

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.590 
you place mines on level ground to
maximize<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.369> chances<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.850> vehicles<00:01:27.270> running

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
maximize the chances of vehicles running

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.749 
maximize the chances of vehicles running
over<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.470> ground<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.829> uneven<00:01:29.070> vehicles

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
over it if the ground is uneven vehicles

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.670 
over it if the ground is uneven vehicles
especially<00:01:30.090> tanks<00:01:30.840> have<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> good<00:01:31.229> chance<00:01:31.439> of

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
especially tanks have a good chance of

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.530 
especially tanks have a good chance of
not<00:01:31.829> making<00:01:32.189> contact<00:01:32.369> with<00:01:32.700> mine<00:01:33.030> now<00:01:33.479> you

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
not making contact with mine now you

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.149 
not making contact with mine now you
might<00:01:33.840> be<00:01:33.869> asking<00:01:34.110> how<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.619> hell<00:01:34.860> am<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.040> gonna

might be asking how the hell am I gonna

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.160 
might be asking how the hell am I gonna
create<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.610> fence<00:01:35.939> with<00:01:36.210> only<00:01:36.360> three<00:01:36.689> mines

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
create a fence with only three mines

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.690
