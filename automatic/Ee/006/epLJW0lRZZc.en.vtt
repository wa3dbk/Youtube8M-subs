00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.500 

wasn't<00:01:22.009> too<00:01:22.250> expensive

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
wasn't too expensive

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.679 
wasn't too expensive
they<00:01:24.020> come<00:01:24.230> with<00:01:24.380> three<00:01:24.620> different<00:01:24.800> models

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
they come with three different models

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.760 
they come with three different models
30<00:01:26.229> mile<00:01:26.579> 110<00:01:27.579> miles<00:01:27.880> and<00:01:28.359> one<00:01:28.539> my<00:01:28.780> biggest<00:01:29.049> 17

30 mile 110 miles and one my biggest 17
miles

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
miles

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.780 
miles
so<00:01:31.380> what<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.560> was<00:01:31.710> really<00:01:32.009> impressed<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.640> that

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
so what I was really impressed is that

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.490 
so what I was really impressed is that
you<00:01:32.909> decided<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.630> make<00:01:33.780> sure<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.140> got<00:01:34.259> one

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
you decided to make sure you got one

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.830 
you decided to make sure you got one
with<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.770> lithium<00:01:35.220> battery<00:01:35.250> yes<00:01:36.149> because<00:01:36.659> I

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
with the lithium battery yes because I

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.300 
with the lithium battery yes because I
know<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.990> lot<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> less<00:01:37.560> expensive<00:01:37.890> kits

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
know a lot of the less expensive kits

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.370 
know a lot of the less expensive kits
come<00:01:38.490> with<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.790> different<00:01:39.479> types<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.079> you

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
come with the different types and so you

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.660 
come with the different types and so you
think<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.649> lithium<00:01:40.979> battery<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.399> really

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
think the lithium battery is really

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.039 
think the lithium battery is really
important<00:01:42.149> hard<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.420> make<00:01:42.570> what<00:01:42.720> makes<00:01:42.930> us

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
important hard to make what makes us

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.380 
important hard to make what makes us
work<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.259> well<00:01:43.649> yeah<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.399> lasts<00:01:44.670> longer<00:01:45.090> it's

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
work so well yeah it lasts longer it's

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.870 
work so well yeah it lasts longer it's
less<00:01:48.390> volatile

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
less volatile

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.540 
less volatile
last<00:01:51.330> longer<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.140> fog

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
last longer in the fog

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.030 
last longer in the fog
long<00:01:54.180> periods<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.690> time<00:01:55.700> everything

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
long periods of time everything

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.670 
long periods of time everything
