00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
wanted to say that this gameplay is

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.370 
wanted to say that this gameplay is
taking<00:00:17.820> from<00:00:17.940> my<00:00:18.150> good<00:00:18.359> friend<00:00:18.420> Apollo<00:00:19.050> with

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
taking from my good friend Apollo with

theater mode in black ops 2 and I

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.130 
theater mode in black ops 2 and I
thought<00:00:23.220> I'd<00:00:23.369> check<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.670> out<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.029> in<00:00:24.660> this

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
pack a punch and how to get or how to

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.790 
pack a punch and how to get or how to
get<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.500> pack<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.680> punch<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.220> how<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.460> uh

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
get to pack a punch and how to uh

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.560 
get to pack a punch and how to uh
basically<00:00:31.800> activate<00:00:32.550> pack<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.759> punch<00:00:33.059> cuz<00:00:33.390> when

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
basically activate pack a punch cuz when

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.060 
basically activate pack a punch cuz when
you<00:00:33.660> go<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.050> Machine<00:00:34.440> normally<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.860> says

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
you go to the Machine normally it says

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.850 
you go to the Machine normally it says
you<00:00:35.550> must<00:00:35.790> have<00:00:36.230> activated<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.380> power<00:00:37.530> and

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
you must have activated the power and

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.380 
you must have activated the power and
they're<00:00:38.040> in<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.550> sudden<00:00:38.850> was<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.149> first

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
they're in the sudden was the first

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.569 
they're in the sudden was the first
generator<00:00:39.870> where<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.170> must<00:00:40.410> hold<00:00:40.890> X<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.370> buy

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
generator where you must hold X to buy

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.280 
generator where you must hold X to buy
it<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.879> then<00:00:42.030> activated<00:00:42.660> by<00:00:42.750> standing<00:00:43.050> around

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
it and then activated by standing around

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.110 
it and then activated by standing around
it<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.160> generator<00:00:44.520> number<00:00:44.820> two

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
it and this is generator number two

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.930 
it and this is generator number two
which<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.020> located<00:00:46.680> outside<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.250> first<00:00:47.610> room

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
which is located outside the first room

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.520 
which is located outside the first room
I<00:00:48.000> think<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.270> open<00:00:48.450> up<00:00:48.510> one<00:00:48.570> one<00:00:49.140> or<00:00:49.230> two<00:00:49.350> doors

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
I think you open up one one or two doors

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.799 
I think you open up one one or two doors
and<00:00:49.770> you're<00:00:49.860> there<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.210> generator

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
and you're there and this is generator

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.150 
and you're there and this is generator
number<00:00:52.110> three<00:00:52.289> which<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.469> located<00:00:52.920> right<00:00:52.949> by

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
number three which is located right by

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.240 
number three which is located right by
juggernaut<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.890> think<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.129> one

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
juggernaut and I think this is the one

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.799 
juggernaut and I think this is the one
my<00:00:56.340> driver<00:00:56.550> not<00:00:56.760> I'm<00:00:56.969> not<00:00:57.030> actually<00:00:57.480> no<00:00:57.690> this

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
my driver not I'm not actually no this

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.240 
my driver not I'm not actually no this
is<00:00:57.899> nothing<00:00:58.140> what<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.320> do<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.590> I'm<00:00:58.649> sorry<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
is nothing what I do and I'm sorry the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.410 
is nothing what I do and I'm sorry the
next<00:00:59.340> one's<00:00:59.579> mine<00:00:59.730> they're<00:00:59.879> not<00:01:00.120> but<00:01:00.300> um

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
next one's mine they're not but um

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.360 
next one's mine they're not but um
there's<00:01:01.050> generated<00:01:01.469> number<00:01:01.710> three<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.250> as

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
there's generated number three and as

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.070 
there's generated number three and as
you<00:01:02.489> can<00:01:02.609> see<00:01:02.850> when<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.600> players<00:01:03.809> stand

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
you can see when the players stand

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.380 
you can see when the players stand
around<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.500> some<00:01:05.040> weird<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.850> know<00:01:05.880> some

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
around it some weird you know some

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.330 
around it some weird you know some
weirdly<00:01:06.689> just<00:01:06.900> zombies<00:01:07.110> up<00:01:07.560> here<00:01:08.130> out<00:01:08.250> of

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
weirdly just zombies up here out of

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.359 
weirdly just zombies up here out of
nowhere<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:09.439> the<00:01:10.439> tubes<00:01:10.830> fill<00:01:11.100> up<00:01:11.220> or

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
nowhere and the tubes fill up or

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.620 
nowhere and the tubes fill up or
something<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.000> generated<00:01:12.420> number

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
something and this is generated number

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.149 
something and this is generated number
four<00:01:12.840> were<00:01:13.020> driven<00:01:13.229> out<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.530> located<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
four were driven out is located and the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.950 
four were driven out is located and the
machine<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.729> my<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.090> don't<00:01:15.509> know<00:01:15.659> if<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.810> saw

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
machine that my I don't know if you saw

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.359 
machine that my I don't know if you saw
that<00:01:15.990> I'll<00:01:16.409> see<00:01:16.680> B<00:01:16.799> turns<00:01:16.979> around<00:01:17.130> again

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
that I'll see B turns around again

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.850 
that I'll see B turns around again
towards<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.479> machine<00:01:18.750> but<00:01:18.930> right<00:01:19.680> there

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
towards that machine but right there

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.020 
towards that machine but right there
that<00:01:19.979> machine<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.430> right<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.790> where<00:01:20.880> he

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
that machine to the right of where he

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.399 
that machine to the right of where he
just<00:01:21.180> looked<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.720> was<00:01:21.810> actually<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> perk

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
just looked it was actually a perk

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.960 
just looked it was actually a perk
machine<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.950> when<00:01:23.369> do<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.490> buy<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.790> get<00:01:23.939> a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
machine and when do you buy it you get a

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.730 
machine and when do you buy it you get a
random<00:01:24.210> perk<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.750> most<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.350> time<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.650> is

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
random perk and most of the time it is

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.760 
random perk and most of the time it is
mule<00:01:25.979> kick<00:01:26.250> but<00:01:26.520> other<00:01:27.150> times<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:27.869> stuff

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
mule kick but other times it is stuff

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.490 
mule kick but other times it is stuff
like<00:01:28.950> slide<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> hand<00:01:29.640> or<00:01:29.939> dead<00:01:30.450> shot<00:01:30.750> or<00:01:30.990> PhD

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
like slide a hand or dead shot or PhD

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.590 
like slide a hand or dead shot or PhD
flopper<00:01:31.650> even<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.250> yeah<00:01:32.400> PhD<00:01:32.880> flopper<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.420> on

flopper even so yeah PhD flopper is on

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.390 
flopper even so yeah PhD flopper is on
this<00:01:33.750> map<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.259> as<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.799> can<00:01:34.920> see<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.159> he<00:01:35.250> went

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
this map and as you can see that he went

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.640 
this map and as you can see that he went
to<00:01:35.460> go<00:01:35.579> bud<00:01:35.759> jug<00:01:36.060> he<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:36.960> now<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.110> generator

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
to go bud jug he is now a generator

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.100 
to go bud jug he is now a generator
number<00:01:38.009> five<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.670> believe<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.689> stand

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
number five I believe this is and stand

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.980 
number five I believe this is and stand
up<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.350> Right<00:01:40.500> located<00:01:41.009> right<00:01:41.100> next<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.549> and

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
up is Right located right next to it and

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.090 
up is Right located right next to it and
here<00:01:42.990> all<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.350> players<00:01:43.590> are<00:01:43.710> stepping<00:01:43.920> around

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
here all the players are stepping around

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.950 
here all the players are stepping around
the<00:01:44.340> generator<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:45.259> have<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.409> turned<00:01:46.619> on<00:01:46.799> and

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
the generator to have it turned on and

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.569 
the generator to have it turned on and
yeah<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.740> basically<00:01:50.100> how<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.310> get<00:01:50.460> to

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
yeah this is basically how to get to

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.219 
yeah this is basically how to get to
pack<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> punch<00:01:51.090> like<00:01:51.240> send<00:01:51.689> beginning<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.170> this

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
pack a punch like send beginning of this

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.959 
pack a punch like send beginning of this
video<00:01:54.680> keep<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:55.799> mind<00:01:56.040> though<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.250> sometimes

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
video keep in mind though that sometimes

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.700 
video keep in mind though that sometimes
if<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.240> take<00:01:57.450> too<00:01:57.570> long<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.810> activate<00:01:58.439> all<00:01:58.500> six

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
if you take too long to activate all six

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.760 
if you take too long to activate all six
generators<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:01.590> those<00:02:02.040> weirdly<00:02:02.700> dressed

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
generators the those weirdly dressed

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.870 
generators the those weirdly dressed
those<00:02:04.770> really<00:02:05.040> just<00:02:05.219> assam<00:02:05.430> bees<00:02:05.640> can

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
those really just assam bees can

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.419 
those really just assam bees can
actually<00:02:06.750> regroup<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.409> destroy<00:02:07.979> and

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
actually regroup and destroy and

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.770 
actually regroup and destroy and
degenerated<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.330> then<00:02:09.420> you're<00:02:09.539> gonna<00:02:09.629> have

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
degenerated and then you're gonna have

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.999 
degenerated and then you're gonna have
to<00:02:09.810> react<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.259> we<00:02:10.319> did<00:02:10.470> which<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.709> really

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
to react and we did which is really

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.100 
to react and we did which is really
annoying<00:02:11.220> but<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:12.390> only<00:02:12.480> happens<00:02:12.720> if<00:02:13.020> you

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
annoying but that only happens if you

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.940 
annoying but that only happens if you
take<00:02:13.319> too<00:02:13.440> long<00:02:13.620> so

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
take too long so

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.320 
take too long so
make<00:02:14.010> sure<00:02:14.160> you<00:02:14.250> do<00:02:14.370> this<00:02:14.550> maybe<00:02:14.730> then<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.120> round

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
make sure you do this maybe then a round

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.449 
make sure you do this maybe then a round
or<00:02:15.569> two<00:02:15.599> and<00:02:15.989> then<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.709> should<00:02:16.920> be<00:02:17.069> good<00:02:17.280> but

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
or two and then you should be good but

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.520 
or two and then you should be good but
even<00:02:18.030> if<00:02:18.150> all<00:02:18.330> six<00:02:18.510> are<00:02:18.690> activated<00:02:19.200> they<00:02:19.290> still

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
even if all six are activated they still

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.619 
even if all six are activated they still
can<00:02:19.769> destroy<00:02:20.160> them<00:02:20.370> which<00:02:21.300> is<00:02:21.420> gonna<00:02:21.540> be

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
can destroy them which is gonna be

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.020 
can destroy them which is gonna be
pretty<00:02:21.750> annoying<00:02:22.260> but<00:02:22.470> you're<00:02:22.560> gonna<00:02:22.680> have<00:02:22.830> to

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
pretty annoying but you're gonna have to

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.600 
pretty annoying but you're gonna have to
keep<00:02:24.030> watching<00:02:24.300> them<00:02:24.540> at<00:02:24.690> times<00:02:25.129> but<00:02:26.129> um<00:02:26.310> once

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
keep watching them at times but um once

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.339 
keep watching them at times but um once
they<00:02:26.730> destroy<00:02:27.030> one<00:02:27.239> gender<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.720> generator

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
they destroy one gender the generator

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.479 
they destroy one gender the generator
I'm<00:02:28.500> pretty<00:02:28.709> sure<00:02:28.860> they<00:02:28.950> always<00:02:29.190> start<00:02:29.430> with

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
I'm pretty sure they always start with

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.400 
I'm pretty sure they always start with
generating<00:02:29.940> number<00:02:30.239> one<00:02:30.450> don't<00:02:30.930> quote<00:02:31.110> me<00:02:31.290> I'm

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
generating number one don't quote me I'm

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.140 
generating number one don't quote me I'm
wrong<00:02:31.920> I'm<00:02:32.160> pretty<00:02:32.430> sure<00:02:32.640> they<00:02:32.760> always<00:02:32.880> start

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
wrong I'm pretty sure they always start

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.040 
wrong I'm pretty sure they always start
with<00:02:33.209> generator<00:02:33.630> number<00:02:33.870> one<00:02:33.989> and<00:02:35.390> if<00:02:36.390> they<00:02:36.720> do

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
with generator number one and if they do

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.540 
with generator number one and if they do
they<00:02:37.230> always<00:02:37.500> go<00:02:37.890> today<00:02:38.130> goes<00:02:38.340> through<00:02:38.489> the

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
they always go today goes through the

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.430 
they always go today goes through the
generators<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.030> go<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.209> one<00:02:39.480> two<00:02:39.840> three

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
generators to go to one two three

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.470 
generators to go to one two three
anyway<00:02:40.860> pack<00:02:41.489> of<00:02:41.640> hunters<00:02:41.880> activated<00:02:42.330> you

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
anyway pack of hunters activated you

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.729 
anyway pack of hunters activated you
should<00:02:42.660> open<00:02:42.750> up<00:02:42.930> that<00:02:43.080> barrier<00:02:43.379> for<00:02:43.530> twenty

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
should open up that barrier for twenty

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.800 
should open up that barrier for twenty
five<00:02:43.860> hundred<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.519> here<00:02:45.090> he<00:02:45.269> puts<00:02:45.510> its<00:02:45.629> gonna

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
five hundred and here he puts its gonna

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.300 
five hundred and here he puts its gonna
pack<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.140> punch<00:02:46.380> machine<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:47.010> then<00:02:47.130> when<00:02:47.250> he

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
pack a punch machine and then when he

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.240 
pack a punch machine and then when he
takes<00:02:47.519> it<00:02:47.700> out<00:02:47.989> his<00:02:48.989> gun<00:02:49.260> is<00:02:49.410> an<00:02:49.530> awesome<00:02:50.040> aqua

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
takes it out his gun is an awesome aqua

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.610 
takes it out his gun is an awesome aqua
blue<00:02:50.640> color<00:02:50.849> that<00:02:51.630> is<00:02:51.810> amazing

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
blue color that is amazing

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.350 
blue color that is amazing
current<00:02:53.310> really<00:02:53.519> outdone<00:02:53.790> themselves<00:02:53.849> I'm
