 It will be 4.19 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:38.729

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.200
 Yes 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.710
 During those years 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.710

 What will you forget? 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.859
 I've been thinking about favoritism for the past few days .

 But the big moon is not a good way to open 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:43.360
 Now, step back and prepare to fight back. 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:47.190
 It means lower. 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:54.810
 Did you take the quorum of the estate? 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:58.760
 That's not it. When I'm away from Agana, I have to write it down. 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.950
 Even though I'm standing back and now I'm back on size bread , 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:06.720
 Cheong Wa Dae has yet others that Raden 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:09.280
 That's the judgment in the waters , 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.860
 The cycle judgment comes. 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.860

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.990
 Invite again and in fact bombard you 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.980
 No matter what number I use to hit the stadium 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.980
 There was a lot of room. 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:42.930

 Once a demo, it shoots, but now I 'm working underneath it . 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:03.280
 I need to be careful. 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:03.280
 Originally, though, I wrote my friends' faces. 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.829
 My deck is fishing. 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.840

 Well, in my opinion, 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.920
 Then you just told me 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.740
 In fact, did you record or visit 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:57.080
 Whatever the reason, anyway. 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.080
 I was wrong. 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.960
 Are you calling to say that, buddy? 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.140

 I can take the show to a guy who can not hear it anywhere. 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:34.360
 It 's not enough that it's easy for the body to fall from the bottom . 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.360
 To be 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.419
