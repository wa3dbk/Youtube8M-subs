nuclear medicine it's also called
molecular<00:00:14.660> imaging<00:00:15.230> now<00:00:15.759> but<00:00:16.759> it's<00:00:16.909> the<00:00:17.089> use

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:17.269 
molecular imaging now but it's the use

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:20.380 
molecular imaging now but it's the use
of<00:00:17.300> radioactive<00:00:18.199> isotopes<00:00:18.859> to<00:00:19.609> stage<00:00:19.970> street

at the hospitals you know all the
different<00:01:24.499> machines<00:01:25.039> so<00:01:25.340> being<00:01:25.939> able<00:01:26.090> to

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:26.389 
different machines so being able to

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:28.660 
different machines so being able to
really<00:01:26.600> touch<00:01:26.840> feel<00:01:27.439> work<00:01:28.340> with<00:01:28.520> those

really touch feel work with those

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.599 
really touch feel work with those
machines<00:01:29.119> before<00:01:29.649> we<00:01:30.649> go<00:01:30.859> into<00:01:31.069> the<00:01:31.280> clinical

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
machines before we go into the clinical

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:34.149 
machines before we go into the clinical
setting<00:01:31.850> helps<00:01:32.299> us<00:01:32.420> out<00:01:32.600> tremendously<00:01:33.159> the

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
setting helps us out tremendously the

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.580 
setting helps us out tremendously the
benefit<00:01:34.759> of<00:01:34.789> gaining<00:01:35.509> practical<00:01:35.689> experience

benefit of gaining practical experience

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.039 
benefit of gaining practical experience
is<00:01:36.829> that<00:01:36.859> students<00:01:37.490> will<00:01:37.729> actually<00:01:38.329> get<00:01:38.990> a

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
is that students will actually get a

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.830 
is that students will actually get a
chance<00:01:39.409> to<00:01:39.679> work<00:01:39.829> in<00:01:40.069> the<00:01:40.219> field<00:01:40.520> with<00:01:40.880> real
