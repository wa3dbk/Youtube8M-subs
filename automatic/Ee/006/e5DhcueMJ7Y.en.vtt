00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:17.730
 hello everyone about the spirit and it is already 15 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.869
 part about clash of clans and today i 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.210
 I will attack 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.410
 clan war will tell my base and 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.930
 I will cut down the Christmas tree and see what they give for it. 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.250
 Christmas tree I still grew up here 3 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.340
 Christmas tree 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.649
 from the edge I will not cut down either 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.440
 this 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.969
 because I have a Christmas tree here as you can see 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.440
 everywhere 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.079
 let's first cut down the tree and 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:49.910
 let's see what they give for it 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:54.690
 so let's wait wait 26 seconds more 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:58.289
 clan not necessarily attack and show 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:03.000
 as I have warriors here a little bit now 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:09.210
 wait 10 seconds left 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:13.710
 and another eight don't even have anything to do with it 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:17.189
 time but everyone is watching what happens next 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:23.930
 5000 gold as in that year or in that 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:27.840
 45,000 wali shorter it's normally expected 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:31.110
 so let me show you how much black I have 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:37.049
 the fence of the eighth level and even with me 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:40.460
 his 195 left 30 to swing and then 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:44.220
 everything will be fine and come on quiet 9 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:49.860
 still me second level 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:53.340
 improved well and yet I improved 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.219
 almost all mines are 12 rounds level 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.030
 there are only 2 mine left to receive and 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.600
 all I can say full base such 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.759
 8 except the fence and 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:10.190
 Well let's attack in the plans of Van 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.190
 I have not even seen opponents 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:22.620
 I donâ€™t even know who to attack 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:29.160
 so let's see this base can 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:36.240
 to be attacking her so seeing pretty 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:37.110
 still strong and I did not base course 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.070
 will destroy 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:44.750
 what i'm sure of but let's just attack 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:47.850
 for video even on stars but 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.680
 let's see what happens and yes 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.230
 I 'll show you what 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.230
 what is my army and attack 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.090
 I will not tell you yourself see everything 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:10.280
 so that's the troops on another decided to attack 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:13.760
 not like then all with god attack battle 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:18.120
 I will try even to give 0 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.930
 just for the sake of video through the camera of course 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:27.350
 very uncomfortable to attack but how come 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.350
 let the mumps one leaves our clan 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:35.050
 so give one more let 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:39.570
 one still came out the rest so here 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:45.240
 It seems to take everything down to the archer 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:50.580
 let all the clan run here so 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:58.870
 a little bit of judgment still and so let him 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:04:01.030
 so hopefully they can kill everyone and yet 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.480
 and I hope that there is no one left in 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.360
 plan 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.360
 and let's all 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:18.330
 attack we do not even know where and 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:21.070
 let's face it the miracle of this court of this court 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:24.360
 I don't know why I attacked so much from here and 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.360
 communication here wanted to attack 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:33.700
 Well, in short, I do not understand what I am doing 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:40.570
 sell all let before all at once 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:43.690
 let the magicians still let the pitch let 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:48.930
 King I and just through the camera very 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:50.320
 ill understand everything what is happening so 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:55.990
 let's let 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:59.500
 dragons do not know why and pike where-thread 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.720
 we still have to quit here and here 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.170
 Throw hilku then accelerating potions need 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:09.790
 where not to throw accelerating potions so 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:13.840
 trial let's throw it as the king went 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:17.620
 in a circle, okay, let's go 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:21.280
 clan on the clan let them simply do not need 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:24.280
 C later I destroyed one star 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.530
 it pleases me already on two stars inside 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:33.310
 I can not destroy the stars unfortunately 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:34.880
 but I have already tried 60 percent of my 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:40.139
 King killed 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:43.199
 Dragon also now kill anything 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:49.830
 terrible, I already am glad that I'm two 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:52.710
 the stars destroyed this database well here 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:55.889
 such an attack is not bad let's 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:06:03.860
 let's see 30 seconds left two stars 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:05.400
 and not bad and not good although I broke the record 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.570
 former this 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.650
 him one star was golem these 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:15.919
 small little slow 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:24.660
 very slow fell apart on small 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:28.850
 so and 68 percent well, and that's it 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:33.260
 here's an attack quite non-standard 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:35.010
 I will do the army here for the likes, so 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.620

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:55.789
 convenient to attack I hope you enjoyed 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:55.789

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:06.710
 finish such a short release but 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:09.450
