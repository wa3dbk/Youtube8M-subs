00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.500
 Good day to all my name is 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.360
 brian today i'm going korzham 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.920
 to tell you where else falls 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.080
 four new pets 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.869
 Since Karadzhan raid is quite large 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.130
 video decided and divided into 2 parts 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:19.550
 no doubt today I will tell you where 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.690
 falls pitomitsy evil and terrible wolf 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.350
 the probability of a drop is a little over 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.420
 15 percent and also where it falls 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.460
 See the menagerie the probability that 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.710
 he will fall is a little over five 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.870
 percent if you don't know where 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.550
 is the entrance to the raid Karazhan then in 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.710
 Currently you can see a link to 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.870
 video where I tell in detail how 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.820
 find this raid and so move forward as 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.890
 only we entered the first thing that 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.350
 we need to do it kill one boss 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.350
 otherwise we will not go far 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.320
 it is here that the boss is his 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.980
 we just need to kill without any 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.980
 features 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.030
 finally when we figured it all out 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.680
 now we can run the boss from which 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.680
 we can fall 1 pet 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.780
 now we need to talk to this 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.910
 character that is, I press the button 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.980
 not an actor and so on if you have this 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.190
 no buttons then it seems you are not 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.710
 killed the first boss now will be the most 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.690
 interesting from us it does not depend 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.790
 the choice will be played that is 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.110
 absolutely by chance three performances this 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.540
 aroma u juliet 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.940
 still some and about the red cap so 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.130
 here we need to make a wine and a performance about 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.530
 red cap because only in this 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.200
 the case will be the boss angry and scary gray 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.300
 wolf which we safely kill and 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.150
 with a probability of 15 percent can 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.400
 get a pet however today i don't 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.060
 lucky it is once again its frame and 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.060
 Juliet 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.519
 pet of course not but we run to 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.519
 next bass 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.570
 finally we got to the next boss 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.850
 this is the caretaker with him we may fall 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.440
 the superintendent of the menagerie let me remind you that the chance 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:44.050
 groups is just over five 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:46.420
 percent on this this video 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.340

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.580
