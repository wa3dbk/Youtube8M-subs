00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.239 
it's like this I fired the chair legs
out<00:05:00.849> there<00:05:01.059> so<00:05:01.269> it<00:05:02.259> would<00:05:02.349> be<00:05:02.589> quite<00:05:02.800> tough<00:05:03.039> I'm

00:05:03.239 --> 00:05:03.249 
out there so it would be quite tough I'm

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:13.019 
out there so it would be quite tough I'm
sort<00:05:03.580> of<00:05:03.699> quite<00:05:04.449> young<00:05:04.659> and<00:05:07.800> brilliant<00:05:12.029> from

00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:13.029 
sort of quite young and brilliant from

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:14.429 
sort of quite young and brilliant from
where<00:05:13.209> they<00:05:13.389> were<00:05:13.449> when<00:05:13.779> they<00:05:13.869> started<00:05:14.289> their

00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:14.439 
where they were when they started their

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.199 
where they were when they started their
fitness<00:05:14.679> levels<00:05:15.159> are<00:05:15.339> so<00:05:15.579> much<00:05:15.759> better<00:05:15.999> to

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:16.209 
fitness levels are so much better to

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:17.639 
fitness levels are so much better to
start<00:05:16.449> off<00:05:16.599> with<00:05:16.809> it<00:05:16.929> allows<00:05:17.229> them<00:05:17.469> clear

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:17.649 
start off with it allows them clear

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:19.559 
start off with it allows them clear
around<00:05:17.919> the<00:05:18.099> field<00:05:18.369> and<00:05:18.999> obviously<00:05:19.329> as<00:05:19.479> we

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:19.569 
around the field and obviously as we

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:21.449 
around the field and obviously as we
said<00:05:19.779> before<00:05:19.899> they've<00:05:20.619> taken<00:05:20.889> those<00:05:21.129> to<00:05:21.339> the
