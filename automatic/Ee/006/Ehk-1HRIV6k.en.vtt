00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
forever there's only these worlds may be

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.019 
forever there's only these worlds may be
huge<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.800> there<00:00:19.980> may<00:00:20.250> be<00:00:20.279> supposedly

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
huge and there may be supposedly

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.939 
huge and there may be supposedly
multiple<00:00:21.510> ways<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.869> go<00:00:22.020> but<00:00:22.320> if<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.560> go<00:00:22.800> the

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
multiple ways to go but if you go the

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.179 
multiple ways to go but if you go the
wrong<00:00:23.100> way<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.430> are<00:00:24.000> fucked<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.320> you're

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
to go up here even though this is

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.420 
to go up here even though this is
probably<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.579> path<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.059> death<00:00:57.859> okay<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.070> don't

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.830 
know what is up here at all I'm going to
take<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.340> little<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:03.180> course<00:01:03.480> it's<00:01:03.660> going<00:01:03.690> to

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
take this little of course it's going to

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.539 
take this little of course it's going to
take<00:01:04.019> me<00:01:04.170> backwards<00:01:04.680> because<00:01:05.159> that's<00:01:05.369> what

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
take me backwards because that's what

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.940 
take me backwards because that's what
these<00:01:05.670> things<00:01:05.729> do<00:01:06.299> they<00:01:07.049> take<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.470> backwards

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
these things do they take you backwards

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.590 
these things do they take you backwards
because<00:01:08.729> I'm<00:01:08.820> probably<00:01:08.970> not<00:01:09.210> supposed<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.540> be

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
because I'm probably not supposed to be

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.320 
because I'm probably not supposed to be
going<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:10.049> way<00:01:10.260> but<00:01:10.650> it's<00:01:10.770> too<00:01:10.979> late<00:01:11.189> now

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
going this way but it's too late now

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.940 
going this way but it's too late now
let's<00:01:12.330> see<00:01:12.600> if<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.840> signal<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.470> want<00:01:13.680> even<00:01:13.860> go

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
let's see if the signal you want even go

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.010 
let's see if the signal you want even go
back<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.729> that's<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.090> jump<00:01:15.330> blindly<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.810> hope

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
back so that's a jump blindly and hope

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.190 
back so that's a jump blindly and hope
that<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.259> don't<00:01:16.350> fall<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.710> my<00:01:16.830> face<00:01:16.979> or<00:01:18.049> land<00:01:19.049> in

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
that I don't fall on my face or land in

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.289 
that I don't fall on my face or land in
there<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.759> don't<00:01:20.759> even<00:01:20.820> know<00:01:20.970> where<00:01:21.060> I'm<00:01:21.150> going

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
there I don't even know where I'm going

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.190
