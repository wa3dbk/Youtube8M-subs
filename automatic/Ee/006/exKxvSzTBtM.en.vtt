outstanding<00:01:03.059> defensive<00:01:03.870> end<00:01:04.049> well<00:01:04.229> because

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
outstanding defensive end well because

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.370 
outstanding defensive end well because
you<00:01:04.739> use<00:01:04.949> them<00:01:05.100> as<00:01:05.220> receiver<00:01:05.729> he's<00:01:05.880> 66<00:01:06.380> 210

pounds and he's an outstanding player I

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.149 
pounds and he's an outstanding player I
think<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.510> team<00:01:09.720> can<00:01:09.750> be<00:01:10.110> probably<00:01:10.650> equal<00:01:11.040> to

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
think the team can be probably equal to

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.310 
think the team can be probably equal to
the<00:01:11.310> team<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.790> was<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.060> 2006<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.049> won<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the team that was in 2006 that won the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.499 
the team that was in 2006 that won the
state<00:01:13.500> championship<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.460> think<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.119> schedule

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
state championship I think the schedule

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.789 
state championship I think the schedule
that<00:01:15.630> we<00:01:15.689> plays<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.930> little<00:01:16.080> tougher<00:01:16.470> than<00:01:16.590> that

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
that we plays a little tougher than that

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.580 
that we plays a little tougher than that
team<00:01:17.040> schedule<00:01:17.970> well<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.689> know<00:01:18.810> played<00:01:19.110> but
