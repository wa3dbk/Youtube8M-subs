00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.390
 Look, I'll teach you how to be hot. 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:09.389
 here for my children right from bueno 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.309
 First choose the color you want 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.089
 can choose the coral he is very mature 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.460
 he tried the green but at a point not 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.609
 can be this is how it is 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.890
 seeing black because within the semed years 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.150
 loose a lot of color then not opened yet 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.119
 Digest, you want to show me here. 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.590
 showing clear why are you coming 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.480
 seeds are in. I'm just going to 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.500
 hand looks at my little hand 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.940
 see you there first of all people 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.270
 will get 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.000
 O will open the coral tab already has a lot 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.539
 Then I'll pass the one Gabriel 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.370
 I was on the team attacking in the seed there 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.239
 people are going possibly everything here is 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.960
 it was in that summer boot whose seed 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.489
 on here 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.550
 here is the fubá there are people use the corn 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.049
 can put everything corn was the amount that 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.670
 find it better 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.900
 So, what do you want to do now? 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:14.490
 weep cool 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:18.710
 O crushing maybe now does not want peace and 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:24.330
 It's the seed's mind to get short cut. 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:29.939
 for the fubá, there you go, you'll think 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:33.119
 but hey it's there just talking whatever 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.479
 It is then what the show boot 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.670
 getting red summer is going to crush 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.759
 the truck does not need oil that 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.409
 a lot of people talk a little salt 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:49.470
 to play here in the oven besides picking 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:53.750
 A little bit is a little bit here 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:02:00.810
 only that it is to preserve 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:03.420
 It's because there's still more missing 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.280
 seed here this seed is case 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.320
 someone wants to plant again for 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.860
 plant because it was cooked or anything 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.130
 but that's what happens after the 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.470
 color you already have 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.640
 in the fubá to pass all the ink of the seed 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.190
 for cornmeal 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.710
 You will sieve a sieve more 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.800
 thick to separate the seed one 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:28.640
 thinner sieve than here 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:33.530
 here it is ready the color here is just 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.510
 the sebrae already pereita is excellent 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.140
 I played to be born again in the middle of 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:44.080
 bush throws away do what you want 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:45.770
 but here in O a kilo of maize flour enough 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.070
 paprika understood 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.060
 here for example had here is almost 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.580
 almost a pound 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.760
 It's what I'm going to do now, my 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:00.350
 pile and I already tamos thrashing more 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.750
 here seeds and that's what people look is just 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.670
 get the cornmeal mixed with advisors in the 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.280
 I do not care who wants to spot it. 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.770
 flat vineyard just from crushing looks only 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.930
 with the summer catch is already passing 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.620
 that football preaches this part and clarinet 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.620
 it's just you see 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:24.470
 I do not like all the seeds there. 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.510
 the corn is very red, the coral is 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.090
 made so people with cornmeal 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.090
 only those who come from many times in the 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.040
 market has some dye you 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.940
 doing at home has the advantages of ipad 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:41.150
 red planting in the yard is in the garden 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.340
 It's born very well, I'm just going to film because 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.680
 I live in the city, it's a little far 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.820
 the house and it will take too long to 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:54.380
 but here he is adding the seed until 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:58.040
 the cornbread stays in that color and what you do 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.110
 at home it's much better soon I'm going 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.180
 also teach the saffron the saffron 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.660
 it's not a seed it's a root 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.330
 so for now it's the tip, and I 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.209
 I'm still here threatening my I was hit. 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.140
 he gets little thing okay then so is 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.280
 people 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:19.359
 the coral is made with the seed and the corn 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.070
 a little salt just to keep 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.870
 It will get better after you are 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.990
 ready the way I have it ready 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.870
 already have red leaving the sun 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.759
 so the inter in that only comes hot 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.460
 on drought any unit that has 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:36.169
 the microwave cloth i think it is very 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.500
 good I will never tried the microwave 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.419
 but knows leaving the sun to dry all 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:46.250
 moisture understood that you have to not have 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:49.430
 danger of moffa ok better to almost 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:53.539
 It's still a long way from here. 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.169
 just write a lot and color goes to the 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.960
 Corn meal 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.750
 So the tip is a little cornmeal 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.479
 of salt and the seed of 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.669
 preferably the green seed not too 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:08.300
 green when it has hardly some 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:11.449
 I matured and got that color here 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.280
 Then you can already shrink all this. 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.090
 Do not let it ripen too much, this is the color 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.810
 do not leave 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:23.569
 Look, I hope you've helped everyone. 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:26.599
 and enjoy my tip 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:29.810
 Look, I'll tell you that with this. 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:34.009
 which seasoned with this 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:36.110
 Home cooking is much better, at least with 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:39.590
 sure this chicken your meat will have 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:44.349
 color because the market my God 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.349
