videos but today I'm gonna be moving

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.669 
videos but today I'm gonna be moving
Tobin<00:00:11.670> off<00:00:11.820> so<00:00:12.330> I've<00:00:12.750> got<00:00:12.960> her<00:00:13.080> in<00:00:13.110> her<00:00:13.290> saddle

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
now and I'm asking her to round pen and

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.859 
now and I'm asking her to round pen and
as<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.410> can<00:00:16.590> see<00:00:16.830> as<00:00:17.100> she<00:00:17.210> is<00:00:18.210> first<00:00:18.539> round

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
as you can see as she is first round

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.779 
as you can see as she is first round
penning<00:00:19.289> after<00:00:19.680> being<00:00:19.859> saddled<00:00:20.189> she<00:00:20.520> gets<00:00:20.670> a

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
penning after being saddled she gets a

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.730 
penning after being saddled she gets a
little<00:00:21.000> cold<00:00:21.359> backed<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.020> starts

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
little cold backed and starts

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.349 
little cold backed and starts
she's<00:00:23.100> trying<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.430> figure<00:00:23.699> out<00:00:23.880> how<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.150> get

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
she's trying to figure out how to get

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.000 
she's trying to figure out how to get
that<00:00:24.539> saddle<00:00:24.960> off<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.410> how<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.560> get<00:00:25.740> away<00:00:25.949> from

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
that saddle off and how to get away from

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.250 
that saddle off and how to get away from
the<00:00:26.250> pressure<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.390> apply<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.779> lot<00:00:28.080> of

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
the pressure so I apply a lot of

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.140 
the pressure so I apply a lot of
pressure<00:00:28.529> with<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:28.890> whip<00:00:29.250> until<00:00:29.699> she<00:00:29.910> calms

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
pressure with that whip until she calms

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.450 
pressure with that whip until she calms
down<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.840> starts<00:00:31.140> moving<00:00:31.529> off<00:00:31.650> fluidly<00:00:34.460> so

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
down and starts moving off fluidly so

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.580 
down and starts moving off fluidly so
now<00:00:35.579> I'm<00:00:35.700> going<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.000> actually<00:00:36.480> tie<00:00:36.989> my<00:00:37.320> lead

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
now I'm going to actually tie my lead

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.500 
now I'm going to actually tie my lead
rope<00:00:37.860> all<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.129> way<00:00:38.340> around<00:00:38.730> into<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.180> halter

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
rope all the way around into the halter

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.660 
rope all the way around into the halter
itself<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.200> make<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.739> pair<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.129> makeshift

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
itself and make a pair of makeshift

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.819 
itself and make a pair of makeshift
reins<00:00:42.059> I'm<00:00:42.750> not<00:00:42.960> going<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.170> be<00:00:43.260> using<00:00:43.680> these

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829
