00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.130
 hello tonight then we will indeed 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.200
 Sardinian with a sauce that usually us 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.740
 we do when we have practically 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:18.359
 empty fridge however it is very very very much 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.100
 good is simple to make and very tasty 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.310
 so we thought about doing one 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.250
 recipe then the ingredients are is 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.449
 only for 4 people 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:35.790
 then 40 grams of capers 400 g of 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:41.879
 small tomatoes an onion 400 g of nichetti 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:45.270
 Sardinian and 80 g of pitted olives and then 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.300
 we will need extra virgin olive oil 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.070
 salt, pepper and chili pepper 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.120
 so these are the ingredients and 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:58.039
 let's start immediately with the recipe then 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.039
 first chop the onion 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:21.860
 once chopped the onion we put it 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.860
 aside and pass to the tomatoes 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.869
 we have already washed the tomatoes and these 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:34.369
 must be cut into rounds and 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.369
 the seeds should be removed 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.050
 once cut tomatoes 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:50.810
 take a pan add a 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:55.550
 thin oil and heat once 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:02:00.190
 warm the oil, add the onion and 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.190
 let it fry for a few minutes 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:16.600
 meanwhile we put the water in 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.600
 a pot for cooking pasta 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:29.510
 then we add the cherry tomatoes e 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:36.850
 let it cook for 10 minutes turning them 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:36.850
 occasionally medium high 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.440
 so let's cook covered 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:47.069
 leaving the master so that the 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.670
 steam comes out while little tomatoes 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.480
 cook it we prepare a chopped olives 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.470
 capers 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.530
 we use this tool but it is 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.170
 You can still do it by hand then 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.370
 add the olives and capers e 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.370
 we chop the whole thing 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.400
 Now 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.530
 boil the water and throw away the pasta 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:35.000
 meanwhile our cherry tomatoes 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:35.000
 continue cooking smells 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:51.290
 Ten minutes have passed at this point 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.290
 add the chopped caper olives 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:13.380
 stir and stir the stove well 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:14.660
 even better so we don't have it 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:19.470
 turned off 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:23.690
 mix well if it turns out too much 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.690
 dry, add a little more oil 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.420
 taste 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.979
 and at this point you set yourself if 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.260
 add more salt or other 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:42.800
 we reach the powdered basil 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.960
 because unfortunately the map died 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.979
 of basil in the garden so there is no 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.310
 we 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:57.740
 if you have it fresh and much better then 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:05:00.350
 chili pepper and stir as seen 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.880
 has dried a lot we add a little 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.880
 of pasta cooking water 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:11.240
 voila 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.400
 to not add too much oil and 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:20.470
 we continue to cook until not 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:20.470
 it is ready the pasta is missing a few minutes 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:35.980
 add the pasta to the sauce and stir 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.980
 well 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.110
 that the end result is another 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:50.800

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:53.980

00:05:53.980 --> 00:06:00.880
 grated cheese 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:04.090
