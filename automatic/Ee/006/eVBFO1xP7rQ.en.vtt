00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
really again I came up with this it's a

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.889 
really again I came up with this it's a
simple<00:00:40.829> little<00:00:41.070> thing<00:00:41.340> it's<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:41.730> wire<00:00:42.510> ties

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
simple little thing it's just wire ties

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.200 
simple little thing it's just wire ties
on<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.200> front<00:00:43.559> which<00:00:44.040> hook<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:47.210> front

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
on the front which hook to that front

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:58.069 
on the front which hook to that front
bumper<00:00:56.059> one<00:00:57.059> on<00:00:57.210> each<00:00:57.360> side<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.870> front

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
bumper one on each side of that front

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.200 
bumper one on each side of that front
bumper<00:00:58.410> threw<00:00:59.129> those<00:00:59.250> through<00:00:59.850> those<00:01:00.059> outer

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
bumper threw those through those outer

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.869 
bumper threw those through those outer
holes<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:01.410> what<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.129> gives<00:01:02.430> me<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.640> they're

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
holes and what this gives me is they're

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.809 
holes and what this gives me is they're
not<00:01:03.030> tight<00:01:03.709> and<00:01:04.709> I<00:01:04.859> left<00:01:05.100> some<00:01:05.459> of<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.609> back

00:01:05.809 --> 00:01:05.819 
not tight and I left some of the back

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:08.569 
not tight and I left some of the back
plate<00:01:06.179> instead<00:01:06.539> of<00:01:06.659> cutting<00:01:06.899> it<00:01:07.279> so<00:01:08.279> that<00:01:08.459> it

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
plate instead of cutting it so that it

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:10.219 
plate instead of cutting it so that it
could<00:01:08.670> fit<00:01:08.909> on<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.299> thing<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.869> then<00:01:09.959> I<00:01:10.049> just

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
could fit on that thing and then I just

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.080 
could fit on that thing and then I just
got<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> Velcro<00:01:10.859> there<00:01:11.069> so<00:01:11.249> now<00:01:11.429> I<00:01:11.459> have<00:01:11.819> like<00:01:12.029> a
