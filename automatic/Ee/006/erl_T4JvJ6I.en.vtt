00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.240
 If I live in Argentina and Argentina 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.730
 he made the america cup that ended yesterday 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.400
 the champion was uruguay he won 3 to 0 to 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.960
 paraguay and saw a soccer lesson 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.700
 mainly because it was a team the 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.840
 everything was more than the sum of the parts and 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.790
 that's something that all teams 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.010
 starting with ours have to 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.860
 learn a goal from Luis Suarez the man 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.630
 of the liverpool 2 of diego forlán that no 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.090
 he converted goals for the celestial one from the 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.560
 the world team took revenge yesterday in the final and 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.510
 Uruguay became the team that 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.240
 more times he won the America Cup in the 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.699
 football history reached 15 second 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.050
 Argentina was with 14 achievements that 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.609
 said the technician of uruguay oscar 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.350
 washington tabárez that fans of 

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:41.499
 mouths know well because I come out champion 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:45.839
 to mouth in 92 he learned everything by watching 

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:45.839
 Pekerman in the Argentine youth 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.629
 with this comfort or do not look at what 

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:54.549
 we were learning from us and today 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.280
 we are out in the first round 

00:00:54.549 --> 00:01:00.399
 since many times people talk about the 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.559
 illogical thing that football has like 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.230
 always as a trap to stay with a 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.520
 idea with the other remove the america cup 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.789
 uruguay paraguay 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.619
 so those who reach the final say 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:12.369
 the two best performances of the world 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.829
 past 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.600
 that is, there is a logic, let's say that 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:19.149
 continues to manifest despite the fact that 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.950
 Sometimes one is surprised with more and more 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.939
 the teams weigh more than the big ones 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.380
 players are the big ones 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.939
 Individualities is getting more and more 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.520
 far the one that manages to form a team 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.500
 although each of the men is not the 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.329
 megastar that those who put together a 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.799
 series of stars and fail to amalgamate 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.750
 the to follow all for the same 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.490
 target issued and on that reason carla 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.959
 how do you know that the Argentine team does not 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.250
 can play well because he has one of 

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:41.250
 each side of the world 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.060
 amalgamated if there is a mind that can 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.500
 perform let's say work 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.759
 corresponding for me you have to go 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.840
 on vacation all today maybe it's 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:59.799
 it would also be good has to see 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:01.270
 they also have to count many 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.130
 million also make millions 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.810
 the games when the games work 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.640
 strong, the spirit of luxury is difficult 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.329
 what Alberto said in our first 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.299
 program alberto kornblihtt this the 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:14.889
 science does not want like this the work 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.600
 as a team soccer is teamwork 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:18.069
 in almost all activities of being 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.709
 human salons to that are so 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.630
 independent that they feel is also a 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.970
 team the coach is the coach is the 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.639
 physical trainer is the logic is the 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.310
 family issues training 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:31.810
 containment is always like there's 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.889
 that abandon the games and devote more 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.889
 to the team we are going to learn
