00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.260 

must<00:01:35.650> be<00:01:35.770> tough

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
must be tough

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.730 
must be tough
finding<00:01:38.020> out<00:01:38.109> that<00:01:38.170> she's<00:01:38.380> a<00:01:38.409> traitor

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
finding out that she's a traitor

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.349 
finding out that she's a traitor
especially<00:01:38.950> after<00:01:39.399> you<00:01:39.579> base<00:01:39.759> clearest<00:01:40.179> drag

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:40.359 
especially after you base clearest drag

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:44.289 
especially after you base clearest drag
on<00:01:40.509> her<00:01:40.630> and<00:01:40.780> all

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:49.870 

well<00:01:45.579> Clara<00:01:46.579> started<00:01:46.909> off<00:01:47.149> as<00:01:47.450> Sophia<00:01:47.899> but<00:01:48.880> she

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
well Clara started off as Sophia but she

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.120 
well Clara started off as Sophia but she
ended<00:01:50.090> up<00:01:50.179> being<00:01:50.450> more<00:01:50.630> like<00:01:50.689> you<00:01:50.990> know<00:01:51.229> smart

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
ended up being more like you know smart

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.139 
ended up being more like you know smart
fierce<00:01:52.579> kind<00:01:53.329> I<00:01:54.759> think<00:01:55.759> that's<00:01:55.909> one<00:01:56.030> of<00:01:56.090> the

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
fierce kind I think that's one of the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.490 
fierce kind I think that's one of the
reasons<00:01:56.360> I<00:01:56.450> was<00:01:56.539> drawn<00:01:56.810> to<00:01:56.990> you<00:01:57.159> as<00:01:58.159> a<00:01:58.219> muse<00:01:59.500> you

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
reasons I was drawn to you as a muse you

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.580 
reasons I was drawn to you as a muse you
think<00:02:00.679> dr.<00:02:00.890> Blakely<00:02:01.250> was<00:02:01.369> right<00:02:01.899> about<00:02:02.899> the

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
think dr. Blakely was right about the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.380 
think dr. Blakely was right about the
linchpin<00:02:03.979> do<00:02:04.039> you<00:02:04.130> think<00:02:04.280> we<00:02:04.369> actually<00:02:04.789> saved

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
linchpin do you think we actually saved

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.070 
linchpin do you think we actually saved
the<00:02:05.959> world<00:02:06.200> I<00:02:06.619> think<00:02:07.459> that<00:02:07.729> we<00:02:08.690> saved<00:02:08.929> a<00:02:08.989> little

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
the world I think that we saved a little

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.030 
the world I think that we saved a little
girl's<00:02:09.379> life<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:10.160> that's<00:02:10.519> enough<00:02:10.759> for<00:02:10.910> me
