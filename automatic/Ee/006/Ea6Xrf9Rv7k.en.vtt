00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
piece but anyway I followed all the

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.449 
piece but anyway I followed all the
instructions<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.970> work

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
instructions I work

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.520

play<00:02:12.700> it<00:02:13.180> says<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.629> work<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.959> clay<00:02:14.170> at<00:02:14.319> least

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
play it says to work the clay at least

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.490 
play it says to work the clay at least
two<00:02:14.890> minutes<00:02:15.280> I<00:02:15.579> probably<00:02:16.390> worked<00:02:16.900> my<00:02:17.170> clay

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
two minutes I probably worked my clay

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.369 
two minutes I probably worked my clay
ten<00:02:17.859> minutes<00:02:18.189> because<00:02:18.459> I<00:02:19.060> wanted<00:02:20.019> to<00:02:20.079> get<00:02:20.290> it

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
ten minutes because I wanted to get it

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.059 
ten minutes because I wanted to get it
soft<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:20.980> pliable<00:02:21.689> so<00:02:22.689> I<00:02:22.719> really<00:02:23.319> did<00:02:23.560> work<00:02:23.829> it

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
soft and pliable so I really did work it

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.880 
soft and pliable so I really did work it
you<00:02:24.849> get<00:02:24.969> a<00:02:25.030> pound<00:02:25.269> of<00:02:25.480> clay<00:02:25.629> but<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:26.469> only<00:02:26.620> get

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
you get a pound of clay but you only get

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.250 
you get a pound of clay but you only get
two<00:02:27.129> ounces<00:02:27.670> of<00:02:27.730> each<00:02:28.090> color<00:02:28.450> so<00:02:28.870> there's

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
two ounces of each color so there's

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.539 
two ounces of each color so there's
eight<00:02:29.500> colors<00:02:30.030> two<00:02:31.030> ounces<00:02:31.510> that's<00:02:31.719> a<00:02:31.900> pound

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
eight colors two ounces that's a pound

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.740 
eight colors two ounces that's a pound
but<00:02:33.549> anyway<00:02:33.849> it<00:02:33.969> comes<00:02:34.180> in<00:02:34.389> two<00:02:34.510> blocks

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
but anyway it comes in two blocks

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.869 
but anyway it comes in two blocks
because<00:02:35.290> regular<00:02:35.560> coffee<00:02:36.159> dies<00:02:38.819> but<00:02:39.819> you

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
because regular coffee dies but you

really<00:02:40.450> do<00:02:40.659> want<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:40.989> work<00:02:41.170> it<00:02:41.379> good<00:02:41.590> see<00:02:41.829> how

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
really do want to work it good see how

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.649 
really do want to work it good see how
it<00:02:42.040> crumbles<00:02:42.519> right<00:02:42.760> now<00:02:42.909> like<00:02:43.180> this<00:02:43.389> but

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
it crumbles right now like this but

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.710 
it crumbles right now like this but
that's<00:02:43.810> that's<00:02:44.349> fine<00:02:44.560> you<00:02:44.859> expect<00:02:45.370> that<00:02:45.720> so

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
that's that's fine you expect that so

work it at least at least two minutes
but<00:02:58.780> I<00:02:58.840> would<00:02:59.109> work<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.439> a<00:02:59.530> lot<00:02:59.709> more<00:02:59.950> than<00:03:00.129> that

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:00.639 
but I would work it a lot more than that

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:03.629 
but I would work it a lot more than that
and<00:03:01.200> when<00:03:02.200> you<00:03:02.290> bake<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.560> it<00:03:02.859> says<00:03:03.069> bake<00:03:03.340> it<00:03:03.519> on

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
use this this metal metal sheet just

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.199 
use this this metal metal sheet just
like<00:03:13.659> that<00:03:14.019> and<00:03:14.319> I<00:03:14.859> baked<00:03:15.159> it<00:03:15.340> I<00:03:15.519> preheated<00:03:15.909> my

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
like that and I baked it I preheated my

oven up to 285

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.689 
oven up to 285
and<00:03:19.359> then<00:03:19.510> I<00:03:19.629> baked<00:03:19.900> it<00:03:20.139> for<00:03:21.040> 20<00:03:21.400> minutes

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:21.699 
and then I baked it for 20 minutes

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:23.430 
and then I baked it for 20 minutes
because<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.299> says<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:22.659> bake<00:03:22.870> for<00:03:23.199> every

because it says to bake for every
quarter<00:03:23.709> of<00:03:23.919> an<00:03:24.040> inch<00:03:24.190> they<00:03:24.519> said<00:03:24.760> to<00:03:24.879> bake<00:03:25.409> if

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:26.409 
quarter of an inch they said to bake if

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.189 
quarter of an inch they said to bake if
you're<00:03:26.760> 1/4<00:03:27.760> inch<00:03:27.939> thickness<00:03:28.239> bake<00:03:28.720> at<00:03:28.870> 20

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:29.199 
you're 1/4 inch thickness bake at 20

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:32.490 
you're 1/4 inch thickness bake at 20
minutes<00:03:29.379> so<00:03:29.680> on<00:03:29.799> 285<00:03:30.479> for<00:03:31.479> 20<00:03:31.780> minutes<00:03:32.109> that's

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
minutes so on 285 for 20 minutes that's

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.219 
minutes so on 285 for 20 minutes that's
how<00:03:32.709> I<00:03:32.739> baked<00:03:33.069> it<00:03:33.569> but<00:03:34.569> anyway<00:03:34.840> just<00:03:34.870> keep

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:35.229 
how I baked it but anyway just keep

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:37.770 
how I baked it but anyway just keep
working<00:03:35.650> this<00:03:35.769> clay<00:03:36.099> until<00:03:36.879> it<00:03:37.209> feels<00:03:37.449> really

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
working this clay until it feels really

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.009 
working this clay until it feels really
nice<00:03:38.079> and<00:03:38.409> soft<00:03:38.620> it's<00:03:38.979> a<00:03:39.099> lot<00:03:39.689> when<00:03:40.689> you<00:03:40.810> work

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
nice and soft it's a lot when you work

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.809 
nice and soft it's a lot when you work
with<00:03:41.049> clay<00:03:41.500> like<00:03:41.829> when<00:03:42.099> I<00:03:42.129> worked<00:03:42.370> with<00:03:42.519> these

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
with clay like when I worked with these

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.999 
with clay like when I worked with these
this<00:03:43.299> was<00:03:43.509> very<00:03:43.750> firm<00:03:44.109> and<00:03:44.530> I<00:03:44.590> had<00:03:44.739> an<00:03:44.829> easy

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:45.009 
this was very firm and I had an easy

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:47.640 
this was very firm and I had an easy
time<00:03:45.159> putting<00:03:45.729> these<00:03:45.849> together<00:03:46.620> you're<00:03:47.620> not

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
time putting these together you're not

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.530 
time putting these together you're not
going<00:03:47.949> to<00:03:48.009> get<00:03:48.129> that<00:03:48.370> firmness<00:03:48.669> in<00:03:49.150> here<00:03:49.389> it's

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
going to get that firmness in here it's

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.530 
going to get that firmness in here it's
a<00:03:49.689> little<00:03:50.019> bit<00:03:50.229> more<00:03:50.819> the<00:03:51.819> clay<00:03:52.060> is<00:03:52.120> a<00:03:52.269> little

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
a little bit more the clay is a little

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.710 
a little bit more the clay is a little
softer<00:03:53.079> to<00:03:53.199> work<00:03:53.379> with<00:03:54.120> but<00:03:55.120> you<00:03:55.180> can<00:03:55.449> still

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
softer to work with but you can still

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.409 
softer to work with but you can still
get<00:03:55.959> a<00:03:55.989> nice<00:03:56.259> finish<00:03:56.709> on<00:03:56.919> it<00:03:57.129> so<00:03:57.340> anyway<00:03:58.180> keep

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419 
get a nice finish on it so anyway keep

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:00.809 
get a nice finish on it so anyway keep
work<00:03:58.629> in<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:58.870> clay<00:03:59.189> get<00:04:00.189> it<00:04:00.280> so<00:04:00.459> it's<00:04:00.639> really

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
work in the clay get it so it's really

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.659 
work in the clay get it so it's really
nice<00:04:01.180> and<00:04:01.599> soft<00:04:01.840> and<00:04:02.319> pliable<00:04:02.620> and<00:04:03.280> like<00:04:03.519> I

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:03.669 
nice and soft and pliable and like I

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:05.520 
nice and soft and pliable and like I
said<00:04:03.729> I<00:04:03.909> worked<00:04:04.209> with<00:04:04.389> mine<00:04:04.629> like<00:04:04.900> 10<00:04:05.199> minutes

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
said I worked with mine like 10 minutes

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.469 
said I worked with mine like 10 minutes
to<00:04:05.709> get<00:04:05.769> it<00:04:05.949> soft<00:04:06.189> and<00:04:06.459> pliable<00:04:06.669> the

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:07.479 
to get it soft and pliable the

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:10.379 
to get it soft and pliable the
instructions<00:04:08.079> say<00:04:08.290> 2<00:04:08.349> minutes<00:04:08.949> but<00:04:09.189> I<00:04:09.489> would

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389

my design

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.939 
my design
I<00:05:16.610> had<00:05:17.509> the<00:05:17.690> design<00:05:18.020> on<00:05:18.169> the<00:05:18.289> back<00:05:18.469> but<00:05:18.740> I<00:05:18.770> did

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
I had the design on the back but I did

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.249 
I had the design on the back but I did
the<00:05:19.039> same<00:05:19.250> thing<00:05:19.610> I<00:05:19.849> cut<00:05:20.599> it<00:05:20.719> out<00:05:20.840> just<00:05:21.110> like

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:21.259 
the same thing I cut it out just like

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:25.179 
the same thing I cut it out just like
that<00:05:23.050> but<00:05:24.050> I<00:05:24.110> would<00:05:24.439> still<00:05:24.650> work<00:05:24.830> with<00:05:25.069> this

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:25.189 
that but I would still work with this

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:27.219 
that but I would still work with this
clay<00:05:25.490> more<00:05:25.759> I<00:05:25.789> wouldn't<00:05:26.240> just<00:05:26.419> go<00:05:26.599> with<00:05:26.810> that<00:05:26.960> I

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
clay more I wouldn't just go with that I

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:29.080 
clay more I wouldn't just go with that I
mean<00:05:27.349> it<00:05:27.469> would<00:05:27.590> probably<00:05:27.620> be<00:05:28.009> okay<00:05:28.340> but<00:05:28.699> now

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090

they said that when you do make your
connections<00:06:30.770> make<00:06:31.610> sure<00:06:31.849> you<00:06:32.000> press<00:06:32.300> them

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:32.509 
connections make sure you press them

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:35.860 
connections make sure you press them
together<00:06:32.659> firmly<00:06:33.319> really<00:06:34.310> firmly

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.870 
together firmly really firmly

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.990 
together firmly really firmly
I<00:06:35.900> didn't<00:06:36.530> do<00:06:36.650> that<00:06:36.890> I<00:06:37.160> knew<00:06:37.370> I<00:06:37.400> didn't<00:06:37.820> do<00:06:37.970> that

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 
I didn't do that I knew I didn't do that

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.840 
I didn't do that I knew I didn't do that
when<00:06:38.360> I<00:06:38.390> made<00:06:38.720> this<00:06:39.400> and<00:06:40.400> that's<00:06:40.640> what

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:40.850 
when I made this and that's what

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:45.040 
when I made this and that's what
happened<00:06:41.270> well<00:06:42.230> I'll<00:06:42.440> be<00:06:42.590> done<00:06:43.600> okay<00:06:44.600> well

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
happened well I'll be done okay well

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.410 
happened well I'll be done okay well
when<00:06:45.290> you<00:06:45.380> put<00:06:45.560> your<00:06:45.770> edge<00:06:46.490> on<00:06:46.820> make<00:06:47.120> sure<00:06:47.300> you

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:47.420 
when you put your edge on make sure you

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.090 
when you put your edge on make sure you
get<00:06:47.540> a<00:06:47.600> really<00:06:47.840> good<00:06:48.110> connection<00:06:48.440> under<00:06:48.920> that

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:49.100 
get a really good connection under that

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.760 
get a really good connection under that
another<00:06:49.940> thing<00:06:50.150> joann<00:06:50.570> told<00:06:50.810> me<00:06:50.990> was<00:06:51.200> to<00:06:51.500> use

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:51.770 
another thing joann told me was to use

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:57.100 
another thing joann told me was to use
this<00:06:52.100> 528<00:06:52.970> by<00:06:53.240> beacon<00:06:55.360> because<00:06:56.360> this<00:06:56.600> works<00:06:56.900> on

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
this 528 by beacon because this works on

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.800 
this 528 by beacon because this works on
ceramic<00:06:57.800> tiles<00:06:58.310> corks<00:06:58.730> metals<00:06:59.150> wood<00:06:59.450> fiber

00:06:59.800 --> 00:06:59.810 
ceramic tiles corks metals wood fiber

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.290 
ceramic tiles corks metals wood fiber
glass<00:07:00.110> and<00:07:00.410> more<00:07:00.620> so<00:07:01.370> she<00:07:01.460> said<00:07:01.790> this<00:07:01.940> is<00:07:02.120> what

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:02.300 
glass and more so she said this is what

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.650 
glass and more so she said this is what
she<00:07:02.540> used<00:07:02.840> when<00:07:03.020> she<00:07:03.200> glues<00:07:03.470> her<00:07:04.120> clay<00:07:05.120> pieces

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:05.660 
she used when she glues her clay pieces

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.830 
she used when she glues her clay pieces
together<00:07:05.870> so<00:07:07.240> I'll<00:07:08.240> probably<00:07:08.420> put<00:07:08.720> a<00:07:08.780> little

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 
together so I'll probably put a little

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.660 
together so I'll probably put a little
bit<00:07:09.170> of<00:07:09.290> glue<00:07:09.500> in<00:07:09.680> there<00:07:09.890> just<00:07:10.100> to<00:07:10.310> hold<00:07:10.520> it

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:10.670 
bit of glue in there just to hold it

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.310 
bit of glue in there just to hold it
secure<00:07:11.120> but<00:07:11.450> see<00:07:11.660> how<00:07:11.780> I<00:07:11.810> didn't<00:07:12.110> make<00:07:12.260> that

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:12.320 
secure but see how I didn't make that

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.450 
secure but see how I didn't make that
nice<00:07:12.800> connection<00:07:13.810> in<00:07:14.810> the<00:07:15.140> top<00:07:15.380> so<00:07:15.980> just<00:07:16.280> make

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:16.460 
nice connection in the top so just make

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.070 
nice connection in the top so just make
sure<00:07:16.640> when<00:07:16.880> you're<00:07:17.000> putting<00:07:17.240> your<00:07:17.360> edging<00:07:17.930> on

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 
sure when you're putting your edging on

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.740 
sure when you're putting your edging on
like<00:07:18.380> I<00:07:18.590> did<00:07:18.800> that<00:07:19.640> you<00:07:19.880> really<00:07:20.240> make<00:07:20.450> a<00:07:20.480> good

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:20.750 
like I did that you really make a good

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.300 
like I did that you really make a good
connection<00:07:21.110> because<00:07:21.590> if<00:07:21.710> you<00:07:21.830> don't<00:07:21.950> get<00:07:22.130> that

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:22.310 
connection because if you don't get that

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:23.680 
connection because if you don't get that
good<00:07:22.370> connection<00:07:23.150> it's<00:07:23.300> going<00:07:23.480> to<00:07:23.540> happen

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:23.690 
good connection it's going to happen

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.800 
good connection it's going to happen
just<00:07:24.170> like<00:07:24.380> I<00:07:24.560> did<00:07:24.770> that<00:07:24.980> right<00:07:25.220> there<00:07:25.490> you<00:07:25.810> can

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:26.810 
just like I did that right there you can

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.330 
just like I did that right there you can
only<00:07:26.930> see<00:07:27.230> in<00:07:27.320> the<00:07:27.380> front<00:07:27.650> where<00:07:27.860> I<00:07:27.890> made<00:07:28.160> that

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:28.340 
only see in the front where I made that

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.270 
only see in the front where I made that
connection<00:07:28.670> but<00:07:28.970> isn't<00:07:29.300> that<00:07:29.420> wonderful

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:30.280 
connection but isn't that wonderful

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:36.120 
connection but isn't that wonderful

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:48.950 
because now you can do flowers you can

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:52.660 
because now you can do flowers you can
do<00:07:49.600> polka<00:07:50.600> dots<00:07:50.930> here<00:07:51.440> you<00:07:51.710> can<00:07:51.950> you<00:07:52.250> know<00:07:52.370> and

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:56.290 
do polka dots here you can you know and
eventually<00:07:53.540> you<00:07:53.660> can<00:07:53.840> probably<00:07:55.090> expand<00:07:56.090> on

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:56.300 
eventually you can probably expand on

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.360 
eventually you can probably expand on
this<00:07:56.510> and<00:07:56.780> make<00:07:56.900> the<00:07:57.050> entire<00:07:57.200> shoe<00:07:57.920> out<00:07:58.190> of
