00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
in a game with it so it comes very

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.120

rushing a building commando does come in

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.650 
rushing a building commando does come in
handy<00:03:02.280> oh<00:03:02.579> it's<00:03:02.760> just<00:03:03.000> using<00:03:03.299> it<00:03:03.390> if<00:03:03.540> you

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
handy oh it's just using it if you

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.180 
handy oh it's just using it if you
probably<00:03:04.290> don't<00:03:04.829> already<00:03:05.010> then<00:03:05.400> use<00:03:05.670> it<00:03:06.140> so<00:03:07.140> uh

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
probably don't already then use it so uh

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.130 
probably don't already then use it so uh
I'm<00:03:08.190> just<00:03:08.579> pretty<00:03:08.970> much<00:03:09.180> adapting<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:09.959> the

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
I'm just pretty much adapting to the

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.530 
I'm just pretty much adapting to the
spawns<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:10.799> good<00:03:10.950> thing<00:03:11.160> about<00:03:11.370> this<00:03:11.670> map

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
spawns and a good thing about this map

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.750 
spawns and a good thing about this map
is<00:03:12.750> that<00:03:13.079> where<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:13.920> enemy<00:03:14.250> spawns<00:03:14.549> you

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
is that where the enemy spawns you

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.210 
is that where the enemy spawns you
always<00:03:15.090> have<00:03:15.269> a<00:03:15.329> good<00:03:15.600> defensive<00:03:16.410> position<00:03:16.890> to

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
always have a good defensive position to
