go on

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.440

the<00:04:44.650> thing<00:04:44.860> about<00:04:44.890> dressing<00:04:45.700> hostages<00:04:46.270> as

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450

terrorists and terrorists as hostages
not<00:04:49.660> really<00:04:49.900> a<00:04:49.930> Joker<00:04:50.260> thing<00:04:50.530> but<00:04:50.710> definitely

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
not really a Joker thing but definitely

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.930 
not really a Joker thing but definitely
a<00:04:51.130> two-face<00:04:51.520> thing

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
a two-face thing

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.270 
a two-face thing
this<00:04:52.810> would<00:04:52.990> also<00:04:53.140> explain<00:04:53.620> why<00:04:53.740> the<00:04:53.920> Joker

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
this would also explain why the Joker

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.590 
this would also explain why the Joker
isn't<00:04:54.580> funny<00:04:55.000> at<00:04:55.090> all<00:04:55.300> but<00:04:55.810> yeah<00:04:57.120> all<00:04:58.120> in<00:04:58.450> all

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
isn't funny at all but yeah all in all

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.420 
isn't funny at all but yeah all in all
it<00:04:58.780> seems<00:04:59.020> a<00:04:59.140> lot<00:04:59.290> like<00:04:59.500> two<00:04:59.800> phases<00:05:00.190> plot

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
it seems a lot like two phases plot

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.370 
it seems a lot like two phases plot
points<00:05:00.850> were<00:05:00.970> given<00:05:01.120> to<00:05:01.330> the<00:05:01.450> Joker<00:05:01.690> maybe

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
points were given to the Joker maybe

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.960 
points were given to the Joker maybe
it's<00:05:02.560> just<00:05:02.860> that<00:05:03.010> Heath<00:05:03.310> Ledger<00:05:03.580> blew

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
it's just that Heath Ledger blew

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.550 
it's just that Heath Ledger blew
everyone<00:05:04.390> away<00:05:04.420> to<00:05:04.690> the<00:05:05.050> point<00:05:05.230> that<00:05:05.410> they

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
everyone away to the point that they

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.290 
everyone away to the point that they
started<00:05:06.010> writing<00:05:06.280> a<00:05:06.340> bigger<00:05:06.520> part<00:05:06.850> for<00:05:07.030> him

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
started writing a bigger part for him

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.750 
started writing a bigger part for him
maybe<00:05:08.110> it's<00:05:08.320> not<00:05:08.530> that<00:05:08.590> the<00:05:08.950> Joker<00:05:09.190> was<00:05:09.400> added

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
maybe it's not that the Joker was added

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.030 
maybe it's not that the Joker was added
later<00:05:09.940> on<00:05:10.030> like<00:05:10.540> when<00:05:10.750> Sam<00:05:11.110> Raimi<00:05:11.410> was<00:05:11.530> forced

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
later on like when Sam Raimi was forced

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.600 
later on like when Sam Raimi was forced
to<00:05:12.100> shoehorn<00:05:12.400> venom<00:05:12.970> into<00:05:13.090> spider-man<00:05:13.600> 3

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
to shoehorn venom into spider-man 3

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.300 
to shoehorn venom into spider-man 3
maybe<00:05:15.610> but<00:05:16.410> unfortunately<00:05:17.410> there's<00:05:17.710> one<00:05:18.100> more

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
maybe but unfortunately there's one more

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.840 
maybe but unfortunately there's one more
switchblade<00:05:19.000> shoe<00:05:19.330> that's<00:05:19.570> about<00:05:19.750> to<00:05:19.930> drop

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
switchblade shoe that's about to drop

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.990

Dark Knight this really should change

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.300 
Dark Knight this really should change

nothing it's movies get written and

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.730

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
of it that you like that you don't like

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.870 
of it that you like that you don't like
it's<00:06:11.080> all<00:06:11.290> subjective<00:06:11.500> so<00:06:12.430> I'm<00:06:12.490> not<00:06:12.610> saying

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
it's all subjective so I'm not saying

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.490 
it's all subjective so I'm not saying
that<00:06:13.120> the<00:06:13.210> Dark<00:06:13.420> Knight<00:06:13.570> is<00:06:13.690> a<00:06:13.720> bad<00:06:13.930> film<00:06:14.230> I'm

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
that the Dark Knight is a bad film I'm

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.890 
that the Dark Knight is a bad film I'm
just<00:06:14.710> saying<00:06:14.950> that<00:06:15.280> this<00:06:15.700> is<00:06:15.940> my<00:06:16.150> theory<00:06:16.570> that

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
just saying that this is my theory that

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.450 
just saying that this is my theory that
the<00:06:17.530> Joker<00:06:18.310> was<00:06:18.880> added<00:06:19.420> to<00:06:19.780> the<00:06:19.900> Dark<00:06:20.140> Knight

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
the Joker was added to the Dark Knight

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.460 
the Joker was added to the Dark Knight
later<00:06:21.460> on<00:06:21.700> and<00:06:22.000> that's<00:06:22.450> two<00:06:22.750> phases<00:06:23.200> scenes

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.470 
later on and that's two phases scenes

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.440 
later on and that's two phases scenes
were<00:06:23.710> all<00:06:23.890> ripped<00:06:24.250> away<00:06:24.400> from<00:06:24.520> him<00:06:24.850> and<00:06:25.030> he

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:25.450 
were all ripped away from him and he

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.210 
were all ripped away from him and he
became<00:06:25.690> almost<00:06:25.930> a<00:06:26.200> minor<00:06:26.440> character<00:06:26.770> I<00:06:27.010> mean

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
became almost a minor character I mean

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.210 
became almost a minor character I mean
if<00:06:27.310> you<00:06:27.430> remove<00:06:27.760> two-face<00:06:28.300> if<00:06:28.920> you<00:06:29.920> remove

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
if you remove two-face if you remove

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.810 
if you remove two-face if you remove

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860
