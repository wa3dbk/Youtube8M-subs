smoothly thanks to the bells being
similar<00:03:07.620> diameter<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:09.530> I<00:03:11.360> have<00:03:12.360> yet<00:03:12.569> to<00:03:12.599> test

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
similar diameter and I have yet to test

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.720 
similar diameter and I have yet to test
this<00:03:13.049> myself<00:03:13.790> this<00:03:14.790> is<00:03:14.940> very<00:03:15.120> exciting

let's get a good shot in the first uh

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:59.699 
let's get a good shot in the first uh
okay<00:03:22.459> chess<00:03:23.459> form<00:03:23.760> on<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.120> bottom

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.740 

all<00:04:00.250> right<00:04:00.370> now<00:04:00.549> let's<00:04:00.760> compare<00:04:01.090> it<00:04:01.239> to<00:04:01.569> that

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
all right now let's compare it to that

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.959 
all right now let's compare it to that
of<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:02.109> Mike<00:04:02.290> Portnoy<00:04:02.709> and<00:04:02.890> lo<00:04:03.010> stack<00:04:03.340> which

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:03.969 
of the Mike Portnoy and lo stack which

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:06.089 
of the Mike Portnoy and lo stack which
is<00:04:04.030> a<00:04:04.209> 12<00:04:04.569> inch<00:04:04.870> and<00:04:05.049> a<00:04:05.109> 14<00:04:05.530> inch<00:04:05.709> so<00:04:05.859> we<00:04:05.950> got

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
is a 12 inch and a 14 inch so we got

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.910 
is a 12 inch and a 14 inch so we got
similar<00:04:06.340> diameters<00:04:07.150> going<00:04:07.420> on<00:04:07.569> just<00:04:08.200> to<00:04:08.319> get<00:04:08.560> a

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
similar diameters going on just to get a

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.849 
similar diameters going on just to get a
feel<00:04:09.730> of<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:10.120> two<00:04:10.629> differences<00:04:11.200> here<00:04:11.560> we<00:04:11.680> go

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
feel of the two differences here we go

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.740 
feel of the two differences here we go
which<00:04:12.340> I<00:04:12.489> also<00:04:12.670> have<00:04:12.909> a<00:04:12.939> video<00:04:13.150> for<00:04:13.510> this<00:04:13.599> so

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
which I also have a video for this so

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.179 
which I also have a video for this so
you<00:04:13.840> can<00:04:13.959> check<00:04:14.109> that<00:04:14.170> out<00:04:14.349> too<00:04:14.650> but<00:04:14.859> let's<00:04:15.040> do

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:15.189 
you can check that out too but let's do

00:04:15.189 --> 00:05:12.830 
you can check that out too but let's do
it<00:04:15.280> at<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:15.430> same<00:04:15.609> time

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.330 

all<00:05:13.840> right<00:05:13.990> so<00:05:14.230> what<00:05:14.440> I'm<00:05:14.530> noticing<00:05:14.740> here<00:05:15.010> is
