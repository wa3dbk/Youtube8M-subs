00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.440
 paolo 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.910
 welcome to this new type rows 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.730
 let's pamper here are luca flying from the moon to the position that 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:10.959
 you are watching here 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:13.509
 using a days of movement 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.660
 well first of all I'm going to tell you how this is structured 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.960
 here in the tasting below is the background is basically the delight of the 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.489
 stars and the moon is blocked by zacapa 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:27.359
 and in which appears the symbol of what the witch is, who is good 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.909
 obviously witch 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:31.979
 what we are going to do now is create the gum and movements by which the 

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:36.269
 witch is going to fly let's create a new layer name it and you want 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.400
 take really wants the line with a color that looks like I'm going to choose red and 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.510
 let's trace 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.350
 An climber by which the witch will fly 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.160
 queen without more or less preki and obviously we do not want her to come back in 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.290
 straight line is going to look a bit wrong then with the tool 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.480
 selection 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.920
 sixth date and so black that is here 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.370
 take tiny tim wanted to fold this line to give 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.010
 a curve more or less like that 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.320
 that she that you have something similar to that we are going to give 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.530
 Right click on the tasting of the guide 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.720
 and select don Vicente there would you 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.040
 and now we are going to create it is a layer the day now you see that you have small 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.270
 weird symbol here talks about what we have to do to finish the process is 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.140
 take the witch's cloak and astrada 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.950
 to the stage of law 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.870
 and here to know that the new change is small icon symbol attended the 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:33.979
 day species 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.580
 and very important the witchcraft tent is 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.260
 to pushed to the right as 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.690
 attach to the eagle carp 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.609
 that's what we want and now we're going to 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:47.609
 select who says 12 data clicks 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.970
 change what is the usillal of the frames because the test in 12 and if 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.999
 we want a 24 to be more fluid 

00:01:55.999 --> 00:02:00.579
 the resignation of frames I see that prevents this is his master we continue 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.080
 we extend a bit to what is frame 100 pretty much 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.920
 and select all layers 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.440
 right click inserts a frame that we already have space 2 grams with what 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.619
 to work 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:19.649
 and now we'll ll feel more or less the photographer 85 right click 

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:22.989
 insert keyframes 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.219
 this will be the position before 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:29.309
 of the witch and if we're going to take the object transformer tool 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:33.090
 and this little icon grows I wanted injured that estimated select the 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:36.269
 ships to attach objects 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.549
 let's wait for this little white dot that are the symbol of the 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.150
 witch with the end 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.299
 This line 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.979
 today we can even move the line I think it's going to be easier line grinding and 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:48.490
 that sticks with that white dot 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.379
 that then that is going to be 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.379
 the German position that know the witch 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:58.359
 now monkeys to the pose start that is obviously here with the moon 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.749
 we are going to take the tool of the promos of objects and obviously we are going to 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:05.749
 be smaller the witch to give you some perspective this flight 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:08.420
 kim simmons to beat him quinn 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.420
 even smaller and I want to make it still that athens look 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.869
 selected let's go to color properties 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:20.850
 we try to give it a 100% black tint so that it is totally like this 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.799
 nothing more the silhouette 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.719
 Kevin 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:28.559
 i will select right click on the lid of the witch 

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:31.689
 icq and there mosen pimpon interpolation movement 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.720
 and here you can see that the witch flies 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.159
 m 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:40.730
 and take as it comes that line that draws what and you can also see what to change 

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:42.139
 it goes black 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.520
 to the original color of what the witch was 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.919
 what did I do very well 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:50.079
 Now what we can do is select here the interpolation 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.829
 crime 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.329
 and the sixteenth itself and this one feels access to more I realized the 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:57.389
 animation 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.389
 kelly so do not be so robotic 

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:03.929
 by drought the frame 

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:07.299
 to the last frame something we can do there is fine animation 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.459
 even power control in test moved to test movie 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:14.939
 I think we're going to see how they look 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:17.309
 if it looks pretty good 

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:22.150
 but something that we can be park will be even better p this for prison 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.259
 selecting here the symbol of the witch I'm going to two clicks cucaicor this to 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:31.470
 center of what is the symbol of the witch you can see that everything else he 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.569
 are placed 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:35.039
 it degrades although with opacity 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.379
 and here we can work with all the symbols of which it is composed 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:39.849
 the witch 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.639
 and we can make an animation to the center of this symbol 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.000
 qi with the magnifying glass more or less get away a little to be able to work better we go in 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.819
 very simple animation 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:56.289
 create in totora maklad equity in fact when the mix of i others count 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.069
 the money we go to more 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:04.960
 move it group a little upwards with the arrows of the keyboard move very 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.050
 simple that you hardly notice 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.590
 Dion train them with little because not with the effects transformation tool 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:15.319
 two 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:20.389
 something like this arm again all very subtle movements with milk goals 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.389
 of the keyboard 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:28.120
 kelly that little effect that mossad is like the witch is shaking l 

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:29.319
 with the 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:33.430
 with broom to stop the illusion that goes very fast and in the last we go 

00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:35.520
 paying a little down 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.520
 moresco a little 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:41.669
 i the arms 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:45.330
 I wanted us to have that we go two clicks to go outside it's symbols 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.330
 and here we will not see it here we will see nothing more to the witch flying singh 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.240
 without those changes we made but the changes we will see when we export 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.400
 the movie 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.819
 control test movie 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:59.819
 if it definitely looks there 

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:03.889
 the witch what we can do is taking in the very fast movements 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:05.460
 look after 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.830
 that will emit inside the witch symbol again 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.360
 and let's in the art 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.300
 insert frames between these keyframes right click 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.110
 insert frame 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.419
 they have right inserted frame i 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:23.849
 i again chile then we have more space between each keyframe what 

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:27.379
 which is going to be the invasion a little slower we are going to control test movie 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:31.719
 definitely insist to be much better 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:36.619
 and well maybe now anxiety is not enough to see well the animation by the 

00:06:36.619 --> 00:06:40.089
 frames in which these tutorials are recorded 

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:43.589
 but you can download the chicuela and stable and I definitely recommend you 

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:47.349
 go from the file stays cc3 or flash 8 

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:51.469
 so what you do explore all this file here are some very interesting things 

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:55.030
 you can even give two clicks inside the head symbol 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.680
 and local is composed of ethically symbols you can change it color 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.619
 play with them and so on 

00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:06.029
 well that's all for today I hope this server i thank you
