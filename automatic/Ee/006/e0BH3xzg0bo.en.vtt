excellent new 3 by 11 Shimano gotcha but
in<00:01:03.210> my<00:01:03.690> opinion<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.979> Shimano<00:01:05.309> drivetrain

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
in my opinion the the Shimano drivetrain

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.039 
in my opinion the the Shimano drivetrain
shifts<00:01:06.750> incredible<00:01:07.320> um<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.820> 2<00:01:09.600> bar<00:01:09.780> or

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
shifts incredible um and a 2 bar or

is<00:01:12.060> going<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.240> be<00:01:12.330> coming<00:01:12.540> out<00:01:12.630> with<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.780> 2<00:01:12.960> 2<00:01:13.380> by

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
is going to be coming out with a 2 2 by

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.929 
is going to be coming out with a 2 2 by
10<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:13.920> year<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.490> really<00:01:14.700> going<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.880> be

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
10 this year and really going to be

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
pushing hard on and I think a lot of it

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.260 
pushing hard on and I think a lot of it
has<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.310> do<00:01:17.580> with<00:01:17.790> you

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
don't rush when you get out and start

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.520 
don't rush when you get out and start
messing<00:01:21.330> with<00:01:21.509> some<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.900> drivetrain<00:01:22.110> sets

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
messing with some of the drivetrain sets

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.359 
messing with some of the drivetrain sets
you<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.740> now<00:01:23.750> you<00:01:24.750> tend<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.049> drop<00:01:25.290> change<00:01:26.130> for

the 2 by 10 and I think shramana has

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.240 
the 2 by 10 and I think shramana has
come<00:01:28.259> out<00:01:28.380> with<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> new<00:01:28.680> rear<00:01:28.890> derailleur
