them<00:01:57.600> up<00:01:57.689> in<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.869> air<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.200> air<00:01:58.409> combo<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.860> can

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
them up in the air to air combo you can

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.630 
them up in the air to air combo you can
tag<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.579> bring<00:01:59.729> your<00:01:59.909> partner<00:02:00.329> and

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
take the air power that's the only

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.550 
take the air power that's the only
difference<00:02:02.620> I've<00:02:02.950> seen<00:02:03.159> and<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.750> stages<00:02:05.290> I

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
difference I've seen and the stages I

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.380

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
like them better in this game because

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.240 
like them better in this game because
they're<00:02:07.690> greedy<00:02:07.990> and<00:02:08.259> they're<00:02:08.380> moved<00:02:08.619> in<00:02:08.619> they

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
they're greedy and they're moved in they

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.640 
they're greedy and they're moved in they

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
did a motorist capcom to be honest but

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.710 
did a motorist capcom to be honest but
in<00:02:11.770> this<00:02:11.890> game<00:02:11.950> there<00:02:12.400> just<00:02:12.819> like<00:02:12.970> there's<00:02:13.630> a

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
in this game there just like there's a

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.590 
in this game there just like there's a
pig<00:02:13.990> like<00:02:14.170> spider-man<00:02:14.709> float<00:02:15.310> and<00:02:15.700> this<00:02:16.060> and

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
just looks pretty cool and it's actually

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.449 
just looks pretty cool and it's actually
based<00:02:18.850> on<00:02:19.740> characters<00:02:20.740> in<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:20.950> game<00:02:20.980> instead

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
based on characters in the game instead

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.699 
based on characters in the game instead
of<00:02:21.610> some<00:02:21.760> generic<00:02:22.180> raft<00:02:22.510> or<00:02:22.900> floating<00:02:23.560> on<00:02:23.680> the
