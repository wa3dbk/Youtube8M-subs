videos i was walking around property and
i<00:00:58.899> kind<00:00:59.139> of<00:00:59.229> thought<00:00:59.379> to<00:00:59.559> myself<00:00:59.709> i<00:01:00.069> I've<00:01:00.399> got

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:00.459 
i kind of thought to myself i I've got

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:02.669 
i kind of thought to myself i I've got
to<00:01:00.670> get<00:01:00.789> some<00:01:00.969> mulch<00:01:01.209> and<00:01:01.479> you<00:01:02.289> know<00:01:02.409> how<00:01:02.530> much

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
to get some mulch and you know how much

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:04.829 
to get some mulch and you know how much
will<00:01:02.859> that<00:01:02.889> cost<00:01:03.010> and<00:01:03.639> that<00:01:03.760> is<00:01:03.879> and<00:01:04.509> I<00:01:04.539> kind<00:01:04.780> of

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
will that cost and that is and I kind of

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.319 
will that cost and that is and I kind of
decided<00:01:05.229> trying<00:01:06.039> to<00:01:06.100> think<00:01:06.280> about<00:01:06.520> utilizing

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:07.329 
decided trying to think about utilizing

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:09.420 
decided trying to think about utilizing
stuff<00:01:07.899> that<00:01:08.079> was<00:01:08.200> already<00:01:08.500> here<00:01:08.890> and<00:01:09.070> see<00:01:09.280> how

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
stuff that was already here and see how

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.039 
stuff that was already here and see how
it<00:01:09.579> goes<00:01:09.610> so<00:01:10.299> I'm<00:01:10.360> going<00:01:10.539> to<00:01:10.570> do<00:01:10.659> a<00:01:10.689> bit<00:01:10.840> of<00:01:10.869> an

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
it goes so I'm going to do a bit of an

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.700 
it goes so I'm going to do a bit of an
experiment<00:01:11.409> this<00:01:12.100> tree<00:01:12.340> behind<00:01:12.520> me<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:14.500> an

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
experiment this tree behind me is an

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.359 
experiment this tree behind me is an
ASIS<00:01:14.890> at<00:01:15.340> the<00:01:15.460> maple<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:16.750> actually<00:01:16.869> a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
ASIS at the maple it's actually a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.279 
ASIS at the maple it's actually a
variety<00:01:18.369> called<00:01:18.579> October<00:01:19.509> glory<00:01:19.780> so<00:01:20.079> it's<00:01:20.229> a

a bit so i'm going to pop into

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.360 
a bit so i'm going to pop into
background<00:03:11.080> alright<00:03:12.080> so<00:03:12.500> this<00:03:12.830> is<00:03:13.040> all<00:03:13.160> dug

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
background alright so this is all dug

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.880 
background alright so this is all dug
out<00:03:13.580> now<00:03:14.000> there<00:03:14.420> are<00:03:14.450> still<00:03:14.870> bits<00:03:15.080> this<00:03:15.709> is

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
out now there are still bits this is

this<00:03:16.220> buffalo<00:03:16.700> growing<00:03:17.090> in<00:03:17.209> this<00:03:17.330> area<00:03:17.860> so<00:03:18.860> i

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
this buffalo growing in this area so i

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.920 
this buffalo growing in this area so i

it's a runner so the law ways kind of

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
it's a runner so the law ways kind of
creep<00:03:22.910> in<00:03:24.310> but<00:03:25.310> try<00:03:25.700> and<00:03:25.850> get<00:03:25.970> out<00:03:26.150> as<00:03:26.180> much<00:03:26.480> as

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.560 
soon come back one of the advantages
here<00:03:33.410> they<00:03:33.769> go<00:03:33.950> one<00:03:34.790> of<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.030> advantages<00:03:35.120> of

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
here they go one of the advantages of

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.270 
here they go one of the advantages of
having<00:03:35.720> it<00:03:36.110> is<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.350> fact<00:03:36.590> that<00:03:36.650> it<00:03:36.799> does<00:03:37.010> keep

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
having it is the fact that it does keep

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.430 
having it is the fact that it does keep
coming<00:03:37.700> back<00:03:37.880> so<00:03:38.239> for<00:03:38.540> lawns<00:03:38.900> and<00:03:39.110> stuff<00:03:39.290> like

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
coming back so for lawns and stuff like

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.770 
coming back so for lawns and stuff like
that<00:03:39.500> it's<00:03:39.799> great<00:03:40.010> but<00:03:40.850> if<00:03:41.150> you've<00:03:41.329> got<00:03:41.450> trees

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
that it's great but if you've got trees

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.090 
that it's great but if you've got trees
and<00:03:42.079> what<00:03:42.200> have<00:03:42.350> you<00:03:42.380> could<00:03:42.650> be<00:03:42.769> a<00:03:42.799> bit<00:03:42.950> of<00:03:43.040> a

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
and what have you could be a bit of a

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.910 
and what have you could be a bit of a
nightmare<00:03:43.390> alright<00:03:44.390> so<00:03:45.880> get<00:03:46.880> this<00:03:47.030> done<00:03:47.269> first

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
nightmare alright so get this done first

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.170 
nightmare alright so get this done first
now<00:03:48.920> this<00:03:49.070> is<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.250> wetting<00:03:49.579> agent<00:03:49.940> now<00:03:50.030> this

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
now this is the wetting agent now this

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.180 
now this is the wetting agent now this
is<00:03:50.269> an<00:03:50.420> eco-friendly<00:03:50.720> wetting<00:03:51.350> agent<00:03:51.709> organic

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
is an eco-friendly wetting agent organic

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.530 
is an eco-friendly wetting agent organic
one

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
one

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.770 
one
so<00:03:53.189> harmful<00:03:54.189> always<00:03:54.969> be<00:03:55.090> careful<00:03:55.299> which<00:03:55.569> one

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
so harmful always be careful which one

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.190 
so harmful always be careful which one
you<00:03:55.870> buy<00:03:56.019> that<00:03:56.709> goes<00:03:56.950> along<00:03:57.129> way<00:03:57.489> and<00:03:58.200> this

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
you buy that goes along way and this

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.459 
you buy that goes along way and this
will<00:03:59.349> actually<00:03:59.500> acts<00:03:59.920> like<00:04:00.010> a<00:04:00.129> detergent<00:04:01.469> and

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:02.469 
will actually acts like a detergent and

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:05.039 
will actually acts like a detergent and
hold<00:04:03.129> that<00:04:03.250> moisture<00:04:03.849> in<00:04:03.969> now<00:04:04.599> i've<00:04:04.810> put<00:04:05.019> about

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
hold that moisture in now i've put about

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:07.459 
hold that moisture in now i've put about
three<00:04:05.379> handfuls<00:04:05.769> to<00:04:06.010> that<00:04:06.129> stack<00:04:06.489> all<00:04:06.879> right

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:07.469 
three handfuls to that stack all right

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:09.270 
three handfuls to that stack all right
normally<00:04:08.469> you<00:04:08.560> don't<00:04:08.680> even<00:04:08.920> really<00:04:09.010> need

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
normally you don't even really need

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.069 
normally you don't even really need
about<00:04:09.519> a<00:04:09.579> handful<00:04:10.060> now<00:04:10.540> just<00:04:10.840> so<00:04:10.959> it<00:04:11.049> doesn't

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
about a handful now just so it doesn't

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:26.970 
about a handful now just so it doesn't
blow<00:04:11.379> away<00:04:12.569> I'm<00:04:13.569> just<00:04:13.689> going<00:04:13.900> to<00:04:13.959> cover<00:04:14.170> it<00:04:22.860> now

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.450 

all<00:04:27.580> I'm<00:04:27.730> going<00:04:27.910> to<00:04:28.000> do<00:04:28.180> now<00:04:29.010> start<00:04:30.010> stacking

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
all I'm going to do now start stacking

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:40.020 
all I'm going to do now start stacking
on<00:04:30.790> this<00:04:31.090> stuff<00:04:31.920> around<00:04:32.920> it

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:47.040 

just<00:04:40.780> do<00:04:40.870> a<00:04:40.900> little<00:04:41.110> bit

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.589 

now<00:04:47.889> it<00:04:48.159> won't<00:04:48.340> actually<00:04:48.460> as<00:04:48.940> such<00:04:49.180> like

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 
now it won't actually as such like

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:51.540 
now it won't actually as such like
retain<00:04:49.990> the<00:04:50.169> moisture<00:04:50.289> that'll<00:04:51.009> reduce<00:04:51.190> the

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
retain the moisture that'll reduce the

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.930 
retain the moisture that'll reduce the
amount<00:04:51.699> of<00:04:51.849> evaporation<00:04:52.090> in<00:04:52.900> this<00:04:53.349> vicinity

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
amount of evaporation in this vicinity

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.149 
amount of evaporation in this vicinity
basically<00:04:54.940> the<00:04:55.060> root<00:04:55.270> system<00:04:55.449> as<00:04:56.440> a<00:04:56.620> general

00:04:57.149 --> 00:04:57.159 
basically the root system as a general

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:58.860 
basically the root system as a general
rule<00:04:57.190> not<00:04:57.699> always<00:04:57.970> the<00:04:58.270> general<00:04:58.479> will<00:04:58.720> be

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
rule not always the general will be

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.930 
rule not always the general will be
where<00:04:59.199> the<00:04:59.289> trip<00:04:59.500> line<00:04:59.710> is<00:04:59.979> so<00:05:00.400> the<00:05:00.699> edge<00:05:00.819> of

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
where the trip line is so the edge of

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.390 
where the trip line is so the edge of
the<00:05:01.030> tree<00:05:01.240> comes<00:05:01.539> down<00:05:01.750> severe<00:05:02.110> so<00:05:02.440> I'm<00:05:03.220> sure

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
the tree comes down severe so I'm sure

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.129 
the tree comes down severe so I'm sure
the<00:05:03.520> root<00:05:03.699> system<00:05:03.849> goes<00:05:04.479> down<00:05:04.509> a<00:05:04.750> bit<00:05:04.900> further

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139 
the root system goes down a bit further

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.089 
the root system goes down a bit further
but<00:05:06.129> basically<00:05:06.520> you<00:05:06.729> need<00:05:06.879> to<00:05:07.060> feed<00:05:07.300> I<00:05:08.099> don't

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:09.099 
but basically you need to feed I don't

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:10.770 
but basically you need to feed I don't
take<00:05:09.280> the<00:05:09.430> moisture<00:05:09.909> and<00:05:10.060> up<00:05:10.180> into<00:05:10.360> the<00:05:10.539> tree

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
take the moisture and up into the tree

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.830 
take the moisture and up into the tree
itself<00:05:10.979> so<00:05:11.979> like<00:05:12.940> I<00:05:13.060> said<00:05:13.120> I<00:05:13.270> could<00:05:13.479> come<00:05:13.629> out<00:05:13.810> a

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
itself so like I said I could come out a

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.760 
itself so like I said I could come out a
little<00:05:13.990> bit<00:05:14.139> further<00:05:14.879> but

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
little bit further but

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.670 
little bit further but
all<00:05:18.770> right<00:05:18.949> and<00:05:19.280> what<00:05:19.400> I<00:05:19.430> might<00:05:19.610> do<00:05:20.530> it's<00:05:21.530> kind

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
all right and what I might do it's kind

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.710 
all right and what I might do it's kind
of<00:05:21.800> just<00:05:21.979> occurred<00:05:22.340> to<00:05:22.370> me<00:05:22.550> that<00:05:22.850> this<00:05:23.539> is

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
of just occurred to me that this is

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.390 
of just occurred to me that this is
going<00:05:23.840> to<00:05:23.900> take<00:05:24.080> a<00:05:24.139> while<00:05:24.259> and<00:05:24.800> you<00:05:25.310> know<00:05:25.370> I

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
want you to sit there watching me break

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.360 
want you to sit there watching me break
sticks<00:05:27.080> thinking<00:05:27.440> oh<00:05:27.530> my<00:05:27.740> good<00:05:27.979> it's<00:05:28.130> broken

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
sticks thinking oh my good it's broken

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.879 
sticks thinking oh my good it's broken
sticks<00:05:28.759> so<00:05:29.600> what<00:05:29.750> I'll<00:05:29.870> do<00:05:30.050> I'll<00:05:30.320> finish<00:05:30.560> here

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
want to put across about utilizing

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.480 
want to put across about utilizing
facilities<00:05:38.690> in<00:05:39.020> your<00:05:39.199> own<00:05:39.320> backyard<00:05:39.530> like

leaf matter like things he would turn

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:44.879 
leaf matter like things he would turn
into<00:05:43.039> compost<00:05:43.580> and<00:05:43.820> stuff<00:05:44.030> of<00:05:44.150> that<00:05:44.180> sticks
