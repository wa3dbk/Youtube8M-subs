tiny and vigeland specializes in making
those<00:01:37.439> miniature<00:01:37.740> strands<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.850> those<00:01:39.000> little

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
those miniature strands so those little

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.149 
those miniature strands so those little
miniature<00:01:39.479> strands<00:01:39.960> are<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.829> Strand

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.120 
like that works well with the blend that
you<00:02:48.060> have<00:02:48.269> and<00:02:48.900> because<00:02:49.080> it's<00:02:49.440> exposed<00:02:49.890> in<00:02:50.040> the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.890 
you have and because it's exposed in the
design<00:02:50.430> here<00:02:50.700> that's<00:02:50.940> why<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.120> chose<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.480> 49

together<00:03:21.660> or<00:03:21.930> just<00:03:22.320> so<00:03:22.709> you<00:03:22.769> know<00:03:22.829> a<00:03:22.920> straight

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
together or just so you know a straight

together or just so you know a straight
stringing<00:03:23.610> project<00:03:23.970> like<00:03:24.090> this<00:03:24.299> 19<00:03:24.780> is<00:03:24.930> a

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
stringing project like this 19 is a

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.630 
stringing project like this 19 is a
really<00:03:25.350> great<00:03:25.560> place<00:03:25.860> to<00:03:26.040> start<00:03:26.310> if<00:03:26.549> you're

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
really great place to start if you're

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.520 
really great place to start if you're
not<00:03:26.820> sure<00:03:27.030> if<00:03:27.299> you<00:03:27.930> don't<00:03:28.110> know<00:03:28.230> how<00:03:28.410> much

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
not sure if you don't know how much

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.350 
not sure if you don't know how much
flexibility<00:03:29.070> you<00:03:29.220> need<00:03:29.250> or<00:03:29.850> you<00:03:30.060> know<00:03:30.180> that

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
flexibility you need or you know that

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.759 
flexibility you need or you know that
you're<00:03:30.450> not<00:03:30.570> going<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.900> require<00:03:31.140> you<00:03:31.650> know<00:03:31.680> a

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
you're not going to require you know a

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.770 
you're not going to require you know a
very<00:03:32.130> thread<00:03:32.400> like<00:03:32.579> drape<00:03:32.820> this<00:03:33.299> has<00:03:33.510> a<00:03:33.540> little

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
very thread like drape this has a little

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.990 
very thread like drape this has a little
bit<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:33.959> body<00:03:34.110> to<00:03:34.410> it<00:03:34.530> it's<00:03:34.709> a<00:03:34.799> heavy<00:03:34.950> piece<00:03:35.250> and

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
bit of body to it it's a heavy piece and

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.090 
bit of body to it it's a heavy piece and
it<00:03:36.180> just<00:03:36.390> works<00:03:36.570> just<00:03:37.110> kind<00:03:37.320> of<00:03:37.350> my<00:03:37.470> go-to<00:03:37.680> wire

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
it just works just kind of my go-to wire

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.860 
it just works just kind of my go-to wire
like<00:03:38.370> I<00:03:38.489> use<00:03:38.670> that<00:03:38.850> the<00:03:38.970> most<00:03:39.239> of<00:03:39.420> it<00:03:39.510> it's<00:03:39.780> a

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
like I use that the most of it it's a

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.960 
like I use that the most of it it's a
great<00:03:39.989> go-to<00:03:40.290> yeah<00:03:40.829> and<00:03:41.160> this<00:03:41.310> piece<00:03:41.579> also<00:03:41.940> I

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
great go-to yeah and this piece also I

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.180 
great go-to yeah and this piece also I
made<00:03:42.209> with<00:03:42.390> ion<00:03:42.720> stream<00:03:42.989> look<00:03:43.290> at<00:03:43.320> this<00:03:43.920> is<00:03:44.040> the

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
made with ion stream look at this is the

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.069 
made with ion stream look at this is the
Watusi<00:03:44.400> style<00:03:45.000> that<00:03:45.239> Wyatt<00:03:45.540> way<00:03:45.690> my<00:03:45.930> good

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
Watusi style that Wyatt way my good

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.170 
Watusi style that Wyatt way my good
palate<00:03:46.380> bead<00:03:46.530> alignment<00:03:46.950> ah<00:03:47.010> I'm<00:03:47.370> great

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
palate bead alignment ah I'm great

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.080 
palate bead alignment ah I'm great
created<00:03:48.989> and<00:03:49.230> I<00:03:49.590> like<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.220> idea<00:03:50.519> of<00:03:50.579> using<00:03:50.850> it

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
created and I like the idea of using it

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.640 
created and I like the idea of using it
with<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.269> crystals<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:52.019> you<00:03:52.230> could<00:03:52.410> do<00:03:52.530> this

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
with the crystals and you could do this

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.229 
with the crystals and you could do this
with<00:03:52.859> any<00:03:53.040> of<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.430> constructions<00:03:53.940> of<00:03:54.090> where

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
with any of the constructions of where

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.940 
with any of the constructions of where
but<00:03:54.450> I<00:03:54.510> use<00:03:54.660> 19<00:03:55.109> for<00:03:55.290> that<00:03:55.410> too<00:03:55.590> so<00:03:55.799> it<00:03:55.859> would

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
but I use 19 for that too so it would

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.310 
but I use 19 for that too so it would
have<00:03:56.070> a<00:03:56.100> little<00:03:56.310> bit<00:03:56.489> more<00:03:56.670> body<00:03:57.359> I<00:03:57.840> love<00:03:58.109> that

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
have a little bit more body I love that

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.530 
have a little bit more body I love that
in<00:03:58.470> its<00:03:58.680> initial<00:03:58.980> but<00:03:59.970> it<00:04:00.060> doesn't<00:04:00.390> look

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
in its initial but it doesn't look

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.759 
in its initial but it doesn't look
simple<00:04:00.959> like<00:04:01.230> when<00:04:01.380> you<00:04:01.470> wear<00:04:01.620> it<00:04:01.650> it<00:04:01.709> looks

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
simple like when you wear it it looks

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.650 
simple like when you wear it it looks
really<00:04:02.100> elegant<00:04:02.130> it's<00:04:02.730> really<00:04:03.000> thanks<00:04:03.450> Wyatt

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
really elegant it's really thanks Wyatt

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.460 
really elegant it's really thanks Wyatt
Ming<00:04:04.170> and<00:04:04.500> then<00:04:05.010> beadalon<00:04:05.820> 7<00:04:06.239> is<00:04:06.420> what<00:04:07.200> I<00:04:07.230> use

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
Ming and then beadalon 7 is what I use

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.990 
Ming and then beadalon 7 is what I use
to<00:04:07.500> create<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:08.070> multi<00:04:08.370> strand<00:04:08.640> seed<00:04:08.850> bead

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
to create the multi strand seed bead

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.060 
to create the multi strand seed bead
necklace<00:04:09.359> so<00:04:09.780> this<00:04:09.959> is<00:04:10.079> a<00:04:10.109> piece<00:04:10.380> I<00:04:10.590> knew<00:04:10.859> that

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
necklace so this is a piece I knew that

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.520 
necklace so this is a piece I knew that
I've<00:04:11.190> it's<00:04:11.340> lightweight<00:04:11.549> I<00:04:12.120> used<00:04:12.530> inexpensive

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
I've it's lightweight I used inexpensive

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.080 
I've it's lightweight I used inexpensive
beads<00:04:13.739> and<00:04:14.040> I<00:04:14.160> might<00:04:14.370> be<00:04:14.519> making<00:04:14.640> a<00:04:14.880> ton<00:04:15.060> of

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
beads and I might be making a ton of

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.759 
beads and I might be making a ton of
these<00:04:15.239> necklaces<00:04:15.480> for<00:04:15.900> Christmas<00:04:16.229> gifts<00:04:16.260> or

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
these necklaces for Christmas gifts or

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.289 
these necklaces for Christmas gifts or
bridesmaids<00:04:17.160> or<00:04:17.579> something<00:04:17.850> like<00:04:17.940> that<00:04:18.150> where

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
bridesmaids or something like that where

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.659 
bridesmaids or something like that where
I<00:04:18.329> really<00:04:18.600> need<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:18.900> look<00:04:19.680> at<00:04:19.829> my<00:04:19.919> cost<00:04:20.160> right

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
I really need to look at my cost right

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.520 
I really need to look at my cost right
so<00:04:20.910> seven<00:04:21.239> strand<00:04:21.510> it's<00:04:21.630> economical

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
so seven strand it's economical

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.810 
so seven strand it's economical
it's<00:04:22.650> I'm<00:04:22.889> still<00:04:23.370> going<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:23.639> have<00:04:23.730> that

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
it's I'm still going to have that

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.060 
it's I'm still going to have that
strength<00:04:24.180> of<00:04:24.480> steel<00:04:24.780> flexibility<00:04:25.740> of<00:04:25.830> thread

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
strength of steel flexibility of thread

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.370 
strength of steel flexibility of thread
it's<00:04:26.760> more<00:04:27.120> flexible<00:04:27.300> than<00:04:27.630> Tiger<00:04:27.960> tales<00:04:28.139> day

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
it's more flexible than Tiger tales day

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.180 
it's more flexible than Tiger tales day
huh

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
huh

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.670 
huh
so<00:04:29.400> in<00:04:29.550> seven<00:04:30.150> strands<00:04:30.420> and<00:04:30.660> that<00:04:30.810> is<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.230> very

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
so in seven strands and that is the very

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.080 
so in seven strands and that is the very
first<00:04:31.950> people<00:04:32.340> in<00:04:32.400> front<00:04:32.580> of<00:04:32.639> with<00:04:32.820> seven

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
first people in front of with seven

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.210 
first people in front of with seven
strand<00:04:33.330> really<00:04:33.960> yeah<00:04:34.260> oh<00:04:34.410> that's<00:04:34.889> good<00:04:35.130> to

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
strand really yeah oh that's good to

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.360 
strand really yeah oh that's good to
know

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
know

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.800 
know
so<00:04:35.850> there<00:04:36.090> are<00:04:36.180> a<00:04:36.210> lot<00:04:36.360> of<00:04:36.389> different

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
so there are a lot of different

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.480 
so there are a lot of different
constructions<00:04:37.650> I<00:04:37.889> know<00:04:37.950> that's<00:04:38.190> a<00:04:38.250> lot<00:04:38.370> of

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
constructions I know that's a lot of

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.040 
constructions I know that's a lot of
numbers<00:04:38.820> but<00:04:39.060> if<00:04:39.150> you<00:04:39.240> can<00:04:39.360> just<00:04:39.540> keep<00:04:39.690> in<00:04:39.840> mind

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
numbers but if you can just keep in mind

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.870 
numbers but if you can just keep in mind
the<00:04:40.290> flexibility<00:04:40.860> that's<00:04:41.010> the<00:04:41.220> main<00:04:41.370> thing

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
the flexibility that's the main thing

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.760 
the flexibility that's the main thing
but<00:04:42.480> you<00:04:42.810> also<00:04:42.960> want<00:04:43.080> to<00:04:43.230> pay<00:04:43.380> attention<00:04:43.410> to

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
but you also want to pay attention to

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.890 
but you also want to pay attention to
the<00:04:43.950> whole<00:04:44.130> size<00:04:44.400> of<00:04:44.550> your<00:04:44.669> beads<00:04:44.910> so<00:04:45.540> always

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
the whole size of your beads so always

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.020 
the whole size of your beads so always
be<00:04:46.050> is<00:04:46.169> the<00:04:46.410> largest<00:04:46.770> diameter<00:04:47.250> of<00:04:47.550> wire<00:04:47.730> that

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
be is the largest diameter of wire that

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.450 
be is the largest diameter of wire that
passes<00:04:48.419> through<00:04:48.540> the<00:04:48.630> smallest<00:04:49.050> pull<00:04:49.590> size<00:04:49.889> in

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
passes through the smallest pull size in

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.010 
passes through the smallest pull size in
your<00:04:50.639> design<00:04:50.910> and<00:04:51.180> that's<00:04:51.600> to<00:04:51.780> prevent

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
your design and that's to prevent

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.840 
your design and that's to prevent
abrasion<00:04:52.230> on<00:04:52.590> the<00:04:52.680> wire<00:04:52.860> because<00:04:53.310> abrasion<00:04:53.730> is

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
abrasion on the wire because abrasion is

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.820 
abrasion on the wire because abrasion is
the<00:04:53.970> number<00:04:54.270> one<00:04:54.450> enemy<00:04:55.110> you<00:04:55.470> don't<00:04:55.500> want<00:04:55.770> to

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
the number one enemy you don't want to

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.010 
the number one enemy you don't want to
have<00:04:55.950> beads<00:04:56.460> that<00:04:56.610> are<00:04:56.669> twisting<00:04:57.570> around<00:04:57.690> on

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
have beads that are twisting around on

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.720 
have beads that are twisting around on
the<00:04:58.110> wire<00:04:58.260> you<00:04:58.440> want<00:04:58.530> it<00:04:58.680> to<00:04:58.770> be<00:04:58.919> just

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
the wire you want it to be just

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.230 
the wire you want it to be just
comfortably<00:05:00.650> snug<00:05:01.650> right<00:05:02.550> good<00:05:02.820> point

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
comfortably snug right good point

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.640 
comfortably snug right good point
yeah<00:05:03.419> because<00:05:03.630> sometimes<00:05:03.990> if<00:05:04.169> the<00:05:04.290> beads<00:05:04.470> are

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
yeah because sometimes if the beads are

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.159 
yeah because sometimes if the beads are
sliding<00:05:05.040> too<00:05:05.430> that's<00:05:06.120> gonna<00:05:06.360> wear<00:05:06.630> over<00:05:06.930> time

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
sliding too that's gonna wear over time

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.200 
sliding too that's gonna wear over time
and<00:05:07.530> that's<00:05:07.710> gonna<00:05:07.860> cut<00:05:08.190> right<00:05:08.220> into<00:05:08.669> your<00:05:08.790> you

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
and that's gonna cut right into your you

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.580 
and that's gonna cut right into your you
know<00:05:09.300> can<00:05:09.510> cut<00:05:09.720> into<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.020> wire<00:05:10.200> so<00:05:10.380> you<00:05:10.440> don't

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
know can cut into the wire so you don't

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:11.990 
know can cut into the wire so you don't
want<00:05:10.710> that<00:05:10.800> to<00:05:10.890> happen<00:05:10.980> everybody<00:05:11.370> very<00:05:11.669> sad

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
want that to happen everybody very sad

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.580 
want that to happen everybody very sad
beads<00:05:12.360> the<00:05:12.510> in-floor<00:05:12.780> so<00:05:13.230> you<00:05:13.320> want<00:05:13.440> to<00:05:13.500> use

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
beads the in-floor so you want to use

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.560 
beads the in-floor so you want to use
spacer<00:05:14.100> beads<00:05:14.280> you<00:05:14.580> know<00:05:14.669> like<00:05:14.880> doing<00:05:15.270> this

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
spacer beads you know like doing this

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:16.909 
spacer beads you know like doing this
larger<00:05:15.930> piece<00:05:16.110> you<00:05:16.350> know<00:05:16.470> I<00:05:16.500> used<00:05:16.710> some

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
larger piece you know I used some

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.130 
larger piece you know I used some
smaller<00:05:17.220> beads<00:05:17.460> too<00:05:17.729> and<00:05:17.940> that<00:05:18.030> helps<00:05:18.419> kind<00:05:19.020> of

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
smaller beads too and that helps kind of

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.300 
smaller beads too and that helps kind of
bring<00:05:19.410> that<00:05:19.740> wire<00:05:21.080> maximize<00:05:22.080> the<00:05:22.860> space<00:05:23.070> that

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
bring that wire maximize the space that

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.920 
bring that wire maximize the space that
the<00:05:23.370> bead<00:05:23.520> is<00:05:23.669> easy<00:05:23.820> on<00:05:24.000> the<00:05:24.090> wire<00:05:24.240> -<00:05:24.479> oh<00:05:24.660> that's

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
the bead is easy on the wire - oh that's

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.409 
the bead is easy on the wire - oh that's
a<00:05:25.050> good<00:05:25.200> designer<00:05:25.500> tip<00:05:25.740> hey<00:05:26.190> thanks<00:05:26.490> I<00:05:26.940> like<00:05:27.300> to
