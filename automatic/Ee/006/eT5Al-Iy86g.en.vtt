 way from the down syndrome 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.199

 absolute junior and first-time titles 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.269
 in fact besides the many confirmations not 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.609
 the first ones were missing 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.319
 experience in agonism other note 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.599
 the presence of the number one is important 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.189
 federal marco borzacchini intervened in 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.720
 lucera in the company of the president of 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:58.909
 fip italian swimming federation 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.009
 paralympic roberto valenti we have 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:03.709
 more and more participating companies that 

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:05.840
 come from normal this is a 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.579
 very important fact because it shows 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.370
 that slowly ours too 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:13.750
 movement is integrating into the name 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.490
 of sport in the name of the new who 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.780
 and I think it's beyond the results 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:21.640
 though striking if a very positive note 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.230
 both for today and for the future because 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.850
 means that more and more guys are with 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.890
 intellectual discomfort will have 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.450
 the opportunity to really get closer to 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.040
 that splendid discipline that swimming 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.900
 the protocol between the two 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.460
 federations about the inclusion in the 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.300
 film activity of the athletes of interest 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.280
 national 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.840
 pursuing the goal of a single e 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.610
 unique Paralympic swimming comes 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.620
 so summarized by values ​​is so 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.750
 let's say that apart from marco 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.700
 we have always said even in times not 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.280
 suspicions that the Paralympic swimming and one 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.080
 regardless of disability 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.520
 so let's say the possibility is welcome 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.800
 to work together as a federation 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.419
 God forbid, and then also by will 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.669
 international we know the already in the 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.440
 international protocol the inconvenience 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.410
 intellectual at a high level then ds 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.630
 14 are a worthy part in their own right 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.130
 the Paralympic program was spoken of 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.630
 many years ago in the fact of inserting 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.220
 let's say kids with deficits 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.720
 intellectual within the competitions 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:15.010
 we have seen that this is Paralympic 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:17.260
 It was a very important move was 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.600
 did this was done well because it is 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.919
 right that it should be so with time 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.720
 with international furnishings they make 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.270
 fright then we say my function 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.950
 is to mark is meanwhile to say that 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.140
 the new one only mine in particular 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.840
 is to succeed through marco 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.340
 through the basin of the great gods 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.800
 great moons of physics and 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.990
 great talent of the federation a 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.210
 also find great champions 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.790
 we take over with our experience 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.710
 trying to refine what it is 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.550
 the highest level and to seek to 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.960
 find samples 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.790
 in view of bringing more and more 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.320
 obviously disabled kids who do n't 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.040
 I don't think you misunderstand what 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.510
 I said 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.070
 thinking about the fact that we think about 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.660
 samples in the next service the 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:00.000
 summary of the other two days of competitions 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.000
 also sites of new Italian records
