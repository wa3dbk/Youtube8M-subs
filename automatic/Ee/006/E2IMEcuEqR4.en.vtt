knew ba he's trying to TV except then

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.820 
knew ba he's trying to TV except then
who<00:01:02.640> go<00:01:02.850> for<00:01:03.059> your<00:01:03.210> base<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.840> then<00:01:04.409> all<00:01:04.680> your

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
who go for your base and then all your

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.100 
who go for your base and then all your
bones<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.400> then<00:01:05.760> everything<00:01:06.119> will<00:01:06.390> exploded

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
bones and then everything will exploded

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.980 
bones and then everything will exploded
his<00:01:07.290> troops<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.920> then<00:01:08.070> propose<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.210> his

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
his troops and then propose that his

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.410 
his troops and then propose that his
troops<00:01:10.350> today<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.250> then<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.700> motors<00:01:12.180> will

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
troops today and then the motors will

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.520 
troops today and then the motors will
start<00:01:13.369> shooting<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:15.210> think<00:01:15.869> sometimes<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
start shooting and I think sometimes the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.800 
start shooting and I think sometimes the
cannon<00:01:16.950> whoo-hoo<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.850> do<00:01:18.000> reach<00:01:18.299> as<00:01:18.600> well

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
cannon whoo-hoo can and do reach as well

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.330 
cannon whoo-hoo can and do reach as well
but<00:01:19.650> yet<00:01:21.320> if<00:01:22.320> he<00:01:22.439> puts<00:01:22.650> any<00:01:22.830> air<00:01:23.040> troops

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
but yet if he puts any air troops

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.910 
but yet if he puts any air troops
there's<00:01:23.670> air<00:01:24.360> defenses<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.290> carbon

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
there's air defenses of the carbon

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.960 
there's air defenses of the carbon
bubble<00:01:26.100> area<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.360> Freitag<00:01:28.080> levels<00:01:28.970> and

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
bubble area and just Freitag levels and

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.960 
bubble area and just Freitag levels and
so<00:01:30.869> if<00:01:31.470> he<00:01:31.650> made<00:01:31.829> slowly<00:01:32.189> strips<00:01:32.640> they<00:01:32.820> all

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
so if he made slowly strips they all

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.819 
so if he made slowly strips they all
basically<00:01:33.210> gonna<00:01:33.720> die<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.320> then<00:01:34.500> that's<00:01:34.740> a

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
basically gonna die and then that's a

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.410 
basically gonna die and then that's a
waste<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.220> troops<00:01:35.549> for<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.880> person<00:01:36.390> that
