this<00:02:28.500> is<00:02:28.590> really<00:02:28.800> solid<00:02:29.160> card<00:02:29.340> three<00:02:30.300> shiny

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
this is really solid card three shiny

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.630 
this is really solid card three shiny
balls<00:02:30.810> obviously<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.560> go<00:02:31.680> with<00:02:31.890> your<00:02:32.070> other

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
balls obviously to go with your other

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.330 
balls obviously to go with your other
agents<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:33.620> 2nd<00:02:34.620> earth<00:02:34.710> makes<00:02:34.980> all<00:02:35.220> the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
agents so 2nd earth makes all the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.480 
agents so 2nd earth makes all the
difference<00:02:36.230> speeds<00:02:37.230> up<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.500> deck<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.680> lot<00:02:37.980> 1

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
difference speeds up the deck a lot 1

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.250 
difference speeds up the deck a lot 1
earth<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:38.940> Venus<00:02:39.360> makes<00:02:39.570> to<00:02:39.780> ayperi<00:02:40.110> ons

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
earth and to Venus makes to ayperi ons

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.560 
earth and to Venus makes to ayperi ons
live<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.770> one<00:02:41.010> earth<00:02:41.160> is<00:02:41.310> too<00:02:41.490> slow<00:02:41.730> wit<00:02:42.000> with

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
live and one earth is too slow wit with

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.110 
live and one earth is too slow wit with
two<00:02:42.810> earths<00:02:43.020> I<00:02:43.410> think<00:02:43.770> the<00:02:43.950> deck<00:02:44.160> is<00:02:44.400> like<00:02:44.640> it

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
two earths I think the deck is like it

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.520 
two earths I think the deck is like it
makes<00:02:45.270> it<00:02:45.390> deck<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.540> lot<00:02:45.750> more<00:02:45.870> playable<00:02:46.170> so

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
makes it deck a lot more playable so

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.670 
makes it deck a lot more playable so
yeah<00:02:47.360> yeah<00:02:48.360> I<00:02:48.390> pirie<00:02:48.840> on<00:02:49.020> pretty<00:02:49.290> good<00:02:49.440> card

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680

the<00:02:53.430> Chrystia<00:02:53.790> it's<00:02:54.150> it's<00:02:54.510> ok<00:02:54.990> but<00:02:55.350> a<00:02:55.560> lot<00:02:55.740> of

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
the Chrystia it's it's ok but a lot of

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.410 
the Chrystia it's it's ok but a lot of
the<00:02:55.920> time<00:02:56.100> it's<00:02:56.250> not<00:02:56.400> live<00:02:56.640> that's<00:02:57.330> the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
the time it's not live that's the

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.380

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
think it's a one of so that when you

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.600 
think it's a one of so that when you
drop<00:03:02.100> it<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.370> win<00:03:02.550> so<00:03:03.650> um<00:03:04.650> background<00:03:05.490> removal

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
drop it you win so um background removal

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.160 
drop it you win so um background removal
