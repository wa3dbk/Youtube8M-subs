I<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.730> had<00:01:00.090> tried<00:01:00.329> him<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> striker<00:01:00.960> position

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
I I had tried him in a striker position

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.049 
I I had tried him in a striker position
while<00:01:01.559> his<00:01:01.649> natural<00:01:01.980> position<00:01:02.010> died<00:01:02.430> his<00:01:02.760> info

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
while his natural position died his info

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.929 
while his natural position died his info
came<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:04.049> as<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.589> striker<00:01:04.979> his<00:01:05.549> dribbling

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.030 
came in so as a striker his dribbling
was<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.479> effective<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.080> matches<00:01:07.560> i<00:01:07.590> think

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040

that<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.549> my<00:01:08.760> main<00:01:09.000> well<00:01:09.479> that's<00:01:09.720> his<00:01:09.900> main

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
that is my main well that's his main

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.719 
that is my main well that's his main
selling<00:01:10.439> point<00:01:10.650> as<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> silver<00:01:11.220> player<00:01:11.460> and

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
selling point as a silver player and

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.289 
selling point as a silver player and
that<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.270> my<00:01:12.450> favorite<00:01:12.659> attribute<00:01:13.350> for<00:01:13.590> him<00:01:13.770> so

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
that is my favorite attribute for him so

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.749 
that is my favorite attribute for him so
shooting<00:01:15.299> outside<00:01:15.540> 25<00:01:16.259> yards<00:01:16.650> ain't<00:01:17.400> gonna<00:01:17.549> go

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
shooting outside 25 yards ain't gonna go

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.359 
shooting outside 25 yards ain't gonna go
in<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.390> guy<00:01:18.600> shot<00:01:18.930> power<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.409> quite<00:01:19.740> weak<00:01:20.040> so

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
in this guy shot power is quite weak so

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.830 
in this guy shot power is quite weak so
you're<00:01:20.580> gonna<00:01:20.700> see<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.299> video<00:01:21.570> and

you're gonna see that in the video and

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.530 
you're gonna see that in the video and
also<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.770> kind<00:01:22.830> can<00:01:23.189> miss<00:01:23.759> cities<00:01:24.210> because

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
also this kind can miss cities because

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.929 
also this kind can miss cities because
his<00:01:24.689> finishing<00:01:25.020> isn't<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.530> greatest<00:01:25.729> bited<00:01:26.729> I

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.300 
plus side because he did score me most
of<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.479> goals<00:01:30.720> but<00:01:31.259> he<00:01:31.409> isn't<00:01:31.680> exactly<00:01:32.070> one

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
of the goals but he isn't exactly one

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.950 
of the goals but he isn't exactly one
hundred<00:01:32.460> percent<00:01:32.670> reliable<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.720> penalty

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
hundred percent reliable in the penalty

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.870 
hundred percent reliable in the penalty
area<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.500> keep<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.860> mind<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.610> will<00:01:35.729> see<00:01:35.850> a

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
area so keep that in mind you will see a

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.760 
area so keep that in mind you will see a
couple<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.270> cities<00:01:36.509> which<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.960> expected<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.619> go

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
couple of cities which I expected to go

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.609 
couple of cities which I expected to go
in<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.100> did<00:01:38.729> not<00:01:39.060> he<00:01:39.869> can<00:01:39.900> get<00:01:40.259> out<00:01:40.320> type

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
in and did not he can get out type

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.289

positions<00:01:41.100> Frank's<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.520> dribbling<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.090> you'll

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
positions Frank's is dribbling so you'll

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.760 
positions Frank's is dribbling so you'll
see<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.540> couple<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.960> positions<00:01:43.200> where<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.619> just

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
see a couple of positions where you just

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.920 
see a couple of positions where you just
dribbles<00:01:44.130> past<00:01:44.340> defenders<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.000> sometimes

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
dribbles past defenders and sometimes

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.170
