they're not too familiar with but you

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.020 
they're not too familiar with but you
just<00:01:05.360> need<00:01:05.510> to<00:01:05.659> look<00:01:05.780> at<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.170> nutritional

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
just need to look at the nutritional

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.580 
just need to look at the nutritional
fact<00:01:08.030> of<00:01:08.659> muscles<00:01:09.200> and<00:01:09.440> you<00:01:09.500> can<00:01:09.680> see<00:01:09.890> just<00:01:10.130> how

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
fact of muscles and you can see just how

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.230 
fact of muscles and you can see just how
complex<00:01:12.590> they<00:01:12.830> are<00:01:12.950> in<00:01:13.159> all<00:01:13.369> of<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.729> minerals

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
complex they are in all of the minerals

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.960 
complex they are in all of the minerals
zinc<00:01:15.020> magnesium<00:01:15.409> or<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:16.220> essential<00:01:16.759> and

zinc magnesium or the essential and

zinc magnesium or the essential and
electrolyte<00:01:18.250> minerals<00:01:19.390> that<00:01:20.390> we<00:01:20.540> need

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
electrolyte minerals that we need

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.020 
electrolyte minerals that we need
regardless<00:01:21.770> whether<00:01:22.040> we're<00:01:22.250> training<00:01:22.520> or<00:01:22.790> not

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
regardless whether we're training or not

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.300 
regardless whether we're training or not
just<00:01:23.690> to<00:01:23.810> keep<00:01:23.960> them<00:01:24.200> topped<00:01:24.830> up<00:01:24.950> within<00:01:25.159> our

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
just to keep them topped up within our

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.100 
just to keep them topped up within our
bodies<00:01:25.580> so<00:01:25.820> that's<00:01:26.390> another<00:01:26.600> reason<00:01:26.750> why<00:01:26.960> it's

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
bodies so that's another reason why it's

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.520 
bodies so that's another reason why it's
great<00:01:27.320> to<00:01:27.530> vary<00:01:28.460> your<00:01:28.759> protein<00:01:29.390> sources<00:01:29.750> and

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
great to vary your protein sources and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.800 
great to vary your protein sources and
if<00:01:31.160> the<00:01:31.340> nutritional<00:01:31.880> facts<00:01:32.090> aren't<00:01:32.509> enough

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
if the nutritional facts aren't enough

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.840 
if the nutritional facts aren't enough
to<00:01:33.020> get<00:01:33.170> you<00:01:33.320> to<00:01:33.440> try<00:01:33.649> these<00:01:33.710> muscles<00:01:34.250> just

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
to get you to try these muscles just

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.270 
to get you to try these muscles just
have<00:01:35.030> to<00:01:35.179> look<00:01:35.330> at<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.750> qualities<00:01:36.440> of<00:01:36.679> other

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
have to look at the qualities of other

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.300 
have to look at the qualities of other
similar<00:01:37.640> foods<00:01:37.880> like<00:01:38.390> oysters<00:01:39.259> high<00:01:39.979> in<00:01:40.280> zinc

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
similar foods like oysters high in zinc

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.550 
similar foods like oysters high in zinc
which<00:01:41.270> is<00:01:41.450> why<00:01:41.630> they<00:01:41.810> known<00:01:41.990> as<00:01:42.020> an

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
which is why they known as an

which is why they known as an
aphrodisiac

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
aphrodisiac

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.309 
aphrodisiac
it's<00:01:43.640> that<00:01:43.880> zinc<00:01:44.240> that<00:01:44.509> gets<00:01:44.869> around<00:01:45.110> to

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
it's that zinc that gets around to

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:47.169 
it's that zinc that gets around to
certain<00:01:45.590> parts<00:01:45.830> of<00:01:45.920> your<00:01:46.039> body<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.610> gets<00:01:47.000> you

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
certain parts of your body and gets you

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.630 
certain parts of your body and gets you
fired<00:01:47.450> up<00:01:47.659> so<00:01:48.140> a<00:01:48.440> nice<00:01:48.830> batch<00:01:49.039> of<00:01:49.220> these<00:01:49.369> on<00:01:49.580> a

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
fired up so a nice batch of these on a

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.040 
fired up so a nice batch of these on a
first<00:01:49.880> date<00:01:50.090> it's<00:01:50.270> going<00:01:50.420> to<00:01:50.479> go<00:01:50.600> down<00:01:50.780> much

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
first date it's going to go down much

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.590 
first date it's going to go down much
better<00:01:51.319> than<00:01:51.560> usual<00:01:52.220> chicken<00:01:52.640> or<00:01:52.789> turkey<00:01:53.240> or

dish<00:02:25.680> but<00:02:25.920> like<00:02:26.069> I<00:02:26.189> said<00:02:26.250> this<00:02:26.549> is<00:02:26.790> kind<00:02:27.239> of<00:02:27.359> a

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
dish but like I said this is kind of a

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.000 
dish but like I said this is kind of a
bit<00:02:27.689> of<00:02:27.719> a<00:02:27.840> break<00:02:28.049> from<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.260> norm<00:02:28.349> it's<00:02:28.920> a

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
bit of a break from the norm it's a

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.440 
bit of a break from the norm it's a
healthier<00:02:29.489> treatment<00:02:29.969> other<00:02:30.060> than<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.299> ones

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
healthier treatment other than the ones

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.380 

we're<00:05:06.720> gonna<00:05:06.870> save<00:05:07.110> the<00:05:07.440> seaweed<00:05:08.400> salad<00:05:08.880> to<00:05:09.240> go

we're gonna save the seaweed salad to go
on<00:05:09.420> top

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
on top

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.710 
on top
decoration<00:05:11.340> plus<00:05:11.580> to<00:05:11.730> add<00:05:11.850> to<00:05:12.060> that<00:05:12.180> taste<00:05:12.450> an

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
has been preheated to 375 to is found

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.180 
has been preheated to 375 to is found
height<00:05:21.420> we're<00:05:22.410> gonna<00:05:22.530> put<00:05:22.710> these<00:05:22.800> in<00:05:23.040> for

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
height we're gonna put these in for

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.880 
height we're gonna put these in for
about<00:05:23.340> 1518<00:05:24.210> minutes<00:05:25.020> until<00:05:25.560> it<00:05:25.650> just<00:05:25.800> starts

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
to harden on the top so keep an eye

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:45.830 
to harden on the top so keep an eye
after<00:05:28.620> about<00:05:29.040> 12<00:05:29.370> minutes
