00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hi today i want to be a book with you 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.299
 and that is today a wall 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.980
 from glass of marique mesh 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.900
 marique maas name comes to you 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.370
 probably not care known for and 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.019
 that's because it's a pseudonym of 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.650
 esther you probably do 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.580
 knows 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.470
 Esther mainly prescribes 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.900
 psychological vibrators and her last 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.279
 who appeared is backlight that I am in 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.850
 sleeper version that I have on 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.019
 holiday read and this is really very 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.830
 impressive is about a young girl 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.539
 that in her you already in her youth something 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.489
 has problems and does not get well 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.170
 raised and therefore adult 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.960
 life gets quite a few problems 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.670
 and I was really impressed 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.610
 the impression base I have on vacation too 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.170
 take two or three days read out 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.610
 but good marieke maas is one 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.980
 pseudonym of esther Vroegh and that is 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.010
 because they are a total with glass walls 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.930
 new but for her new genre 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.879
 taps is in fact the Dutch 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.100
 answer to fifty shades of gray and that 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.600
 is a story that you are already on 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.949
 I miss lipgloss overlook I come 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.320
 I also discussed it once or mine 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.760
 site what I have about 50 shades of gray for all 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.159
 said was that I am immersive in the story 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.020
 but did not really thought much content 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.369
 and that the romantic scenes really 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.060
 were monotonous and I found the 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.220
 main character rather stupid and 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.259
 she could really be a bit stupid and naive about it 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.729
 and that bothered me and I am after one and a half 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.750
 book stopped because I just don't 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.580
 more could 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.780
 and what struck me very much at fifty 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.060
 shades of gray was the real story 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.159
 one in love with each other 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.600
 now there are scenes of glass and scenes 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.490
 that is an answer to fifty shades 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.100
 gray and frankly I think this is one 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.409
 much stronger story and stronger book it 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.270
 story is about nadine nadine is one 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.590
 mature woman and she is actually human 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.759
 from catering company 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.360
 and she meets Daniel at a fair 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.159
 Holland and immediately love it 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.750
 him and yes that sometimes happens to you 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.770
 totally a crash or someone without 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.869
 that you know someone is complete 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.250
 Attracted to him and twice she 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.840
 met Daniel takes her with her 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.700
 eating out so he also sees something 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.649
 its very exciting they are going to eat at it 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.020
 okura and fun I find it a 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.549
 story of the whole book is that you whole 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.920
 many places can recognize it 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.509
 just plays in the Netherlands and that too 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.009
 it is more realistic after that first 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.899
 to that of course a bit 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.790
 unsure of going me texting and looking for you 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.860
 contact but we go 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.850
 good times and of course that happens 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.470
 And what then follows is that you actually have it 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.790
 story follows of two people who go 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.470
 dating each other very much 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.240
 but that are very different 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.790
 danios the owner of one 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.980
 from a major Dutch design brand and 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.780
 he smelly rich and he has a whole 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.580
 other lifestyle than after that but also 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.200
 in other hands past another 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.820
 had childhood that made it different in it 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.870
 life stands and serving is very different 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.880
 used to things does not live in either 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.250
 Amsterdam lives in I think she lives 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.140
 in Breda if I'm right 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.490
 somewhere in Brabant in this case so one 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.770
 very different but that attracts them 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.209
 very much towards each other and like 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.280
 also in 50 shades of gray you have in this 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.750
 also tell the romantic scenes 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.459
 exciting scenes 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.900
 what i like about this book is that they 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.190
 not all to be themselves they are 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.390
 actually very very different there 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.450
 very different things happen 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.950
 no whips and tools arrive 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.750
 Be careful of it yourself because it is 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.500
 just really more realistic is just 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.209
 more 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.340
 it really looks like something 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.570
 one of us could happen to you, you know 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.030
 I you meet someone and you 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.620
 someone really likes it and yes 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.840
 happens naturally a lot in days 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.430
 life with people and I like it 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.650
 that you can relate yourself to it 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.570
 just tell the uncertainty of it 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.610
 dating and someone like you doin 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.180
 texting and you can feel that very much in this 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.340
 story 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.190
 so I find scenes surprisingly every one 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.900
 just explicitly but that is 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.850
 with fifty shades of gray I too think so 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.580
 they are in glass walls and better defined 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.900
 they regularly come to me what i am 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.390
 is nice that the story is not 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.190
 depends on each of those scenes so it 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.080
 is not that you work scene after scene 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.150
 so really a story is really about 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.500
 afterwards with her catering company too 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.570
 A little mess with her 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.280
 catering company because she likes daniel 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.690
 and daniel does quite a lot of it 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.250
 time up and then she must go 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.690
 account to a colleague and after 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.799
 all very awkward of course 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.900
 I really have the book in one go 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.549
 I finished my afternoon with 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.840
 and I stopped in the evening and me 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.739
 got it in one go in one go 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.350
 read out 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.450
 i found a vibrant it is real 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.280
 relaxation it's a bit somewhere 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.480
 exciting but again not 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.610
 it is not as exciting as the 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.470
 psychological thrillers from van esther 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.190
 amplify where and they tip this book 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.580
 written 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.440
 it is really a different genre and 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.850
 it reads away nicely 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.380
 vacation or just when you are not on 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.130
 vacation enjoy yourself in the garden or at home 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.930
 the couch and yes I thought it was better then 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.580
 50 shades of gray I saw feels it 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.410
 the Dutch always in fifty shades 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.270
 I thought oh oh dear 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.430
 well we are going to get it but i think yes 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.840
 I was actually surprised it'll stay 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.000
 much if i found a nice book 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.320
 the book ends open so you don't know 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.120
 what will happen but good news 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.970
 because the second part is coming at the end of September 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.550
 of of walls of glass 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.730
 and that is also all the names I already read 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.110
 walls of glass hard borders only 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.550
 in the back so that marieke maas is one 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.470
 pseudonym of bestseller author esther 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.000
 value for psychological 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.410
 depth in a strong plot 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.910
 presupposes it runs in the books of 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.260
 marique mesh for pure reading pleasure and 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.670
 sizzling eroticism 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.140
 the pseudonym gives her the freedom to 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.370
 the genre that with 50 shades large 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.140
 schools and an appropriate one 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.850
 to answer 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.760
 I am really enthusiastic about it 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.800
 a nice light story but what 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.660
 has a little content so i found it 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.670
 so better than fifty shades of gray he 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.420
 costs 15 euros and is now in store too 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.560
 buy 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.940
 I hope you enjoyed my video 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.560
