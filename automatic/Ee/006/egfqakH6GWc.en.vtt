in<00:00:01.050> this<00:00:01.319> quick<00:00:01.589> and<00:00:01.620> easy<00:00:01.860> tutorial<00:00:02.310> I'll

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
in this quick and easy tutorial I'll

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.240 
in this quick and easy tutorial I'll
show<00:00:03.300> you<00:00:03.419> how<00:00:03.510> to<00:00:03.659> you<00:00:03.840> might<00:00:04.220> simulate<00:00:05.220> a

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
show you how to you might simulate a

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.519 
show you how to you might simulate a
simple<00:00:05.819> kind<00:00:06.270> of<00:00:06.359> ocean<00:00:06.720> scene<00:00:06.960> now<00:00:07.170> you<00:00:07.410> know

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
simple kind of ocean scene now you know

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.500 
simple kind of ocean scene now you know
in<00:00:07.770> blender<00:00:08.130> there's<00:00:08.280> this<00:00:08.460> ocean<00:00:08.970> simulator

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
in blender there's this ocean simulator

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.570 
in blender there's this ocean simulator
built<00:00:09.809> in<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.200> it's<00:00:10.679> very<00:00:10.889> powerful<00:00:11.099> you<00:00:11.429> can

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
built in and it's very powerful you can

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.180 
built in and it's very powerful you can
make<00:00:11.759> waves<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.570> do<00:00:13.259> all<00:00:13.440> kinds<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:13.889> things<00:00:14.070> I

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
make waves and do all kinds of things I

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.650 
make waves and do all kinds of things I
mean<00:00:14.340> it's<00:00:14.490> really<00:00:14.610> powerful<00:00:15.089> so<00:00:15.210> this<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.480> not

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
mean it's really powerful so this is not

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.090 
mean it's really powerful so this is not
quite<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:15.960> same<00:00:16.230> thing<00:00:16.260> this<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.740> simply

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
quite the same thing this is simply

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.250 
quite the same thing this is simply
cloth<00:00:17.400> effects<00:00:17.820> from<00:00:18.150> like<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:18.930> saw<00:00:19.080> in<00:00:19.109> the

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
cloth effects from like you saw in the

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.320 
cloth effects from like you saw in the
previous<00:00:19.590> tutorial<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.070> have<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.670> have<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:21.060> wind

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
previous tutorial I have a I have a wind

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.529 
previous tutorial I have a I have a wind
object<00:00:21.900> here<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.789> if<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:23.880> look<00:00:24.029> at<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.300> this

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
object here and if you look at this this

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.140 
object here and if you look at this this
is<00:00:24.750> just<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.140> subdivided<00:00:26.070> mesh<00:00:26.279> symmetrically

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
is just a subdivided mesh symmetrically

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.599 
is just a subdivided mesh symmetrically
like<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.680> scene<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.250> that's<00:00:29.429> what's

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
like this in the scene so that's what's

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.069 
like this in the scene so that's what's
making<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:31.640> waves<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:33.450> appearance<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:33.989> the

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
making the waves the appearance of the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.770 
making the waves the appearance of the
waves<00:00:34.940> let's<00:00:35.940> see<00:00:36.120> if<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.239> can<00:00:36.329> get<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.570> going

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
waves let's see if I can get this going

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.430 
waves let's see if I can get this going
alright<00:00:37.550> it<00:00:38.550> goes<00:00:38.790> like<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.059> but<00:00:39.809> then<00:00:40.020> this

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
alright it goes like that but then this

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.260 
alright it goes like that but then this
object<00:00:40.710> here<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.430> sea<00:00:41.640> might<00:00:41.940> be<00:00:42.090> your

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
object here in the sea might be your

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.729 
object here in the sea might be your
boat<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.750> could<00:00:42.840> just<00:00:43.050> shape<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.440> into<00:00:43.620> a

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
boat you could just shape that into a

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.560 
boat you could just shape that into a
boat<00:00:44.010> it's<00:00:44.280> just<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.550> cube<00:00:44.789> for<00:00:45.059> now<00:00:45.180> but<00:00:45.390> that's

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
boat it's just a cube for now but that's

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.040 
boat it's just a cube for now but that's
no<00:00:45.690> big<00:00:45.840> deal

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
no big deal

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.319 
no big deal
as<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.010> seen<00:00:47.250> from<00:00:47.430> all<00:00:47.610> many<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.210> other

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
as you seen from all many of the other

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.569 
as you seen from all many of the other
lessons<00:00:48.600> but<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.770> get<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.190> kind<00:00:50.550> of

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
lessons but to get it to kind of

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.189 
lessons but to get it to kind of
interact<00:00:51.239> with<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.719> wave<00:00:51.840> it's<00:00:52.050> not<00:00:52.170> a

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
interact with the wave it's not a

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.540 
interact with the wave it's not a
perfect<00:00:52.590> interaction<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.100> wave<00:00:53.340> because

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
perfect interaction the wave because

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.970 
perfect interaction the wave because
it's<00:00:53.699> not<00:00:53.960> changing<00:00:54.960> its<00:00:55.079> angle<00:00:55.500> but<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.860> is

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
it's not changing its angle but it is

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.400 
it's not changing its angle but it is
bobbing<00:00:56.489> with<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.239> waves<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.719> little<00:00:57.780> bit<00:00:58.199> and

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
bobbing with the waves a little bit and

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.860 
bobbing with the waves a little bit and
it's<00:00:58.890> enough<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.219> give<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.520> to<00:01:00.210> simulate<00:01:00.510> an

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
it's enough to give it to simulate an

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.229 
it's enough to give it to simulate an
effect<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.410> some<00:01:02.010> simple<00:01:02.219> animations<00:01:02.850> if<00:01:03.149> you

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
effect in some simple animations if you

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.520 
effect in some simple animations if you
get<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.449> right<00:01:03.539> lighting<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.080> colors<00:01:04.379> in

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
get the right lighting and the colors in

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.890 
get the right lighting and the colors in
the<00:01:04.589> whole<00:01:04.710> nine<00:01:04.920> yards<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:06.570> way<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.750> do

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
the whole nine yards so the way you do

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.840 
the whole nine yards so the way you do
it<00:01:07.049> let's<00:01:07.439> say<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.619> add<00:01:07.920> another<00:01:08.189> cube<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
it let's say I add another cube to the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.420 
it let's say I add another cube to the
scene<00:01:09.090> over<00:01:09.360> here<00:01:09.799> if<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.950> was<00:01:11.070> just<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> add<00:01:11.400> a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
scene over here if I was just to add a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.170 
scene over here if I was just to add a
regular<00:01:11.880> cube<00:01:13.159> make<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.280> one<00:01:14.520> different<00:01:14.970> I

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
regular cube make this one different I

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.149 
regular cube make this one different I
don't<00:01:15.780> know<00:01:15.960> there<00:01:16.619> we<00:01:16.740> go

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
don't know there we go

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.060 
don't know there we go
and<00:01:17.580> if<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.850> just<00:01:18.140> parent<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.710> since

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
and if I just parent it to this since

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.890 
and if I just parent it to this since
this<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> cloth<00:01:20.670> object<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.270> has<00:01:21.540> all<00:01:21.750> the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
this is a cloth object this has all the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.050 
this is a cloth object this has all the
physics<00:01:22.259> effects<00:01:22.619> associated<00:01:22.860> with<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.909> I

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
physics effects associated with it and I

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.929 
physics effects associated with it and I
was<00:01:24.180> just<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.570> then<00:01:24.720> shift<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.380> grab<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.610> and

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
was just to then shift and grab this and

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.600 
was just to then shift and grab this and
parent<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.509> like<00:01:27.659> normal<00:01:27.930> control<00:01:28.619> P<00:01:28.860> I'd

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
parent it like normal control P I'd

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.520 
parent it like normal control P I'd
parent<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> object<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.869> let's<00:01:31.439> see

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
parent it to the object and let's see

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.020 
parent it to the object and let's see
what<00:01:31.650> happens<00:01:33.650> well<00:01:34.650> nothing<00:01:35.009> because<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.909> has

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
what happens well nothing because it has

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.700 
what happens well nothing because it has
because<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.420> just<00:01:36.630> doesn't<00:01:36.990> know<00:01:37.229> about<00:01:37.380> it

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
because it just doesn't know about it

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.440 
because it just doesn't know about it
doesn't<00:01:37.920> have<00:01:38.159> any<00:01:38.400> physics<00:01:38.850> effects<00:01:39.150> well<00:01:39.329> if

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
doesn't have any physics effects well if

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.630 
doesn't have any physics effects well if
I<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:40.290> know<00:01:40.409> if<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.560> turn<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:41.009> into<00:01:41.250> its<00:01:41.490> own

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
I you know if I turn that into its own

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.260 
I you know if I turn that into its own
cloth<00:01:41.970> object<00:01:42.920> what<00:01:43.920> would<00:01:43.950> happen<00:01:44.490> well<00:01:44.790> we

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
cloth object what would happen well we

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.420 
cloth object what would happen well we
could<00:01:45.509> let's<00:01:45.780> see<00:01:45.899> what<00:01:46.020> happens<00:01:46.350> there<00:01:46.590> since

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
could let's see what happens there since

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.429 
could let's see what happens there since
since<00:01:48.090> that's<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.479> cloth<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.960> that's<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.229> cloth

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
since that's a cloth and that's a cloth

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.469 
since that's a cloth and that's a cloth
and<00:01:49.619> that's<00:01:49.770> parented<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.610> let's<00:01:51.299> see

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
and that's parented to that let's see

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.560 
and that's parented to that let's see
what<00:01:51.630> happens<00:01:51.960> we'll<00:01:52.140> add<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.649> cloth<00:01:53.450> object<00:01:54.450> to

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
what happens we'll add a cloth object to

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.520 
what happens we'll add a cloth object to
that<00:01:54.710> see<00:01:55.710> we<00:01:55.829> need<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.549> go<00:01:56.729> give<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.570> created

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
that see we need to go give it a created

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.800 
that see we need to go give it a created
quick<00:01:58.890> group<00:01:59.130> for<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.610> by<00:02:00.479> going<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.750> the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
quick group for it by going to the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.499 
quick group for it by going to the
vertex<00:02:01.170> group<00:02:01.640> how<00:02:02.640> do<00:02:02.700> we<00:02:02.969> use<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.360> default

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
vertex group how do we use the default

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.560 
vertex group how do we use the default
group<00:02:03.930> name<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:05.040> we'll<00:02:05.399> let<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.969> float<00:02:06.210> free

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
group name and we'll let it float free

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.690 
group name and we'll let it float free
like<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:07.079> all<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.500> vertices<00:02:07.799> okay<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.399> now

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
like that all the vertices okay so now

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.580 
like that all the vertices okay so now
as<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.879> group<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.869> we'll<00:02:09.959> go<00:02:10.050> back<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.259> grab

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
as a group and we'll go back and grab

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.510 
as a group and we'll go back and grab
the<00:02:10.830> group<00:02:11.069> and

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
the group and

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.940 
the group and
it<00:02:11.610> down<00:02:11.850> now<00:02:12.600> that<00:02:12.810> should<00:02:13.020> take<00:02:13.230> effect<00:02:13.380> next

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
it down now that should take effect next

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.020 
it down now that should take effect next
time<00:02:14.070> it<00:02:14.190> comes<00:02:14.310> around<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:15.780> there<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.740> is<00:02:17.030> so

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
time it comes around and there it is so

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.950 
time it comes around and there it is so
it<00:02:18.660> is<00:02:18.870> moving<00:02:19.170> with<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:20.550> wind<00:02:20.810> but<00:02:21.810> it's

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
it is moving with the wind but it's

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.470 
it is moving with the wind but it's
still<00:02:22.140> not<00:02:22.290> bobbing<00:02:22.740> up<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:24.000> down<00:02:24.090> like<00:02:24.450> that

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
still not bobbing up and down like that

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.880 
still not bobbing up and down like that
so<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:24.870> doesn't<00:02:24.930> really<00:02:25.260> give<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.710> same

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
so it doesn't really give you the same

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.650 
so it doesn't really give you the same
effect<00:02:26.040> if<00:02:26.580> like<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:26.790> can<00:02:26.910> barely<00:02:27.120> see<00:02:27.540> it

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
effect if like you can barely see it

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.060 
effect if like you can barely see it
maybe<00:02:27.840> it's<00:02:28.050> because<00:02:28.230> it's<00:02:28.380> not<00:02:28.470> quite<00:02:28.770> close

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
maybe it's because it's not quite close

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.600 
maybe it's because it's not quite close
enough<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.550> wind<00:02:29.730> like<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:31.400> okay<00:02:32.400> so

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
enough to the wind like that okay so

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.900 
enough to the wind like that okay so
it's<00:02:33.300> it<00:02:33.720> doesn't<00:02:34.050> work<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.470> way<00:02:35.100> all<00:02:35.700> right

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
it's it doesn't work that way all right

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.670 
it's it doesn't work that way all right
so<00:02:36.150> let's<00:02:36.360> get<00:02:36.510> rid<00:02:36.660> of<00:02:36.720> this<00:02:36.900> object<00:02:37.110> again

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
so let's get rid of this object again

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.250 
so let's get rid of this object again
and<00:02:38.010> then<00:02:38.850> so<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:39.360> way<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.540> have<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.750> do<00:02:39.990> it<00:02:40.170> in

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
and then so the way you have to do it in

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.750 
and then so the way you have to do it in
order<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.500> make<00:02:40.710> this<00:02:40.860> effect<00:02:41.220> work<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:41.640> it's

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
order to make this effect work and it's

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.070 
order to make this effect work and it's
really<00:02:41.820> fun<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:43.380> it's<00:02:43.560> easy<00:02:44.270> so<00:02:45.270> this<00:02:45.450> is<00:02:45.600> kind

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
really fun and it's easy so this is kind

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.840 
really fun and it's easy so this is kind
of<00:02:46.140> an<00:02:46.260> intermediate<00:02:46.470> intermediate<00:02:46.860> tutorial

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
of an intermediate intermediate tutorial

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.510 
of an intermediate intermediate tutorial
because<00:02:48.750> it's<00:02:49.020> not<00:02:49.560> quite<00:02:49.860> as<00:02:50.010> obvious

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
because it's not quite as obvious

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.270 
because it's not quite as obvious
so<00:02:50.970> you<00:02:51.060> just<00:02:51.390> I'll<00:02:51.960> scale<00:02:52.380> down<00:02:52.650> again<00:02:53.040> give

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
so you just I'll scale down again give

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.760 
so you just I'll scale down again give
it<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.430> that<00:02:53.700> same<00:02:53.970> color<00:02:54.240> as<00:02:54.990> before<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:57.770> what

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
it a that same color as before and what

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.550 
it a that same color as before and what
you<00:02:58.860> do<00:02:59.010> when<00:02:59.510> first<00:03:00.510> of<00:03:00.690> all<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:01.170> have<00:03:01.350> this

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
you do when first of all you have this

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.560 
you do when first of all you have this
object<00:03:01.740> selected<00:03:02.370> so<00:03:02.670> that's<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:02.970> child<00:03:03.270> and

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
object selected so that's the child and

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.940 
object selected so that's the child and
this<00:03:03.900> is<00:03:03.990> going<00:03:04.110> to<00:03:04.170> be<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.350> parent<00:03:04.680> so<00:03:04.830> you

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
this is going to be the parent so you

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.090 
this is going to be the parent so you
shift<00:03:05.070> and<00:03:05.460> select<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:06.060> one<00:03:06.290> like<00:03:07.290> we<00:03:07.920> just

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
shift and select that one like we just

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.850 
shift and select that one like we just
did<00:03:08.280> before<00:03:08.460> but<00:03:09.150> now<00:03:09.420> since<00:03:10.110> this<00:03:10.320> is<00:03:10.590> the

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
did before but now since this is the

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.340 
did before but now since this is the
active<00:03:11.610> object<00:03:11.760> because<00:03:12.570> I<00:03:12.660> just<00:03:12.900> selected

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
active object because I just selected

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.500 
active object because I just selected
and<00:03:13.440> now<00:03:13.560> go<00:03:13.740> into<00:03:13.890> edit<00:03:14.190> mode<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:14.610> then<00:03:15.420> I'll

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
and now go into edit mode and then I'll

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.090 
and now go into edit mode and then I'll
pick<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:15.930> vertex<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:16.709> make<00:03:16.860> sure<00:03:16.980> I'm<00:03:17.040> in

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
pick a vertex and make sure I'm in

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.250 
pick a vertex and make sure I'm in
vertex<00:03:17.490> select<00:03:17.910> mode<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.360> I'll<00:03:18.930> just<00:03:19.050> pick

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
vertex select mode and I'll just pick

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.300 
vertex select mode and I'll just pick
say<00:03:19.440> this<00:03:19.590> vertex<00:03:19.709> right<00:03:20.130> there<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.750> then<00:03:21.750> I

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
say this vertex right there and then I

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.280 
say this vertex right there and then I
compare<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.520> this<00:03:23.760> was<00:03:24.000> this<00:03:24.570> was<00:03:24.870> still

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
compare it this was this was still

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.470 
compare it this was this was still
essentially<00:03:25.920> selected<00:03:26.310> so<00:03:26.430> now<00:03:26.550> go<00:03:26.730> control<00:03:27.240> P

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
essentially selected so now go control P

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.420 
essentially selected so now go control P
and<00:03:27.750> now<00:03:28.080> notice<00:03:28.290> it<00:03:28.530> says<00:03:28.680> make<00:03:28.920> vertex

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
and now notice it says make vertex

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.100 
and now notice it says make vertex
parent<00:03:29.850> instead<00:03:30.030> of<00:03:30.209> just<00:03:30.330> make<00:03:30.630> object

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
parent instead of just make object

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.170 
parent instead of just make object
parent<00:03:31.440> all<00:03:31.980> right<00:03:32.100> so<00:03:32.250> now<00:03:32.430> I've<00:03:32.550> parented<00:03:33.060> it

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
parent all right so now I've parented it

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.990 
parent all right so now I've parented it
to<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.480> vertex<00:03:33.870> like<00:03:34.830> this<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:35.670> I'll<00:03:35.820> escape

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
to the vertex like this and I'll escape

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.630 
to the vertex like this and I'll escape
and<00:03:36.390> then<00:03:37.110> let's<00:03:37.440> it's<00:03:37.890> still<00:03:38.160> running<00:03:38.340> so

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
and then let's it's still running so

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.270 
and then let's it's still running so
when<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:38.880> comes<00:03:39.060> back<00:03:39.300> around<00:03:40.010> it<00:03:41.010> should<00:03:41.190> be

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
when it comes back around it should be

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.160 
when it comes back around it should be
controlled<00:03:41.790> but<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.420> should<00:03:42.630> be<00:03:42.750> affecting

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
controlled but you should be affecting

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.920 
controlled but you should be affecting
it<00:03:43.320> and<00:03:43.980> there<00:03:44.160> it<00:03:44.250> is<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.150> bounces<00:03:45.300> in<00:03:45.720> this

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
it and there it is so it bounces in this

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.420 
it and there it is so it bounces in this
scene<00:03:46.110> we<00:03:46.290> just<00:03:46.500> move<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:46.740> down<00:03:46.830> closer<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.340> the

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
scene we just move it down closer to the

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.130 
scene we just move it down closer to the
surface<00:03:47.610> in<00:03:47.940> there<00:03:48.060> like<00:03:48.300> that<00:03:48.330> and<00:03:48.750> then<00:03:49.050> you

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
surface in there like that and then you

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.320 
surface in there like that and then you
can<00:03:49.290> simulate<00:03:49.500> your<00:03:49.770> little<00:03:50.100> boats<00:03:50.340> floating

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
can simulate your little boats floating

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.120 
can simulate your little boats floating
in<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.510> water

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
in the water

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.640 
in the water
you<00:03:53.130> know<00:03:53.780> for<00:03:54.780> that<00:03:54.840> effect<00:03:55.140> now<00:03:55.290> you<00:03:55.350> can

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
you know for that effect now you can

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.740 
you know for that effect now you can
even<00:03:55.920> change<00:03:56.490> these<00:03:56.790> on<00:03:57.060> their<00:03:57.270> own<00:03:57.450> you<00:03:57.600> could

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
even change these on their own you could

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.170 
even change these on their own you could
do<00:03:57.959> some<00:03:58.230> kind<00:03:58.470> of<00:03:58.620> rotation<00:03:58.980> on<00:03:59.310> these<00:03:59.520> say<00:03:59.880> R

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
do some kind of rotation on these say R

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.670 
do some kind of rotation on these say R
Y<00:04:00.870> separately<00:04:01.650> if<00:04:01.830> you<00:04:01.980> want<00:04:02.250> or<00:04:03.350> whatever<00:04:04.350> but

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
Y separately if you want or whatever but

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.170 
Y separately if you want or whatever but
we'll<00:04:05.220> deal<00:04:05.400> with<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.700> more<00:04:05.910> advanced

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
we'll deal with the more advanced

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.390 
we'll deal with the more advanced
lessons<00:04:06.510> for<00:04:06.990> that<00:04:07.140> but<00:04:07.350> for<00:04:07.380> starters<00:04:08.220> it's<00:04:08.370> a

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
lessons for that but for starters it's a

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.670 
lessons for that but for starters it's a
great<00:04:08.580> way<00:04:08.700> to<00:04:08.730> get<00:04:09.540> some<00:04:09.720> cool<00:04:09.959> action<00:04:10.230> going

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
great way to get some cool action going

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.470 
great way to get some cool action going
okay<00:04:11.340> well<00:04:11.489> that's<00:04:11.640> it<00:04:11.700> for<00:04:11.880> this<00:04:11.970> lesson<00:04:12.030> and

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
okay well that's it for this lesson and

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.650 
okay well that's it for this lesson and
I'll<00:04:12.840> see<00:04:12.989> you<00:04:13.050> in<00:04:13.110> the<00:04:13.170> next<00:04:13.380> lesson
