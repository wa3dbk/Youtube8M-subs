00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
three inch which is the standard arm

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.910 
three inch which is the standard arm
you'll<00:00:26.090> find<00:00:26.330> on<00:00:26.450> most<00:00:26.660> mounts<00:00:27.170> this<00:00:27.650> is<00:00:27.830> the

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
you'll find on most mounts this is the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.960 
you'll find on most mounts this is the
one<00:00:28.039> I'm<00:00:28.130> going<00:00:28.160> to<00:00:28.280> talk<00:00:28.430> about<00:00:28.610> right<00:00:28.940> now

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
one I'm going to talk about right now

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.150 
one I'm going to talk about right now
which<00:00:29.420> is<00:00:29.570> three<00:00:29.869> inches<00:00:30.170> from<00:00:30.350> socket<00:00:30.860> Center

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
which is three inches from socket Center

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.069 
which is three inches from socket Center
-<00:00:31.310> so<00:00:31.490> that<00:00:31.640> Center<00:00:31.970> then<00:00:32.539> you<00:00:32.629> have<00:00:32.750> the<00:00:32.840> large

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
- so that Center then you have the large

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.710 
- so that Center then you have the large
one<00:00:33.379> here<00:00:33.410> which<00:00:33.950> is<00:00:34.100> actually<00:00:34.730> five<00:00:35.239> point

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
one here which is actually five point

two five inches long from Safa Center to

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.050 
two five inches long from Safa Center to
suffer<00:00:39.320> Center<00:00:39.680> all<00:00:40.220> these<00:00:40.489> three<00:00:40.790> are<00:00:40.820> made

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.060 
suffer Center all these three are made

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.819 
suffer Center all these three are made
of<00:00:41.239> marine<00:00:41.540> grade<00:00:41.750> aluminum<00:00:41.810> what<00:00:42.680> I'm<00:00:42.739> gonna

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
of marine grade aluminum what I'm gonna

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:44.410 
of marine grade aluminum what I'm gonna
do<00:00:43.010> is<00:00:43.160> just<00:00:43.190> move<00:00:43.520> these<00:00:43.730> two<00:00:44.060> out<00:00:44.239> of<00:00:44.270> the

how<00:01:06.979> it<00:01:07.039> works<00:01:07.219> I'm<00:01:07.399> just<00:01:07.609> take<00:01:07.850> this<00:01:07.999> this

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:08.329 
how it works I'm just take this this

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:10.629 
how it works I'm just take this this
base<00:01:08.600> which<00:01:08.840> is<00:01:08.990> a<00:01:09.020> suction<00:01:09.350> cup<00:01:09.619> base<00:01:09.859> just

00:01:10.629 --> 00:01:10.639 
base which is a suction cup base just

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:12.699 
base which is a suction cup base just
like<00:01:10.759> the<00:01:10.880> down<00:01:11.060> surf<00:01:11.359> and<00:01:11.600> grit<00:01:11.749> and<00:01:12.469> what<00:01:12.619> you

00:01:12.699 --> 00:01:12.709 
like the down surf and grit and what you

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:15.099 
like the down surf and grit and what you
do<00:01:12.829> is<00:01:12.979> with<00:01:13.130> this<00:01:13.280> this<00:01:13.579> arm<00:01:13.999> is<00:01:14.359> you<00:01:14.840> can<00:01:14.959> see

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:15.109 
do is with this this arm is you can see

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:17.230 
do is with this this arm is you can see
the<00:01:15.170> spring<00:01:15.499> inside<00:01:15.649> of<00:01:15.979> there<00:01:16.159> it<00:01:16.399> allows<00:01:16.909> you

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
the spring inside of there it allows you

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.359 
the spring inside of there it allows you
to<00:01:17.359> clamp<00:01:17.719> this<00:01:18.020> on<00:01:18.259> like<00:01:18.529> a<00:01:18.560> peg<00:01:18.950> so<00:01:19.189> what<00:01:19.310> you

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
to clamp this on like a peg so what you

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.129 
to clamp this on like a peg so what you
do<00:01:19.459> is<00:01:19.549> put<00:01:19.700> this<00:01:19.819> over<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.149> ball<00:01:20.359> and<00:01:20.990> now

00:01:21.129 --> 00:01:21.139 
do is put this over the ball and now

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:24.160 
do is put this over the ball and now
that<00:01:21.380> holds<00:01:22.249> fairly<00:01:22.639> firm<00:01:22.939> on<00:01:23.240> there<00:01:23.539> just<00:01:23.929> for

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
that holds fairly firm on there just for

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.749 
that holds fairly firm on there just for
gripping<00:01:24.439> so<00:01:24.799> what<00:01:24.979> you<00:01:25.100> can<00:01:25.219> now<00:01:25.310> do<00:01:25.369> is<00:01:25.579> put

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
gripping so what you can now do is put

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.819 
gripping so what you can now do is put
another<00:01:26.209> plate<00:01:26.840> on<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:27.170> end<00:01:27.319> and<00:01:27.649> then<00:01:27.799> just

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
another plate on the end and then just

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.489 
another plate on the end and then just
loosen<00:01:28.369> this<00:01:28.520> using<00:01:28.969> the<00:01:29.090> knob<00:01:29.299> but<00:01:30.049> a<00:01:30.109> play<00:01:30.349> in

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:30.499 
loosen this using the knob but a play in

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:32.679 
loosen this using the knob but a play in
there<00:01:30.709> and<00:01:31.219> then<00:01:31.310> tighten<00:01:31.520> up<00:01:31.819> the<00:01:32.420> ball

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
there and then tighten up the ball

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.190 
there and then tighten up the ball
around<00:01:32.990> these<00:01:33.969> this<00:01:34.969> so<00:01:35.329> a<00:01:35.359> clamp<00:01:35.689> onto<00:01:35.959> the

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
around these this so a clamp onto the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.599 
around these this so a clamp onto the
board<00:01:36.469> and<00:01:36.619> what's<00:01:36.829> actually<00:01:36.950> happening<00:01:37.459> is

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
board and what's actually happening is

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:40.239 
board and what's actually happening is
as<00:01:37.759> dispersing<00:01:38.630> these<00:01:38.840> ball<00:01:39.170> sockets<00:01:39.740> had<00:01:40.039> the

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:40.249 
as dispersing these ball sockets had the

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:42.819 
as dispersing these ball sockets had the
ball<00:01:40.459> rubber<00:01:41.329> balls<00:01:41.599> so<00:01:42.259> what's<00:01:42.409> happening<00:01:42.679> is

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
ball rubber balls so what's happening is

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.409 
ball rubber balls so what's happening is
it's<00:01:42.920> clamping<00:01:43.520> here<00:01:43.639> on<00:01:43.729> those<00:01:43.909> balls<00:01:44.179> and

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:44.419 
it's clamping here on those balls and

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:46.089 
it's clamping here on those balls and
changing<00:01:44.779> from<00:01:44.810> a<00:01:45.109> round<00:01:45.319> shape<00:01:45.709> to<00:01:45.889> just

00:01:46.089 --> 00:01:46.099 
changing from a round shape to just

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:47.349 
changing from a round shape to just
slightly<00:01:46.399> up<00:01:46.609> around<00:01:46.789> so<00:01:47.060> now<00:01:47.179> they<00:01:47.329> don't

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
slightly up around so now they don't

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:49.480 
slightly up around so now they don't
move<00:01:47.749> in<00:01:47.959> there<00:01:48.109> but<00:01:48.679> also<00:01:48.740> being<00:01:49.130> solid

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
move in there but also being solid

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.889 
move in there but also being solid
rather<00:01:49.669> they<00:01:49.819> have<00:01:49.969> very<00:01:50.270> good<00:01:50.419> damping

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
rather they have very good damping

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.589 
rather they have very good damping
effect<00:01:51.020> so<00:01:51.859> once<00:01:52.579> you<00:01:52.669> put<00:01:52.849> this<00:01:52.999> sort<00:01:53.209> of<00:01:53.270> into

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:53.599 
effect so once you put this sort of into

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:55.389 
effect so once you put this sort of into
a<00:01:53.630> position<00:01:54.109> you<00:01:54.529> want<00:01:54.740> it<00:01:54.889> to<00:01:55.009> go<00:01:55.189> in

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
a position you want it to go in

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.399 
a position you want it to go in
especially<00:01:56.060> with<00:01:56.569> just<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:56.959> weight<00:01:57.169> this<00:01:57.349> is

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
especially with just the weight this is

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.139 
especially with just the weight this is
designed<00:01:57.950> to<00:01:58.099> work<00:01:58.310> with<00:01:58.369> it<00:01:58.729> which<00:01:58.819> is<00:01:58.849> around

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
designed to work with it which is around

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.419 
designed to work with it which is around
up<00:01:59.389> to<00:01:59.539> about<00:01:59.659> a<00:01:59.719> 1<00:01:59.929> 1<00:01:59.959> pound<00:02:00.469> maybe<00:02:00.649> oh<00:02:01.009> sorry

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
up to about a 1 1 pound maybe oh sorry

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.229 
up to about a 1 1 pound maybe oh sorry
about<00:02:01.700> 2<00:02:02.060> pounds<00:02:02.270> even<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:03.139> bit<00:02:03.289> more<00:02:03.999> it<00:02:04.999> does

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:05.239 
about 2 pounds even a bit more it does

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:07.209 
about 2 pounds even a bit more it does
hold<00:02:05.630> very<00:02:06.049> well<00:02:06.109> this<00:02:06.499> movement<00:02:06.889> is<00:02:07.009> things

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
hold very well this movement is things

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:10.030 
hold very well this movement is things
just<00:02:07.489> in<00:02:07.609> the<00:02:08.119> base<00:02:08.300> alone<00:02:08.630> but<00:02:08.959> you<00:02:09.619> can<00:02:09.649> see

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
just in the base alone but you can see

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.890 
just in the base alone but you can see
here<00:02:10.369> this<00:02:10.550> is<00:02:10.820> played<00:02:11.210> at<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.420> top<00:02:11.600> here<00:02:11.870> is

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
here this is played at the top here is

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.020 
here this is played at the top here is
not<00:02:12.290> going<00:02:12.680> anywhere

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
not going anywhere

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.140 
not going anywhere
so<00:02:14.570> it's<00:02:14.840> very<00:02:14.990> easy<00:02:15.140> very<00:02:15.650> simple<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:17.000> move

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
so it's very easy very simple to move

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.150 
so it's very easy very simple to move
and<00:02:17.570> unpolluted<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.650> then<00:02:18.770> move<00:02:18.950> it<00:02:19.070> around

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
and unpolluted and then move it around

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.220 
and unpolluted and then move it around
to<00:02:19.490> whatever<00:02:19.640> location<00:02:20.420> and<00:02:20.690> come<00:02:20.900> back<00:02:21.050> to

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
to whatever location and come back to

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.810 
to whatever location and come back to
whatever<00:02:21.500> spot<00:02:21.770> and<00:02:22.250> it's<00:02:22.370> just<00:02:22.490> a<00:02:22.580> matter<00:02:22.700> of

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
whatever spot and it's just a matter of

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.730 
whatever spot and it's just a matter of
tightening<00:02:23.210> the<00:02:23.300> arm<00:02:23.450> back<00:02:23.690> up<00:02:23.720> with<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:24.560> couple

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
tightening the arm back up with a couple

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.160 
tightening the arm back up with a couple
of<00:02:24.860> turns<00:02:25.100> and<00:02:26.060> there<00:02:26.240> you<00:02:26.330> go<00:02:26.510> it's<00:02:26.750> very<00:02:26.810> easy

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
of turns and there you go it's very easy

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.260 
of turns and there you go it's very easy
very<00:02:27.290> good<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:27.710> use<00:02:27.830> so<00:02:28.340> that's<00:02:28.490> the<00:02:28.730> standard

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
very good to use so that's the standard

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.610 
very good to use so that's the standard
