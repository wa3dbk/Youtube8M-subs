board and the center point of its handle
is<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.740> great<00:01:22.920> indicator<00:01:23.340> for<00:01:23.940> that<00:01:24.060> center

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
is a great indicator for that center

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.180 
is a great indicator for that center
point<00:01:24.479> from<00:01:24.960> pulling<00:01:25.200> yourself<00:01:25.290> up<00:01:25.680> onto<00:01:25.950> the

our paddle up onto the board and then

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.570 
our paddle up onto the board and then
pull<00:01:30.659> yourself<00:01:31.049> again<00:01:31.920> on<00:01:32.010> the<00:01:32.100> center<00:01:32.340> point
