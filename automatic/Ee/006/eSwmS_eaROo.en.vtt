time I'm starting to feel that this game

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.870 
time I'm starting to feel that this game
is<00:03:08.780> cursed<00:03:09.170> but<00:03:09.560> now<00:03:09.769> let<00:03:10.220> me<00:03:10.370> explain<00:03:10.700> the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
reason why we actually jumped straight

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.190 
reason why we actually jumped straight
into<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.820> end<00:03:14.000> of<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.209> first<00:03:14.540> quarter<00:03:14.810> and

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
into the end of the first quarter and

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.650 
into the end of the first quarter and
why<00:03:15.590> there<00:03:15.890> weren't<00:03:16.190> really<00:03:16.400> any

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
why there weren't really any

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.570 
why there weren't really any
introductions<00:03:17.920> unfortunately<00:03:18.920> during<00:03:19.250> me

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
of the first quarter and that made me

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.140 
of the first quarter and that made me
believe<00:03:27.110> even<00:03:27.650> more<00:03:27.920> that<00:03:28.310> tonight's<00:03:28.670> game<00:03:28.970> is

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150

in<00:03:53.959> this<00:03:54.170> game<00:03:54.440> and<00:03:54.739> shots<00:03:55.280> like<00:03:55.550> those<00:03:55.850> are

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
in this game and shots like those are

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.180 
in this game and shots like those are
the<00:03:56.330> reason<00:03:56.780> why<00:03:57.110> we<00:03:57.380> cannot<00:03:57.769> get<00:03:58.010> any

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
the reason why we cannot get any

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.060 
the reason why we cannot get any
defensive<00:03:58.970> stops<00:03:59.330> Trevor<00:03:59.780> Ariza<00:04:00.019> I<00:04:00.620> thought

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
defensive stops Trevor Ariza I thought

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.310 
defensive stops Trevor Ariza I thought
he<00:04:01.190> was<00:04:01.340> playing<00:04:01.489> great<00:04:01.790> defense<00:04:01.910> but<00:04:02.870> Jamal

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
he was playing great defense but Jamal

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.949 
he was playing great defense but Jamal
Crawford<00:04:04.070> has<00:04:04.370> been<00:04:04.640> unstoppable<00:04:05.239> in<00:04:05.780> this

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
Crawford has been unstoppable in this

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.050 
Crawford has been unstoppable in this
series<00:04:06.380> since<00:04:07.010> I'm<00:04:07.130> going<00:04:07.340> up<00:04:07.489> against<00:04:07.880> Chris

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
series since I'm going up against Chris

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.330 
series since I'm going up against Chris
Paul<00:04:08.090> and<00:04:08.510> Jamal<00:04:08.810> Crawford<00:04:08.840> James<00:04:09.830> Harden<00:04:10.220> is

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
Paul and Jamal Crawford James Harden is

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.100 
Paul and Jamal Crawford James Harden is
being<00:04:10.580> left<00:04:10.760> wide<00:04:11.000> open<00:04:11.030> he<00:04:11.450> gets<00:04:11.660> that<00:04:11.900> layup

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
being left wide open he gets that layup

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.410 
being left wide open he gets that layup
to<00:04:12.260> go<00:04:12.590> and<00:04:12.860> I'm

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
to go and I'm

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.839 
to go and I'm
hoping<00:04:13.870> again<00:04:14.230> that<00:04:14.800> we<00:04:14.980> can<00:04:15.250> find<00:04:15.520> a<00:04:15.640> way<00:04:15.670> to

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
hoping again that we can find a way to

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.150 
hoping again that we can find a way to
get<00:04:16.120> back<00:04:16.389> into<00:04:16.660> this<00:04:16.900> game<00:04:17.169> we<00:04:17.769> are<00:04:17.919> now

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
get back into this game we are now

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.280 
get back into this game we are now
scoring<00:04:18.700> buckets<00:04:19.180> on<00:04:19.359> offense<00:04:19.840> but

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
scoring buckets on offense but

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.800 
scoring buckets on offense but
unfortunately<00:04:21.070> we<00:04:21.519> simply<00:04:22.030> haven't<00:04:22.510> figured

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
unfortunately we simply haven't figured

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.200 
unfortunately we simply haven't figured
out<00:04:22.930> how<00:04:23.320> to<00:04:23.380> stop<00:04:23.800> the<00:04:23.980> Clippers<00:04:24.370> on<00:04:24.610> defense

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210
