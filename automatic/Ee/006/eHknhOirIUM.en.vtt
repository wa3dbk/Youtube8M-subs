00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.520
 hi everyone is toxic this one 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.000
 finds himself for a new top 10 he 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.070
 so top 10 feed so not only to 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.490
 snipers it's possible with others 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.460
 arms 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.640
 I've booked you 10 really clips 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.360
 rather not bad in tenth position we get 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.329
 find with dams go so that's okay 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:46.940
 start with heavy today he 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:50.030
 will make us 5 kg c4 so we can see 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.520
 really slows it down 5 kg c4 you have 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.739
 seen on the bottom left and 5 kills so he 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.480
 is in bloodthirsty 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:01:00.710
 then he will finish with a little kilo 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.269
 pump the 6 in less than 10 seconds 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.360
 9th position ends with six cases 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:08.540
 the water that he is going to make us a 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:12.410
 a nice little clip with his dsr 50 so 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.390
 a kill of them that they believe he is 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.000
 be careful the fourth for the cua of 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.229
 feed so here is she a cat for 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.500
 so finish a pretty nice eighth clip 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:29.329
 position between reunion knüt ex il 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:32.360
 is going to make us simply so a 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.189
 triple in one ball followed by a kill 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.240
 so this business what what feed with 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.399
 a small price plan a ball so 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.840
 it's pretty good 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:42.890
 we quote pos seventh 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.979
 historic eu 88 that will make us all 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.290
 just he starts the part so in 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.020
 catching the flag I believe it will us 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.290
 do a triplet shot in inbal so 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.210
 here is what to start the game rather 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.380
 not bad 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.950
 sixth position we end up with 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.189
 tommy and said what will we do a 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.469
 very nice clip so a collateral 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.930
 followed by a second collateral for the 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:10.550
 cua of feed so logically he would have 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.410
 had to do the triple in a ball but I 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.130
 am not why he did not take so 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.570
 really bad damage 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.459
 in fifth place we end up 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:24.790
 with ucb ds 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.090
 who will then make us a very beautiful 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.400
 clip 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.209
 he will start with a marker hit 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.330
 but it's not over 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.849
 so 2 he's going to do the third so 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.500
 a triple fidh 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:41.530
 then he reloads it will continue so 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:43.300
 1 2 3 and 4 so a triple fidh followed 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.360
 a headdress of a quad fidh 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.030
 so there a double break girl and in 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.880
 everything he's done nine he's all in it 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.860
 excellent 9 quillan in 15 seconds 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.680
 not bad fourth position we get 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.870
 found with killer frag so very 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.690
 bad quality but it's an excellent 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.230
 clip to what he's going to do to us a big 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.239
 fat girl from alex inquiry g12 so I 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.420
 let you tell I'll tell you to the 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:14.319
 end how many kiel he did so so that's it 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:18.519
 he gets killed he did it so he 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:20.440
 an excellent 8 fidh position third 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:24.239
 we find with BFC them 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:27.489
 he will make us a feed cross 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:30.820
 you see in newton being killed 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:33.130
 but watch what will happen if you 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:37.030
 going to do there someone wins 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:39.070
 demolition so 3,2 fit in which 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.400
 victory case could see there have 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:46.730
 slowed down the 4 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:50.810
 so is that a little bit of fun on the 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.370
 spawn except that he gets killed in 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.829
 second position we end up with 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:59.769

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:06.700
 so you'll see he'll make us 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.909
 5 kills so one collateral so 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.980
 very good shot but a little bit 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:20.660
 damage first position we end up 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.889
 with arzew dies the winner so he goes 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.780
 we make a 6 fidh 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.060
 you're going to see so there he comes from 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.630

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:34.010
