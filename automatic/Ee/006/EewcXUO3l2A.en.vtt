00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
running around 10 in jungle and mining

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.219 
running around 10 in jungle and mining
different<00:01:24.030> mines<00:01:24.180> now<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.420> mind<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.960> don't<00:01:25.110> even

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
different mines now I mind I don't even

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.910 
different mines now I mind I don't even
know<00:01:25.409> like<00:01:25.650> probably<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:27.020> like<00:01:28.020> 20<00:01:28.229> mines<00:01:28.619> ok

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
know like probably a like 20 mines ok

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.039 
know like probably a like 20 mines ok
let's<00:01:29.280> just<00:01:29.490> say<00:01:29.640> 20<00:01:30.210> mines<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.600> got<00:01:30.750> zero

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
let's just say 20 mines I got zero

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.260 
let's just say 20 mines I got zero
felled<00:01:31.439> white<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.250> honestly<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.030> mean

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
felled white so that I honestly I mean

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.969 
felled white so that I honestly I mean
it's<00:01:33.420> PTR<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.200> there's<00:01:34.350> probably<00:01:34.439> not<00:01:34.770> even

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
it's PTR so there's probably not even

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.620 
it's PTR so there's probably not even
implemented<00:01:35.400> but<00:01:35.520> maybe<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.210> don't<00:01:36.479> know

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
implemented but maybe it is I don't know

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.020 
implemented but maybe it is I don't know
either<00:01:37.170> way<00:01:37.500> I'm<00:01:38.159> assuming<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.700> will<00:01:38.790> probably

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
either way I'm assuming it will probably

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.969 
either way I'm assuming it will probably
be<00:01:39.150> relatively<00:01:39.659> rare<00:01:39.960> because<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.650> how<00:01:40.770> many

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
be relatively rare because of how many

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.469 
be relatively rare because of how many
of<00:01:41.070> them<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.369> are<00:01:41.400> actually<00:01:41.759> required<00:01:41.909> for

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
of them that are actually required for

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.499 
of them that are actually required for
each<00:01:42.540> crafting<00:01:43.140> upgrade<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.329> some<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
each crafting upgrade and some of the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.940 
each crafting upgrade and some of the
things<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.780> fell<00:01:45.990> boy<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.380> going<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.560> be<00:01:46.710> used

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
things that fell boy is going to be used

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.880 
things that fell boy is going to be used
for<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.630> stage<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.140> guess<00:01:49.320> five<00:01:49.590> and

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
for is the this stage I guess five and

Eiland<00:02:48.970> skinning<00:02:49.720> we're<00:02:50.140> basically<00:02:50.290> deleted

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
Eiland skinning we're basically deleted

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.380 
Eiland skinning we're basically deleted
from<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.310> game<00:02:51.610> because<00:02:51.970> it<00:02:52.090> would<00:02:52.239> be<00:02:52.270> a

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
from the game because it would be a

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.320 
from the game because it would be a
complete<00:02:52.870> waste<00:02:52.900> of<00:02:53.260> time<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.920> do<00:02:54.820> that<00:02:55.030> to

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
complete waste of time to do that to

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.620 
complete waste of time to do that to
skin<00:02:55.690> I<00:02:55.930> disco<00:02:56.590> skin<00:02:56.920> was<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:57.580> cleft<00:02:57.910> hoofs<00:02:58.209> or

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
skin I disco skin was it cleft hoofs or

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.690 
skin I disco skin was it cleft hoofs or
go<00:02:59.140> mine<00:02:59.410> mines<00:02:59.739> or<00:03:00.100> any<00:03:00.220> of<00:03:00.400> that<00:03:00.430> stuff

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
go mine mines or any of that stuff

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.330 
go mine mines or any of that stuff
because<00:03:01.420> you<00:03:01.570> get<00:03:01.690> so<00:03:01.750> much<00:03:02.170> of<00:03:02.380> it<00:03:02.500> in<00:03:03.100> the

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
because you get so much of it in the

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.460 
because you get so much of it in the
garrison<00:03:03.790> mine<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.270> so<00:03:04.780> many<00:03:04.870> people<00:03:05.080> formed

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
garrison mine and so many people formed

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.740 
garrison mine and so many people formed
a<00:03:05.560> garrison<00:03:05.830> mines<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.910> demand<00:03:07.270> like<00:03:07.600> the

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
a garrison mines the the demand like the

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.930 
a garrison mines the the demand like the
supply<00:03:08.080> is<00:03:08.110> higher<00:03:08.440> than<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:08.770> demand<00:03:09.010> and<00:03:09.459> so

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
supply is higher than the demand and so

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.850 
supply is higher than the demand and so
the<00:03:10.150> price<00:03:10.480> of<00:03:10.690> these<00:03:10.870> are<00:03:11.080> these<00:03:11.350> ores<00:03:11.709> and

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
the price of these are these ores and

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.090 
the price of these are these ores and
the<00:03:12.310> herbs<00:03:12.520> and<00:03:12.820> the<00:03:13.650> sumptuous<00:03:14.650> fur<00:03:14.860> and

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
the herbs and the sumptuous fur and

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.280 
the herbs and the sumptuous fur and
Robbie<00:03:15.489> sides<00:03:15.820> are<00:03:16.120> extremely<00:03:16.780> low<00:03:16.989> because

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
Robbie sides are extremely low because

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.259 
Robbie sides are extremely low because
as<00:03:17.560> I<00:03:17.650> said<00:03:17.799> before<00:03:17.860> there's<00:03:18.640> more<00:03:18.970> of<00:03:19.060> them<00:03:19.150> in

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
as I said before there's more of them in

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.360 
as I said before there's more of them in
the<00:03:19.390> economy<00:03:19.870> than<00:03:20.019> people<00:03:20.320> can<00:03:20.470> use<00:03:20.739> and<00:03:21.040> so

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
the economy than people can use and so

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.220 
the economy than people can use and so
I'm<00:03:21.760> very<00:03:21.940> glad<00:03:22.360> that<00:03:22.480> they're<00:03:22.840> adding<00:03:23.140> a

are a lot of people my mom's one of them
and<00:03:37.870> she<00:03:38.440> used<00:03:38.590> to<00:03:38.680> really<00:03:38.860> like<00:03:39.010> in<00:03:39.220> this

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
and she used to really like in this

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.130 
and she used to really like in this
append<00:03:39.730> aria<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.239> it's<00:03:40.420> like<00:03:40.510> I<00:03:40.660> never<00:03:40.720> I

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
append aria and it's like I never I

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.080 
append aria and it's like I never I
never<00:03:41.170> would<00:03:41.590> do<00:03:41.739> this<00:03:41.920> okay<00:03:42.250> but<00:03:42.670> she'd<00:03:42.940> get

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
never would do this okay but she'd get

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.300 
never would do this okay but she'd get
into<00:03:43.360> this<00:03:43.480> she<00:03:44.260> would<00:03:44.410> just<00:03:44.620> go<00:03:44.769> around<00:03:44.890> jade

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
into this she would just go around jade

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.640 
into this she would just go around jade
forest<00:03:45.790> and<00:03:46.000> just<00:03:46.450> mind<00:03:46.690> go<00:03:46.870> sign<00:03:47.110> or<00:03:47.380> and<00:03:47.560> it

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
forest and just mind go sign or and it

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.440 
forest and just mind go sign or and it
was<00:03:47.769> really<00:03:47.980> uh<00:03:48.400> I<00:03:48.820> guess<00:03:49.269> like<00:03:49.390> maybe

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
was really uh I guess like maybe

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.280 
was really uh I guess like maybe
therapeutic<00:03:50.230> or<00:03:50.799> relaxing<00:03:51.580> for<00:03:51.790> her<00:03:51.970> and

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
therapeutic or relaxing for her and

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.240 
therapeutic or relaxing for her and
obviously<00:03:53.290> in<00:03:53.410> wars<00:03:53.620> are<00:03:53.769> doing<00:03:53.950> or<00:03:54.040> that's

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
obviously in wars are doing or that's

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.910 
obviously in wars are doing or that's
not<00:03:54.370> really<00:03:54.730> a<00:03:54.970> viable<00:03:55.720> option<00:03:56.140> compared<00:03:56.830> to

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
not really a viable option compared to

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.199 
not really a viable option compared to
all<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.070> other<00:03:57.190> things<00:03:57.580> and<00:03:57.880> the<00:03:57.940> fact<00:03:58.120> that

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
all the other things and the fact that

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.460 
all the other things and the fact that
you<00:03:58.330> can<00:03:58.480> just<00:03:58.600> log<00:03:58.780> on<00:03:58.930> from<00:03:59.049> one<00:03:59.260> character

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
you can just log on from one character

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.949 
you can just log on from one character
to<00:03:59.620> another<00:03:59.769> and<00:04:00.160> just<00:04:00.760> increasingly<00:04:01.269> or<00:04:01.630> you

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
to another and just increasingly or you

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.740 
to another and just increasingly or you
know<00:04:02.049> I<00:04:02.080> guess<00:04:02.320> I<00:04:02.350> constantly<00:04:03.010> mine<00:04:03.730> your<00:04:04.480> mind

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
know I guess I constantly mine your mind

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.030 
know I guess I constantly mine your mind
your<00:04:04.810> mind<00:04:04.930> over<00:04:05.260> and<00:04:05.380> over<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:05.709> so<00:04:05.830> what's

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
your mind over and over and so what's

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.830 
your mind over and over and so what's
the<00:04:06.190> point<00:04:06.370> really<00:04:06.610> to<00:04:06.880> go<00:04:07.000> out<00:04:07.120> in<00:04:07.269> mine<00:04:07.480> if

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
the point really to go out in mine if

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.270 
the point really to go out in mine if
you<00:04:07.959> can<00:04:08.170> just<00:04:08.200> sit<00:04:08.530> in<00:04:08.590> your<00:04:08.620> garrison<00:04:08.980> in

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
you can just sit in your garrison in

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.380 
you can just sit in your garrison in
mine<00:04:09.489> and<00:04:09.790> then<00:04:09.880> oh<00:04:09.940> there's<00:04:10.150> another<00:04:10.209> one

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
mine and then oh there's another one

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.850 
mine and then oh there's another one
three<00:04:10.720> feet<00:04:10.900> away<00:04:10.989> from<00:04:11.170> that<00:04:11.260> one<00:04:11.440> there's<00:04:11.680> no

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
three feet away from that one there's no

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.470 
three feet away from that one there's no
13<00:04:12.100> feet<00:04:12.280> away<00:04:12.340> for<00:04:12.519> that<00:04:12.610> one<00:04:12.730> you<00:04:13.150> run<00:04:13.329> out<00:04:13.420> of

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
13 feet away for that one you run out of

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.850 
13 feet away for that one you run out of
mines<00:04:13.720> in<00:04:13.900> that<00:04:14.110> character<00:04:14.380> you<00:04:14.560> just<00:04:14.709> all

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
mines in that character you just all

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.909 
mines in that character you just all
don't<00:04:15.010> know<00:04:15.100> another<00:04:15.310> character<00:04:15.790> and<00:04:16.000> so<00:04:16.919> I

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
don't know another character and so I

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.770 
don't know another character and so I
think<00:04:18.220> garrisons<00:04:18.820> of<00:04:18.880> it<00:04:19.030> having<00:04:19.299> validate<00:04:19.720> at

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
think garrisons of it having validate at

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.570 
think garrisons of it having validate at
a<00:04:19.870> lot<00:04:20.019> I<00:04:20.169> mean<00:04:20.320> I<00:04:20.470> think<00:04:20.829> that<00:04:21.100> you<00:04:21.190> guys<00:04:21.250> know

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
a lot I mean I think that you guys know

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.730 
a lot I mean I think that you guys know
that<00:04:21.609> I'm<00:04:21.849> not<00:04:22.090> really<00:04:22.240> a<00:04:22.330> big<00:04:22.510> fan<00:04:22.570> of<00:04:23.080> the<00:04:23.590> way

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
that I'm not really a big fan of the way

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.700 
that I'm not really a big fan of the way
Garrison's<00:04:24.370> change<00:04:25.120> professions<00:04:25.840> but<00:04:26.440> I

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
Garrison's change professions but I

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
Garrison's change professions but I
don't<00:04:26.919> think<00:04:27.039> anybody's

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
don't think anybody's

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:28.980 
don't think anybody's
really<00:04:27.880> a<00:04:27.910> big<00:04:28.090> fan<00:04:28.120> of<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.660> way<00:04:28.780> the

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
really a big fan of the way the

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.470 
really a big fan of the way the
garrisons<00:04:29.730> completely<00:04:30.730> removed<00:04:31.030> three<00:04:31.360> of

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
garrisons completely removed three of

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.720 
garrisons completely removed three of
them<00:04:31.630> and<00:04:32.070> with<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.250> fact<00:04:33.460> that<00:04:33.580> that's

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
them and with the fact that that's

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.160 
them and with the fact that that's
fishing<00:04:34.060> I<00:04:34.390> think<00:04:34.570> there's<00:04:34.720> a<00:04:34.780> lot<00:04:34.870> of<00:04:34.930> people

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
fishing I think there's a lot of people

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.110 
fishing I think there's a lot of people
who<00:04:35.290> said<00:04:35.500> that<00:04:35.650> it's<00:04:35.950> unfair<00:04:36.490> to<00:04:36.550> do<00:04:36.910> this

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
who said that it's unfair to do this

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.790 
who said that it's unfair to do this
because<00:04:37.390> they<00:04:37.720> drop<00:04:38.050> their<00:04:38.290> gathering

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
because they drop their gathering

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.440 
because they drop their gathering
profession<00:04:39.340> halfway<00:04:39.760> or<00:04:39.940> as<00:04:40.090> soon<00:04:40.210> as<00:04:40.360> they

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
profession halfway or as soon as they

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.810 
profession halfway or as soon as they
realize<00:04:40.600> that<00:04:40.840> it<00:04:40.930> wasn't<00:04:41.080> useful<00:04:41.350> I<00:04:41.790> really<00:04:42.790> I

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
realize that it wasn't useful I really I

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.850 
realize that it wasn't useful I really I
honestly<00:04:43.780> I<00:04:43.840> think<00:04:44.020> that<00:04:44.350> that's<00:04:44.440> kind<00:04:44.710> of

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
honestly I think that that's kind of

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.280 
honestly I think that that's kind of
that's<00:04:45.100> kind<00:04:45.460> of<00:04:45.520> stupid<00:04:45.760> because<00:04:46.290> honestly

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
that's kind of stupid because honestly

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.680 
that's kind of stupid because honestly
you<00:04:47.650> can<00:04:48.220> you<00:04:48.550> can<00:04:48.730> reel<00:04:48.940> eville<00:04:49.240> any<00:04:49.480> other

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
you can you can reel eville any other

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.510 
you can you can reel eville any other
profession<00:04:50.260> you<00:04:50.470> want<00:04:50.680> especially<00:04:51.280> with<00:04:51.400> the

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
profession you want especially with the

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.240 
profession you want especially with the
ketchup<00:04:51.910> kits<00:04:52.150> that<00:04:52.300> they<00:04:52.450> have<00:04:52.630> now<00:04:52.840> and<00:04:53.250> also

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
ketchup kits that they have now and also

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.010 
ketchup kits that they have now and also
on<00:04:54.520> top<00:04:54.700> of<00:04:54.820> that<00:04:54.910> fishing<00:04:55.420> is<00:04:55.600> one<00:04:55.840> of<00:04:55.960> the

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
on top of that fishing is one of the

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.740 
on top of that fishing is one of the
things<00:04:56.230> that<00:04:56.320> you<00:04:56.500> can<00:04:56.650> get<00:04:56.890> the<00:04:57.700> FL<00:04:58.510> blight

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
things that you can get the FL blight

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.930 
things that you can get the FL blight
from<00:04:59.050> and<00:04:59.320> so<00:04:59.770> it's<00:04:59.980> not<00:05:00.160> like<00:05:00.400> this<00:05:00.550> is<00:05:00.610> going

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
from and so it's not like this is going

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.460 
from and so it's not like this is going
to<00:05:01.030> be<00:05:01.150> completely<00:05:01.660> you're<00:05:02.170> going<00:05:02.290> to<00:05:02.380> be

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
to be completely you're going to be

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.960 
to be completely you're going to be
completely<00:05:02.740> locked<00:05:03.040> out<00:05:03.220> of<00:05:03.280> this<00:05:03.520> if<00:05:03.790> you

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
completely locked out of this if you

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.600 
completely locked out of this if you
don't<00:05:04.000> have<00:05:04.420> a<00:05:04.620> gathering<00:05:05.620> profession<00:05:06.340> and<00:05:06.490> so

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
those are two things that are pretty

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.870 
those are two things that are pretty

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
the the the gains outweigh the the

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120

jungle<00:06:17.410> farming<00:06:17.800> this<00:06:17.980> stuff<00:06:18.220> and<00:06:18.640> just

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 
jungle farming this stuff and just

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.670 
jungle farming this stuff and just
report<00:06:19.420> them<00:06:19.570> like<00:06:19.840> wizard<00:06:20.230> might<00:06:20.470> do

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
something about it they might not and I

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.450 
something about it they might not and I
think<00:06:23.080> that's<00:06:23.470> the<00:06:23.560> same<00:06:23.740> with<00:06:23.860> anything<00:06:24.250> like

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
think that's the same with anything like

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.100 
think that's the same with anything like
to<00:06:24.640> think<00:06:24.850> that<00:06:24.910> I<00:06:25.030> think<00:06:25.450> it's<00:06:25.570> kind<00:06:25.720> of<00:06:25.750> naive

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
to think that I think it's kind of naive

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.380 
to think that I think it's kind of naive
to<00:06:26.680> think<00:06:26.710> that<00:06:26.920> people<00:06:27.100> can't<00:06:27.490> setup<00:06:27.760> box<00:06:28.000> to

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.390 
to think that people can't setup box to

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.510 
to think that people can't setup box to
do<00:06:28.510> things<00:06:28.750> right<00:06:28.810> now<00:06:28.990> in<00:06:29.290> the<00:06:29.410> game<00:06:29.560> with

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
do things right now in the game with

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.060 
do things right now in the game with
other<00:06:30.700> things<00:06:31.030> and<00:06:31.330> just<00:06:32.200> adding<00:06:32.620> some<00:06:32.650> sort

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070 
other things and just adding some sort

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.890 
other things and just adding some sort
of<00:06:33.130> a<00:06:33.280> an<00:06:33.670> incentive<00:06:34.390> to<00:06:34.420> have<00:06:34.630> a<00:06:34.660> gathering

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:34.900 
of a an incentive to have a gathering

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.720 
of a an incentive to have a gathering
profession<00:06:35.530> is<00:06:35.680> encouraging<00:06:36.190> balance<00:06:36.550> i<00:06:36.700> I

profession is encouraging balance i I

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.250 
profession is encouraging balance i I
really<00:06:37.030> don't<00:06:37.420> think<00:06:37.600> that's<00:06:37.810> fair<00:06:38.020> to<00:06:38.080> the

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:38.260 
really don't think that's fair to the

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.540 
really don't think that's fair to the
people<00:06:38.290> who<00:06:38.650> have<00:06:38.920> these<00:06:39.130> gathering

people who have these gathering

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.320 
people who have these gathering
professions<00:06:39.730> and

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.330 
professions and

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.089

professions have been invalidated by
actually<00:06:44.060> the<00:06:44.150> entire<00:06:44.419> expansion<00:06:44.780> really<00:06:45.229> it

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620 
people a meaningful path to you know get

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:58.450 
people a meaningful path to you know get
something<00:06:57.979> out<00:06:58.099> of<00:06:58.129> their<00:06:58.310> profession

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460 
something out of their profession

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.159 
something out of their profession
because<00:06:59.000> i<00:06:59.419> don't<00:06:59.750> really<00:06:59.870> think<00:07:00.050> that

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:00.169 
because i don't really think that

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:01.779 
because i don't really think that
they've<00:07:00.379> had<00:07:00.560> that<00:07:00.710> option<00:07:00.919> for<00:07:01.280> the<00:07:01.520> entire

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:01.789 
they've had that option for the entire

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:04.719 
they've had that option for the entire
expansion<00:07:02.090> and<00:07:02.419> so<00:07:02.960> if<00:07:03.860> you<00:07:03.919> guys<00:07:04.159> don't<00:07:04.490> know

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:21.289 
the data mining changes and i didn't see

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:23.020 
the data mining changes and i didn't see
anything<00:07:21.500> like<00:07:21.680> that<00:07:21.800> that<00:07:21.979> it<00:07:22.280> was<00:07:22.400> a<00:07:22.430> bible

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:23.030 
anything like that that it was a bible

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.450 
anything like that that it was a bible
with<00:07:23.180> crappy<00:07:23.419> primal<00:07:24.349> spirits<00:07:24.710> and<00:07:24.919> so<00:07:25.430> I

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:25.460 
with crappy primal spirits and so I

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.550 
with crappy primal spirits and so I
can't<00:07:25.819> really<00:07:25.940> say<00:07:26.180> for<00:07:26.210> sure<00:07:26.419> but<00:07:26.569> it<00:07:27.199> doesn't

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:27.560 
can't really say for sure but it doesn't

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.080 
can't really say for sure but it doesn't
really<00:07:27.710> seem<00:07:27.979> that<00:07:28.009> way<00:07:28.310> and<00:07:28.520> so<00:07:28.669> hopefully<00:07:28.819> it

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:29.090 
really seem that way and so hopefully it

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.189 
really seem that way and so hopefully it
stays<00:07:29.240> that<00:07:29.300> way<00:07:29.509> is<00:07:29.780> something<00:07:30.110> that's

00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:30.199 
stays that way is something that's

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:32.260 
stays that way is something that's
unique<00:07:30.440> that<00:07:31.430> only<00:07:31.580> people<00:07:31.849> with<00:07:32.060> gathering

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:32.270 
unique that only people with gathering

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.999 
unique that only people with gathering
professions<00:07:32.599> to<00:07:33.050> get<00:07:33.199> so<00:07:33.349> they<00:07:33.469> can<00:07:33.620> have<00:07:33.710> some

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:34.009 
professions to get so they can have some

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:35.769 
professions to get so they can have some
sort<00:07:34.190> of<00:07:34.279> niche<00:07:34.520> in<00:07:34.819> the<00:07:34.879> economy<00:07:35.449> because

00:07:35.769 --> 00:07:35.779 
sort of niche in the economy because

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:37.869 
sort of niche in the economy because
right<00:07:35.960> now<00:07:35.990> of<00:07:36.289> course<00:07:36.500> they<00:07:37.400> really<00:07:37.729> don't

00:07:37.869 --> 00:07:37.879 
right now of course they really don't

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:40.269 
right now of course they really don't
have<00:07:38.060> one<00:07:38.270> and<00:07:38.449> so<00:07:38.900> I<00:07:38.930> hope<00:07:39.500> that<00:07:39.740> you<00:07:39.889> guys<00:07:40.039> are
