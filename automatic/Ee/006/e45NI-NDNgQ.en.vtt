one and then save this image of course

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.630 
one and then save this image of course
these<00:01:04.549> these<00:01:05.549> ways<00:01:05.760> both<00:01:06.090> take<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> lot<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.080> time

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
these these ways both take a lot of time

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.679 
these these ways both take a lot of time
so<00:01:08.640> I'm<00:01:08.729> going<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.909> show<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.299> best<00:01:09.450> way

border around there and what happens is
this<00:02:19.859> the<00:02:20.519> program<00:02:20.879> things<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.329> the<00:02:21.450> entire

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
this the program things that the entire

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
sprite sheet is one image and that's not

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.880 
sprite sheet is one image and that's not
going<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.230> work<00:02:25.349> so<00:02:26.569> open<00:02:27.569> it<00:02:27.719> with<00:02:28.019> paint

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
going to work so open it with paint

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.580 
going to work so open it with paint
click<00:02:29.819> on<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.090> background<00:02:30.329> color<00:02:30.840> choose<00:02:31.349> the

fill to take white black press save and

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.759 
fill to take white black press save and
now<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:44.040> should<00:02:44.489> work<00:02:45.260> another<00:02:46.260> problem<00:02:46.739> you

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
now it should work another problem you

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.819 
now it should work another problem you
might<00:02:47.010> encounter<00:02:47.370> is<00:02:47.879> it<00:02:48.419> thinks<00:02:49.049> that<00:02:49.079> two

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
might encounter is it thinks that two

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:55.729 
might encounter is it thinks that two
sprites<00:02:50.340> are<00:02:50.639> actually<00:02:51.299> one<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:55.500> this

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
sprites are actually one and this

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.379 
sprites are actually one and this
happens<00:02:56.099> when<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.370> sprites<00:02:56.700> are<00:02:56.909> too<00:02:57.120> close

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:57.389 
happens when the sprites are too close

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:59.869 
happens when the sprites are too close
together<00:02:57.599> and<00:02:58.139> what<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.680> have<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.189> do<00:02:59.310> then<00:02:59.639> is

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
together and what you have to do then is

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.479 
together and what you have to do then is
click<00:03:00.239> on<00:03:00.450> options<00:03:01.139> and<00:03:01.469> the<00:03:01.950> max<00:03:02.219> distance

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
click on options and the max distance

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.599 
click on options and the max distance
between<00:03:02.849> pixels<00:03:03.269> changes<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.469> 1<00:03:04.829> which<00:03:05.430> is<00:03:05.459> the

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
between pixels changes to 1 which is the

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:11.119 
between pixels changes to 1 which is the
lowest<00:03:06.109> press<00:03:07.109> updating<00:03:07.769> close<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:10.530> now<00:03:10.889> it

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
lowest press updating close and now it

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.179 
lowest press updating close and now it
will<00:03:11.370> have<00:03:11.669> separated<00:03:12.329> the<00:03:12.719> images<00:03:13.079> if<00:03:13.769> it<00:03:14.069> has

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
will have separated the images if it has

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:17.330 
will have separated the images if it has
separated<00:03:14.730> images<00:03:15.209> that<00:03:15.419> you<00:03:15.780> want<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.889> be<00:03:17.040> one

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
separated images that you want to be one

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.580 
separated images that you want to be one
sprite<00:03:17.729> click<00:03:18.720> on<00:03:19.079> all<00:03:19.949> the<00:03:20.519> parts<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.590> then

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
sprite click on all the parts and then

click combine selection and it will do
exactly<00:03:31.049> that<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.859> will<00:03:32.099> combine<00:03:32.400> the

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
exactly that it will combine the

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.469 
exactly that it will combine the
selection<00:03:34.189> so<00:03:35.189> I<00:03:35.220> hope<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:35.909> found<00:03:36.090> this<00:03:36.269> video
