two liners in there which is the spring

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.570 
two liners in there which is the spring
and<00:01:22.170> if<00:01:22.440> you<00:01:22.530> take<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.860> out<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.220> blade<00:01:23.400> can

I<00:01:26.460> did<00:01:27.030> have<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.240> bend<00:01:27.480> the<00:01:27.600> liner<00:01:27.780> out<00:01:27.900> a

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
I did have to bend the liner out a

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.210 
I did have to bend the liner out a
little<00:01:28.290> bit<00:01:28.440> this<00:01:28.590> way<00:01:28.770> because<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.130> was

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
little bit this way because it was

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.530 
little bit this way because it was
pushing<00:01:29.550> into<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.790> blade<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.360> when<00:01:30.480> I

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
pushing into the blade and so when I

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.060 
pushing into the blade and so when I
would<00:01:30.720> close<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.080> would<00:01:31.200> kind<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.530> snatch<00:01:31.830> on

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
would close it would kind of snatch on

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.350 
would close it would kind of snatch on
the<00:01:32.220> spring<00:01:33.320> but<00:01:34.400> there's<00:01:35.400> no<00:01:35.520> biggie<00:01:35.760> this

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
the spring but there's no biggie this

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.180 
the spring but there's no biggie this
thing<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.750> really<00:01:37.110> smooth<00:01:37.560> as<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:37.980> see

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
thing is really smooth as you can see

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.590 
thing is really smooth as you can see
this<00:01:38.850> closes<00:01:39.330> itself<00:01:40.790> very<00:01:41.790> very<00:01:42.060> nice<00:01:42.330> i

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600
