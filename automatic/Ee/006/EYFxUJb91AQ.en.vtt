00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
competitor I would say - cruising in in

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.190 
competitor I would say - cruising in in
its<00:01:36.509> price<00:01:36.750> point<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.439> availability<00:01:39.200> but

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
its price point and availability but

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.380 
its price point and availability but
it's<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:41.070> kind<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.400> become<00:01:41.640> available<00:01:42.030> here

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
it's just kind of become available here

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.330 
it's just kind of become available here
I<00:01:42.720> don't<00:01:42.960> have<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.290> many<00:01:43.530> products<00:01:44.130> as

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
I don't have it many products as

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.370 
I don't have it many products as
cruising<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.270> think<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.810> regard<00:01:46.049> they

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
cruising so I think in that regard they

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.130 
cruising so I think in that regard they
don't<00:01:46.530> really<00:01:46.799> win<00:01:47.390> at<00:01:48.390> least<00:01:48.659> around<00:01:48.780> here

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
don't really win at least around here

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.160 
don't really win at least around here
and<00:01:49.790> from<00:01:50.790> what<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.000> understand<00:01:51.509> having<00:01:51.840> talked

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
and from what I understand having talked

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.830 
and from what I understand having talked
to<00:01:52.380> people<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.860> industry<00:01:53.689> one<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
to people in the industry one of the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.260 
to people in the industry one of the
best<00:01:55.110> ways<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.350> really<00:01:55.799> take<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.670> market<00:01:57.119> is

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
best ways to really take the market is

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.160 
best ways to really take the market is
you<00:01:58.130> make<00:01:59.130> lots<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.790> variants<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.540> sizes<00:02:01.140> to

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
you make lots of variants and sizes to

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.929 
you make lots of variants and sizes to
your<00:02:01.469> alcohol<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.430> takes<00:02:02.640> up<00:02:02.820> more

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
your alcohol so that it takes up more

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.719 
your alcohol so that it takes up more

here this is a more of a Coke Zero style

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.290 
here this is a more of a Coke Zero style
so<00:06:07.390> it's<00:06:07.510> not<00:06:07.630> as<00:06:07.900> sweet<00:06:09.000> they<00:06:10.000> have<00:06:10.150> their<00:06:10.270> own

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
so it's not as sweet they have their own

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.560

Coke<00:06:10.630> Zero<00:06:10.660> and<00:06:11.140> SodaStream<00:06:11.650> so<00:06:12.420> you<00:06:13.420> could

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:13.570 
Coke Zero and SodaStream so you could
