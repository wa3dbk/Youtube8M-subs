print out and at first you'll cut out
the<00:00:30.260> whole<00:00:30.440> thing<00:00:30.859> and<00:00:31.130> then<00:00:32.090> you'll<00:00:32.300> cut<00:00:32.629> that

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
the whole thing and then you'll cut that

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.829 
the whole thing and then you'll cut that
from<00:00:34.420> form<00:00:35.530> horrible<00:00:36.530> word<00:00:36.739> and<00:00:37.629> then<00:00:38.629> you'll

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
and i have put front on there because

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.910 
and i have put front on there because
what<00:00:43.579> I<00:00:43.609> discovered<00:00:44.059> is<00:00:44.329> it<00:00:45.199> doesn't<00:00:45.710> fit

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
what I discovered is it doesn't fit

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.459 
what I discovered is it doesn't fit
every<00:00:46.489> single<00:00:46.879> way<00:00:46.999> so<00:00:47.359> you<00:00:48.049> find<00:00:48.260> the<00:00:48.350> way

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
every single way so you find the way

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.059 
every single way so you find the way
that<00:00:48.710> it<00:00:48.949> fits<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:49.940> easiest<00:00:50.629> and<00:00:50.989> if<00:00:51.799> you're

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:52.069 
that it fits the easiest and if you're

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:54.910 
that it fits the easiest and if you're
like<00:00:52.280> me<00:00:52.609> and<00:00:52.850> you're<00:00:53.479> a<00:00:53.539> messy<00:00:54.199> foam<00:00:54.499> core

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
like me and you're a messy foam core

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.399 
like me and you're a messy foam core
board<00:00:54.949> cutter<00:00:55.579> you<00:00:56.239> may<00:00:56.420> need<00:00:56.569> to<00:00:56.629> sand<00:00:57.109> your

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:57.409 
board cutter you may need to sand your

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:03.939 
board cutter you may need to sand your
edges<00:01:00.190> now<00:01:01.190> before<00:01:01.579> I<00:01:02.709> glue<00:01:03.709> these<00:01:03.889> pieces

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
edges now before I glue these pieces

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.800 
edges now before I glue these pieces
together<00:01:04.430> I<00:01:04.940> want<00:01:05.360> to<00:01:05.570> put<00:01:05.810> a<00:01:05.960> hole<00:01:06.290> in<00:01:06.320> here

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
together I want to put a hole in here

together I want to put a hole in here
after<00:01:08.810> you've<00:01:08.990> punched<00:01:09.260> your<00:01:09.500> holes<00:01:09.850> take

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
after you've punched your holes take

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.510 
after you've punched your holes take
something<00:01:11.390> that's<00:01:11.690> fairly<00:01:12.550> smooth<00:01:15.340> drag<00:01:16.340> it

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
something that's fairly smooth drag it

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.150 
something that's fairly smooth drag it
across<00:01:16.610> there<00:01:17.270> between<00:01:17.480> the<00:01:17.840> holes<00:01:18.160> with

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
across there between the holes with

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.410 
across there between the holes with
extreme<00:01:19.820> prejudice<00:01:21.970> that's<00:01:22.970> going<00:01:23.210> to<00:01:23.300> help

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
extreme prejudice that's going to help

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.660 
extreme prejudice that's going to help
your<00:01:23.600> wire<00:01:23.840> laid<00:01:24.140> flat<00:01:27.160> and<00:01:28.160> this<00:01:28.310> is<00:01:28.460> nice

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
your wire laid flat and this is nice

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.020 
your wire laid flat and this is nice
this<00:01:29.480> coated<00:01:29.960> wire<00:01:30.250> because<00:01:31.250> you<00:01:31.790> won't<00:01:32.000> be

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
this coated wire because you won't be

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.670 
this coated wire because you won't be
poking<00:01:32.480> yourself<00:01:32.600> with<00:01:33.140> the<00:01:33.260> little<00:01:33.470> frayed

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
poking yourself with the little frayed

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.520 
poking yourself with the little frayed
ends<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:34.670> just<00:01:35.540> fish<00:01:35.780> it<00:01:35.810> through<00:01:37.360> and<00:01:38.530> pull

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
ends and just fish it through and pull

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.890 
ends and just fish it through and pull
it<00:01:39.560> tight<00:01:42.910> and<00:01:43.910> you<00:01:44.180> can<00:01:44.300> put<00:01:44.510> a<00:01:44.540> piece<00:01:44.720> of<00:01:44.750> tape

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
it tight and you can put a piece of tape

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.810 
it tight and you can put a piece of tape
over<00:01:45.260> it<00:01:45.470> if<00:01:45.770> you<00:01:45.920> want<00:01:46.130> to<00:01:46.280> to<00:01:46.430> hold<00:01:46.610> it<00:01:46.730> in

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
over it if you want to to hold it in

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.770 
over it if you want to to hold it in
place<00:01:46.850> but<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.510> glue<00:01:47.780> should<00:01:48.110> work<00:01:48.290> just<00:01:48.320> fine

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
place but the glue should work just fine

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.649 
place but the glue should work just fine
and<00:01:50.950> then<00:01:51.950> you're<00:01:52.340> going<00:01:52.550> to<00:01:52.790> wrap<00:01:53.030> it<00:01:53.090> around

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
and then you're going to wrap it around

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:02.130 
and then you're going to wrap it around
itself

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.430 

now<00:02:03.140> let's<00:02:03.410> put<00:02:03.710> some<00:02:05.260> aleene's<00:02:06.260> original

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
now let's put some aleene's original

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
now let's put some aleene's original
tacky<00:02:06.860> glue<00:02:07.250> on<00:02:07.610> and<00:02:08.270> then<00:02:09.170> we<00:02:09.380> will<00:02:09.590> spread<00:02:10.220> it

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
tacky glue on and then we will spread it

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.100 
tacky glue on and then we will spread it
out<00:02:11.590> so<00:02:12.590> that<00:02:12.620> there's<00:02:13.070> immediate<00:02:13.930> suction<00:02:14.930> we

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
out so that there's immediate suction we

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.640 
out so that there's immediate suction we
set<00:02:15.530> down<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.950> top<00:02:16.130> piece<00:02:16.400> I<00:02:17.230> have<00:02:18.230> lots<00:02:18.410> of
