00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.860
 hello to all today we get 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.050
 find for 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:32.620
 I will introduce you if a 2011 agent 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:33.930
 beta one in 100 are so the 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:38.550
 dialing 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.760
 so we look like that 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.530
 that's what we've known for a long time 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.710
 since the wake of words say that but 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.540
 it can change so the application 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:53.160
 learned that few changes I 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.870
 show you the lodge tac 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.540
 now it's eating like that 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.699
 section them first and then it limits 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:07.740
 8h40 we click on ok we can say that he 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.740
 learns to change the ringtones so who 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.170
 makes sense to wake up 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:18.770
 again suppressing paul so canceled 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:21.770
 so the dollar comes back from a scrub more 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.770
 breadth 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:32.100
 so we can add more a little 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.510
 I took my taxes like that all 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.370
 the little details it works rather 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.510
 well 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.760
 What can I do for you 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.480
 show the keyboard so they could 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.480
 kat bullish kit 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.140
 so since pete four cities all 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.250
 to have an explanation they resist 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:04.190
 badly that the city are screaming so that they 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:04.190
 have also so here is hello 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:20.920
 learned changes so he visited 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:24.480
 the parameter pane so the city 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.480
 like parameters has also been changed 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.550
 So here is the summer also changed so 12 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.510
 if google labs google has not been 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:38.140
 so added and you I believe that we 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.840
 can put it spread in the presence of 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.990
 flash so by putting himself in the 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.580
 fridge standby or mode and the flash and I 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.860
 think a video if I can find 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.330
 I will make a video how do you google 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.370
 armed for that must see andric so 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.440
 what can i still show to 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.850
 what you forget so the 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.360
 applications when the moves on the 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.290
 SD card 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.220
 and then we restart only device 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.420
 can quit the application 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.550
 harmonious duceppe that's throwing 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.100
 gamers and is named as the app 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.750
 stopped yet and the weaver 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.330
 present in applications this is 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.790
 we just moved in Part 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.150
 was going after the restart spasfon that 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.150
 existed 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.580
 these apps are on my map sd 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.050
 so if I add his vk in the smell if 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.670
 never on the SD card and I restart 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.860
 appears that I will be able to leave 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.060
 application 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.530
 so the parameters are at 100 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.640
 now I've shown it's 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:45.209
 really from a 42.2 quest and that at age 34 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.209
 of works 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.950
 you 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:04:01.860
 what is waiting for two penalty icons like that 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:01.860
 it's something of 2,500 m here 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.500
 I do not have it but it was 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.500
 add common 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.360
 how good the widget to doctors on 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.060
 an empty space on the screen in question 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.459
 application challenge budget 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.780
 we are offered widgets 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:26.220
 for example it's the police is actually 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.730
 pretty much a new page actually 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.350
 as if sure 4.2 it was five pages 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.020
 and then who can do solid and 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.000
 continues there in fact that can put the 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.670
 so many pages tube hours actually 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.770
 it's got to choose when you remove 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:46.760
 a widget the page is that price but 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.760
 this crime and the fast 

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:54.679
 only remains for the flash of 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:56.659
 google 9 if I had if I get to 

00:04:54.679 --> 00:05:00.289
 find something I will say the 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:04.179
 wolves to see show that we can 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:10.159
 flash yes two no and so 

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:13.429
 unloading changes now 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:17.239
 the interface is where we go 

00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:19.429
 to do is the test of the spreaders 

00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:22.779
 it's something beautiful finally me 

00:05:19.429 --> 00:05:22.779
 because it did not please at all 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.330
 1 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.480
 here 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.900
 so 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.900
 in vain 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.689
 at 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:39.980
 the 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:42.100
 in 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.100
 it 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:55.610
 [Music] 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.630
 so we put it back for example what is 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.670
 of course kit kat 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.070
 is that on the screen of 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:04.240
 lock in fact we have the little 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.240
 music budget 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.750
 the cover of music wholesale 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.460
 every night is most of my time 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.040
 cut-out windows cover kits 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.960
 already discovered music or album 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.160
 this is so in quest they will not have to 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.480
 his promises the wallpaper he 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:22.670
 replaces the times often defended 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:27.820
 gonelle lean 2 or sting your in 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:38.810
 added that even for the old series of 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:39.800
 of course alphand so i have seen that 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.290
 this is a reform version one of the 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.480
 little bugs and warts the phone 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.890
 it takes time to get along well seen 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.870
 that it's an alpha version I think that 

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.570
 in the gym update everything will be 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.520
 changed and I hope we can find 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:56.690
 find google and it will not be able to 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:58.990
 find I will surely make video or who 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.990
 will 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.730
 a video that will explain how you 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:07.430
 loose and or throw between phone 

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:10.100
 but before that I think we need to 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:12.050
 this team so define his beta without 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:15.490
 I'm doing right now and the videos and 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.490
 I will explain how to let go
