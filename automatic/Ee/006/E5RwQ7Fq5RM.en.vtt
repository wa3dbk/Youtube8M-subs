00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.890
 hello very good to all and welcome to 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.389
 a new video of win was a meter already 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.340
 you know yesterday was launched in the new 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.170
 build for windows movile in this case 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.240
 it's about build 10.512 in yesterday 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.860
 it is the same information we comment 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.960
 some of the novelties that it brings 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.309
 brings this new this new life though 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.520
 most are about improvements and 

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:28.500
 arrangements to the system the first of them 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.300
 the first of the novelties that are 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.700
 general improvements in stability and 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.040
 operating system performance in 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.250
 this sense I am testing with the same 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.300
 dancing in a number 535 has improved 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.730
 sensibly in this sense but the 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.260
 known problems of this terminal with 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.269
 the sensitivity of the touch screen is not 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.789
 have been resolved and had to go to 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:53.609
 solve in the future still have 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.489
 improved in this case with this new 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:58.469
 build but very little very little I hope that 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.260
 be resolved but everything that is going to 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.070
 solve already I say another novelty of 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.150
 done I think the most important novelty 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.270
 is power from the photography from 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.850
 the photo application 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:19.000
 can configure it for that photograph 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.110
 as background image of the screen as 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.750
 background image of the screen of 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:27.710
 start or lock screen 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:31.100
 and it's pretty easy here we have it 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.340
 let's go to a photograph and from this 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.900
 menu already says it can establish as 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.870
 background on the lock screen or how 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.190
 background of the home screen we are going to 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.050
 set it as wallpaper 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.940
 lock so you can see the one take a 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.940
 Tiny in doing it 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.580
 meanwhile I will continue commenting 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.200
 other news 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.000
 The problem has also been fixed 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.340
 the applications installed in the 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.870
 microsd cards that do not work 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.550
 after restart 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.210
 it has also been improved in the accommodation of 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.460
 such in the children's corner 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.490
 at the time the children's corner of 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.070
 windows mobile and I have not appreciated 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.170
 an important change is still working 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.740
 pretty good here we already have it 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.740
 configured 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:25.340
 if we are going to unblock it, we have it 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:26.180
 image already on the core screen it 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.739
 will do the same also in the 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.049
 home screen without the need to go 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.610
 as up to now to the section of 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.709
 customization configuration 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.000
 in addition to the improvements he has commented 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.040
 solution has been given to some of the 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.260
 problems that the system had as per 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.819
 example the error that prevented access to 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.200
 the camera with the phone locked in 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.269
 this case could not prove it because 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.189
 the number 535 does not have a button 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.959
 dedicated to the camera but I guess it's 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:50.030
 will have solved in the case of 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.790
 terminals that do have this button 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.799
 with this physical button another of the 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.909
 problems that has also been fixed 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.560
 has been the problem where 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.959
 text message notifications 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.459
 entrants did not appear in this case 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.359
 I've been able to prove it but I take it for granted 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:07.310
 also that have been resolved is arranged 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:09.170
 also the failure of the touch screen 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.340
 that did not respond after finishing a 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.409
 phone call in some 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.470
 devices in this case in mine yes 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:18.049
 yes it works quite well and I did not have 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.000
 No problem at the time nor neither 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.290
 that I returned again received 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.470
 a call and I did not have that 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.760
 problem 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.590
 they also came out a failure of the 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.630
 superposition of the text in the post of the 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.420
 times in terms of detected failures 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.160
 in this good version with the use 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.750
 shared internet from the phone 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.750
 it does not work I've tried it 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.120
 that we can go from here 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.120
 I've already tried it and it does not work 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.180
 what else 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.650
 the verification of the steps of your 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.630
 Microsoft account with your number 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.550
 phone does not work either 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.380
 phones may take too long in the 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.940
 Data migration after the use 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.180
 after the update in this case 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.400
 if it has happened to me and you just have to 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.410
 wait a bit and until the process 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.680
 end and there will not be any 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.569
 problem 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.489
 also the applications that use the 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.370
 audio in the background as is the case 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:16.519
 of the music of brow the groove or 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.720
 podcast or et cetera for when 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.549
 run after receiving a 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.220
 update from the store you have to 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.789
 restart the device and it is solved 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.740
 the problem also other one of the 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:29.479
 problems that has also been seen but 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.050
 that in my case has not happened and that 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:34.340
 I have I think I have quite styles 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.259
 but in some phone with many 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.370
 with many mosaics anchored to the 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.490
 Home screen can be 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.200
 clogged showing the message even 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.540
 downloading 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.270
 in this case the solution they give is that 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.630
 a reset or return windows was our 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.849
 point 1 but in my case no no no 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.969
 past 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:57.399
 some applications can also 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:05:00.619
 fail to update from the store 

00:04:57.399 --> 00:05:02.839
 showing an error so the solution 

00:05:00.619 --> 00:05:05.539
 is to uninstall the application and subtract and 

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:08.389
 subtract and reinstall it and then 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:10.879
 they also say that on this track in the 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.069
 movie and television application no 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:16.080
 it works we're going to try it so that the 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:19.120
 idea for yourselves 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.810
 let's go where they are 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.810
 here 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.910
 and in my case, it works 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:34.909
 Well, here's a review 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:36.080
 to the new build 10.512 I hope that I 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:39.590
 tell in the comments also if 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.530
 you have had problems installing 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.330
 the update that is not working and 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.150
 well a little more I hope we see each other 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.950
 soon and you know if you liked the 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.570
 Andrea video I like to subscribe if 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:56.200
 you have not done it yet I'm sure 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:56.200
 yes and nothing until the next greeting
