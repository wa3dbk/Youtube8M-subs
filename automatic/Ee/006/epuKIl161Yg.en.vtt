00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
got it taken care of at least for now

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.689 
got it taken care of at least for now
and<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.619> still<00:00:22.680> have<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.160> six<00:00:23.430> plants<00:00:25.310> so<00:00:26.310> it's

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
and I still have the six plants so it's

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.099 
and I still have the six plants so it's
looking<00:00:26.849> pretty<00:00:27.210> good<00:00:29.029> and<00:00:30.029> then<00:00:30.449> over<00:00:30.660> here<00:00:30.689> I

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
looking pretty good and then over here I

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.310 
looking pretty good and then over here I
still<00:00:31.590> haven't<00:00:31.920> planted<00:00:32.279> anything<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:33.260> can<00:00:34.260> I

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320

doing<00:00:38.760> great<00:00:40.820> very<00:00:41.820> full<00:00:43.129> been<00:00:44.129> picking<00:00:44.579> and

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
doing great very full been picking and

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.170 
doing great very full been picking and
dehydrating<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.140> probably<00:00:46.579> once<00:00:47.579> every<00:00:47.789> two

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
dehydrating it probably once every two

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.189 
dehydrating it probably once every two
weeks<00:00:48.500> the<00:00:49.500> lemon<00:00:49.770> balm<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.100> still<00:00:50.340> growing

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
weeks the lemon balm is still growing

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.950 
weeks the lemon balm is still growing
very<00:00:52.199> slow<00:00:52.590> growing<00:00:52.800> but<00:00:53.719> looks<00:00:54.719> like<00:00:54.840> it's

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
very slow growing but looks like it's

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.670 
very slow growing but looks like it's
doing<00:00:55.110> pretty<00:00:55.199> good<00:00:55.530> library<00:00:56.129> plants<00:00:57.680> we're

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
doing pretty good library plants we're

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.340 
doing pretty good library plants we're
growing<00:00:58.980> nicely<00:00:59.640> I<00:01:00.239> probably<00:01:00.930> should<00:01:01.199> cut

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
growing nicely I probably should cut

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.810 
growing nicely I probably should cut
that<00:01:01.530> runner<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:03.830> got<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.860> few<00:01:05.070> berries<00:01:05.430> off<00:01:05.610> of

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
that runner I got a few berries off of

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.080 
that runner I got a few berries off of
it<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.229> couple<00:01:07.229> days<00:01:07.350> ago<00:01:07.520> we're<00:01:08.520> really<00:01:08.700> sweet

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
it a couple days ago we're really sweet

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.770 
it a couple days ago we're really sweet
really<00:01:09.240> good<00:01:09.680> that<00:01:10.680> they're<00:01:10.920> not<00:01:11.100> producing

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
really good that they're not producing

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.810 
really good that they're not producing
much<00:01:12.780> now<00:01:13.850> here's<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.909> nice<00:01:15.090> plant<00:01:16.820> growing

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
much now here's a nice plant growing

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.090 
much now here's a nice plant growing
pretty<00:01:18.780> well<00:01:20.750> it<00:01:21.750> looks<00:01:21.960> like<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.680> might<00:01:22.950> be

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
pretty well it looks like this might be

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.910 
pretty well it looks like this might be
a<00:01:23.130> different<00:01:23.310> type<00:01:24.290> compared<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.560> plant

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
a different type compared to this plant

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.500 
a different type compared to this plant
but<00:01:26.820> I'm<00:01:26.909> not<00:01:27.090> sure<00:01:27.350> so<00:01:28.350> leave<00:01:28.560> look<00:01:28.770> different

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.450 

you<00:01:34.080> should<00:01:34.260> probably<00:01:34.380> harvest<00:01:34.770> some<00:01:35.190> of<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
you should probably harvest some of the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.380 
you should probably harvest some of the
red<00:01:36.360> peppers<00:01:36.720> up<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.050> Thai<00:01:37.260> chili<00:01:37.620> plant

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.350 

still<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.630> bunch<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:43.020> green<00:01:43.260> ones<00:01:43.470> too

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
still have a bunch of green ones too

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.590 
still have a bunch of green ones too
it'll<00:01:45.360> probably<00:01:45.510> bloom<00:01:45.840> again<00:01:47.120> before<00:01:48.120> winter

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
it'll probably bloom again before winter

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.040 
it'll probably bloom again before winter
comes<00:01:49.730> we'll<00:01:50.730> see<00:01:50.970> i<00:01:51.210> have<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.930> few<00:01:52.260> baby<00:01:52.820> um

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.120 
then these were planted a week after
that<00:03:14.620> kind<00:03:15.620> of<00:03:15.650> stack<00:03:15.980> rhythm<00:03:16.310> some<00:03:17.890> in<00:03:18.890> fact

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
that kind of stack rhythm some in fact

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.460 
that kind of stack rhythm some in fact
they're<00:03:19.220> doing<00:03:19.430> pretty<00:03:19.549> good<00:03:20.320> these<00:03:21.320> are

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
they're doing pretty good these are

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.170 
they're doing pretty good these are
starting<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.769> flower<00:03:21.950> too

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
starting to flower too

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.199 
starting to flower too
the<00:03:24.750> rutabaga<00:03:25.170> are<00:03:25.319> doing<00:03:25.620> really<00:03:25.769> well

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
the rutabaga are doing really well

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:33.770 
the rutabaga are doing really well
gotten<00:03:27.209> pretty<00:03:27.450> big<00:03:31.700> looks<00:03:32.700> like<00:03:32.819> a<00:03:33.090> sunflower

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
gotten pretty big looks like a sunflower

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.539 
gotten pretty big looks like a sunflower
came<00:03:34.260> up<00:03:34.409> in<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.590> middle<00:03:34.769> of<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:34.950> rutabagas<00:03:35.609> I

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
came up in the middle of the rutabagas I

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.559 
came up in the middle of the rutabagas I
think<00:03:38.549> I<00:03:38.670> just<00:03:38.730> might<00:03:38.969> leave<00:03:39.239> it<00:03:39.359> there<00:03:39.540> for

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
think I just might leave it there for

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.930 
think I just might leave it there for
the<00:03:39.810> time<00:03:39.989> being<00:03:40.290> see<00:03:41.010> what<00:03:41.159> happens

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.800 

and<00:03:44.540> then<00:03:44.660> I<00:03:44.750> have<00:03:44.930> beats<00:03:45.230> in<00:03:45.740> front<00:03:46.810> rutabagas

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
and then I have beats in front rutabagas

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.660 
and then I have beats in front rutabagas
are<00:03:47.930> kind<00:03:48.110> of<00:03:48.170> taking<00:03:48.440> over<00:03:48.890> hopefully<00:03:49.400> the

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
are kind of taking over hopefully the

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.390 
are kind of taking over hopefully the
beats<00:03:49.880> will<00:03:50.060> do<00:03:50.180> okay<00:03:50.650> have<00:03:51.650> some<00:03:51.830> baby<00:03:52.040> ones

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400
