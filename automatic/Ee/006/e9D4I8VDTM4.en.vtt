00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.980
 the here or also known as be 42 in 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:09.379
 counter strike global offensive is a 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.079
 quite used competitive weapon of 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:13.489
 the main ones of the terrorists are going 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:15.940
 to see first the spray that does when 

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:15.940
 we are together 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.080
 as you can see what is a 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.430
 form of tea not to nuclear form is by 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.590
 that when you start to shoot 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:31.150
 from a distant distance or average 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.040
 people look down 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.910
 to try to let the bullets go or more 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.910
 possible meetings 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.700
 when you are moving to the 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.000
 left or right this is what 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.000
 pass 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.510
 You see, I always try to shoot 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.510
 example to this poster 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.790
 bullets come out very very scattered 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.790
 let's try this red here 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.110
 you can see that the wheels have come out 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.140
 take by saco all of each other is 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.570
 that's why it's very important no longer 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.970
 try to make come down to the peephole 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.680
 400 meters to see if I give you all the 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.070
 millions of bullets that I have my charger 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.660
 but try to give small bursts 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.740
 example let's see at the point of the 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.740
 arrow is 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:28.230
 if we go from two to two rods all the 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.230
 Rods stay pretty in the center 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.520
 if we are going to try to give this signal in the 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.520
 center of three entities of rods 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.990
 You see that the third bullet has gone very 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.270
 away and if I give a fourth much more still 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.509
 that's why it's important to give 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.729
 nothing more than two rods at the head of 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.560
 someone very righteous and if you have to 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.240
 middle distance then yes yes yes this 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.240
 it's the doll and this is the head 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.470
 try to lower the military the blast 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.470
 whole yes no 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.630
 and try it because they go a lot 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.630
 very difficult
