 his jackets actually always throne you 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.040
 can combine it with sport shoes liz 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.570
 because tough and casual 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.809
 We really combine lace with hocker 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.879
 chic so this is the first item and am 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.610
 I am very happy with this from the H&amp;M and this one 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.920
 was 3995 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.420
 then from further on with an oil pants 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.680
 and and that's these pants it's one 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.170
 jeans with a bit on the legs 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.120
 torn spots but really whole 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.549
 subtle so not really 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.560
 here face torn who do I have 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.890
 those books but now I wanted something cleaner 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.840
 but somewhat cooler 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.420
 so this is the model this is the 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.250
 back and a beautiful dark blue 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.009
 pants of oil and this one that was 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.340
 3985 also just like the play surgeon at sca 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.340
 Hey 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.460
 then I bought a blouse at 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.840
 the Villa 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.979
 I think you have already passed this vlog 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.350
 see it coming 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.719
 really such a lumberjack shirt with whole 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.350
 I like beautiful colors of blue 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.350
 Red and white 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.039
 yes, pasteur goes well with denim jeans 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.549
 red kirby and beautiful lipstick hurt 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.560
 lip 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.959
 wit stuck with everything so this one 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.969
 I really like the colors 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:02.619
 if you want to know how it stands then you can 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:05.860
 you view my vlog 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.590
 so yes this is the lumberjack shirt you 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.590
 these that cost 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.590
 2695 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.930
 then we go back to hana 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.580
 there still have very simple jeans 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:29.030
 bought it was only 1995 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.980
 yes simple light blue it is comfortable 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.040
 nice stretchy it's a super skinny 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.130
 superlow most and yes i have flow is 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.850
 needed hi knew i just was n't tasty 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.890
 to sit 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.530
 so I actually prefer to come like this 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:47.050
 late at the waist 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.050
 yes so this smart 1995 at h &amp; m 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.280
 oh god i also go to the h &amp; m and 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:04.769
 black blouse 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.239
 so this is how it looks very simple too 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.150
 and I had that is very nice to combine 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.620
 with a statement necklace 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.120
 I actually wanted one with fierce 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.409
 colors but I didn't really see a whole one 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.750
 nice so in the end i got this one 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.819
 chosen and yes this is a bit more 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.420
 chic necklace but find it quite 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.099
 very nice to stand the items i go i was 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.510
 or show originated but you see it 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.829
 probably come by anyway 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.209
 videos 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.040
 yes as I am now there you see 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.659
 outfit will come by I think 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.389
 is nice then you don't have it already 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:36.000
 seen before but you just see in the 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:39.480
 video looks good and that 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.230
 blouse was 1995 and the necklace was 12 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.230
 euro 9 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:57.740
 then I have a simple white 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:04:00.290
 tank top you bought with a small 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.340
 puzzle cartels I don't know how 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.350
 that calls it 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.150
 at the neck I think that 's just something 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.800
 more fun than a very simple white 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.570
 tank top and that can be nice again 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.070
 under this jacket because those directors 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.510
 same color as the stripes on 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:15.850
 bags 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.850
 this was 699 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.190
 I also found another one at the harbor and one 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.800
 very simple t-shirt 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.240
 yes not very special but in the summer 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.860
 I like this type of t-shirt 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.870
 easy you just wear jeans 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.870
 ballerinas and so shirt above it 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:42.069
 is always possible and as a mother you sometimes do 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:46.870
 just got a little bit easier 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:50.770
 the whole day tom on the item 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.960
 not really no an item bag 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:59.919
 that is ideal or very nice 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:01.840
 This this vest it is an oversized 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.729
 well not really oversized is a very long one 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.069
 white cardigan 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:08.069
 really up to say your knees around 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.700
 and he has a bit of the waterfall 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.850
 he is a bit on his for what 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.160
 way also with coats too 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.480
 trench coat now that is also called marvel 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.370
 trench coats 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.130
 with that special open falling 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.600
 sides and this cardigan has that too 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.360
 you know and he is just nice and comfy 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.420
 but also air permeable for the 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.660
 summer yes white color can of course 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.340
 always have a little bit in the summer 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.190
 Of course sometimes fries so 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.500
 then you can also provide us with such a vest 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:48.250
 something cooler for cool 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:53.680

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:57.070

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.920
 because yes I'd rather not be sure 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.390
 it even to well but it sometimes happens 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.920
 nevertheless a bit should n't be there either 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:21.490
 difficult to do 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:24.340
