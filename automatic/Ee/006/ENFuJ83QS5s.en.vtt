00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
which came out in the spring patch and

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.370 
which came out in the spring patch and
this<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:12.090> an<00:00:12.240> interesting<00:00:12.480> sidearm<00:00:13.110> because

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
this is an interesting sidearm because

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.410 
this is an interesting sidearm because
it<00:00:13.500> actually<00:00:13.650> gives<00:00:14.040> you<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.219> sniping<00:00:14.910> option

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
it actually gives you a sniping option

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.019 
it actually gives you a sniping option
as<00:00:15.540> your<00:00:16.020> secondary<00:00:16.590> or<00:00:16.830> at<00:00:17.130> least<00:00:17.400> it<00:00:17.609> used<00:00:17.640> to

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
as your secondary or at least it used to

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.000 
as your secondary or at least it used to
back<00:00:18.270> in<00:00:18.300> CTE<00:00:18.779> before<00:00:19.289> they<00:00:19.380> took<00:00:19.560> away<00:00:19.740> your

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
back in CTE before they took away your

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.099 
back in CTE before they took away your
sniping<00:00:20.460> scopes<00:00:20.939> now<00:00:21.210> I'll<00:00:21.600> be<00:00:21.779> getting<00:00:21.810> into

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
sniping scopes now I'll be getting into

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.410 
sniping scopes now I'll be getting into
why<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:22.680> gun<00:00:23.070> got<00:00:23.279> nerfed<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.880> why<00:00:24.000> I'm<00:00:24.210> not

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
why this gun got nerfed and why I'm not

why this gun got nerfed and why I'm not
really<00:00:24.720> enjoying<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.439> anymore<00:00:25.710> but<00:00:26.430> stat<00:00:26.789> wise

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
really enjoying it anymore but stat wise

popping up the synth extensors with the

popping up the synth extensors with the
mayor's<00:00:34.590> leg<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.190> 44<00:00:35.700> Magnum

mayor's leg and the 44 Magnum
side-by-side<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.020> can<00:00:37.380> see<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.710> they<00:00:37.829> both

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
side-by-side you can see that they both

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.610 
side-by-side you can see that they both
do<00:00:38.190> 56<00:00:38.790> damage<00:00:39.210> maximum<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.989> mayor's<00:00:40.200> leg<00:00:40.410> has

a little bit further drop off start but

a little bit further drop off start but
it's<00:00:43.559> drop<00:00:43.770> off<00:00:43.920> actually<00:00:44.129> ends<00:00:44.700> before<00:00:45.059> the

it's drop off actually ends before the
44<00:00:45.600> Magnum<00:00:45.629> does<00:00:46.289> at<00:00:46.469> 45<00:00:47.010> meters<00:00:47.370> where<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.610> 44

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
44 Magnum does at 45 meters where the 44

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.850 
44 Magnum does at 45 meters where the 44

Magnum can reach all the way out to 50

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.979 
Magnum can reach all the way out to 50
before<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.280> hits<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.579> mid<00:00:51.000> damage<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.780> mayor's

before it hits a mid damage the mayor's
leg<00:00:52.230> has<00:00:52.440> slightly<00:00:52.770> faster<00:00:53.430> muzzle<00:00:53.789> velocity

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
leg has slightly faster muzzle velocity

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.420 
leg has slightly faster muzzle velocity
of<00:00:54.270> 520<00:00:55.230> meters<00:00:55.350> per<00:00:55.649> second<00:00:55.980> versus<00:00:56.280> the

magnums 460 meters per second not a huge
difference<00:00:59.489> overall<00:01:00.030> they<00:01:00.270> have<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.510> exact

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
difference overall they have the exact

same magazine capacity the difference

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.219 
same magazine capacity the difference
though<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.329> Magnum<00:01:03.780> gets<00:01:04.049> a

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
though is that the Magnum gets a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.289 
though is that the Magnum gets a
standard<00:01:04.830> four<00:01:05.100> second<00:01:05.580> reload<00:01:05.939> no<00:01:06.119> matter

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
standard four second reload no matter

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.240 
standard four second reload no matter
how<00:01:06.420> many<00:01:06.540> shots<00:01:06.840> are<00:01:07.020> replacing<00:01:07.530> but<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.130> can

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
how many shots are replacing but it can

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.950 
how many shots are replacing but it can
replace<00:01:08.549> all<00:01:08.760> six<00:01:09.119> shots<00:01:09.390> at<00:01:09.540> once

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
replace all six shots at once

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.600 
replace all six shots at once
whereas<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.439> mayor's<00:01:10.680> leg<00:01:10.920> reloads<00:01:11.369> each

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
whereas the mayor's leg reloads each

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.399 
whereas the mayor's leg reloads each
shot<00:01:11.880> individually<00:01:12.659> like<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.900> pump-action

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
shot individually like a pump-action

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.590 
shot individually like a pump-action
shotgun<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.400> takes<00:01:14.610> point<00:01:14.939> seven<00:01:15.360> seven

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
shotgun and it takes point seven seven

shotgun and it takes point seven seven
seconds<00:01:16.200> between<00:01:16.320> each<00:01:16.710> shot<00:01:16.830> reload<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
seconds between each shot reload the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.120 
seconds between each shot reload the
downside<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.869> reload<00:01:19.290> process<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.950> that

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
downside to this reload process is that

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.950 
downside to this reload process is that
you<00:01:20.250> can't<00:01:20.549> really<00:01:20.939> interrupt<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.720> between

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
you can't really interrupt it between

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.289 
you can't really interrupt it between
each<00:01:22.259> shell<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.979> take<00:01:23.159> an<00:01:23.310> accurate<00:01:23.490> shot<00:01:23.759> you

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
each shell to take an accurate shot you

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.390 
each shell to take an accurate shot you
can<00:01:24.630> hipfire<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.380> weapon<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:25.890> that's<00:01:26.189> pretty

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
can hipfire the weapon but that's pretty

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.770 
can hipfire the weapon but that's pretty
much<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.700> last<00:01:26.850> thing<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.210> want<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.509> do<00:01:27.630> with

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
much the last thing you want to do with

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.780 
much the last thing you want to do with
the<00:01:27.900> mayor's<00:01:28.080> leg<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.590> why<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.100> well<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
that the mayor's Lake has slightly less

that the mayor's Lake has slightly less
recoil<00:01:52.560> than<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.009> Magnum<00:01:53.369> which<00:01:53.549> really

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
recoil than the Magnum which really

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.730 
recoil than the Magnum which really
doesn't<00:01:54.299> matter<00:01:54.420> since<00:01:54.750> it's<00:01:54.990> about<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.290> second

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
doesn't matter since it's about a second

in<00:01:55.860> between<00:01:56.189> shots<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.670> doesn't<00:01:56.939> matter<00:01:57.090> if

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
in between shots it doesn't matter if

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.330 
in between shots it doesn't matter if
the<00:01:57.270> recoil<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.689> absolutely<00:01:58.350> insane<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:59.189> have

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
the recoil is absolutely insane you have

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.160 
the recoil is absolutely insane you have
plenty<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.759> time<00:01:59.939> to<00:01:59.969> reset<00:02:00.509> between<00:02:00.719> taking

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
plenty of time to reset between taking

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.050 
plenty of time to reset between taking
your<00:02:01.500> next<00:02:01.770> shot<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.460> only<00:02:02.700> other<00:02:02.850> difference

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
your next shot the only other difference

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.249 
your next shot the only other difference
is<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.630> mayor's<00:02:03.840> Lake<00:02:04.049> has

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
is that the mayor's Lake has

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.590 
is that the mayor's Lake has
considerably<00:02:04.920> worse<00:02:05.219> hipfire<00:02:05.790> accuracy<00:02:06.149> than

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
considerably worse hipfire accuracy than

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.199 
considerably worse hipfire accuracy than
Magnum<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.500> have<00:02:07.860> even<00:02:08.069> less<00:02:08.310> options<00:02:08.759> and

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
Magnum so you have even less options and

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.140 
Magnum so you have even less options and
CQB<00:02:10.020> combat<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.770> again<00:02:11.340> putting<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.879> stats

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
CQB combat so again putting the stats

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.680 
CQB combat so again putting the stats
side-by-side<00:02:12.870> looking<00:02:13.260> at<00:02:13.410> them

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
side-by-side looking at them

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.300 
side-by-side looking at them
there's<00:02:13.840> literally<00:02:14.500> nothing<00:02:14.890> that<00:02:15.190> the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
there's literally nothing that the

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.370 
there's literally nothing that the
mayor's<00:02:15.520> leg<00:02:15.730> has<00:02:15.940> going<00:02:16.180> for<00:02:16.300> it<00:02:16.630> versus<00:02:17.230> the

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
mayor's leg has going for it versus the

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.440 
mayor's leg has going for it versus the
Magnum<00:02:17.800> other<00:02:18.010> than<00:02:18.400> it<00:02:18.610> can<00:02:18.820> equip<00:02:19.180> some

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
Magnum other than it can equip some

Magnum other than it can equip some
scopes<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.170> Magnum<00:02:20.590> can't<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.310> it

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
scopes that the Magnum can't and it

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.010 
scopes that the Magnum can't and it
could<00:02:21.550> actually<00:02:21.580> equip<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.150> lot<00:02:22.390> more<00:02:22.660> scopes

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
could actually equip a lot more scopes

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.350 
could actually equip a lot more scopes
back<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:23.530> CTE<00:02:23.860> for<00:02:24.520> some<00:02:24.760> reason<00:02:25.090> they<00:02:25.210> took

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
back and CTE for some reason they took

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.210 
back and CTE for some reason they took
away<00:02:25.540> some<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:26.020> best<00:02:26.260> options<00:02:26.830> at<00:02:26.980> head

away some of the best options at head

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.820 
away some of the best options at head
for<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.790> final<00:02:28.150> release<00:02:28.330> I'm<00:02:28.750> not<00:02:29.200> sure<00:02:29.560> why

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
for the final release I'm not sure why

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.710 
for the final release I'm not sure why
they<00:02:30.040> did<00:02:30.070> this<00:02:30.430> because<00:02:30.640> it<00:02:30.970> basically<00:02:31.480> made

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
they did this because it basically made

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.780 
they did this because it basically made
the<00:02:32.200> one<00:02:32.500> thing<00:02:32.770> I<00:02:32.920> liked<00:02:33.160> about<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.580> mayor's

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
the one thing I liked about the mayor's

the one thing I liked about the mayor's
leg<00:02:34.150> useless<00:02:34.630> so<00:02:35.200> let's<00:02:35.410> talk<00:02:35.530> about<00:02:35.680> that<00:02:35.920> for

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
leg useless so let's talk about that for

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.280 
leg useless so let's talk about that for
a<00:02:36.160> second<00:02:36.580> if<00:02:36.730> you<00:02:36.760> go<00:02:37.030> back<00:02:37.210> and<00:02:37.390> watch<00:02:37.570> my<00:02:37.780> CTE

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
a second if you go back and watch my CTE

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.230 
a second if you go back and watch my CTE

one the 40 time scope which is just a

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
this weapon you're never going to even

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.510 
this weapon you're never going to even
one<00:03:11.200> shot<00:03:11.440> kill<00:03:11.680> somebody<00:03:12.010> at<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.220> ranges

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
one shot kill somebody at the ranges

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.430 
one shot kill somebody at the ranges
that<00:03:12.580> that<00:03:12.850> scope<00:03:13.150> is<00:03:13.270> useful<00:03:13.660> because<00:03:13.810> your

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
that that scope is useful because your

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.740 
that that scope is useful because your
drop<00:03:14.680> off<00:03:14.830> goes<00:03:15.070> down<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.400> 37<00:03:16.000> point<00:03:16.240> 5<00:03:16.300> damage

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
drop off goes down to 37 point 5 damage

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.810 
drop off goes down to 37 point 5 damage
so<00:03:17.050> it's<00:03:17.170> not<00:03:17.290> even<00:03:17.560> a<00:03:17.620> one<00:03:17.830> shot<00:03:18.040> head<00:03:18.310> shot<00:03:18.580> at

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
so it's not even a one shot head shot at

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.150 
so it's not even a one shot head shot at
that<00:03:19.300> range<00:03:19.600> a<00:03:19.870> six<00:03:20.410> time<00:03:20.590> scope<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.070> an

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
that range a six time scope and an

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.740 
that range a six time scope and an
eighth<00:03:21.310> time<00:03:21.489> scope<00:03:21.790> was<00:03:22.000> absolutely<00:03:22.540> perfect

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
eighth time scope was absolutely perfect

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.720 
eighth time scope was absolutely perfect
for<00:03:23.110> this<00:03:23.200> weapon<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:23.800> it<00:03:24.070> allowed<00:03:24.370> it<00:03:24.520> to<00:03:24.550> be

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
for this weapon and it allowed it to be

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.490 
for this weapon and it allowed it to be
effective<00:03:24.970> at<00:03:25.330> the<00:03:25.540> range<00:03:25.810> at<00:03:26.020> which<00:03:26.170> it<00:03:26.320> could

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
effective at the range at which it could

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.290 
effective at the range at which it could
either<00:03:26.620> one-shot<00:03:27.190> headshot<00:03:27.610> or<00:03:27.790> almost

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
either one-shot headshot or almost

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.690 
either one-shot headshot or almost
one-shot<00:03:28.810> headshot<00:03:29.200> your<00:03:29.620> opponent<00:03:30.190> and<00:03:30.310> that

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
one-shot headshot your opponent and that

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.820 
one-shot headshot your opponent and that
was<00:03:30.910> fun<00:03:31.150> to<00:03:31.360> run<00:03:31.510> with<00:03:31.750> but<00:03:31.959> now<00:03:32.110> I'm<00:03:32.530> stuck

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
was fun to run with but now I'm stuck

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.280 
was fun to run with but now I'm stuck
with<00:03:32.890> four<00:03:33.370> times<00:03:33.700> and<00:03:33.970> 3.4<00:03:34.690> times<00:03:34.870> scope

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
with four times and 3.4 times scope

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.590 
with four times and 3.4 times scope
options<00:03:35.830> which<00:03:36.100> basically<00:03:36.850> gives<00:03:37.239> me<00:03:37.330> no

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
options which basically gives me no

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.750 
options which basically gives me no
other<00:03:37.810> options<00:03:38.260> that<00:03:38.320> then<00:03:38.560> 44<00:03:39.100> Magnum<00:03:39.459> didn't

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
other options that then 44 Magnum didn't

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.850 
other options that then 44 Magnum didn't
already<00:03:39.940> have<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.600> 44<00:03:40.989> Magnum<00:03:41.020> has<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.650> three

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
already have the 44 Magnum has the three

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.380 
already have the 44 Magnum has the three
time<00:03:42.040> scope<00:03:42.370> if<00:03:42.550> I<00:03:42.700> want<00:03:42.820> a<00:03:42.880> snipe<00:03:43.090> with<00:03:43.269> the

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
time scope if I want a snipe with the

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.840 
time scope if I want a snipe with the
Magnum<00:03:43.750> I<00:03:43.900> can<00:03:44.410> do<00:03:44.560> that<00:03:44.709> with<00:03:44.950> its<00:03:45.160> own<00:03:45.340> scope

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
Magnum I can do that with its own scope

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.670 
Magnum I can do that with its own scope
so<00:03:46.120> now<00:03:46.239> the<00:03:46.300> Mayers<00:03:46.570> like<00:03:46.780> literally<00:03:47.350> offers

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
so now the Mayers like literally offers

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.920 
so now the Mayers like literally offers
me<00:03:47.860> nothing<00:03:48.550> new<00:03:48.760> it's<00:03:49.060> just<00:03:49.360> like<00:03:49.570> running<00:03:49.870> a

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
me nothing new it's just like running a

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.320 
me nothing new it's just like running a
44<00:03:50.440> Magnum<00:03:50.860> but<00:03:51.070> with<00:03:51.250> worse<00:03:51.519> reload<00:03:52.150> a

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
44 Magnum but with worse reload a

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.050 
44 Magnum but with worse reload a
crappier<00:03:53.230> way<00:03:53.680> crappier<00:03:54.280> rate<00:03:54.489> of<00:03:54.610> fire<00:03:54.790> and

crappier way crappier rate of fire and

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.479 
crappier way crappier rate of fire and
worse<00:03:55.540> hipfire<00:03:55.989> accuracy<00:03:56.440> there's<00:03:56.980> literally

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
worse hipfire accuracy there's literally

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.640 
worse hipfire accuracy there's literally
nothing<00:03:57.820> that<00:03:58.150> this<00:03:58.360> gun<00:03:58.570> has<00:03:58.810> going<00:03:59.080> for<00:03:59.200> it

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
nothing that this gun has going for it

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.400 
nothing that this gun has going for it
it<00:03:59.890> did<00:04:00.220> in<00:04:00.430> CTE<00:04:00.850> because<00:04:01.239> of<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:01.480> 6<00:04:01.750> na<00:04:02.110> time

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
it did in CTE because of the 6 na time

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.930 
it did in CTE because of the 6 na time
scope<00:04:02.769> that<00:04:03.010> made<00:04:03.250> it<00:04:03.370> worthwhile

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
scope that made it worthwhile

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.300 
scope that made it worthwhile
but<00:04:04.480> even<00:04:04.900> so<00:04:05.230> right<00:04:05.620> now<00:04:05.830> the<00:04:05.890> damage

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
but even so right now the damage

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.130 
but even so right now the damage
drop-off<00:04:06.700> with<00:04:06.970> this<00:04:07.150> gun<00:04:07.420> is<00:04:07.600> not

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
drop-off with this gun is not

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.020 
drop-off with this gun is not
particularly<00:04:08.620> impressive<00:04:09.280> I<00:04:09.610> mean<00:04:09.790> when<00:04:09.940> you

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
particularly impressive I mean when you

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.300 
particularly impressive I mean when you
add<00:04:10.239> a<00:04:10.269> longer<00:04:10.660> barrel<00:04:10.989> to<00:04:11.350> a<00:04:11.380> gun<00:04:11.920> for<00:04:12.220> the

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
add a longer barrel to a gun for the

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.400 
add a longer barrel to a gun for the
most<00:04:12.519> part<00:04:12.790> it<00:04:12.940> should<00:04:13.180> increase<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.900> muzzle

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
most part it should increase the muzzle

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.440 
most part it should increase the muzzle
velocity<00:04:14.980> and<00:04:15.010> in<00:04:15.550> this<00:04:15.820> game<00:04:16.060> that<00:04:16.269> should

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
velocity and in this game that should

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.449 
velocity and in this game that should
increase<00:04:16.720> this<00:04:16.930> ranged<00:04:17.350> effectiveness<00:04:17.980> for

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
increase this ranged effectiveness for

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.610 
increase this ranged effectiveness for
some<00:04:18.700> reason<00:04:19.150> this<00:04:19.269> gun<00:04:19.510> does<00:04:19.989> even<00:04:20.410> less

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
some reason this gun does even less

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.620 
some reason this gun does even less
damage<00:04:21.040> if<00:04:21.160> further<00:04:21.370> ranges<00:04:21.850> than<00:04:21.970> the<00:04:22.120> 44

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
damage if further ranges than the 44

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.450 
damage if further ranges than the 44
Magnum<00:04:22.660> doesn't<00:04:23.620> make<00:04:23.740> any<00:04:23.919> sense<00:04:24.250> at<00:04:24.370> all

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
Magnum doesn't make any sense at all

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.100 
Magnum doesn't make any sense at all
considering<00:04:25.090> its<00:04:25.210> shooting<00:04:25.419> the<00:04:25.630> same<00:04:25.870> type

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
considering its shooting the same type

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.450 
considering its shooting the same type
around<00:04:26.410> but<00:04:26.710> this<00:04:26.950> gun<00:04:27.190> has

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
around but this gun has

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.400 
around but this gun has
longer<00:04:27.880> barrel<00:04:28.210> so<00:04:28.449> in<00:04:28.690> theory<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.139> bullet

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
longer barrel so in theory the bullet

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.689 
longer barrel so in theory the bullet
should<00:04:29.530> be<00:04:29.680> going<00:04:29.919> further<00:04:30.160> it<00:04:30.400> should<00:04:30.580> be<00:04:30.669> a

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
should be going further it should be a

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.790 
should be going further it should be a
slightly<00:04:31.060> more<00:04:31.389> effective<00:04:31.870> at<00:04:32.080> range<00:04:32.350> now

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
slightly more effective at range now

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.409 
slightly more effective at range now
there<00:04:32.949> is<00:04:33.069> another<00:04:33.220> thing<00:04:33.430> they<00:04:33.759> could<00:04:34.030> do<00:04:34.240> to

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
there is another thing they could do to

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.089 
there is another thing they could do to
this<00:04:34.539> weapon<00:04:34.750> to<00:04:34.960> try<00:04:35.380> and<00:04:35.500> balance<00:04:35.680> it<00:04:35.949> out

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
this weapon to try and balance it out

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.070 
this weapon to try and balance it out
and<00:04:36.280> make<00:04:36.400> it<00:04:36.430> more<00:04:36.849> effective<00:04:37.270> and<00:04:37.660> frankly

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
and make it more effective and frankly

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.600 
and make it more effective and frankly
more<00:04:38.319> realistic<00:04:38.949> it's<00:04:39.099> something<00:04:39.400> that<00:04:39.520> I've

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
more realistic it's something that I've

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:40.980 
more realistic it's something that I've
been<00:04:39.729> trying<00:04:39.940> to<00:04:40.030> get<00:04:40.150> the<00:04:40.270> developers<00:04:40.750> to<00:04:40.870> do

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
been trying to get the developers to do

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.930 
been trying to get the developers to do

the reload with an aim and down sight
shot<00:05:02.169> on<00:05:02.349> the<00:05:02.470> mayor's<00:05:02.680> leg<00:05:02.919> the<00:05:03.340> reload

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
shot on the mayor's leg the reload

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.969 
shot on the mayor's leg the reload
process<00:05:03.699> is<00:05:04.389> really<00:05:04.960> a<00:05:04.990> lot<00:05:05.410> worse<00:05:05.650> than<00:05:05.889> the

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
process is really a lot worse than the

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.249 
process is really a lot worse than the
44<00:05:06.400> Magnum<00:05:06.430> it<00:05:06.970> takes<00:05:07.180> a<00:05:07.300> lot<00:05:07.449> longer<00:05:07.660> to

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:08.259 
44 Magnum it takes a lot longer to

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:10.050 
44 Magnum it takes a lot longer to
reload<00:05:08.620> all<00:05:08.889> of<00:05:09.070> your<00:05:09.220> shots<00:05:09.490> on<00:05:09.699> this<00:05:09.849> weapon

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
reload all of your shots on this weapon

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.120 
reload all of your shots on this weapon
than<00:05:10.360> it<00:05:10.509> does<00:05:10.690> with<00:05:10.870> the<00:05:10.930> 44<00:05:11.440> Magnum<00:05:11.500> so

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
than it does with the 44 Magnum so

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.589 
than it does with the 44 Magnum so
you're<00:05:12.370> basically<00:05:12.729> in<00:05:12.910> a<00:05:13.150> worse<00:05:13.360> situation

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599 
you're basically in a worse situation

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:16.439 
you're basically in a worse situation
you<00:05:14.380> can<00:05:14.620> however<00:05:14.889> reload<00:05:15.520> individual<00:05:16.150> shots

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
you can however reload individual shots

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.270 
you can however reload individual shots
so<00:05:16.630> you<00:05:16.660> can<00:05:16.930> get<00:05:17.080> a<00:05:17.110> shorter<00:05:17.470> reload<00:05:17.830> on<00:05:17.979> three

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
so you can get a shorter reload on three

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.189 
so you can get a shorter reload on three
rounds<00:05:18.669> whereas<00:05:18.909> the<00:05:19.000> 44<00:05:19.419> Magnum<00:05:19.449> takes<00:05:20.080> the

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
rounds whereas the 44 Magnum takes the

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:21.689 
rounds whereas the 44 Magnum takes the
same<00:05:20.409> amount<00:05:20.710> of<00:05:20.770> time<00:05:20.949> to<00:05:20.979> reload<00:05:21.430> three

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:21.699 
same amount of time to reload three

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:23.879 
same amount of time to reload three
bullets<00:05:22.060> as<00:05:22.210> it<00:05:22.360> does<00:05:22.539> all<00:05:22.750> six<00:05:23.229> bullets<00:05:23.680> but

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
bullets as it does all six bullets but

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.129 
bullets as it does all six bullets but
it's<00:05:24.340> still<00:05:24.669> not<00:05:25.030> enough<00:05:25.419> to<00:05:25.479> warrant<00:05:25.870> the

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
it's still not enough to warrant the

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:28.680 
it's still not enough to warrant the
current<00:05:26.470> reload<00:05:26.830> process<00:05:27.370> now<00:05:27.880> I<00:05:27.940> apologize

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
current reload process now I apologize

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.570 
current reload process now I apologize

it's<00:05:31.000> mostly<00:05:31.419> that<00:05:31.599> way<00:05:31.780> because<00:05:32.080> I<00:05:32.110> was

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
it's mostly that way because I was

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.589 
it's mostly that way because I was
actually<00:05:32.500> excited<00:05:33.039> about<00:05:33.400> this<00:05:33.580> gun<00:05:33.820> in<00:05:34.030> CTE

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
actually excited about this gun in CTE

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:36.390 
actually excited about this gun in CTE
and<00:05:35.020> then<00:05:35.139> they<00:05:35.259> took<00:05:35.409> away<00:05:35.590> the<00:05:35.710> Scopes<00:05:36.130> which

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
and then they took away the Scopes which

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.950 
and then they took away the Scopes which
was<00:05:36.610> the<00:05:36.789> only<00:05:36.909> thing<00:05:37.270> that<00:05:37.330> made<00:05:37.780> it

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
was the only thing that made it

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.439 
was the only thing that made it
worthwhile<00:05:38.320> using<00:05:39.190> now<00:05:39.669> it's<00:05:39.849> really<00:05:40.120> just<00:05:40.240> an

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
worthwhile using now it's really just an

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:42.240 
worthwhile using now it's really just an
aesthetic<00:05:40.780> choice<00:05:40.960> to<00:05:41.320> use<00:05:41.470> this<00:05:41.650> gun<00:05:41.889> and<00:05:42.130> as

I mention the zeroing on this rifle

I mention the zeroing on this rifle
seems<00:06:00.729> to<00:06:00.880> be<00:06:01.030> off<00:06:01.210> if<00:06:01.539> you<00:06:01.719> aim<00:06:01.900> at<00:06:02.080> the<00:06:02.169> top<00:06:02.409> of

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
seems to be off if you aim at the top of

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.800 
seems to be off if you aim at the top of
somebody's<00:06:03.009> head<00:06:03.190> at<00:06:03.430> around<00:06:03.699> 40<00:06:04.270> meters<00:06:04.630> or

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
somebody's head at around 40 meters or

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.110 
somebody's head at around 40 meters or
even<00:06:05.229> closer<00:06:05.620> that<00:06:06.310> bullet<00:06:06.639> will<00:06:06.759> go<00:06:06.909> whizzing

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
even closer that bullet will go whizzing

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.370 
even closer that bullet will go whizzing
over<00:06:07.479> their<00:06:07.630> head<00:06:07.780> it<00:06:07.900> looks<00:06:07.930> like<00:06:08.259> the

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
over their head it looks like the

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.959 
over their head it looks like the
weapons<00:06:08.710> zeroed<00:06:09.070> in<00:06:09.219> at<00:06:09.370> around<00:06:09.669> a<00:06:09.789> hundred

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.730 
meters or so I talked to Matt imio about
this<00:06:13.120> issue<00:06:13.360> and<00:06:13.599> he<00:06:13.719> was<00:06:13.870> having<00:06:14.020> the<00:06:14.349> exact

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
this issue and he was having the exact

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.100 
this issue and he was having the exact
same<00:06:15.009> problem<00:06:15.669> so<00:06:16.000> it<00:06:16.449> seems<00:06:16.659> like<00:06:16.750> the<00:06:16.960> guns

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
same problem so it seems like the guns

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.350 
same problem so it seems like the guns
not<00:06:17.289> even<00:06:17.349> zeroed<00:06:18.070> properly<00:06:18.669> which<00:06:18.969> if<00:06:19.210> your

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
not even zeroed properly which if your

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.149 
not even zeroed properly which if your
marksman<00:06:19.870> of<00:06:19.960> any<00:06:20.199> kind<00:06:20.469> in<00:06:20.620> battlefield<00:06:21.070> 4

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:21.159 
marksman of any kind in battlefield 4

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:23.219 
marksman of any kind in battlefield 4
and<00:06:21.430> you've<00:06:21.520> got<00:06:21.729> used<00:06:21.969> to<00:06:22.060> bullet<00:06:22.449> drop<00:06:22.690> you

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:23.229 
and you've got used to bullet drop you

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:25.230 
and you've got used to bullet drop you
know<00:06:23.409> exactly<00:06:24.099> where<00:06:24.310> to<00:06:24.400> aim<00:06:24.550> to<00:06:24.849> get<00:06:24.969> a<00:06:25.030> head

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
know exactly where to aim to get a head

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.149 
know exactly where to aim to get a head
shot<00:06:25.270> in<00:06:25.659> the<00:06:25.750> fact<00:06:25.960> that<00:06:26.110> this<00:06:26.320> is<00:06:26.710> sending

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:27.159 
shot in the fact that this is sending

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:28.830 
shot in the fact that this is sending
bullets<00:06:27.460> over<00:06:27.610> your<00:06:28.030> opponent's<00:06:28.419> head<00:06:28.539> is

just the worst thing that you could ask

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.909 
just the worst thing that you could ask
for<00:06:30.699> in<00:06:30.849> any<00:06:31.240> sort<00:06:31.570> of<00:06:31.630> weapon<00:06:32.050> so<00:06:32.289> dice<00:06:32.530> I<00:06:32.710> hate

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:40.470 
damage drop off there should be

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.020 
damage drop off there should be
longer-range<00:06:41.190> at<00:06:41.400> which<00:06:41.580> I<00:06:41.700> can<00:06:41.730> get<00:06:42.000> a

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:05.550 
an update you don't start off with any

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:07.950 
sort of scope with this rifle so you're

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:09.440 
sort of scope with this rifle so you're
gonna<00:07:08.040> need<00:07:08.280> something<00:07:08.670> that<00:07:08.970> can<00:07:09.000> actually

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:09.450 
gonna need something that can actually

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.450 
gonna need something that can actually
hit<00:07:09.720> headshots<00:07:10.200> accurately<00:07:10.920> since<00:07:11.130> it's<00:07:11.310> the

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:11.460 
hit headshots accurately since it's the

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:12.830 
hit headshots accurately since it's the
only<00:07:11.610> way<00:07:11.820> to<00:07:11.850> get<00:07:12.060> a<00:07:12.090> kill<00:07:12.360> with<00:07:12.390> this<00:07:12.660> rifle

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 
only way to get a kill with this rifle

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.050 
only way to get a kill with this rifle
and<00:07:13.200> the<00:07:13.290> iron<00:07:13.470> sights<00:07:13.770> just<00:07:14.130> suck<00:07:14.400> it's<00:07:14.640> very

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.060 
and the iron sights just suck it's very

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.610 
and the iron sights just suck it's very
hard<00:07:15.330> to<00:07:15.360> be<00:07:15.540> precise<00:07:15.930> with<00:07:16.140> them<00:07:16.320> and<00:07:16.530> it

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:16.620 
hard to be precise with them and it

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.110 
hard to be precise with them and it
would<00:07:16.770> be<00:07:16.920> kind<00:07:17.130> of<00:07:17.160> cool<00:07:17.310> to<00:07:17.490> use<00:07:17.580> this<00:07:17.760> gun<00:07:17.940> in

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 
would be kind of cool to use this gun in

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.660 
would be kind of cool to use this gun in
its<00:07:18.360> stock<00:07:18.690> form<00:07:19.080> but<00:07:19.350> you<00:07:19.770> just<00:07:20.040> really<00:07:20.250> can't

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:20.670 
its stock form but you just really can't

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:22.520 
its stock form but you just really can't
you<00:07:20.820> have<00:07:21.090> to<00:07:21.270> put<00:07:21.450> a<00:07:21.480> scope<00:07:21.780> on<00:07:21.960> here<00:07:22.200> to<00:07:22.350> get

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:22.530 
you have to put a scope on here to get

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.440 
you have to put a scope on here to get
any<00:07:22.740> sort<00:07:23.160> of<00:07:23.250> precision<00:07:23.580> out<00:07:23.940> of<00:07:24.120> it<00:07:24.240> so

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:24.450 
any sort of precision out of it so

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:25.820 
any sort of precision out of it so
anyway<00:07:24.750> that's<00:07:24.930> my<00:07:25.140> list<00:07:25.350> of<00:07:25.530> things<00:07:25.680> to

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:25.830 
anyway that's my list of things to

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.920 
anyway that's my list of things to
change<00:07:26.160> on<00:07:26.340> this<00:07:26.460> weapon<00:07:26.850> to<00:07:26.880> make<00:07:27.180> it<00:07:27.390> usable

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:27.930 
change on this weapon to make it usable

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.110 
change on this weapon to make it usable
not<00:07:28.350> even<00:07:28.650> close<00:07:28.860> to<00:07:29.040> overpowered<00:07:29.550> just

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 
not even close to overpowered just

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.840 
not even close to overpowered just
usable<00:07:31.010> hopefully<00:07:32.010> we'll<00:07:32.160> see<00:07:32.310> some<00:07:32.490> changes

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:32.850 
usable hopefully we'll see some changes

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.790 
usable hopefully we'll see some changes
on<00:07:33.000> this<00:07:33.120> gun<00:07:33.300> in<00:07:33.510> the<00:07:33.720> next<00:07:34.050> patch<00:07:34.260> that

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800 
on this gun in the next patch that

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.350 
on this gun in the next patch that
pretty<00:07:35.010> much<00:07:35.130> wraps<00:07:35.370> it<00:07:35.550> up<00:07:35.640> for<00:07:35.700> my<00:07:35.910> review<00:07:36.330> of

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 
pretty much wraps it up for my review of

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.600 
pretty much wraps it up for my review of
the<00:07:36.690> Mayers<00:07:36.930> like<00:07:37.260> not<00:07:37.620> worth<00:07:37.830> using<00:07:38.280> for<00:07:38.460> any

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:38.610 
the Mayers like not worth using for any
