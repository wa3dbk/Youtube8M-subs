00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
position in his fantastic so overall I

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.230 
position in his fantastic so overall I
think<00:02:40.020> Thiago<00:02:40.500> Silva<00:02:40.710> just<00:02:41.250> edges<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:41.850> so<00:02:42.090> he

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
think Thiago Silva just edges and so he

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.110 
think Thiago Silva just edges and so he
gets<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.750> 10<00:02:43.290> out<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.710> 10<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.310> what<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.790> player

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120
