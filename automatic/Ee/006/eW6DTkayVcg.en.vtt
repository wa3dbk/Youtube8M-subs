training Freddie all had to be a circle
and<00:02:15.540> I'm<00:02:15.900> your<00:02:16.670> Deb<00:02:17.670> mentioned<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:18.870> it's<00:02:19.200> not

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
and I'm your Deb mentioned that it's not

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.800 
and I'm your Deb mentioned that it's not
as<00:02:19.590> power<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.310> will<00:02:20.460> be<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.790> different<00:02:21.180> but

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
as power that will be the different but

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.590 
as power that will be the different but
his<00:02:22.050> experience<00:02:22.770> what<00:02:23.760> do<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:23.970> say<00:02:24.570> about

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
his experience what do you say about

his experience what do you say about
that<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:25.500> think<00:02:25.830> otherwise<00:02:25.980> maybe<00:02:26.460> set<00:02:26.790> up

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
that I think otherwise maybe set up

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.520 
that I think otherwise maybe set up
because<00:02:27.180> he<00:02:27.270> knows<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.630> can<00:02:27.840> take<00:02:28.020> a<00:02:28.050> good<00:02:28.290> shot

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
because he knows I can take a good shot

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.010 
because he knows I can take a good shot
and<00:02:28.740> maybe<00:02:29.070> I'll<00:02:29.790> be<00:02:30.030> able<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.300> Standish<00:02:30.720> power

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
and maybe I'll be able to Standish power

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
and maybe I'll be able to Standish power
for<00:02:31.740> experience<00:02:32.840> I<00:02:33.840> agree<00:02:34.290> he<00:02:34.530> might<00:02:34.710> be<00:02:34.830> much

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
for experience I agree he might be much
