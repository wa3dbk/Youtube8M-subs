that's cool I'm going to show you how
you<00:03:24.780> can<00:03:25.590> transform<00:03:26.430> this<00:03:27.230> so<00:03:28.230> first<00:03:28.950> just<00:03:29.310> the

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
you can transform this so first just the

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.199 
you can transform this so first just the
same<00:03:30.209> directions<00:03:30.720> of<00:03:31.079> the<00:03:31.230> Eve<00:03:31.579> except<00:03:32.579> there

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
same directions of the Eve except there

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.810 
same directions of the Eve except there
are<00:03:33.239> more<00:03:33.540> buttons<00:03:34.109> there<00:03:34.920> they're<00:03:35.340> lots<00:03:35.640> of

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
are more buttons there they're lots of

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.479 
are more buttons there they're lots of
buttons<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:36.660> this<00:03:37.109> is<00:03:37.260> kind<00:03:37.739> is<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.010> bit

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
buttons so this is kind is a bit

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:49.690 
buttons so this is kind is a bit
trickier<00:03:39.299> than<00:03:39.390> you<00:03:47.600> so

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
trickier than you so

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.300 
trickier than you so
and<00:03:50.700> he's<00:03:51.510> can<00:03:51.900> do<00:03:52.109> this<00:03:52.410> you<00:03:52.950> have<00:03:53.070> to<00:03:53.190> be

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
and he's can do this you have to be

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.150 
and he's can do this you have to be
careful<00:03:54.000> like<00:03:54.600> do<00:03:54.900> not<00:03:55.079> use<00:03:55.319> force<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:55.859> pull

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
careful like do not use force to pull

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.009 
careful like do not use force to pull
out<00:03:56.280> his<00:03:56.400> head<00:03:56.700> on<00:03:56.880> your<00:03:57.150> meal<00:03:57.470> or<00:03:58.470> is<00:03:58.709> it<00:04:00.019> could

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
out his head on your meal or is it could

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.039 
out his head on your meal or is it could
damage<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.650> toy<00:04:02.150> that's<00:04:03.150> why<00:04:03.359> you<00:04:03.420> have<00:04:03.720> to<00:04:03.900> be

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
damage the toy that's why you have to be

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.670 
damage the toy that's why you have to be
a<00:04:04.290> bit<00:04:04.829> careful<00:04:05.160> with<00:04:05.699> this

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
a bit careful with this

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.960 
a bit careful with this
and<00:04:07.239> his<00:04:08.239> arms<00:04:08.659> we'll<00:04:09.349> wrote<00:04:09.799> these<00:04:10.159> arms<00:04:10.579> can

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
and his arms we'll wrote these arms can

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:24.010 
and his arms we'll wrote these arms can
rotate<00:04:15.190> and<00:04:16.190> his<00:04:17.289> hands<00:04:18.289> can<00:04:18.859> move<00:04:22.900> just<00:04:23.900> like

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
rotate and his hands can move just like

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.629 
rotate and his hands can move just like
the<00:04:24.380> in<00:04:24.590> turn<00:04:25.190> action<00:04:25.880> Wally<00:04:26.180> what<00:04:27.020> mine<00:04:27.639> my

the in turn action Wally what mine my
happy<00:04:29.300> idle<00:04:29.630> off<00:04:29.810> the<00:04:30.020> bomber<00:04:30.259> this<00:04:30.500> has<00:04:30.740> done

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.150 

you've<00:04:34.610> done<00:04:34.820> a<00:04:34.850> review<00:04:35.360> of<00:04:35.539> this<00:04:35.780> this<00:04:36.770> Wally

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
you've done a review of this this Wally

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.400 
you've done a review of this this Wally
toy<00:04:37.610> and<00:04:37.880> the<00:04:38.000> other<00:04:38.240> wallet<00:04:38.630> toy

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
toy and the other wallet toy

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.590 
toy and the other wallet toy
so<00:04:39.830> let's<00:04:40.220> go<00:04:40.400> back<00:04:40.430> to<00:04:40.669> the<00:04:40.910> transforming

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
so let's go back to the transforming

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.909 
so let's go back to the transforming
okay<00:04:42.169> now<00:04:42.710> we're<00:04:43.250> back<00:04:43.400> here<00:04:43.970> and<00:04:44.240> see<00:04:44.840> and<00:04:45.320> say

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
okay now we're back here and see and say

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.950 
okay now we're back here and see and say
like<00:04:47.169> like<00:04:48.169> there's<00:04:48.560> a<00:04:48.800> stand<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:49.639> here<00:04:50.180> so

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
like like there's a stand to here so

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.120 
like like there's a stand to here so
that<00:04:50.990> you<00:04:51.320> can<00:04:51.530> use

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
that you can use

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.990 
that you can use
it's<00:04:52.729> a<00:04:53.590> attachable<00:04:54.590> stamp<00:04:55.070> so<00:04:55.520> these<00:04:55.699> are<00:04:55.880> the

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
it's a attachable stamp so these are the

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.719 
it's a attachable stamp so these are the
instructions<00:04:56.510> to<00:04:56.630> put<00:04:56.870> on<00:04:57.099> snapped<00:04:58.099> em<00:04:58.490> on

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
instructions to put on snapped em on

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.810 
instructions to put on snapped em on
base<00:04:59.000> attach<00:04:59.720> them<00:05:00.169> to<00:05:00.410> the<00:05:00.530> cavity<00:05:01.160> on<00:05:01.340> east

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
base attach them to the cavity on east

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:08.170 
base attach them to the cavity on east
back<00:05:02.500> so<00:05:05.199> this<00:05:06.199> is<00:05:06.259> a<00:05:06.440> cavity<00:05:06.800> on<00:05:07.340> her<00:05:08.000> back

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
back so this is a cavity on her back

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.210 
back so this is a cavity on her back
right<00:05:08.860> under<00:05:09.860> the<00:05:10.190> transforming<00:05:10.940> button<00:05:12.220> so

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
right under the transforming button so

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.100 
right under the transforming button so
this<00:05:13.610> is<00:05:13.760> how<00:05:13.910> you<00:05:14.120> pressure<00:05:14.360> in<00:05:14.599> treatment

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
this is how you pressure in treatment

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.140 
this is how you pressure in treatment
you<00:05:15.470> have<00:05:15.590> to<00:05:15.620> reset<00:05:16.010> the<00:05:16.130> eyes<00:05:16.310> and<00:05:16.729> to<00:05:16.849> sleep

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
you have to reset the eyes and to sleep

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.219 
you have to reset the eyes and to sleep
and<00:05:17.930> to<00:05:18.110> closed<00:05:18.470> and<00:05:19.160> you<00:05:19.310> put<00:05:19.550> this<00:05:19.820> in<00:05:20.229> listen

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
and to closed and you put this in listen

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:28.240 
and to closed and you put this in listen
and<00:05:21.590> put<00:05:22.039> this<00:05:22.550> in<00:05:25.479> this<00:05:26.479> is<00:05:26.690> how<00:05:27.020> she's<00:05:27.830> asleep

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
and put this in this is how she's asleep

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.790 
and put this in this is how she's asleep
both<00:05:28.669> so<00:05:29.419> like<00:05:29.630> how<00:05:30.139> you<00:05:30.199> begin<00:05:30.919> it<00:05:31.099> so<00:05:31.490> I<00:05:32.800> think

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
both so like how you begin it so I think

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:40.029 
both so like how you begin it so I think
this<00:05:34.460> is<00:05:34.760> pretty<00:05:35.300> cool<00:05:35.979> so<00:05:38.530> this<00:05:39.530> is<00:05:39.740> pretty

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
this is pretty cool so this is pretty

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:45.399 
this is pretty cool so this is pretty
funny<00:05:40.370> and<00:05:42.639> this<00:05:43.639> comes<00:05:44.300> with<00:05:44.720> a<00:05:44.780> cannon

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:45.409 
funny and this comes with a cannon

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:51.610 
funny and this comes with a cannon
blaster<00:05:45.919> on<00:05:48.130> the<00:05:49.240> transforming<00:05:50.240> wall<00:05:50.620> let's

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
blaster on the transforming wall let's

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.029 
blaster on the transforming wall let's
go<00:05:52.099> in<00:05:52.699> here<00:05:53.270> for<00:05:53.630> a<00:05:53.659> second<00:05:54.199> this<00:05:54.590> is<00:05:54.830> my

best so what's so let's see the

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:03.189 
best so what's so let's see the
transforming<00:06:01.729> Wally's<00:06:02.090> gonna<00:06:02.360> appear<00:06:02.810> in<00:06:02.960> any

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 
transforming Wally's gonna appear in any

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:03.760 
transforming Wally's gonna appear in any
minute

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
minute

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.760 
minute
my<00:06:04.099> two<00:06:04.430> figures<00:06:05.090> the<00:06:05.509> transforming<00:06:06.319> Eve<00:06:06.530> and

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
my two figures the transforming Eve and

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.279 
my two figures the transforming Eve and
the<00:06:06.979> transforming<00:06:07.789> Wally<00:06:08.030> told<00:06:08.360> all<00:06:08.870> of<00:06:09.050> these

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.289 
the transforming Wally told all of these

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:10.809 
the transforming Wally told all of these
two<00:06:09.560> figures<00:06:09.770> a<00:06:09.979> lot<00:06:10.220> I<00:06:10.340> think<00:06:10.430> they're<00:06:10.699> the

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:10.819 
two figures a lot I think they're the

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:18.040 
two figures a lot I think they're the
best<00:06:10.849> I'm<00:06:11.270> not<00:06:11.479> sure<00:06:11.720> I'd<00:06:12.139> say<00:06:16.780> it's<00:06:17.780> much

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
best I'm not sure I'd say it's much

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.930 
best I'm not sure I'd say it's much
cooler<00:06:18.349> than<00:06:18.680> transforming<00:06:19.340> one<00:06:19.430> because<00:06:19.789> she

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
cooler than transforming one because she

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.800 
cooler than transforming one because she
can<00:06:20.120> change<00:06:20.270> her<00:06:20.509> my<00:06:20.720> expressions<00:06:21.259> hmm

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.810 
can change her my expressions hmm

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:29.350 
can change her my expressions hmm
closed<00:06:24.259> open<00:06:24.889> and<00:06:25.370> reason<00:06:25.909> blinking<00:06:28.360> jenos

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
closed open and reason blinking jenos

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:35.080 
closed open and reason blinking jenos
are<00:06:29.629> the<00:06:29.750> expressions<00:06:30.560> so<00:06:32.530> CI<00:06:33.530> everybody<00:06:34.129> stay

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
are the expressions so CI everybody stay

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.270 
are the expressions so CI everybody stay
tuned<00:06:35.509> with<00:06:35.840> the<00:06:35.870> transformational<00:06:36.680> and<00:06:37.190> the

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
tuned with the transformational and the

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:57.430 
tuned with the transformational and the
transforming<00:06:49.599> what<00:06:50.599> those<00:06:50.900> who<00:06:51.169> bow<00:06:56.440> circle

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:57.440 
transforming what those who bow circle

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.330 
transforming what those who bow circle
and<00:06:57.710> close<00:06:58.490> it<00:06:58.849> out<00:06:59.060> it<00:06:59.300> I<00:06:59.479> will<00:06:59.780> and<00:07:00.620> then<00:07:01.190> I'm

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.340 
and close it out it I will and then I'm

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.979 
and close it out it I will and then I'm
gonna<00:07:01.969> do<00:07:02.599> let<00:07:02.960> me<00:07:03.259> stop<00:07:03.620> down
