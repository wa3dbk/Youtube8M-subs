00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.660
 even with the help of professional technology 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.260
 still hoarse in the street fans was so 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.870
 a lot of what seemed to be the final chord 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.879
 Hall will not fall and half after work 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.260
 instead of working on duty from deep at night 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.260
 one by one and whole families 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.979
 baseball 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.570
 legendary metallic today for 30 and to 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.700
 this time the albums of the group went 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.290
 tens of millions are the only ones 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.680
 rockers who sang on all continents 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.680
 of the world 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.780
 minimum advertising and posters no interview 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.549
 but this was not required to find metal 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.130
 in Moscow tried thousands of fans 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.170
 on duty almost a day at the hotel where 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.890
 the rumors stopped the musicians but so 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.890
 didn't find anyone 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.440
 in russia with love in metallica comes 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.600
 to us for the fifth time 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.250
 first time real monsters of the lesson saw 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.350
 at the Tushino airfield in ninety 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.690
 first year and were right to say shocked 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.300
 and delighted at the same time to fan today 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.730
 even soloists of Russian pop groups are not 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.380
 not a group which has an audience 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.640
 grows old with them on which 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.760
 constantly updated with young 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.830
 this sense of uniqueness longevity than 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.600
 the secret of metallica's persistence does not reveal 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.250
 but our channel accidentally found out the secret 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.590
 of at least one youth 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.450
 musician right before the concert guitarist 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.020
 group curly Hamit apparently decided 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.000
 come down 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.850

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.590
 were such as they are aged to 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.000
 rate the rockers in all respects in 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.370
 this year had to buy tickets 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.070
 I bought the last time in spring 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.610
 and this despite the prices from 8 to 30 thousand 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.230
 rubles 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.520
 but many had to add to this 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.010
 also the cost of tickets to Moscow he already 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.320
 10 times at the concert metallic and I 3 were 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.220

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.220
 time to hear them 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.010
 inborn on hollywood hill which 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.080
 still eighties made california and 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.120
 the birthplace of the pioneering lesson today still 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.250
