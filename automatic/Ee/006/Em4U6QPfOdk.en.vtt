hand<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.640> Sami<00:00:27.390> Salah<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.930> think<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:29.010> pair

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
hand and Sami Salah I think this pair

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.669 
hand and Sami Salah I think this pair
would<00:00:29.400> work<00:00:29.820> pretty<00:00:30.000> good<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:31.050> that's<00:00:31.320> what<00:00:31.470> I

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
would work pretty good so that's what I

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.830 
would work pretty good so that's what I
put<00:00:32.040> them<00:00:32.189> as<00:00:32.309> number<00:00:32.790> one<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.149> top<00:00:33.600> pair

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
put them as number one a top pair

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.830 
put them as number one a top pair
defense<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.460> in<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.489> net<00:00:35.700> we<00:00:35.880> have<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.390> ask

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
defense and in the net we have to ask

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.700 
defense and in the net we have to ask
and<00:00:37.140> curry<00:00:38.070> left<00:00:38.340> on<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.170> Antti<00:00:40.170> Niemi<00:00:40.350> so

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
and curry left on and and Antti Niemi so

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.119 
and curry left on and and Antti Niemi so
that<00:00:40.890> three<00:00:41.370> goal<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.820> inspect<00:00:42.739> and<00:00:43.739> then

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
that three goal is to inspect and then

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.790 
that three goal is to inspect and then
the<00:00:44.250> second<00:00:44.550> line<00:00:44.989> you<00:00:45.989> see<00:00:46.260> Keenan

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
the second line you see Keenan

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.040 
the second line you see Keenan
well<00:00:47.190> triphala<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.059> only<00:00:48.420> okay<00:00:49.910> so<00:00:50.910> our<00:00:51.719> I

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
well triphala and only okay so our I

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.959 
well triphala and only okay so our I
think<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:53.250> would<00:00:53.399> also<00:00:53.520> be<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.789> critical

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
think this this would also be a critical

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.840 
think this this would also be a critical
line<00:00:54.440> these<00:00:55.440> guys<00:00:55.710> are<00:00:55.860> having<00:00:56.100> pretty<00:00:56.699> good

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
line these guys are having pretty good

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.510 
line these guys are having pretty good
years<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.500> think<00:00:58.559> they're<00:00:58.949> they<00:00:59.340> might

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
years and I think they're they might

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.299 
years and I think they're they might
have<00:00:59.699> good<00:00:59.910> chemistry<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:01.039> then<00:01:02.039> we<00:01:02.160> have

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
have good chemistry and then we have

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.870 
have good chemistry and then we have
only<00:01:02.699> matter<00:01:03.019> 99<00:01:04.019> stats<00:01:04.320> off<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.010> some<00:01:05.640> Eva

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
only matter 99 stats off and some Eva

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.929
