it<00:00:51.600> happened<00:00:51.870> very<00:00:52.079> quickly<00:00:52.280> for<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.430> it

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
it happened very quickly for you it

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.040 
it happened very quickly for you it
could<00:00:53.670> happen<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:54.059> five<00:00:54.329> minutes<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.809> gameplay

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
could happen in five minutes of gameplay

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.279 
could happen in five minutes of gameplay
10<00:00:55.500> minutes<00:00:55.829> 20<00:00:56.160> minutes<00:00:56.360> but<00:00:57.360> really<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.020> don't

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
10 minutes 20 minutes but really I don't

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.000 
10 minutes 20 minutes but really I don't
think<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.500> should<00:00:58.530> take<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.800> long

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
think you should take that long

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.290 
think you should take that long
especially<00:00:59.160> be<00:00:59.520> going<00:00:59.699> after<00:00:59.910> those<00:01:00.030> scales

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
especially be going after those scales

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.080 
especially be going after those scales
so<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.530> start<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> random<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.670> threw<00:01:02.879> me<00:01:02.910> into

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
so I start up a random it threw me into

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.560 
so I start up a random it threw me into
a<00:01:03.210> payload<00:01:03.570> race<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.729> here<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.820> go<00:01:05.970> i<00:01:06.000> started

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
a payload race and here you go i started

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.690 
a payload race and here you go i started
to<00:01:06.630> pick<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.810> pyro<00:01:07.020> because<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:08.430> was<00:01:08.580> either

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
to pick the pyro because it was either

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.870 
to pick the pyro because it was either
that<00:01:08.820> or<00:01:09.409> I<00:01:10.409> wanted<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.430> buy<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.549> wanted<00:01:11.790> to

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
that or I wanted to buy I wanted to

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.240 
that or I wanted to buy I wanted to
snipe<00:01:12.180> but<00:01:12.570> if<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.439> had<00:01:13.590> shot<00:01:13.799> somebody<00:01:14.010> who's

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
snipe but if I had shot somebody who's

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.620 
snipe but if I had shot somebody who's
across<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.670> map<00:01:14.820> by<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.030> time<00:01:15.210> i<00:01:15.240> get<00:01:15.420> over

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
across the map by the time i get over

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.380 
across the map by the time i get over
there<00:01:15.659> i'm<00:01:15.960> actually<00:01:16.170> gonna<00:01:16.439> die<00:01:16.740> or<00:01:17.390> somebody

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
there i'm actually gonna die or somebody

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.060 
there i'm actually gonna die or somebody
else<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.810> gonna<00:01:18.930> pick<00:01:19.110> up<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.259> present<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:19.830> no

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
else is gonna pick up the present so no

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.039 
else is gonna pick up the present so no
point<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:21.119> i<00:01:21.180> think<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.420> part<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.869> pyro

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
point so i think the part of the pyro

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.380 
point so i think the part of the pyro
cuz<00:01:22.380> he's<00:01:22.500> quick<00:01:22.740> kills<00:01:23.549> very<00:01:23.820> easily<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.240> can

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
cuz he's quick kills very easily I can

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.230 
cuz he's quick kills very easily I can
throw<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.840> know<00:01:24.990> throw<00:01:25.590> missiles<00:01:26.130> back<00:01:26.310> just

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240
