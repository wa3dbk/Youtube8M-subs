00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:07.630
 The 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.840
 Yes and Iuwake 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:16.500
 Next station station liquid crystal station how to choose 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:22.300
 That's right personally, but after all that's the most important thing 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:26.140
 gtg neutral color display speed 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.640
 Slow display speed of neutral colors 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:33.430
 For example 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:34.350
 If it is a personal feeling, it will be 5 milliseconds or later 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.850
 The 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:44.530
 The delay of the image displayed for the mouse operation is uncomfortable 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.960
 7 Start moving and ramen comes late 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.150
 That's right yes 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:54.270
 Conversely speaking, after recognizing the play 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.590
 I aimed at myself with the mouse 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.460
 Until defeat 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:03.690
 That time will be overwhelmingly delayed 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:07.110
 That's right, it's completely done , because I was able to react but I didn't get it turned 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:11.950
 I 'm sorry I didn't get enough balls, so that's why I sell 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:15.549
 If you think so, after all this is many early from gtg 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:21.100
 It's something you 've already done 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:24.550
 by speed 120hz 120hz 120hz What should I do? 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:30.240
 That's likely I think you hammer benefits Tteyuu look at the 3 d 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:32.190
 Domo multiplied by the Well 3 beautiful woman is watching the video of the 3 d With the guy that supports 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.240
 Simply 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:41.230
 Is the number that was jal drawing not a by a mean 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:48.700
 With I'm 120hz So the piece is gonna be two-fold compared to the I heard 60hz 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:50.439
 The ones that had seen the hit 60 Frey in terms of the extreme argument After However if visible at 120 gonna be 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:56.470
 It does not mean 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:59.470
 And if it is 120 frames, the other party looks beautiful but if it is 60 frames 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.310
 During that man frame 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.610
 Hmm 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:09.110
 Me chagrin when I came is that not standing able to recognize the enemy 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.860
 Well Well kind of completely or is that not out my train because of the liquid crystal 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:16.450
 Try to lose the tournament 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.260
 Do Well pillow also beat painted was not I'll I eat I'll I ne wall was also not do not leave many people with 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.480
 Are doing 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.849
 Well, but if you throw it 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.690
 In but the measures I have become almost the same as I Matsuzaki-san was told now sometime I 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:32.360
 Also 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.350
 Or out of a sense of show at the numbers I mean and I think this is the response speed of the so-called gtge 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:40.730
 Though 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:41.540
 The information of the frame is actually physically inserted into the liquid crystal as a person who has not announced the manufacturer 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.800
 From 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.710
 It is the say the period of until it is drawn'm not announced where the manufacturer 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.760
 In short forgiven 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:56.070
 There was that there was nothing but comparison to try to buy and try 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.620
 In this time, I was able to touch 3 points and let us compare, so let's make a very good experience 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:03.420
 I think I got it 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:09.540
 Since the input delay is possible and 120hz less 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:13.110
 Afterimage is I fps lead to blurred afterimage is the largest of the place name stores in the I'm reduced liquid crystal 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:18.640
 It is so because there be I mistaken because you move from the wonders from a distance 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:20.610
 It entered me the afterimage also come the enemy in a few roots and crisp by become shorter 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.120
 I believe in Toparit Ne 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.250
 I wonder if I do not know this 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.490
 I Do not might not know the level not it time that you 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.470
 It is a speed or a residual image in the main secretary 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:34.400
 I consider this one more important 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:37.730
 Yes this is our choice 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:42.130
 Benkei of Chapter 1 of the temporary one eye benq 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.900
 Well I'm using it as well 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.040
 Comfortable N 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.239
 Wow comfortable Well 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:56.120
 Do you have been used to what kind of a liquid crystal me before you buy with this station 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.120
 It seems to be the first thing to put out the manufacturer name 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:05.640
 Well Bonney 17 inch cookbook 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:07.319
 I think that it is likely to be such a thing at the beginning of using the stone 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.680
 I did it but i did 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.680
 Fly 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:17.820
 If you use it at a home for a lifetime early, you might be stunned 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.910
 Isn't it different? 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.960
 Already 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:25.020
 After operating with the story mouse immediately after all 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.110
 The picture is 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.139
 It 's also quick to get it 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:36.620
 I did not move it to here 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:40.360
 It is to be felt to be very moving slimy 7 days the number of frames is because twice 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:44.889
 Or after all the sides Day times 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.670
 This liquid crystal is looking for fps once and for all 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.120
 Active 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:52.680
 famous 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:56.639
 Pro gamer Well that's right I'm a professional like Swedish I have no match 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:05:01.710
 In the liquid crystal that gamers are participating in supervision 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:06.570
 f I want to play with an aspect ratio of 4 to 3, not even through the piece 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.139
 With this kind of function that you can control everything on hardware side 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.230
 The ranking is quite different 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.440
 Hmm 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.620
 Well of an idea 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.710
 Well let 's put out the name of the title and counter strike 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:22.530
 Four to three 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:28.340
 There are a lot of people who want to do it on the screen, and such a very important item for such players 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:28.340
 Is one of the more effect the kana not it become it is recommended products
