00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.370 
to this map as I go along ok so all you
have<00:01:49.099> to<00:01:49.280> do<00:01:49.369> it's<00:01:49.550> very<00:01:49.759> simple<00:01:50.060> to<00:01:50.270> use<00:01:50.390> it's

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
have to do it's very simple to use it's

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.150 
have to do it's very simple to use it's
going<00:01:51.530> to<00:01:51.619> use<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.979> WASD<00:01:52.849> pad<00:01:53.539> to<00:01:53.840> steer<00:01:54.289> shift

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
going to use the WASD pad to steer shift

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.760 
going to use the WASD pad to steer shift
+<00:01:55.490> space<00:01:55.970> makes<00:01:56.599> you<00:01:56.720> go<00:01:56.869> up<00:01:57.080> as<00:01:57.289> well<00:01:57.470> and<00:01:57.709> we

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
+ space makes you go up as well and we

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.790 
+ space makes you go up as well and we
have<00:01:58.369> to<00:01:58.490> do<00:01:58.580> this<00:01:58.670> jump<00:01:59.060> and<00:01:59.330> right<00:02:00.110> click<00:02:00.410> and

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
have to do this jump and right click and

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.620 
have to do this jump and right click and
there<00:02:01.190> we<00:02:01.310> have<00:02:01.340> it<00:02:01.550> that<00:02:01.700> is<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:02.030> parachute

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
there we have it that is the parachute

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.930 
there we have it that is the parachute
and<00:02:03.590> as<00:02:03.770> you'll<00:02:03.920> notice<00:02:04.130> this<00:02:04.459> is<00:02:04.520> actually

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
and as you'll notice this is actually

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.320 
and as you'll notice this is actually
green<00:02:05.300> I<00:02:05.860> didn't<00:02:06.860> make<00:02:07.069> a<00:02:07.130> green<00:02:07.550> parachute

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
green I didn't make a green parachute

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.969 
green I didn't make a green parachute
out<00:02:08.450> a<00:02:08.509> green<00:02:08.840> wool<00:02:09.080> it<00:02:09.410> just<00:02:09.649> does<00:02:09.860> it

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
out a green wool it just does it

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.870 
out a green wool it just does it
randomly<00:02:10.429> so<00:02:10.759> if<00:02:10.849> I<00:02:10.940> just<00:02:10.970> done<00:02:11.510> oh<00:02:12.370> my<00:02:13.370> god<00:02:13.550> I'm

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
randomly so if I just done oh my god I'm

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.760 
randomly so if I just done oh my god I'm
plummeting<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.599> ground<00:02:14.630> let's<00:02:15.290> just<00:02:15.380> head

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
plummeting to the ground let's just head

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.030 
plummeting to the ground let's just head
for<00:02:15.800> that<00:02:15.980> helicopter<00:02:16.970> pad<00:02:17.180> over<00:02:17.480> there<00:02:18.040> no

go up by pressing space like this or you

not sure how accurate that is to real

not sure how accurate that is to real
life<00:02:30.319> but<00:02:30.860> it<00:02:31.790> does<00:02:32.030> seem<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.239> be<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.629> good<00:02:32.900> idea

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
life but it does seem to be a good idea

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.979 
life but it does seem to be a good idea
anyway<00:02:33.790> that's<00:02:34.790> what<00:02:34.970> I'm<00:02:35.090> gonna<00:02:35.300> do<00:02:35.690> now<00:02:35.959> is

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
anyway that's what I'm gonna do now is

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.690 
anyway that's what I'm gonna do now is
I'm<00:02:36.170> just<00:02:36.319> going<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.530> quickly<00:02:36.709> show<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.220> a

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
I'm just going to quickly show you a

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.530 
I'm just going to quickly show you a
practical<00:02:38.680> application<00:02:39.680> of<00:02:39.830> this<00:02:40.430> mod<00:02:40.790> we're

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
practical application of this mod we're

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.330 
practical application of this mod we're
going<00:02:41.660> to<00:02:41.720> find<00:02:41.960> a<00:02:42.260> slightly<00:02:42.680> elevated

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
going to find a slightly elevated

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.740 
going to find a slightly elevated
surface<00:02:44.330> maybe<00:02:44.570> this<00:02:44.750> one<00:02:44.900> will<00:02:44.990> do

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
surface maybe this one will do

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.050 
surface maybe this one will do
with<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.470> bit<00:02:46.710> of<00:02:46.740> a<00:02:46.920> vertical<00:02:47.100> drop<00:02:47.640> now<00:02:47.910> I've

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
with a bit of a vertical drop now I've

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.730 
with a bit of a vertical drop now I've
been<00:02:48.210> playing<00:02:48.630> around<00:02:48.780> with<00:02:48.990> this<00:02:49.170> little<00:02:49.410> bit

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
been playing around with this little bit

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.990 
been playing around with this little bit
and<00:02:50.390> you<00:02:51.390> can<00:02:51.660> actually<00:02:52.190> manage<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.370> jump<00:02:53.790> off

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
and you can actually manage to jump off

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.840 
and you can actually manage to jump off
a<00:02:54.210> very<00:02:54.420> small<00:02:54.900> surface<00:02:55.310> to<00:02:56.310> open<00:02:56.670> up<00:02:56.760> the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
a very small surface to open up the

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.100 
a very small surface to open up the
parachute<00:02:57.240> and<00:02:57.330> you'll<00:02:57.480> notice<00:02:57.750> this<00:02:57.870> time

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
parachute and you'll notice this time

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.420 
parachute and you'll notice this time
it's<00:02:58.260> actually<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.530> purple<00:02:58.920> parachute<00:02:59.310> I'm

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
it's actually a purple parachute I'm

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.090 
it's actually a purple parachute I'm
still<00:02:59.640> using<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.030> same<00:03:00.290> item<00:03:01.290> but<00:03:01.950> we're

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
still using the same item but we're

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.620 
still using the same item but we're
getting<00:03:02.250> different<00:03:02.640> colored<00:03:03.150> parachutes

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
getting different colored parachutes

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.449 
getting different colored parachutes
it's<00:03:04.050> wonderful<00:03:04.530> it's<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:04.950> know<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.160> gives<00:03:05.310> a

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
it's wonderful it's you know it gives a

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.000 
it's wonderful it's you know it gives a
bit<00:03:05.610> of<00:03:05.700> them<00:03:05.990> randomness<00:03:06.990> to<00:03:07.230> this<00:03:07.530> mod<00:03:07.770> which

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
bit of them randomness to this mod which

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.240 
bit of them randomness to this mod which
I<00:03:08.160> like<00:03:08.870> so<00:03:09.870> anyway<00:03:10.140> this<00:03:10.320> is<00:03:10.500> actually<00:03:11.040> quite

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
I like so anyway this is actually quite

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.240 
I like so anyway this is actually quite
fast<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.970> get<00:03:12.090> around<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:13.500> is<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.709> good<00:03:13.980> mode

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
fast to get around and it is a good mode

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.980 
fast to get around and it is a good mode
of<00:03:14.400> transportation<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.330> I<00:03:15.480> have<00:03:15.630> very<00:03:15.780> much

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
of transportation and I have very much

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.890 
of transportation and I have very much
approve<00:03:16.350> of<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:17.060> this<00:03:18.060> is<00:03:18.209> pretty<00:03:18.540> much<00:03:18.690> the

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
approve of it this is pretty much the

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.530 
approve of it this is pretty much the
entire<00:03:19.350> mod<00:03:19.980> there<00:03:20.459> isn't<00:03:20.730> too<00:03:20.880> much<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.360> it

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
entire mod there isn't too much to it

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.840 
entire mod there isn't too much to it
and<00:03:21.800> I<00:03:22.800> suppose<00:03:23.220> it's<00:03:23.400> one<00:03:23.520> thing<00:03:23.670> i<00:03:23.790> could

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
and I suppose it's one thing i could

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.310 
and I suppose it's one thing i could
mention<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.390> might<00:03:24.540> have<00:03:24.690> noticed<00:03:24.720> that<00:03:25.140> it

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
mention you might have noticed that it

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.150 
mention you might have noticed that it
has<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.940> degradation<00:03:26.940> bar<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:28.470> it<00:03:28.500> does<00:03:28.800> the

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
has a degradation bar so it does the

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.190 
has a degradation bar so it does the
item<00:03:29.430> does<00:03:29.640> degrade<00:03:30.150> at<00:03:30.360> while<00:03:30.570> you<00:03:30.750> use<00:03:30.989> it

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
item does degrade at while you use it

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.710 
item does degrade at while you use it
and<00:03:31.700> so<00:03:32.700> that<00:03:32.880> is<00:03:33.030> something<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.420> look<00:03:33.450> out<00:03:33.660> for

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
and so that is something to look out for

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.330 
and so that is something to look out for
it's<00:03:33.959> not<00:03:34.050> very<00:03:34.200> expensive<00:03:34.530> item<00:03:35.040> though<00:03:35.160> so

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
it's not very expensive item though so

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.410 
it's not very expensive item though so
don't<00:03:35.520> think<00:03:35.760> it<00:03:35.850> really<00:03:35.880> makes<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.330> much

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
don't think it really makes that much

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.330 
don't think it really makes that much
