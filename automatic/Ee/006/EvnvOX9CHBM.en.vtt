00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.870
 what the kids here we are a 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.480
 new video as you see again the cos 2 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.900
 I'm already climbing a lot battlefield 3 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.719
 videos 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.400
 I really liked this last pack that 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.590
 they have taken out not since it is the last and so 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.570
 simply to top buddle filtres 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.130
 since I do not think I'll play it again 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.300
 until the new one comes out or something like that 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.420
 the truth that I have no idea so 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.369
 many people have been complaining about 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.560
 because it would be both matrix filtres the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.820
 truth is that you can not be happy 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.730
 to everyone in this sense because 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.649
 there will always be people who want 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.149
 that will bring different games no 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.590
 only electric call of duty as 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.020
 much just stay call of duty like this 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.430
 you have the videos of battlefield 3 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.590
 in the each in case you want to go see them the 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.190
 it's true they're pretty cool today 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.949
 I have uploaded one that is quite rare is not 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.750
 my style the music of duty that I went up but 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.339
 goes telfair simply music a bit of 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.920
 gameplay I wanted to upload it like 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.420
 issued last night not saying I'm going to catch 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.780
 these recipes that is here I'm going to put it 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.820
 you see how it looks like so if you have not 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.039
 ok the data you are seeing 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.300
 the game all game the same until 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:08.800
 that change the host the minute three 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.570
 or four I have no idea at what minute 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.210
 the change but let's 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.840
 until changing the ties that you flip 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.520
 so I did not want to talk to you about 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.110
 what or subscribe to my channel you do not know that 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.120
 all the youtubers well over all 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.310
 big though not all youtubers 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.960
 we have that question inside not because the 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.820
 people subscribe will be for the games 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.190
 of call of duty will be for the 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.400
 comment will be for videos you have seen 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.900
 of farc there will be because they do not like 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.320
 the mounts that come up from time to time 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.869
 they like the competitive one I do not know 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.710
 I just wanted to know why we 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:51.520
 are you writing or are you thinking 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:53.080
 subscribe because he pushed you to 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.030
 subscribe to my channel and keep watching 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.289
 the videos I suppose the great 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.110
 Most will be the call of 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.430
 duty not the items that I get from call of 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.250
 duty since it is a lot to say that is my 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.140
 strong point but I would like to know no 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.090
 I know the opinion of most insurance 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.519
 that of some that some comment that 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.260
 we see it does not surprise us we will not say hosts 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.840
 you from truth you have subscribed for this 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.090
 I'm not sure so please 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.690
 under the comments tell me because I 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.959
 I would like to know using ms 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.280
 the host that is now split is 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.030
 cut because we said of a cojÃ³n 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.879
 term 69 3 I think but I put up 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.489
 when I was going to 60 2 and the truth is that still 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.959
 so there were bits of example from the 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.900
 that I cut that they were super bored 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.740
 they just changed host ran from a 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.820
 respawn for the other 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:47.450
 an authentic torrado good name mmt de 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.830
 keep this drone escort and dogs I think 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.320
 which is the best combination for this 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.660
 map since the swarm what to be 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.440
 seen would not be seen for absolutely 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.940
 nothing since as you see the measure of times 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.920
 that you are on the outside reappear in the 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.350
 disco and it is impossible and beautiful streak 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.870
 of 25 uncle of 20 I do not know how much should I think 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.520
 that the 25 and vice is quite cucumber 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.470
 to be able to take out the nuclear one also not 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.640
 we hit could not be 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.350
 What else did I want to comment on if 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.480
 gameplay that you ask me all with the 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.850
 against the clan that I said and when it is 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.740
 true 14 a reaction I will upload it already 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.180
 you say when I saw them when I sweet them in 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.940
 the next few days do not worry 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.240
 you will have no weeks that I have been 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.090
 quite pretty messed up not true besides 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.440
 that it has been magdalena faults all 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.200
 the roll here and for where I 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.460
 I live so do not worry about training 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.410
 you will not have the same as minecraft 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:43.310
 minecraft I'm already preparing in the 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.780
 second channel because I'm preparing already 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.880
 how to do it because the program that 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.440
 I have to record because I fucked the jab 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.720
 of minecraft is getting me pretty 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.010
 nervous but come on I have to look at that 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.200
 the program would suit me and the whole thing 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.970
 so do not worry that inside 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.230
 nothing will have videos opinion that already 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.650
 I have desire but good what was 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.180
 saying of battlefield 3 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.340
 I'm going to upload a few more videos and 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.329
 another thing that I wanted to comment before 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.250
 I'm going to say now 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.560
 completely changing subject but I want it 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.430
 say now because if I do not know that I've been 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.780
 gone the ball 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.039
 I'm going to ask a question and answer 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.810
 where I will try that some of them 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.979
 answer my girlfriend will not leave our faces 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.680
 or anything like it came out in the video is 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.870
 just answer all three of the 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.000
 questions that you ask and the others 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.699
 answer them so you know in 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.250
 twitter asks stacks and when 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.509
 let you ask what you want you can 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.650
 put a question that is for me and 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:40.680
 other than for her obviously inside 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.050
 of a limit and then they will not respond 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.150
 so nothing just go to twitter 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.979
 questions as always and inside nothing 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.449
 you will have questions and answers that 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.699
 I suppose you can ask some 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.229
 how many things that I have seen I already put it 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.240
 by twitter and there were a few of the 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.190
 that they did not hit me enough and I 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.400
 they did quite funny but well what 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.080
 said by him or by twitter I hope that you 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.289
 is eating butterfield and nothing we 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.289
 we see
