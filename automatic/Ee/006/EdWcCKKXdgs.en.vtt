00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.700

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.950
 because there you told me yeah 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.840
 today I say to myself go concentrate 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.790
 it is not serious 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.580
 and did you feel a change 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.410
 in his language when you're on the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.119
 tennis court since a few 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.369
 weeks yes yes because before I had 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.820
 tend to say a few big words but 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.780
 inciting all whores after and well I 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.670
 could not tell me I was playing 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.460
 well but finally I saw that the negative 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.020
 so since bac we are working on the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.300
 real victory and all that allows me 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.480
 also to feel the inner calm 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.910
 and suddenly when I'm in this in 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.940
 this good and to basle the blow after match 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.039
 hi tweet is so actually the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.460
 do that that changed your language of the 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:00.530
 way of talking on the court that's it 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:05.070
 ok and suddenly you feel the difference 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.780
 yes I feel much more relaxed I 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.650
 take more pleasure because I am 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.520
 not contract I get better at playing 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:17.700
 super and your daddy he's there from the coast 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.380
 and yesteryear and yes ok are they the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.780
 hello patrick is what you got 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.009
 felt a difference you go the site saw 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.450
 one of the games of the eag 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.560
 his death is what you saw a 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.890
 difference either as an observer 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.220
 outside on his language on his way 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.430
 to speak on the ground 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:38.689
 yes it's huge huge the difference 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.920
 all alone explained that's exactly it 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:44.100
 before she got mad about costs in the 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.850
 cows then she happens to be sometimes 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.829
 to get by but that was for example this 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.770
 weekend to win it twice on a 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.640
 just cover a girl lake to which 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.090
 age where not long ago 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.579
 there the game feast of an hour and a quarter 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:03.299
 she won even though it was tight wins 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.340
 I felt like I could 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.409
 lose while the other time win it 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.420
 in three sets but was excruciating have c 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.540
 same for me 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.209
 I saw her getting upset 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.650
 racket father in the tarpaulin and in 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.560
 more at the end of the match she had won 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.099
 but she is not even very tall 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:27.270
 pleasure and thus its own agreement 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:29.640
 ok so that's okay bah pouring what got you 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.950
 the permit of the roof to change your 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.170
 language what is it if you had to do a 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.180
 course where we learn unfairly 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.090
 change the language that's what made you 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.700
 allowed for you bass it was already in 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.019
 did it was in relation to the pleasures 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.370
 all this so it's in my goal 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.739
 in the first game I had started 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.600
 already not to think about having 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.130
 high limits like that 's fine if I saw 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.920
 that sometimes there were small 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.239
 hungers of small thoughts of small 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.010
 sentences he came that it was not 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.470
 possible game like that right now 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.580
 I the opposite I said that I could 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.620
 It was my level 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.170
 so I could play like that otherwise 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.630
 I would have spent so that already 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.390
 allowed me to play better to let go 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:15.660
 then down the neck thinking the real 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.090
 victory I do not think about the score and that's me 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.160
 do not do that makes me forget and I'm coming 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.930
 suddenly has thought about my actions and 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.700
 play well 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.230
 ok ok so you can repeat the 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.760
 first what was it like that I'm going 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:33.299
 Then write the first it was for them 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.980
 not to think about my night all that 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.640
 I talked a lot about the party and 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:42.260
 I managed to put that in the 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.260
 teeth the objectives 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:56.070
 ok and then the other then it was 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.470
 focus on art on my real 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:02.010
 victory 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:04.140
 mad of the blow there is even a moment I was 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.300
 well and the jousting end I was I 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.320
 felt that I was calm so she herself 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.360
 a moment I was miba 40-15 lemmy and of 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.770
 blow and I will succeed at I managed to 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.450
 win the game but my a moment I was 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.160
 led 40-0 I think I managed to 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.320
 come back and win the game because I 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.580
 did not tell him that even like that the 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.620
 score they were they were 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.700
 unfavorable to the adversary and in 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.700
 all the cases it was good for me
