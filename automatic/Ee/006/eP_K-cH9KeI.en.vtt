00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.639
 during the winter season 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.859
 temperatures especially during the night 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.660
 they can drop considerably and i 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.490
 owners of a car equipped with an engine 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.740
 diesel could be a cold one 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.260
 morning to face a surprise 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.769
 very annoying the freezing of the 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.960
 diesel fuel 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.400
 petrol-powered cars do not have 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.550
 this problem as the temperature 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.600
 of freezing is about 48 degrees 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.850
 below zero 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.890
 diesel instead can lose its 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.840
 optimum viscosity over 12 degrees 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.460
 centigrade below zero 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.350
 it is not exactly correct to speak of 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.390
 freezing but rather of one 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.850
 chemical reaction as it is beyond one 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.950
 certain temperature the paraffins contained 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.780
 in the diesel they separate and being more 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.390
 heavy settle to the bottom of the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.559
 tank going to occlude the filter 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.210
 of diesel fuel 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.219
 the result is that your car does not 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.930
 will want to know how to start again as we can 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.969
 do then to prevent this 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.939
 inconvenience is not such a phenomenon 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.200
 common and the most frequent cases concern 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.150
 motorists who go to the mountains 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.070
 with the full fuel in the city 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.990
 the simplest solution is more 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.119
 widespread in mountain areas is 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.310
 refuel using diesel fuel 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.439
 already contains additives capable of 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.790
 bring the freezing point to less 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.619
 20 degrees Celsius 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.150
 this type of diesel can be used 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.530
 easily found in the most common 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.720
 service stations 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.520
 each oil company assigned to 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.040
 such a product a name that plays with the 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.710
 word cold and then we will have diesel fuel 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.030
 arctic blue to wine and the diesel 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.850
 distribution of this particular type 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.950
 of diesel fuel is regulated by law in fact 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.350
 from November 1st to March 31st of the year 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.420
 subsequent distributors are required to 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.159
 dispense this type of diesel precisely 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.079
 winter saying 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.909
 only drawback of the special houses and the 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.159
 price since having higher costs than 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.110
 additives production also on 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.600
 final price at the pump will be higher 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.360
 but what to do if after a night 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.520
 in the mountains the car does not start and the filter 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.259
 occluded paraffin as mentioned above 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.360
 with the improvement of the quality of 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.129
 such fuels on the market 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.899
 phenomenon is no longer as common as 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.610
 a few years ago but in extreme cases 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.380
 could still happen 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.600
 so it is better to be ready for 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.800
 to face the emergency to solve 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.750
 the problem is the only valid remedy 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.520
 would be to redeem the filter 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.140
 to dissolve the paraffin plug e 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.420
 then allow the passage of 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.020
 fuel let's see in brief what we can 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.640
 do 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.260
 the natural remedy would be to wait 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.880
 that the outside temperature saiga 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.310
 so that the paraffin plug does 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.110
 in any case, do not overdo it 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.970
 ignition also to avoid 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.650
 find yourself without a battery 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.180
 another solution is to look for the bar more 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.100
 close and ask for a jug of water 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.350
 hot to pour directly onto the 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.940
 filter if the car locked in the box or 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.440
 you have the possibility to reach one 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.570
 electricity source can be 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.370
 also use a hair dryer 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.650
 in any case it is not such an operation 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.750
 simple as the filter does not always 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.250
 easily accessible and sometimes it is 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.310
 difficult to find a source of heat 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.440
 adapts a good habit by approaching 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.209
 the winter season could be 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.010
 that of changing in advance the 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.050
 diesel filter inside the 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.300
 filter in fact accumulates dirt 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.280
 impurities and water that freezing it 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.200
 can conclude if the car does not 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.880
 wants to know to leave is appropriate 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.799
 go to the nearest workshops that 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.480
 will fix the problem now 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:22.730
 you are ready to go skiing 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.730
 and chester 24 I wish you a good journey
