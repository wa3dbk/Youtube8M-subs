00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.660
 and welcome everyone in focus this 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.849
 issue course taking you 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.370
 quickly more about heroes the storm is 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.170
 today focus is interested in johanna 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.170
 the last hero who joined the net 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.380
 so johanna op or not 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.120
 let's start by talking about his points 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.740
 strong johanna has a great 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.270
 capacity of the ccl and elsewhere 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.200
 certainly the time that by having the 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:34.450
 plus one of the other highlights of 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.070
 johanna and not least his ability 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.390
 to take the shots since she is with 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.230
 mourad mill of the two characters the 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.230
 quieter of the game 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.740
 but how can this capacity be explained? 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.740
 of time king 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.270
 and well not already by this basic stage 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.760
 because they are in the average of 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.530
 others as long as we can partly 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.570
 explain this time capacity king 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.070
 by his liabilities he grants a shield 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.750
 but also the ability to be 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.520
 insensitive to cc what is a true 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.890
 advantage since it is much more 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.940
 difficult to kill a moving target 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.470
 multimode we can also talk about 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.450
 his talents since where others 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.670
 tanks but usually interesting 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.470
 that talents increasing their damage 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.910
 or the efficiency of launching is johanna 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.360
 she has talents one allowing 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.619
 to increase satan that are born let's talk 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.540
 now from his weak points 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.810
 johanna has low capacity 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.710
 in get since it has neither jo nor dash which 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.600
 works in fact it is in the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.100
 remote guide and its purpose 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.270
 another weak point of johanna is his 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.270
 low capacity ludwig 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.970
 so what can we conclude 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.770
 and well playable is a time that is good 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.240
 in taking position since if 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.430
 you can not in geisha team 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.900
 adversary simply place yourself where the 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.940
 opponents will be forced to go this 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.530
 forcing them to choose between one 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.740
 watch johanna it's never good or 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.369
 simply avoid the fight 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.380
 personally I advocate 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.330
 mainly johanna on the cursed val 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.770
 or the eminent and because these are two 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.540
 maps on which and your opponents do not 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.619
 can not avoid bankruptcies 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.530
 or so we leave you completely 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.000
 the goal of the blow to meet the 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.590
 question asked at the beginning of the video I do not 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.600
 do not consider to johanna as a hero 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.260
 op by cons it is clearly part 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.819
 the best tank in the game 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.680
 I particularly recommend johan 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.180
 with wheels like palanca t or 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.010
 jaina who are really heroes 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.230
 need a solid protein what is 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.390
 johanna preventing the opposing team 2 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.760
 I recommend joining the single 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.829
 melee dps such as illidan 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.690
 with johanna since this one will have 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:31.390
 wrong to follow them having no 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.769
 very important mobility capabilities and 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.220
 the same way will have a hard time 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.959
 protect 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.489
 I thank you for watching this 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.230
 focus number two and invites you all 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.829
 especially to watch them on 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.090
 first on dean wall and pulling the 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.709
 first focus was on a combo of 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.000
 hero this one be a unique hero so 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.220
 a difference for me that I you 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.720
 ask also and well to give me 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.819
 your opinion on this focus there in 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.579
 comment it would help me a lot 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.180
 thanks again for following me and 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.180
 next to focus
