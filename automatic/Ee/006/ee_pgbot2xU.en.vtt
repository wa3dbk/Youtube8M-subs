00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
spot when you rotate the cabin always

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.360 
spot when you rotate the cabin always
bring<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:05.870> smile<00:02:06.080> to<00:02:06.110> your<00:02:06.380> face<00:02:06.440> and<00:02:06.950> I<00:02:07.159> think

you're<00:02:08.690> always<00:02:08.869> gonna<00:02:09.080> smile<00:02:09.440> so<00:02:09.979> that's

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
you're always gonna smile so that's

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.220 
you're always gonna smile so that's
something<00:02:10.700> that<00:02:10.910> I<00:02:11.060> think<00:02:11.420> that<00:02:11.630> would<00:02:11.930> really

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
something that I think that would really

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.380 
something that I think that would really
be<00:02:12.500> nice<00:02:12.680> in<00:02:12.890> production<00:02:13.400> and<00:02:13.730> it's<00:02:14.090> it's

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
be nice in production and it's it's

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.090 
be nice in production and it's it's
really<00:02:14.570> not<00:02:14.990> unfeasible<00:02:15.740> because

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
really not unfeasible because

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.520 
really not unfeasible because
drive-by-wire<00:02:17.030> technology<00:02:17.780> allows<00:02:18.230> you<00:02:18.440> to

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
drive-by-wire technology allows you to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.199 
drive-by-wire technology allows you to
get<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.800> be<00:02:19.070> rid<00:02:19.250> of<00:02:19.280> any<00:02:19.640> mechanical

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
get to be rid of any mechanical

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.449 
get to be rid of any mechanical
connection<00:02:20.720> so<00:02:21.290> what's<00:02:21.950> left<00:02:22.130> just

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
connection so what's left just

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.370 
connection so what's left just
electronic<00:02:22.850> connections<00:02:23.420> that's<00:02:23.600> easy<00:02:23.840> it's

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
electronic connections that's easy it's

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.430 
electronic connections that's easy it's
it's<00:02:24.709> almost<00:02:24.890> low-tech
