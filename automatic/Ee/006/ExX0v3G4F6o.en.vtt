00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.210 
point where I don't know I can see I can

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.529 
point where I don't know I can see I can
see<00:07:06.630> what's<00:07:06.960> happening<00:07:07.530> and<00:07:07.680> see<00:07:08.360> how<00:07:09.360> long

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:09.539 
see what's happening and see how long

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:11.210 
see what's happening and see how long
come<00:07:09.780> how<00:07:10.020> I've<00:07:10.470> come<00:07:10.680> in<00:07:10.830> a<00:07:10.860> couple<00:07:11.099> months

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220 
come how I've come in a couple months

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.689 
come how I've come in a couple months
and<00:07:11.669> I<00:07:12.440> just<00:07:13.440> I<00:07:13.710> think<00:07:14.220> it'd<00:07:14.340> be<00:07:14.370> more

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:14.699 
and I just I think it'd be more

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:16.219 
and I just I think it'd be more
important<00:07:15.150> to<00:07:15.210> do<00:07:15.330> the<00:07:15.479> beginning<00:07:15.599> like<00:07:16.080> when

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:16.229 
important to do the beginning like when

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:17.629 
important to do the beginning like when
I<00:07:16.259> first<00:07:16.560> started<00:07:16.830> out<00:07:16.979> because<00:07:17.280> that's<00:07:17.430> when

00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:17.639
