00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.210
 the unboxing of the new 16 gigabyte 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:14.280
 ipod touch in the color black and 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:16.770
 silver much fun in the video as an apple 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.859
 has presented the ipod touch 5g 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.550
 Apple the 4g left to continue 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.949
 to buy 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.720
 as a beginner ipod you have it now 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.650
 removed from the store he could not 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.939
 buy more apple 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.580
 That's why they have the new one here 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.700
 ipod touch as a starter model 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.140
 that has 16 has no 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.670
 camera and is only in one color 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:42.450
 available and costs 239 euros are so 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:47.340
 just under 80 euros cheaper than the normal 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.680
 ipod touch 5g htm is completely that 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.559
 same in it except stop that the camera 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.480
 is missing otherwise is identical and we catch 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.100
 times with the dredging hereby the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.539
 packaging are from the ipod touch because 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.969
 we also see an ipod touch with us 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.559
 the black front if we have the 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.120
 packing on the side view since 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.850
 once we have the lettering ipod 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.110
 touch and we see in the profile the ipod 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.220
 with the black keys then with the 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.930
 silver back 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.119
 as I said, there is only one 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.290
 execution in front black and behind 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.600
 silver we have an apple logo and a 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.610
 few information and on the back 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.770
 we have just the info that the 16 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.030
 gigabyte has 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.610
 we have a strip up here 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:33.810
 we have to deduct 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:35.460
 Let's do it the same way and be there 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.729
 we have the ipod here too 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.439
 open the packaging 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.640
 they can take out the ipod here 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.909
 can we indeed look again 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.780
 wonderful without a camera just come 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.500
 but then again to continue 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.180
 we have here 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.049
 designed by apple in california the 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.479
 whole writing is kept in black 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:01.369
 Here is a little guide for the 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.369
 ipod and of course the apples ticker 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.510
 hereby a lightning cable for 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.470
 sync and pads from the ipod 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.880
 and we have the normal ones here 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:15.080
 potts in it without a microphone and without buttons 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.080
 that's all that is in the scope of delivery 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.250
 Let's get that right here again 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.140
 purely 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.560
 the ipod is here again with so 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.320
 attached to another plastic foil 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.360
 we can pull that off then we can 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:34.230
 We here already is so turn 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:35.790
 can take out the ipod and that 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.680
 we have the good piece and I have to 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.420
 they really say incredibly well 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.580
 out with the black front and with the 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.140
 silver back since we here the 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.580
 see silver frame 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.980
 I think that really looks very 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.930
 good from here on the back we have 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.180
 a black apple logo something new 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.180
 the ipod touches black lettering 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:58.560
 ipod and up here the black bar 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.700
 as you can see no blood you can with the 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.500
 simply do not use an hatch 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.570
 and as I said the camera and the lightning 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.080
 missing the microphone we have here 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.570
 the top as a small point as well 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.580
 have the power button and at the side 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.980
 Here are two black ones again 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.340
 volume buttons the buttons are off 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.370
 plastic not like the normal ipod 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.860
 touch 5g metal here and then took 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.900
 course after the headphones input in 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.290
 black kept here and the lightning 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.450
 connection and speakers before a 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.470
 homebutton and just the 4 inches 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:37.530
 Touchscreen with front still one 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.390
 facetime hd camera to make facetime calls too 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.660
 and now we compare that 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.830
 whole times with the ipod touch 5g us 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.720
 I have the color here 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.400
 blue here comes with a white front as 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.570
 The new ones are only available in black 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.549
 front and back silver the two ipods 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.750
 have the same housing the only one 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.570
 difference is just that with the new ones 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.010
 cheaper version you only plastic 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.470
 used keys and not as at 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.540
 normal metal buttons just as up here 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.580
 at the power button and they have that 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.650
 Microphone made up there at the same time 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.540
 no camera is that the next part 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.370
 the normal ipad has just a 5 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.870
 megapixel camera with 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:18.889
 the saddle the other the new not what 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.940
 he also does not have the loop down there 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.260
 probably nobody used it anyway 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.889
 that is why not so many 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.139
 miss 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.100
 In any case , it is also missing for free 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.680
 There is really no difference 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:32.010
 they have exactly the same processor 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.960
 dual core a5 processor and design 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.360
 I like the new ipod touch a lot 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.610
 better like my iphone or the other 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.750
 ipod touch for the black front and 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.699
 the silver frames do that 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.560
 somehow very very chic and very very 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.750
 cool because that's not just an unboxing 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.310
 but I also do a hands on 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:54.690
 Now just take a look and we'll take a look 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:56.610
 times the software so now we have to 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:00.380
 I always do things 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.380
 quickly choose German language 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:12.030
 germany then we recommend the wlan 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:16.650
 from then go on further then the 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:19.500
 ipod enabled location services 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.300
 activate configure as new ipod 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.070
 apple the judge now not one 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.070
 then we see the whole team here 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:29.250
 the normal ios look which one 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.380
 software version as it is we have 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.470
 here six point 1.3 on it you are called 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.180
 you can also jailbreak the whole thing 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.700
 we'll see in the camera app because 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.440
 we do not actually have a camera 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.760
 since we only see the front camera we 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.190
 Can I switch camera or something 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.590
 but just photos with the 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.419
 make front camera or videos and we 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.220
 can just use facetime 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:52.410
 yes, I'll show you because she still has one 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.130
 little close by and then it was with 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.870
 the video 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.610
 I say goodbye in advance 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.110
 watching me when I watch the video 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.610
 did not like thumbs up 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.110
 forgotten down there, the on
