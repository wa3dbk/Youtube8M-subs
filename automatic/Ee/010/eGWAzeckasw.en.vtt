a convincing win take some confidence
from<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:58.140> then<00:02:58.230> we've<00:02:58.349> got<00:02:58.440> I<00:02:58.500> think<00:02:58.590> West

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
from it and then we've got I think West

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.130 
from it and then we've got I think West
Brom<00:02:59.159> after<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.549> Norwich<00:02:59.909> after<00:03:00.239> that<00:03:00.390> let's

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
Brom after that Norwich after that let's

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.199 
Brom after that Norwich after that let's
just<00:03:01.409> win<00:03:01.739> all<00:03:01.950> our<00:03:02.129> remaining<00:03:02.400> games<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:03.060> get

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
just win all our remaining games and get

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.460 
just win all our remaining games and get
his<00:03:03.329> top<00:03:03.569> foot<00:03:03.780> spot<00:03:03.989> right<00:03:04.109> so<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.260> mean

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
his top foot spot right so I mean

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.199 
his top foot spot right so I mean
Everton<00:03:04.829> they're<00:03:05.040> playing<00:03:05.280> away<00:03:05.370> Southampton

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
Everton they're playing away Southampton

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.729 
Everton they're playing away Southampton
so<00:03:06.450> they<00:03:06.930> can<00:03:07.140> drop<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.290> point<00:03:07.590> near

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
so they can drop a point near

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.500 
so they can drop a point near
Southampton<00:03:08.310> very<00:03:08.519> good<00:03:08.700> team<00:03:08.879> at<00:03:09.060> home<00:03:09.269> I

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
Southampton very good team at home I

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.360 
Southampton very good team at home I
remember<00:03:09.870> we<00:03:09.989> only<00:03:10.290> picked<00:03:10.859> up<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:10.980> point<00:03:11.250> now

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
remember we only picked up a point now

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.039 
remember we only picked up a point now
so<00:03:11.549> maybe<00:03:11.760> step<00:03:12.180> out<00:03:12.329> to<00:03:12.450> be<00:03:12.540> do<00:03:12.659> as<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:12.810> favour

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
so maybe step out to be do as a favour

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.300 
so maybe step out to be do as a favour
and<00:03:13.170> we<00:03:13.290> can<00:03:13.409> really<00:03:13.680> open<00:03:13.769> up<00:03:14.010> quite<00:03:14.280> a

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
and we can really open up quite a

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.879 
and we can really open up quite a
significant<00:03:14.790> gap<00:03:14.970> in<00:03:15.900> this<00:03:16.109> top<00:03:16.319> foot<00:03:16.530> battle

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
significant gap in this top foot battle

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.559 
significant gap in this top foot battle
but<00:03:17.069> it's<00:03:17.280> not<00:03:17.430> gonna<00:03:17.549> be<00:03:17.669> easy<00:03:17.849> we<00:03:18.540> are

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
but it's not gonna be easy we are

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.050 
but it's not gonna be easy we are
relying<00:03:19.169> on<00:03:19.260> Everton<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:19.709> drop<00:03:19.919> points<00:03:20.310> but<00:03:20.940> if

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
relying on Everton to drop points but if

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.180 
relying on Everton to drop points but if
we<00:03:21.180> run<00:03:21.359> out<00:03:21.660> remaining<00:03:21.989> games<00:03:22.260> then<00:03:22.590> there's

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
we run out remaining games then there's

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.740 
we run out remaining games then there's
no<00:03:23.310> reason<00:03:23.639> why<00:03:23.760> we<00:03:23.910> won't<00:03:24.060> get<00:03:24.180> saw<00:03:24.389> for<00:03:24.690> it

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
no reason why we won't get saw for it

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.390 
no reason why we won't get saw for it
was<00:03:24.959> actually<00:03:25.319> no<00:03:25.500> reason<00:03:25.739> why<00:03:25.980> we<00:03:26.069> went<00:03:26.250> down

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
was actually no reason why we went down

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.259 
was actually no reason why we went down
you<00:03:26.519> go<00:03:26.639> remember

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
you go remember

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.729 
you go remember
Everton<00:03:27.810> still<00:03:28.049> gotta<00:03:28.230> play<00:03:28.349> the<00:03:28.470> likes<00:03:28.620> of

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.470 
probably a bit safe to say we rely on
Everton<00:03:32.069> to<00:03:32.160> drop<00:03:32.370> points<00:03:32.669> because<00:03:32.849> he's<00:03:33.359> in

sister<00:04:36.210> I<00:04:36.480> mean<00:04:36.990> it's<00:04:37.080> a<00:04:37.140> massive<00:04:37.290> blow<00:04:37.530> for<00:04:37.710> us

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.440 
sister I mean it's a massive blow for us
I<00:04:37.920> wouldn't<00:04:38.700> mind<00:04:38.880> finding<00:04:39.060> out<00:04:39.330> what's

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
I wouldn't mind finding out what's

I wouldn't mind finding out what's
happened<00:04:39.750> there<00:04:39.930> I'm<00:04:40.740> so<00:04:40.950> I'm<00:04:41.040> guess<00:04:41.160> it<00:04:41.280> will

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
happened there I'm so I'm guess it will

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.310 
happened there I'm so I'm guess it will
see<00:04:41.550> someone<00:04:41.790> I'm<00:04:41.910> on<00:04:42.090> Ralphie<00:04:42.570> left<00:04:42.930> back<00:04:43.110> but

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
see someone I'm on Ralphie left back but

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.170 
see someone I'm on Ralphie left back but
for<00:04:43.920> mei-ling's<00:04:44.310> backing<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.670> team<00:04:44.880> which<00:04:45.060> is

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
for mei-ling's backing the team which is

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.480 
for mei-ling's backing the team which is
a<00:04:45.210> massive<00:04:45.600> boost<00:04:45.750> for<00:04:45.990> us<00:04:46.080> and<00:04:46.950> then<00:04:47.160> possibly

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
a massive boost for us and then possibly

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.920 
a massive boost for us and then possibly
we<00:04:47.610> could<00:04:47.820> consider<00:04:48.090> playing<00:04:48.390> him<00:04:48.630> at<00:04:48.750> left

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
we could consider playing him at left

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.900 
we could consider playing him at left
back<00:04:49.110> instead<00:04:49.890> of<00:04:49.950> monorail<00:04:50.340> but<00:04:50.610> I'll<00:04:50.760> be

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
back instead of monorail but I'll be

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.280 
back instead of monorail but I'll be
pretty<00:04:51.180> happy<00:04:51.420> with<00:04:51.600> an<00:04:51.720> unchanged<00:04:52.110> liner

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
pretty happy with an unchanged liner

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.660 
pretty happy with an unchanged liner
that<00:04:52.350> went<00:04:52.620> out<00:04:52.710> there<00:04:52.920> against<00:04:53.250> howl<00:04:53.400> I<00:04:53.430> mean

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
that went out there against howl I mean

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.790 
that went out there against howl I mean
I'll<00:04:54.000> just<00:04:54.150> play<00:04:54.300> the<00:04:54.390> same<00:04:54.600> team<00:04:54.870> same<00:04:55.500> style

said let's not underestimate new car so
let's<00:05:14.400> still<00:05:14.850> power<00:05:15.120> a<00:05:15.150> team<00:05:15.510> that<00:05:15.690> can<00:05:15.810> be

let's still power a team that can be
them<00:05:16.140> but<00:05:16.590> we<00:05:16.740> could<00:05:16.920> rotate<00:05:17.310> maybe<00:05:17.850> I<00:05:18.030> we<00:05:18.330> can

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
them but we could rotate maybe I we can

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.270
