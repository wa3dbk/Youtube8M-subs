00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.250 
colander outside of a large bowl let's
just<00:02:32.760> make<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.270> little<00:02:33.390> bit<00:02:33.600> useful<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:34.080> wash

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
just make it a little bit useful to wash

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.410 
just make it a little bit useful to wash
it<00:02:34.470> I'm<00:02:34.980> going<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.280> fill<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.550> up<00:02:35.670> until<00:02:36.300> the

don't want to wrench it down and I'm
putting<00:05:46.570> it<00:05:46.750> in<00:05:47.320> my<00:05:47.380> canner<00:05:48.070> when<00:05:48.550> I<00:05:48.580> put

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:48.789 
putting it in my canner when I put

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:50.340 
putting it in my canner when I put
everything<00:05:49.060> in<00:05:49.330> my<00:05:49.419> canner<00:05:49.690> I<00:05:49.960> want<00:05:50.139> to<00:05:50.169> make

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
everything in my canner I want to make

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.930 
everything in my canner I want to make
sure<00:05:50.380> that<00:05:50.650> my<00:05:50.740> jars<00:05:51.039> are<00:05:51.280> not<00:05:51.400> actually

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
sure that my jars are not actually

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.340 
sure that my jars are not actually
touching<00:05:52.150> because<00:05:52.570> they<00:05:52.900> could<00:05:53.110> claim

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.350 
touching because they could claim

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.060 
touching because they could claim
together<00:05:53.800> during<00:05:54.160> the<00:05:54.370> boiling<00:05:54.759> process<00:05:54.940> and

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
together during the boiling process and

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.010 
together during the boiling process and
potentially<00:05:57.070> could<00:05:57.220> break<00:05:57.520> it<00:05:57.970> works<00:05:58.210> best<00:05:58.660> if

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
potentially could break it works best if

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.379 
potentially could break it works best if
you<00:05:59.320> do<00:05:59.530> this<00:05:59.740> all<00:06:00.070> like<00:06:00.580> one<00:06:00.880> step<00:06:01.120> at<00:06:01.300> a<00:06:01.360> time

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:01.389 
you do this all like one step at a time

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:03.750 
you do this all like one step at a time
so<00:06:01.840> you<00:06:01.900> wipe<00:06:02.229> the<00:06:02.440> tops<00:06:02.680> on<00:06:03.010> all<00:06:03.220> of<00:06:03.400> them<00:06:03.550> and

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
so you wipe the tops on all of them and

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.719 
so you wipe the tops on all of them and
then<00:06:03.910> you<00:06:04.030> put<00:06:04.240> all<00:06:04.389> the<00:06:04.710> seals<00:06:05.710> the<00:06:06.250> lids<00:06:06.490> and

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
then you put all the seals the lids and

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:08.310 
then you put all the seals the lids and
seals<00:06:07.060> on<00:06:07.360> and<00:06:07.690> then<00:06:07.780> you<00:06:07.870> put<00:06:08.020> all<00:06:08.169> the

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
seals on and then you put all the

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.189 
seals on and then you put all the
sealing<00:06:08.710> rings<00:06:08.949> on<00:06:09.160> at<00:06:09.850> one<00:06:10.330> time<00:06:10.600> rather<00:06:11.050> than

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 
sealing rings on at one time rather than

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:13.800 
sealing rings on at one time rather than
doing<00:06:11.560> one<00:06:11.979> jar<00:06:12.310> doing<00:06:12.910> the<00:06:13.000> next<00:06:13.180> jar<00:06:13.479> just

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
doing one jar doing the next jar just

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.330 
doing one jar doing the next jar just
makes<00:06:14.050> everything<00:06:14.260> go<00:06:14.680> faster<00:06:16.380> so<00:06:17.380> this<00:06:18.010> is

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
makes everything go faster so this is

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.790 
makes everything go faster so this is
actually<00:06:18.760> the<00:06:19.210> lid<00:06:19.449> to<00:06:19.479> my<00:06:19.810> steam<00:06:20.110> canner<00:06:20.440> is

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
actually the lid to my steam canner is

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.860 
actually the lid to my steam canner is
what<00:06:20.979> i<00:06:21.009> was<00:06:21.190> using<00:06:21.520> sterilized<00:06:22.090> jars<00:06:22.539> and

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
what i was using sterilized jars and

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.230 
what i was using sterilized jars and
lids<00:06:22.990> this<00:06:23.770> my<00:06:23.979> least<00:06:24.280> favorite<00:06:24.759> part<00:06:24.940> of

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
lids this my least favorite part of

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.300 
lids this my least favorite part of
canning<00:06:25.750> is<00:06:25.930> having<00:06:26.320> to<00:06:26.500> move<00:06:26.650> large

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
canning is having to move large

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.800 
canning is having to move large
quantities<00:06:27.550> of<00:06:28.060> boiling<00:06:28.599> hot<00:06:28.750> water

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
quantities of boiling hot water

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.230 
quantities of boiling hot water
especially<00:06:29.710> be<00:06:30.310> careful<00:06:30.760> if<00:06:30.940> you<00:06:31.060> have<00:06:31.210> a

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
especially be careful if you have a

especially be careful if you have a
small<00:06:31.539> child<00:06:31.780> make<00:06:32.199> sure<00:06:32.380> that<00:06:32.560> you<00:06:32.680> never

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:32.949 
small child make sure that you never

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:35.820 
small child make sure that you never
carry<00:06:33.760> boiling<00:06:34.389> water<00:06:34.630> over<00:06:34.960> your<00:06:35.169> child's

carry boiling water over your child's

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.860 
carry boiling water over your child's
head<00:06:36.070> so<00:06:36.400> I'm<00:06:36.460> just<00:06:36.639> going<00:06:36.789> to<00:06:36.849> put<00:06:36.910> this<00:06:37.060> on

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:37.870 
head so I'm just going to put this on

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:42.210 
head so I'm just going to put this on
top<00:06:38.110> of<00:06:38.289> here<00:06:38.440> and<00:06:38.729> turn<00:06:39.729> it<00:06:39.940> on<00:06:40.380> high<00:06:41.380> I've<00:06:41.860> got

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.220 
top of here and turn it on high I've got

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.909 
top of here and turn it on high I've got
about<00:06:42.340> two<00:06:43.210> inches<00:06:43.240> of<00:06:43.750> water<00:06:43.990> in<00:06:44.320> the<00:06:44.650> bottom

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:44.919 
about two inches of water in the bottom

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:47.100 
about two inches of water in the bottom
of<00:06:44.979> the<00:06:45.099> steam<00:06:45.340> canner<00:06:45.639> and<00:06:45.970> I'm<00:06:46.030> watching<00:06:46.240> for

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.110 
of the steam canner and I'm watching for

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.110 
of the steam canner and I'm watching for
a<00:06:47.380> steady<00:06:47.740> column<00:06:48.159> of<00:06:48.310> steam<00:06:48.580> to<00:06:48.820> come<00:06:48.970> out

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 
a steady column of steam to come out

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.399 
a steady column of steam to come out
these<00:06:49.330> holes<00:06:49.599> then<00:06:49.900> i'm<00:06:50.020> going<00:06:50.139> to<00:06:50.229> start

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:50.409 
these holes then i'm going to start
