00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.820

 still writers of my own magazine 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.050
 but I soon realized that 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.880
 was not possible 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.770
 I then went to a ferry 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.390

 I was able to perfect 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.670
 English Spanish and acquire some 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.160

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.540
 I also took advantage of this period to 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.300
 pass my bafa which allowed me to 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.560

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.830
