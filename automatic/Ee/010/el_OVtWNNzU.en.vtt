00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.219
 and well, it 's talking very well that 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.170
 PlayStation 4 is going to sell a lot of 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.049
 that sony could go pretty well 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.760
 over the next few years but it's not going to 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.920
 be precisely on the portable terrain 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.020
 or at least for what we see but they are and 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.390
 is still buried in that your console 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.769
 playstation vita will sell and good 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.199
 Well, the truth is that the console 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.330
 honestly I have the quality that 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.070
 offers is impressive and I think so 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.250
 who deserves it and little by little because 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.079
 we are seeing that they are approaching 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.079
 best titles to this sony laptop 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.230
 but they are still far from reaching 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.090
 what the great nintendo 3ds has come 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.190
 the fact is that they are and still think that 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.980
 Playstation Vita has possibilities in 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.280
 the portable market suffered a drop in 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.190
 price this week already you know its 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.219
 seal oxida president of sony worldwide 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.440
 studios has already talked about the future of 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.329
 your long-term laptop eye your 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.430
 words because he says I still think 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.110
 we can pursue the portable market 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.330
 and I do not think I have to take a 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.160
 decision about it right now as well 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.350
 the difference between laptops and 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.960
 mobile phones is becoming more diffuse 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.820
 we still like playstation vita and 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.520
 we know that the people who buy it 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.110
 she is also happy with her the truth 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.820
 this is that last thing you said to 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.979
 truth I agree with the people that 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.080
 buy playstation vita technically not 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.150
 you can enjoy this console since 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.640
 technically playstation vita is 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.400
 Pretty toe is like playing 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.080
 almost to playstation 3 on a console 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.700
 laptop and the truth is that that 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.500
 thanks but it is true that the 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.360
 catalog has to grow a little bit more 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.920
 offer some more interesting titles 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.600
 it is also true that during the 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.970
 last weeks we have known great 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.890
 news about playstation vita 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.899
 that would make us buy the 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.119
 console is for example that version of 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.910
 borderlands 2 was a very good news 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.979
 and also a guarantee that this 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.840
 console is powerful to hold games 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.420
 and indeed if you have any questions do not 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.789
 you have more to try the beta of that 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.710
 kill are mercenaries for playstation 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.810
 vita impressive quality 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.000
 I assure you it seems that we are playing 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.200
 to a playstation 3 game in a 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.730
 portable console 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.140
 the fact is that well you know that 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.600
 Playstation Vita was put on sale to 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.520
 end of the year 2011 in japan already 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.980
 early last year in the rest 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.860
 of the world the console is suffering a 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.330
 very slow start 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.310
 currently but good despite the 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.250
 improvement of its sales in the territory 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.490
 Japan already know that this week is 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.370
 has reduced its official price to 199.99 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.880
 euros we'll see if this way sells 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.880
 a little more 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.819
 very well
