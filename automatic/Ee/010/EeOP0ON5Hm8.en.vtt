00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.649 
microscope out and really observing
cells<00:04:07.409> and<00:04:08.189> they<00:04:08.340> have<00:04:08.549> that<00:04:08.879> knowledge<00:04:09.150> so

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 
cells and they have that knowledge so

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:11.709 
cells and they have that knowledge so
they<00:04:09.780> can<00:04:09.930> have<00:04:10.049> conversation<00:04:10.650> about<00:04:10.829> cells

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:11.719 
they can have conversation about cells

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:14.899 
they can have conversation about cells
and<00:04:12.719> that<00:04:13.139> makes<00:04:13.409> our<00:04:14.189> atmosphere<00:04:14.790> in<00:04:14.849> our

and that makes our atmosphere in our

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:20.810 
and that makes our atmosphere in our
home<00:04:15.090> very<00:04:15.299> interesting
