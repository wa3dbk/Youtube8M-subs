00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:15.310 
know there's a lot of charm in the first

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.870 
know there's a lot of charm in the first
movie<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:18.010> second<00:00:18.279> one<00:00:18.400> was<00:00:18.490> kind<00:00:18.699> of<00:00:18.730> our

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
movie the second one was kind of our

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.500 
movie the second one was kind of our
summer<00:00:19.330> flings<00:00:19.690> that<00:00:19.960> was<00:00:20.050> really<00:00:20.289> fun<00:00:21.510> but

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
this third the third movie is I think

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.540 
this third the third movie is I think
just<00:00:26.289> a<00:00:26.320> little<00:00:26.380> bit<00:00:26.590> higher<00:00:26.740> caliber<00:00:27.250> you

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
just a little bit higher caliber you

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.390 
just a little bit higher caliber you
know<00:00:27.640> it's<00:00:27.850> we<00:00:28.180> had<00:00:28.449> more<00:00:29.410> resources<00:00:29.920> mortar

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
know it's we had more resources mortar

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.810 
know it's we had more resources mortar
fingertips<00:00:30.850> we<00:00:31.060> had<00:00:31.949> honestly<00:00:32.949> the<00:00:33.370> training

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
fingertips we had honestly the training

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.049 
fingertips we had honestly the training
of<00:00:33.910> the<00:00:33.969> past<00:00:34.270> two<00:00:34.449> movies<00:00:34.809> that<00:00:35.109> really

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
of the past two movies that really

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.399 
of the past two movies that really
accelerated<00:00:37.059> the<00:00:37.390> choreography<00:00:38.019> in<00:00:38.229> this

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:38.409 
accelerated the choreography in this

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:41.549 
accelerated the choreography in this
film<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.760> I<00:00:39.789> would<00:00:40.329> say<00:00:40.510> that<00:00:40.749> I<00:00:40.960> think

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
film so I would say that I think

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:43.529 
film so I would say that I think
graduating<00:00:42.100> with<00:00:42.219> the<00:00:42.280> Wildcats<00:00:42.550> is<00:00:42.969> probably

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:43.539 
graduating with the Wildcats is probably

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:45.719 
graduating with the Wildcats is probably
my<00:00:43.690> favorite<00:00:44.079> that's<00:00:45.069> hard<00:00:45.339> because<00:00:45.489> they're

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:45.729 
my favorite that's hard because they're

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:49.169 
my favorite that's hard because they're
also<00:00:45.909> fun<00:00:46.569> for<00:00:46.749> different<00:00:47.019> reasons<00:00:48.120> but<00:00:49.120> I

00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:49.179 
also fun for different reasons but I

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:51.989 
also fun for different reasons but I
think<00:00:49.510> one<00:00:49.960> that<00:00:50.199> I<00:00:50.469> will<00:00:50.769> always<00:00:51.039> remember<00:00:51.190> is

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:51.999 
think one that I will always remember is

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:54.329 
think one that I will always remember is

very last day of filming on the first

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.509 
very last day of filming on the first

this magic and it was just overwhelming

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:07.920 
this magic and it was just overwhelming
I<00:01:06.280> remember<00:01:06.610> I<00:01:06.640> was<00:01:06.909> crying<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:07.480> Monique<00:01:07.720> was

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
I remember I was crying and Monique was

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.930 
I remember I was crying and Monique was
crying<00:01:08.230> and<00:01:08.320> Ashley<00:01:08.620> was<00:01:08.770> crying<00:01:09.040> but<00:01:09.670> it<00:01:09.790> was

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
crying and Ashley was crying but it was

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.940 
crying and Ashley was crying but it was
just<00:01:10.150> this<00:01:10.390> incredible<00:01:11.080> thing<00:01:11.350> where<00:01:11.560> we<00:01:11.740> were

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
just this incredible thing where we were

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.330 
just this incredible thing where we were
all<00:01:12.310> together<00:01:12.940> as<00:01:13.390> a<00:01:13.450> family<00:01:13.630> and<00:01:14.200> it<00:01:15.040> was<00:01:15.190> just

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
all together as a family and it was just

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.130 
all together as a family and it was just
magical<00:01:15.760> pairing<00:01:16.390> for<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.540> dancers<00:01:16.810> is<00:01:16.960> very

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
magical pairing for the dancers is very

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.720 
magical pairing for the dancers is very
fun<00:01:17.350> it's<00:01:17.620> very<00:01:17.770> involved<00:01:18.040> though<00:01:18.460> too<00:01:20.730> but

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
fun it's very involved though too but

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.910 
fun it's very involved though too but
it's<00:01:21.850> it's<00:01:22.090> it's<00:01:22.450> an<00:01:22.570> exciting<00:01:22.990> process<00:01:23.230> I'm

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
it's it's it's an exciting process I'm

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.370 
it's it's it's an exciting process I'm
usually<00:01:24.190> the<00:01:24.460> last<00:01:24.490> one<00:01:24.760> to<00:01:25.150> learn<00:01:25.330> the<00:01:26.020> dances

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
usually the last one to learn the dances

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.930 
usually the last one to learn the dances
so<00:01:26.650> it's<00:01:26.800> a<00:01:26.860> little<00:01:27.190> bit<00:01:27.310> frustrating<00:01:27.460> at

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
so it's a little bit frustrating at

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.900 
so it's a little bit frustrating at
times<00:01:28.060> but<00:01:28.990> inevitably<00:01:29.710> I<00:01:29.800> pick<00:01:30.550> it<00:01:30.670> up<00:01:30.730> like

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
times but inevitably I pick it up like

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.200 
times but inevitably I pick it up like
the<00:01:31.060> day<00:01:31.240> we<00:01:31.450> film<00:01:31.660> the<00:01:31.840> scene

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
the day we film the scene

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.330 
the day we film the scene
so<00:01:34.210> it's<00:01:34.660> rushed<00:01:34.960> but<00:01:35.230> it's<00:01:35.440> exciting<00:01:35.920> there

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340
