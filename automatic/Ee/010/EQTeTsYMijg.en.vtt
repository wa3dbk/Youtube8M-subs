ok<00:00:12.190> here's<00:00:13.190> another<00:00:13.280> combo<00:00:13.820> which<00:00:13.969> I<00:00:14.150> found

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
ok here's another combo which I found

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:31.570 
ok here's another combo which I found
quite<00:00:14.660> effective

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.630 

if<00:00:32.580> you've<00:00:32.760> ever<00:00:32.970> used<00:00:33.090> slacking<00:00:33.870> before

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
if you've ever used slacking before

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.770 
if you've ever used slacking before
you'll<00:00:35.640> notice<00:00:35.850> its<00:00:36.630> ability<00:00:37.590> truant<00:00:38.510> we<00:00:39.510> said

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
you'll notice its ability truant we said

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.370 
you'll notice its ability truant we said
to<00:00:39.870> move<00:00:40.050> only<00:00:40.230> every<00:00:40.710> two<00:00:40.890> terms<00:00:42.170> which<00:00:43.170> can

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
to move only every two terms which can

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.580 
to move only every two terms which can
be<00:00:43.500> slightly<00:00:43.800> annoying<00:00:45.230> can<00:00:46.230> leave<00:00:46.350> him

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
be slightly annoying can leave him

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:54.920 
be slightly annoying can leave him
vulnerable<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:47.489> sweepers<00:00:49.640> so<00:00:53.780> there<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.900> a

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
vulnerable to sweepers so there is a

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.530 
vulnerable to sweepers so there is a
good<00:00:55.200> way<00:00:55.350> for<00:00:55.680> people<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:57.410> get<00:00:58.410> rid<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.620> this

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
good way for people to get rid of this

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.579 
good way for people to get rid of this
for<00:01:00.540> this<00:01:00.629> example<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:01.230> will<00:01:01.260> use<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.890> cradling

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
for this example I will use a cradling

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:11.180 
for this example I will use a cradling
now<00:01:05.630> we'll<00:01:06.630> move<00:01:08.659> gasps<00:01:09.659> trusted<00:01:10.140> now<00:01:11.070> they

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
now we'll move gasps trusted now they

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.460 
now we'll move gasps trusted now they
suppress<00:01:11.550> is<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> pokemons<00:01:12.180> ability<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:13.320> this

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
suppress is a pokemons ability in this

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:21.610 
suppress is a pokemons ability in this
case<00:01:13.940> could<00:01:14.940> use<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.300> I<00:01:15.510> was<00:01:16.290> lacking

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.050 

slacking<00:01:22.620> itself<00:01:23.010> would<00:01:23.190> make<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.370> very<00:01:23.520> good

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
slacking itself would make a very good

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.650 
slacking itself would make a very good
sleeper<00:01:24.920> seeing<00:01:25.920> speed<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.520> its<00:01:27.060> attack<00:01:27.420> of

sleeper seeing speed and its attack of
both<00:01:28.080> very<00:01:28.620> good<00:01:31.190> now<00:01:32.780> although<00:01:33.780> gastro<00:01:34.140> astex

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
both very good now although gastro astex

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.140 
both very good now although gastro astex
doesn't<00:01:34.770> hit<00:01:34.860> all<00:01:35.010> the<00:01:35.130> time<00:01:35.370> if<00:01:36.030> you

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
doesn't hit all the time if you

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.910 
doesn't hit all the time if you
something<00:01:36.450> like<00:01:36.600> Priya<00:01:36.810> Delhi<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.619> can<00:01:37.800> keep

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
something like Priya Delhi you can keep

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:51.680 
something like Priya Delhi you can keep
it<00:01:38.070> up<00:01:38.130> within<00:01:38.369> grain<00:01:50.150> this<00:01:51.150> case<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.570> will

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
it up within grain this case it will

00:01:51.690 --> 00:02:08.029 
it up within grain this case it will
have<00:01:51.900> which<00:01:52.800> is<00:01:52.830> lucky

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.640 

now<00:02:09.039> seeing<00:02:09.670> of<00:02:09.789> word<00:02:09.940> you<00:02:10.060> spoke<00:02:10.330> up<00:02:10.650> its

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
now seeing of word you spoke up its

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.720 
now seeing of word you spoke up its
attacks<00:02:11.920> can<00:02:12.100> be<00:02:12.220> pretty<00:02:12.430> hot<00:02:12.930> now<00:02:14.730> earthquake

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
attacks can be pretty hot now earthquake

isn't exactly what you'll need but in

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.760 
isn't exactly what you'll need but in
this<00:02:20.530> case<00:02:20.800> I<00:02:21.280> will<00:02:22.000> use<00:02:22.480> it<00:02:22.660> because<00:02:23.350> it<00:02:23.590> is

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
this case I will use it because it is

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:32.400 
this case I will use it because it is
strong<00:02:24.160> now<00:02:24.990> have<00:02:25.990> a<00:02:26.020> look<00:02:29.970> but<00:02:31.080> see<00:02:32.080> nothing

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
strong now have a look but see nothing

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.540 

that's<00:02:47.770> it<00:02:47.950> for<00:02:48.099> now<00:02:48.220> in<00:02:48.520> training<00:02:48.880> tax<00:02:50.550> code
