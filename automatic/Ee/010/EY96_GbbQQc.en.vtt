00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.309
 very good to all and welcome to a 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.260
 new video today as you see we are facing 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.029
 an accessory for android phones though 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.800
 it also works for iphone or for a 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.220
 computer that are headphones 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.490
 bluetooth are the energy system bt 3 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.619
 plus and as its name indicates it has 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.560
 bluetooth and they are also a version 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.480
 improved from a previous model that I know 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.010
 that what is most characteristic of this 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.559
 good device as you see in the 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.290
 box has a pretty elegant design and 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.200
 really comfortable pads that 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:46.129
 bring the box as the box comes very 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:49.340
 simply with a usb micro usb cable 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.960
 which is used to charge the headphones and 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.550
 that does not come with its own charger but 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.590
 well we can load it on the computer 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.390
 we can use our mobile 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.540
 etc. here you have the headphones 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:05.229
 They are really elegant as you can see from a 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.869
 piece has a touch that mimics the skin 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.780
 in the part of the crown and the 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.450
 pads are really skin are 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.759
 extendable in case you do not need a 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.350
 little more in size and say that the 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.750
 only drawback we have found 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.430
 is that the arch is a little small 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.110
 It's also possible that I may have the 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.750
 head a little big we are not going to deny it 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.960
 but it is the only fault as we say that 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.460
 has caught our attention in the one 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.619
 of the sides in the right as you see 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.600
 we have control and that from the 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.940
 own headphones without wires by 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.460
 Of course we can control the start and 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.340
 pause music playback 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:46.509
 or of the call raise and lower the volume 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.190
 and move forward and backward the songs 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.310
 because we say of the call because 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.920
 besides being able to control in our 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.840
 music we can also control 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.540
 the status of calls from our 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.100
 mobile as you see we just turned it on 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:06.070
 leaving it pressed and we already have it 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.210
 synchronized with our mobile in this 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.690
 case 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.670
 we click directly on the button and 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.110
 the reproduction begins 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.110
 of our music 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.250
 let's give it back we're going to put 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.660
 another song 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.030
 and as you can see when we click on the 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.370
 buttons let's go going you see in the 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.690
 top the song that is in 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.900
 playback if we press the button 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.710
 central because we pass the music in a 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.600
 very simple in addition these headphones 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:50.210
 can you tell us the state of the 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.350
 battery in our mobile as you see if 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:56.300
 press we will take the adjustments 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.820
 to tell us if we want to control the 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.410
 audio call or music form 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.630
 independent that is we can do the 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.600
 two things or one of them and also 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.820
 We can show the remaining battery in 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.070
 the eye notifications bar is not the 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.690
 mobile battery are the battery of 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.760
 our headphones are heard 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.920
 really well has a range of 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.410
 between 8 and 10 hours although in practice 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.240
 it's a little bit less, despite us 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.920
 we have used what we have left in pause 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.950
 normal goes off we have left 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.100
 entered and they are really comfortable to wear 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.710
 very very pretty very elegant 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.020
 and as an accessory for those who 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.780
 listen to a lot of music because the truth is 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.510
 which is quite curious we are going to leave you 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.630
