position<00:01:57.570> we<00:01:58.110> use<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.469> analogy<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:59.009> lot

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
position we use that analogy a lot

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.469 
position we use that analogy a lot

because what it does is it gets your

because what it does is it gets your
