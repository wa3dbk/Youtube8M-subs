it all the way down to the bottom nice

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.420 
it all the way down to the bottom nice
and<00:04:47.169> saturate<00:04:47.560> you<00:04:47.650> probably<00:04:47.949> never<00:04:48.099> have<00:04:48.310> to

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
and saturate you probably never have to

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.689 
and saturate you probably never have to
do<00:04:48.550> it<00:04:48.699> this<00:04:49.030> saturated<00:04:49.569> again<00:04:50.699> plants

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
do it this saturated again plants

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.790 
do it this saturated again plants
generally<00:04:51.940> only<00:04:52.330> grow<00:04:52.629> the<00:04:52.780> top<00:04:52.990> 12<00:04:53.319> to<00:04:53.440> 14

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
generally only grow the top 12 to 14

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.339 
generally only grow the top 12 to 14
inches<00:04:53.889> of<00:04:54.190> soil<00:04:54.370> so<00:04:54.930> let's<00:04:55.930> get<00:04:56.050> it<00:04:56.169> nice<00:04:56.319> and

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:56.349 
inches of soil so let's get it nice and

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:58.800 
inches of soil so let's get it nice and
saturated<00:04:56.770> you<00:04:57.759> need<00:04:57.940> to<00:04:58.030> reestablish<00:04:58.300> that

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
saturated you need to reestablish that

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.570 
saturated you need to reestablish that
siphon<00:04:59.319> so<00:04:59.530> the<00:04:59.620> plant<00:04:59.860> can<00:05:00.009> grow<00:05:00.069> and<00:05:00.490> get

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
siphon so the plant can grow and get

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.510 
siphon so the plant can grow and get
water<00:05:00.849> out<00:05:00.940> of<00:05:01.060> the<00:05:01.150> ground<00:05:01.530> so<00:05:03.629> here<00:05:04.629> we<00:05:04.659> go

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
water out of the ground so here we go

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.399
