00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.260 
experience of last season and several
seven<00:00:32.160> or<00:00:32.250> eight<00:00:32.309> other<00:00:32.430> players<00:00:32.730> has<00:00:33.059> that

seven or eight other players has that
stood<00:00:33.510> -<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.809> squad<00:00:34.280> yes<00:00:35.280> definitely<00:00:35.820> but

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
stood - this squad yes definitely but

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.090 
stood - this squad yes definitely but
I've<00:00:36.329> worked<00:00:37.230> with<00:00:37.350> Mike<00:00:37.530> obviously<00:00:37.710> last

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
I've worked with Mike obviously last

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.170 
I've worked with Mike obviously last
week<00:00:38.399> last<00:00:39.120> year<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:40.260> think<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:41.180> understand

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
week last year and I think I understand

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.490 
week last year and I think I understand
the<00:00:42.300> game<00:00:42.450> plan<00:00:42.719> it's<00:00:42.960> more<00:00:43.110> or<00:00:43.170> less<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.379> same

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
the game plan it's more or less the same

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.459 
the game plan it's more or less the same
from<00:00:43.710> last<00:00:43.890> year<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.940> think<00:00:45.600> there's<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.230> bit

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
from last year so I think there's a bit

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.020 
from last year so I think there's a bit
of<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.649> bit<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.039> difference<00:00:47.399> from<00:00:47.520> last<00:00:47.610> year

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
of a bit of difference from last year

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.260 
of a bit of difference from last year
but<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.870> think<00:00:49.469> it's<00:00:49.829> just<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.520> know<00:00:50.640> sometimes

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
but I think it's just you know sometimes

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.819 
but I think it's just you know sometimes
comes<00:00:51.510> down<00:00:51.719> there<00:00:51.930> but<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> lot<00:00:52.320> at<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.530> start

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
comes down there but a lot at the start

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.910 
comes down there but a lot at the start
but<00:00:53.070> ya<00:00:53.910> know<00:00:54.239> we're<00:00:55.170> happy<00:00:55.379> with<00:00:55.559> where<00:00:55.770> we

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
but ya know we're happy with where we

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.920 
but ya know we're happy with where we
are<00:00:55.949> at<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.190> moment<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.699> you've<00:00:57.570> had<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.750> good

three wins out of three at home so
you're<00:01:06.600> obviously<00:01:06.720> on<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> roll<00:01:07.320> here<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.860> I

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
you're obviously on a roll here and I

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.130 
you're obviously on a roll here and I
mean<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.670> championship<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.780> your<00:01:09.900> sights

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
mean the championship is in your sights

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.750 
mean the championship is in your sights
but<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.650> about<00:01:10.740> taking<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.250> one<00:01:11.369> game<00:01:11.520> at<00:01:11.580> a

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
but is it about taking it one game at a

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.730 
but is it about taking it one game at a
time<00:01:11.869> yeah<00:01:12.869> definitely<00:01:13.320> that's<00:01:13.409> what<00:01:13.619> we've

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
time yeah definitely that's what we've

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.830 
time yeah definitely that's what we've
been<00:01:13.770> doing<00:01:14.159> from<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.850> start<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.360> we've<00:01:15.659> had

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
been doing from the start and we've had

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.050 
been doing from the start and we've had
a<00:01:15.869> couple<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.920> tight<00:01:17.100> games<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.610> Wales<00:01:17.820> and

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
a couple of tight games of Wales and

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.170 
a couple of tight games of Wales and
France<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.780> then<00:01:18.960> trouble<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:20.430> Scotland<00:01:21.090> in

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
France and then trouble the Scotland in

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.640 
France and then trouble the Scotland in
the<00:01:21.299> early<00:01:21.450> game<00:01:21.630> we<00:01:21.810> won<00:01:21.930> comfortably<00:01:22.200> enough

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
the early game we won comfortably enough

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.350 
the early game we won comfortably enough
so<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.189> think<00:01:23.580> that's<00:01:23.729> good<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:23.939> we've<00:01:24.210> had

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
so I think that's good that we've had

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.330 
so I think that's good that we've had
those<00:01:24.509> experiences<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.320> we've<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.130> been

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
those experiences and we've just been

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.770 
those experiences and we've just been
taking<00:01:26.670> on<00:01:26.729> one<00:01:26.880> game<00:01:27.030> at<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> time<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.630> there's

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
taking on one game at a time so there's

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.660 
taking on one game at a time so there's
only<00:01:27.869> one<00:01:27.990> left<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.619> that's<00:01:28.920> England's<00:01:29.400> over

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670
