00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.860
 unveiled at the cologne show in 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.140
 last october aprilia dorsoduro 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.610
 12/100 stands out from the 7.50 by a 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.349
 bigger engine but also by 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.769
 the arrival of traction control coupled with 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.990
 the decline 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.190
 we released the beast from his stand 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.360
 to let her express herself in any 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.360
 freedom on Spanish roads 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.910
 as well 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.010
 side look the sweet years looks like 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.050
 for trait at 7 50 and that's good 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.030
 indeed the design cut to the bill and 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.589
 still as devastating with ten pounds 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.170
 more on the balance the sweet in front 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:54.470
 at 219 kg and its tank goes from 12 to 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.000
 15 liters lifted from open at 90 Â° can 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.500
 a good compactness develops 130 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.120
 horses at 8000 700 rpm 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.469
 this surplus of horses and weights 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.100
 need some reinforcements on the 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.780
 cycle part 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.100
 the latter is also lengthen 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.200
 in order to increase the stability of this 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.890
 machine capable of flirting with the 240 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.890
 kilometers chrono 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.000
 this engine for and torque offers 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.259
 good feelings flexible and voluntary 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.820
 from the lowest speeds it benefits 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.420
 a nice length up to 2000 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.770
 rpm 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.509
 the rise is 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.649
 incredibly enjoyable and the outputs 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.479
 turn on the rear wheel are 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.070
 legion to measure this debauchery 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.450
 power the accelerator is entrusted to 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.520
 teamprise by wire technology 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.649
 fully electronic is now 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.210
 perfectly mastered the dorsoduro is 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.100
 so still fun to drive and this 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.340
 despite the traction control that knows 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.750
 to be discreet without lack of efficiency 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.920
 we regret however that aprilia this 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.810
 be more focused on 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.819
 power rather than on the cycle part 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.350
 which lack precision on the other hand 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:45.789
 the brembo radial brakes offer a very 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.710
 good felt a sacred power 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.600
 all coupled to the bs that allows for 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.399
 to please without being afraid 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.899
 final lift of 230 horses is a 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.319
 success by being flexible 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.090
 and powerful 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.619
 if piloting assistance is the 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.700
 welcome to master the beast us 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.870
 would have liked a better comfort 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.170
 general and a front train more incisive 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.170
 100 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.230
 between his homework site
