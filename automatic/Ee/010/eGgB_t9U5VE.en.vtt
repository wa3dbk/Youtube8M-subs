00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.740 
in my hair bag all for the longest time
and<00:00:58.680> I'm<00:00:59.280> using<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.640> little<00:00:59.760> bit<00:00:59.879> of<00:00:59.969> Pantene

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
and I'm using a little bit of Pantene

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.359 
and I'm using a little bit of Pantene
leave-in<00:01:01.559> conditioner<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:03.559> so<00:01:04.559> basically

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
leave-in conditioner and so basically

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.940 
leave-in conditioner and so basically
water<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.270> Pantene<00:01:06.780> conditioner<00:01:07.439> very

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
water and Pantene conditioner very

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.469 
water and Pantene conditioner very
lightly<00:01:08.369> I'm<00:01:08.760> not<00:01:08.939> going<00:01:10.159> too<00:01:11.159> heavy<00:01:11.790> on<00:01:12.150> it

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
lightly I'm not going too heavy on it

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.850 
lightly I'm not going too heavy on it
because<00:01:12.780> then<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.170> going<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.409> take<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> long

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
because then it's going to take a long

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.719 
because then it's going to take a long
time<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.340> dry<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:16.040> this<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.220> it

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
time to dry so this is it

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.170 
time to dry so this is it
and<00:01:18.259> I'm<00:01:19.259> going<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.470> leave<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:19.979> until<00:01:20.400> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
and I'm going to leave this in until the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.180 
and I'm going to leave this in until the
sections<00:01:21.689> dry<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.979> they'll<00:01:23.520> be<00:01:23.700> refreshed
