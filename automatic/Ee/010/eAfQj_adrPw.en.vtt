00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.110
 Hello everyone, today I present to you the staples 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.299
 a fantastic search and I lost time 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.320
 does from the site cook at random 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.320
 try it you won't regret it 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.349
 start crushing your le 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.070
 your potatoes that you have made 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:36.780
 cool with the fork by hand 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.980
 united and all the other ingredients 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.280
 starting from the butter with the sugar the 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.280
 salt 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:01:11.170
 the lemon peel then the flour 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:26.319
 a small bowl lightly beat the two 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:28.509
 eggs and united was then always composed in 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:30.399
 a small bowl to make it easier for me 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.430
 I put a spoonful of warm water 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:36.060
 where I melted 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:44.790
 the yeast is the only naturally has 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:57.780
 compound once done this there 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:59.940
 what remains is to knead well once 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.979
 I finish kneading there remains only 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.440
 to make the place leaven a fact 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.710
 that it was dough for a minimum of two 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.710
 hours 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.179
 naturally they live let rise and 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.179
 the better 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.300
 once it is leavened it does not remain there 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.500
 other than preparing your donuts 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.900
 you can prepare them 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.010
 rolling out the dough and forming your own 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.579
 graf with a glass 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.840
 I preferred to cut and form 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.840
 hand staples 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:39.569
 get the sugar where you need it 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:43.370
 naturally switch your staples 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.370
 as soon as hot comes out of hot oil 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:57.840
 put on the oil I recommend that you must 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:03:00.379
 be warm lori and warm there 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.379
 it remains to flee 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:31.250
 I like to serve them freshly made 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:34.340
 tray this recipe will get you 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.780

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.780
