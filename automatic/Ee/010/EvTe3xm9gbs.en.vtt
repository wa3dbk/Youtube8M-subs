so before learning a waffle what you
want<00:00:13.890> to<00:00:13.980> do<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.250> make<00:00:14.490> sure<00:00:14.519> you<00:00:14.760> have<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:14.940> wall

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
want to do is make sure you have a wall

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.880 
want to do is make sure you have a wall
flip<00:00:15.600> and<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:16.680> back<00:00:17.070> fold<00:00:17.490> or<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.849> cork<00:00:18.619> the<00:00:19.619> cork

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
flip and a back fold or a cork the cork

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.529 
flip and a back fold or a cork the cork
will<00:00:20.010> help<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.340> lot<00:00:20.460> because<00:00:20.730> it's<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.300> very

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
will help a lot because it's a very

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.570 
will help a lot because it's a very
similar<00:00:21.840> motion<00:00:22.440> because<00:00:23.220> you're<00:00:23.369> jumping

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
similar motion because you're jumping

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.830 
similar motion because you're jumping
off<00:00:23.940> one<00:00:24.240> leg<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.750> doing<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.440> full<00:00:25.710> twist<00:00:26.840> also

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
off one leg and doing a full twist also

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.870 
off one leg and doing a full twist also
helps<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.350> lot<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.830> learn<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:29.430> trick<00:00:29.640> on<00:00:29.850> a

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
helps you a lot to learn this trick on a

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.240 
helps you a lot to learn this trick on a
slight<00:00:30.330> angle<00:00:30.600> wall<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.590> don't<00:00:31.740> want<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:31.980> to

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
slight angle wall you don't want it to

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.250 
slight angle wall you don't want it to
slanted<00:00:32.879> because<00:00:33.570> then<00:00:33.750> you're<00:00:33.900> gonna<00:00:33.989> have

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
slanted because then you're gonna have

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.650 
slanted because then you're gonna have
to<00:00:34.379> really<00:00:34.620> focus<00:00:34.860> on<00:00:35.220> pushing<00:00:35.460> out<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> lot<00:00:36.090> but

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
to really focus on pushing out a lot but

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.569 
to really focus on pushing out a lot but
if<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.870> learn<00:00:37.019> it<00:00:37.080> on<00:00:37.199> a<00:00:37.260> flat<00:00:37.590> wall<00:00:37.860> it'll<00:00:38.399> be

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
if you learn it on a flat wall it'll be

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.280 
if you learn it on a flat wall it'll be
a<00:00:38.610> lot<00:00:38.880> harder<00:00:39.239> as<00:00:39.480> well<00:00:39.720> and<00:00:39.930> you'll<00:00:40.079> need<00:00:40.260> a

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
a lot harder as well and you'll need a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.620 
a lot harder as well and you'll need a
lot<00:00:40.559> better<00:00:40.829> technique<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.850> it's<00:00:42.030> nice<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.450> let

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 
lot better technique so it's nice to let

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.080 
lot better technique so it's nice to let
learn<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.649> slight<00:00:44.040> angle<00:00:44.219> wall<00:00:44.670> just<00:00:44.940> as

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
learn on a slight angle wall just as

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.840 
learn on a slight angle wall just as
this<00:00:45.680> you<00:00:46.680> want<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.950> make<00:00:47.070> sure<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.340> plant<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
this you want to make sure you plant the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.549 
this you want to make sure you plant the
right<00:00:48.059> foot<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.079> way<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.410> you're

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
right foot for the way that you're

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.709 
right foot for the way that you're
spinning<00:00:49.850> so<00:00:50.850> before<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.270> try<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.540> trick

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
spinning so before you try this trick

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.690 
spinning so before you try this trick
you<00:00:52.170> should<00:00:52.350> already<00:00:52.590> know<00:00:52.920> which<00:00:53.250> way<00:00:53.520> you're

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
you should already know which way you're

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.030 
you should already know which way you're
going<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.940> be<00:00:54.090> twisting<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.320> I'm<00:00:55.559> twisting

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
going to be twisting so I'm twisting

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.060 
going to be twisting so I'm twisting
left<00:00:56.399> which<00:00:57.149> means<00:00:57.180> I'm<00:00:57.690> gonna<00:00:57.870> put<00:00:58.200> my<00:00:58.739> left

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
left which means I'm gonna put my left

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.150 
left which means I'm gonna put my left
foot<00:00:59.360> the<00:01:00.360> reason<00:01:00.690> for<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.289> I'm<00:01:01.739> gonna

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
foot the reason for this is I'm gonna

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.270 
foot the reason for this is I'm gonna
put<00:01:02.370> my<00:01:02.489> left<00:01:02.789> foot<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.239> drive<00:01:03.899> my<00:01:04.259> right<00:01:04.680> leg

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
put my left foot and drive my right leg

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.889 
put my left foot and drive my right leg
around<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.210> help<00:01:06.420> me<00:01:06.509> twist<00:01:07.340> some<00:01:08.340> people

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
around to help me twist some people

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.650 
around to help me twist some people
drive<00:01:09.899> their<00:01:09.959> opposite<00:01:10.800> leg<00:01:11.069> and<00:01:11.450> twist<00:01:12.450> this

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
drive their opposite leg and twist this

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.710 
drive their opposite leg and twist this
way<00:01:12.959> I<00:01:13.289> find<00:01:14.160> this<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.340> lot<00:01:14.610> more<00:01:14.819> technical<00:01:15.270> and

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
way I find this a lot more technical and

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.570 
way I find this a lot more technical and
a<00:01:15.780> lot<00:01:15.959> harder<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.410> this<00:01:16.830> would<00:01:17.100> be<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.340> best

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
a lot harder so this would be the best

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.389 
a lot harder so this would be the best
way<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.789> learn<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.240> trick<00:01:19.100> when<00:01:20.100> you're<00:01:20.220> ready

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
way to learn the trick when you're ready

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:22.400 
way to learn the trick when you're ready
for<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.700> wall<00:01:20.880> pool<00:01:21.149> what<00:01:21.569> you<00:01:21.660> want<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.929> do<00:01:22.080> is

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
for the wall pool what you want to do is

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.190 
for the wall pool what you want to do is
very<00:01:23.250> similar<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.849> the<00:01:23.970> wall<00:01:24.179> flip<00:01:24.479> it's<00:01:25.020> gonna

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
very similar to the wall flip it's gonna

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.279 
very similar to the wall flip it's gonna
start<00:01:25.560> off<00:01:25.740> pretty<00:01:26.520> much<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.910> exact<00:01:27.179> same<00:01:27.289> so

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 
start off pretty much the exact same so

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:30.529 
start off pretty much the exact same so
you<00:01:28.380> jog<00:01:28.649> towards<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.220> wall<00:01:29.429> and<00:01:29.759> have<00:01:30.300> one

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
you jog towards the wall and have one

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.589 
you jog towards the wall and have one
foot<00:01:30.869> maybe<00:01:31.170> 2<00:01:31.500> or<00:01:31.530> 3<00:01:31.950> feet<00:01:32.130> away<00:01:32.429> from<00:01:33.360> the

00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:33.599 
foot maybe 2 or 3 feet away from the

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:37.249 
foot maybe 2 or 3 feet away from the
wall<00:01:34.039> put<00:01:35.039> your<00:01:35.069> foot<00:01:35.819> about<00:01:36.300> waist<00:01:36.810> height

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
wall put your foot about waist height

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.460 
wall put your foot about waist height
and<00:01:37.590> then<00:01:38.130> drive<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.729> other<00:01:38.849> one<00:01:39.119> hump<00:01:39.470> this

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
and then drive the other one hump this

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.999 
and then drive the other one hump this
is<00:01:40.890> where<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.310> gets<00:01:41.459> different<00:01:42.920> instead<00:01:43.920> of

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
is where it gets different instead of

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.029 
is where it gets different instead of
driving<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.520> up<00:01:44.990> once<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.170> your<00:01:46.590> front<00:01:46.860> loose

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
driving it up once you your front loose

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.979 
driving it up once you your front loose
to<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.340> wall<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:48.000> one<00:01:48.179> that's<00:01:48.420> kicking<00:01:48.840> off

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:48.989 
to the wall the one that's kicking off

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:51.350 
to the wall the one that's kicking off
of<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.349> your<00:01:49.920> other<00:01:50.190> leg<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.880> going<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.149> come

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
of it your other leg is going to come

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.990 
of it your other leg is going to come
around<00:01:51.569> to<00:01:52.229> help<00:01:52.440> you<00:01:52.530> spin<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.670> instead<00:01:53.940> of

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
around to help you spin so instead of

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.510 
around to help you spin so instead of
driving<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.539> straight<00:01:54.720> over<00:01:55.160> to<00:01:56.160> help<00:01:56.369> you

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
driving it straight over to help you

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.350 
driving it straight over to help you
flip<00:01:56.849> it's<00:01:57.599> gonna<00:01:57.840> be<00:01:58.200> over<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.429> around<00:01:59.789> to

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
flip it's gonna be over and around to

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
like the wall flip you're gonna reach up

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.410 
like the wall flip you're gonna reach up
to<00:02:08.340> get

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
to get

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.559 
to get
but<00:02:09.929> then<00:02:10.140> once<00:02:10.950> you're<00:02:11.670> good<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.390> have

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
but then once you're good and you have

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.759 
but then once you're good and you have
your<00:02:12.720> height<00:02:12.930> you're<00:02:13.170> going<00:02:13.319> to<00:02:13.379> bring<00:02:13.590> them

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
your height you're going to bring them

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.819 
your height you're going to bring them
in<00:02:13.980> real<00:02:14.790> nice<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.239> tight<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:16.319> tighter<00:02:16.650> you

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
in real nice and tight the tighter you

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:18.559 
in real nice and tight the tighter you
pull<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.220> they<00:02:17.400> are<00:02:17.519> to<00:02:17.730> your<00:02:17.849> body<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.390> faster

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
pull so they are to your body the faster

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.080 
pull so they are to your body the faster
you're<00:02:18.900> gonna<00:02:19.019> spin<00:02:19.379> so<00:02:20.280> as<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.610> get<00:02:20.909> that

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
you're gonna spin so as you get that

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.920 
you're gonna spin so as you get that
proper<00:02:21.599> kick<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.200> leg<00:02:22.310> around<00:02:23.310> and

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
proper kick of the leg around and

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.270 
proper kick of the leg around and
bringing<00:02:24.930> your<00:02:25.170> arms<00:02:25.500> up<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.730> in<00:02:27.420> like<00:02:27.900> this

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
bringing your arms up and in like this

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.770 
bringing your arms up and in like this
then<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.459> should<00:02:29.489> be<00:02:29.849> able<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.090> get<00:02:30.299> the<00:02:30.569> full

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
then you should be able to get the full

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.770 
then you should be able to get the full
twist<00:02:31.909> during<00:02:32.909> the<00:02:33.000> flip<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:33.360> want<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.599> find

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
twist during the flip you want to find

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.809 
twist during the flip you want to find
out<00:02:33.900> good<00:02:34.290> balance<00:02:34.769> between<00:02:34.859> being<00:02:35.370> tucked

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
out good balance between being tucked

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.599 
out good balance between being tucked
and<00:02:36.090> open<00:02:36.659> the<00:02:37.230> more<00:02:37.440> open<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:37.950> are<00:02:38.099> the

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
and open the more open you are the

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.220 
and open the more open you are the
faster<00:02:39.090> you're<00:02:39.239> going<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.480> be<00:02:39.599> able<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.989> spin

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
faster you're going to be able to spin

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.410 
faster you're going to be able to spin
but<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.129> more<00:02:41.310> tucked<00:02:41.579> you<00:02:41.730> are<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:42.030> faster

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
but the more tucked you are the faster

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.539 
but the more tucked you are the faster
you're<00:02:42.569> going<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.780> be<00:02:42.870> able<00:02:42.959> to<00:02:43.379> flip<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:44.489> you

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
you're going to be able to flip so you

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.789 
you're going to be able to flip so you
want<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:44.849> find<00:02:45.030> your<00:02:45.120> good<00:02:45.359> balance<00:02:45.840> if<00:02:46.590> you're

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
want to find your good balance if you're

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.830 
want to find your good balance if you're
lacking<00:02:47.099> flip<00:02:47.639> then<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.329> probably<00:02:48.629> means

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
lacking flip then that probably means

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.720 
lacking flip then that probably means
you're<00:02:49.200> too<00:02:49.409> straight<00:02:49.829> if<00:02:50.370> you're<00:02:50.519> lacking

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
you're too straight if you're lacking

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.690 
you're too straight if you're lacking
spin<00:02:51.590> then<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.829> probably<00:02:53.129> means<00:02:53.370> that

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
spin then that probably means that

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.729 
spin then that probably means that
you're<00:02:53.849> too<00:02:54.060> tucked<00:02:54.389> so<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.290> want<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.530> find<00:02:55.650> a

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
you're too tucked so you want to find a

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.190 
you're too tucked so you want to find a
good<00:02:55.920> balance<00:02:56.129> which<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.000> usually<00:02:57.870> around

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
good balance which is usually around

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.039 
good balance which is usually around
this<00:02:58.530> area<00:02:58.970> you<00:02:59.970> want<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.150> be<00:03:00.209> slightly<00:03:00.780> tucked

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
this area you want to be slightly tucked

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.979 
this area you want to be slightly tucked
and<00:03:01.290> slightly<00:03:02.389> straight<00:03:03.389> right<00:03:03.780> in<00:03:03.900> the

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
and slightly straight right in the

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.780 
and slightly straight right in the
middle<00:03:04.200> so<00:03:04.349> that<00:03:04.680> you're<00:03:04.859> able<00:03:04.889> to<00:03:05.190> get<00:03:05.459> the

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
middle so that you're able to get the

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.729 
middle so that you're able to get the
perfect<00:03:06.060> amount<00:03:06.389> of<00:03:06.510> flip<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.470> perfect

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
perfect amount of flip and the perfect

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.149 
perfect amount of flip and the perfect
amount<00:03:08.040> of<00:03:08.250> spin<00:03:08.519> if<00:03:09.170> you're<00:03:10.170> looking<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.859> spin

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
amount of spin if you're looking to spin

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.430 
amount of spin if you're looking to spin
even<00:03:11.370> more<00:03:11.730> than<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.060> full<00:03:12.359> twist<00:03:12.690> then<00:03:13.290> you're

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
even more than a full twist then you're

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.809 
even more than a full twist then you're
gonna<00:03:13.739> want<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.069> be<00:03:14.220> as<00:03:14.370> straight<00:03:14.609> as<00:03:14.730> possible

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
gonna want to be as straight as possible

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.839 
gonna want to be as straight as possible
if<00:03:15.660> you<00:03:15.750> want<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:16.079> do<00:03:16.199> a<00:03:16.230> wall<00:03:16.980> double<00:03:17.579> full

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
if you want to do a wall double full

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.210 
if you want to do a wall double full
then<00:03:18.750> your<00:03:18.959> body<00:03:19.199> is<00:03:19.319> going<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.530> be<00:03:19.590> completely

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
then your body is going to be completely

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.830 
then your body is going to be completely
straight<00:03:20.549> and<00:03:20.819> you're<00:03:20.910> going<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.150> try<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:21.569> get

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
straight and you're going to try and get

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.170 
straight and you're going to try and get
as<00:03:21.989> much<00:03:22.260> height<00:03:22.620> as<00:03:22.859> possible<00:03:23.489> off<00:03:23.669> the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
as much height as possible off the

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.619 
as much height as possible off the
initial<00:03:24.389> launch<00:03:25.370> so<00:03:26.370> then<00:03:26.579> at<00:03:26.849> this<00:03:27.269> point

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
initial launch so then at this point

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.839 
initial launch so then at this point
it's<00:03:28.049> very<00:03:28.199> similar<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.099> back<00:03:29.280> full<00:03:29.579> which

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
it's very similar to the back full which

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.939 
it's very similar to the back full which
you<00:03:30.090> should<00:03:30.299> already<00:03:30.629> have<00:03:30.750> down<00:03:31.500> before<00:03:31.859> you

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:31.949 
you should already have down before you

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:33.710 
you should already have down before you
try<00:03:32.190> this<00:03:32.220> so<00:03:33.090> you're<00:03:33.239> just<00:03:33.359> going<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.599> be

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
try this so you're just going to be

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.949 
try this so you're just going to be
doing<00:03:33.930> a<00:03:34.139> full<00:03:34.349> twist<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:35.400> then<00:03:35.609> land<00:03:36.269> by

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
doing a full twist and then land by

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.009 
doing a full twist and then land by
spotting<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.620> ground<00:03:38.000> and<00:03:39.000> learning<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.660> arc

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
spotting the ground and learning the arc

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.250 
spotting the ground and learning the arc
full<00:03:40.459> so<00:03:41.459> I'm<00:03:41.910> gonna<00:03:42.090> show<00:03:42.329> you<00:03:42.419> guys<00:03:42.480> if<00:03:43.049> you
