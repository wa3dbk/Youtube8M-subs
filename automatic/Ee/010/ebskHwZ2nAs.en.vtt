00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.389
 the count friends of youtube here where the 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.490
 98 is bringing you this new video as 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.910
 they will realize the version has already come out 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.460
 also with 0.11 zero point wind 1 that 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.539
 she must have seen the video that 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.250
 suit about the discharge then I've 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.460
 realized that many get a 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.239
 kind of screens or black or they will see ya 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.239
 I got into minecraft 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.890
 and as you can see, that's how it stays and not 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.600
 advances nothing and the black screen remains 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.480
 Well in this video I have the solution 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.039
 to solve this problem 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.550
 we just have to get out of the 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.550
 Minecraft 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.340
 Now I'm leaving, we're going to 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.680
 our file manager here 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.680
 we have to find nobody the folder game 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.730

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:19.910

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.910
 we have to avoid that the language is 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.140
 is the 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:30.170
 and a low point and s 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.920
 that has to be in capital letters then 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.439
 we give in saving 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.520
 Once this is already going to open 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.270

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.469

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.469
 we see the teacher 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.560
 and we wait for it to open 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.170

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.950
