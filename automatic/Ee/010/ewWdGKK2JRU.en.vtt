00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:15.719
 that year rose cream turned 78 years was 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.770
 a very old woman but not as much as 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.990
 for not being able to take care of her husband alone 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.900
 he died two years ago and from time to time 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.620
 when her son visited her with her 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.260
 grandchildren was a widow who lived alone but 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:35.960
 he was happy his life had always been 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.960
 quiet until that night 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.440
 It was 2 in the morning on Wednesday 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:51.519
 rose woke up without any reason can 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.010
 that by pure chance or luckily that 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:57.219
 he saved his life he got up with the 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.949
 difficulty of his age and approached 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:02.430
 to the window without turning on the lights 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.800
 Sometimes he liked to look at the stars 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.890
 she told her grandchildren that this 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.590
 it caused tranquility but the fright that 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.620
 he took away he could have finished with his 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.980
 fragile heart 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:20.460
 I had heard a noise coming from the house 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:24.310
 from his neighbor next door that noise was not 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.460
 something other than a scream 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.399
 due to the scare rose took in 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.909
 calm down but he did not stop looking 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:36.880
 the window the lights of the house of his 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.420
 neighbor were lit unlike 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.420
 of the others 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.740
 Rose did not waste time and called the 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.160
 police perhaps out of curiosity did not stop 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.220
 look out the window she started 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.940
 Think about the causes of why your neighbor 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.750
 had screamed that way you can 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.450
 someone would come in to steal his house and she 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.060
 I would have discovered it after 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.280
 imagine that situation he thought about the worst 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:13.819
 I may already be dead 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.240
 there was another thing in which rose was fixed and 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.850
 is that the other houses in the neighborhood 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.160
 they were still off 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.730
 and I could not be the only one there 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.450
 heard the scream started to be very 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:32.230
 worried but something stripped her of her 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.980
 thoughts when hearing a sound to read or 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.980
 the blood 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.730
 ah 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:46.450
 someone was forcing the door to 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.610
 entering roush's house it was clear that 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.700
 it was not the police because they would call 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.030
 first and I would have seen the cars 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.330
 patrol through the window including the 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.600
 sirens sound 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:05.460
 if ever rose had taken all the 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:09.480
 possible energy of a woman her age 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:12.569
 this was the only one in his entire life 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.360
 He opened the closet and went in 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.560
 sheets and clothing above 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.069
 hide as best as possible 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:25.030
 rose could hear as the door of the 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.030
 entrance opened 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.400
 i 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.760
 or 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.030
 and someone was approaching his 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.890
 room should be noted that the 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.650
 He is approaching sound kooky 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.819
 like someone who had a cane 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:49.840
 that hit the tip with the ground like 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:53.530
 if it were your only point of support 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:57.770
 rose trying to make the minimum noise and 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:02.180
 without moving he began to pray silently 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:05.630
 he thought of his children in his grandchildren and 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:10.140
 even in her deceased husband which 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:12.690
 It seemed to feel closer 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.760
 but she knew that it was not her husband to 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.900
 who felt 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.900
 it was death 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.750
 the sound of police sirens 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.930
 They relieved her anxiety but she did not leave 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.750
 from his hiding place until the police 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.390
 he entered his house 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.330
 when he came out of hiding he was 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:40.920
 covered in sweat and trembling 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:44.380
 fear the police tried to calm the 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.840
 Rous was surprised to see that not only 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:50.770
 there was a police patrol there were 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:54.220
 arrived six it turned out that his neighbor 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:57.520
 I was dead but the most horrible thing is 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.720
 that was not the only one almost all of the 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.960
 neighborhood they had died 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:07.290
 the police found them dead in their 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.950
 beds began to look for evidence in 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:14.280
 each and every one of the houses one by 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:17.190
 a forensics and detectives are 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.610
 they were perplexed to see that there was no 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:23.599
 signs of violence 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:26.300
 there was no blood and there were no fingerprints 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:29.210
 in any of the locks of the 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:35.169
 doors that were clear that they had 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:35.169
 forced in some unknown way 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:43.289
 it was unthinkable to believe that everyone had 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.449
 died from a heart attack 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:47.280
 so it was thought that they had been 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:51.810
 poisoned 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:54.780
 but unfortunately later in the 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:57.389
 morgue discovered that none had 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:01.470
 any poison poisoning 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:03.630
 so the victims could be discovered 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.960
 they died while they slept 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:10.620
 - the neighbor who rose heard screaming that 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.690
 she was awake when she died she never 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:16.080
 he knew exactly what happened in that 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:19.030
 neighborhood in total 30 families died 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:21.160
 from that neighborhood 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.940
 but there is a fact to add that the 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:27.910
 police have not wanted to use as evidence 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:31.870
 I said before that almost all of them had died 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:36.460
 the neighbors the only survivors of 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:39.580
 this event was rose and a child of 5 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:42.550
 years whose name has remained 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.990
 censored for the simple fact of being 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.900
 less 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:50.530
 they found it hidden as well as 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:54.220
 rose but the boy had the misfortune of 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:57.580
 see from his hiding place like his parents 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:07:00.850
 died the child was in a state of 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:03.850
 very serious depression what he saw what 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:06.790
 disturbed a lot and received a lot of help 

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:09.940
 by family members and a psychologist 

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:12.930
 of the police who was the one who would contribute 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:15.490
 that strange test to the detectives 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:17.620
 It turns out that the psychologist gave him some 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:20.800
 crayons the child to be 

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:23.730
 distracted drawing had happened three 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:27.390
 months after that event and the child 

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:27.390
 I was improving 

00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:32.990
 but the first thing I draw 

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:35.890
 it was something of a terrible 

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.890
 nightmare 

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:44.540
 the psychologist asked him 

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:48.350
 who is that 

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:50.420
 and the child with much sadness you 

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:55.900
 answered 

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:55.900
 he killed my mom and my dad
