00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
Legends instead because it's much more

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.880 
Legends instead because it's much more
competitive<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:18.030> my<00:01:18.780> opinion<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.680> feel

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
competitive in my opinion and I feel

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.590 
competitive in my opinion and I feel
like<00:01:19.920> it's<00:01:20.250> got<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> future<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.330> they<00:01:21.420> don't

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
like it's got a future and they don't

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.859 
like it's got a future and they don't
give<00:01:21.780> milk<00:01:22.049> money<00:01:22.380> out<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.740> then<00:01:23.689> north<00:01:24.689> of

give milk money out of it then north of

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.170 
give milk money out of it then north of
those<00:01:25.020> because<00:01:25.229> now<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.380> feel<00:01:25.650> like<00:01:26.180> Naruto

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180

that<00:01:57.509> but<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.170> reality<00:01:58.290> we<00:01:58.799> like<00:01:59.340> they

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
that but in the reality we like they

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.450 
that but in the reality we like they
balance<00:02:00.689> one<00:02:00.930> thing<00:02:01.259> but<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.710> exchange<00:02:01.829> they

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
balance one thing but in exchange they

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.550 
balance one thing but in exchange they
break<00:02:03.180> two<00:02:03.420> other<00:02:03.600> things<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.229> that's<00:02:04.380> how

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
break two other things and that's how

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.340 
break two other things and that's how
cct<00:02:05.009> works<00:02:05.250> for<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.549> logic

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
cct works for the logic

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.830 
cct works for the logic
