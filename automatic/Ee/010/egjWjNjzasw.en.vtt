00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.739
 And there goes beauty arid commandment and it's on this trip today with this talking 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:25.059
 of an error that happens only for those who use windows vista 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.419
 similarly, prize 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.319
 Just talk about your folks here. 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:32.560
 yours here 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.550
 missed 0 4 half-innings 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.900
 I already had problem with this one with this error it results that in the famous blue screen of the 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.250
 death 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.640
 What I did, I did some tests, it worked for me. 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.080
 understood I stayed a month this year and I had no problem with this error 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.200
 does not mean that you do in that 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.080
 this procedure will work for you too 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.300
 at least here in a month the case worked 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.300
 let it clear what the guys are going to do then 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.800
 First thing to see Let's see what started 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.930
 and search here and you can check pms with the order 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.150
 just click here stockings with the made 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.530
 let's wait brief 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.980
 opened the window 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.980
 Do you continue one of yours? 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.050
 what are we going to do now but let's go well here 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.240
 system boot and that once here or afterwards advanced pensions 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.630
 no ctg here or a few memory processors March does not take and memory more 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.070
 when my this mark of the 2 museum will be without the support of you not 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.520
 kill everything that market that we are going to do now 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.420
 let's mark these two options 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.080
 medium-heavy and maximum memory 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.280
 and not here 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.400
 so you will see that you had applied it 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.030
 so ok 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.299
 in my case I have already done so you will stay here restart 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.299
 how I did 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.739
 so I'm going to start rebooting 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.230
 but the guys are talking to you that here in my case worked 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:19.669
 I do not know if it will work for you. 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:21.679
 if it works 

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:24.679
 I beg you to comment 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:29.899
