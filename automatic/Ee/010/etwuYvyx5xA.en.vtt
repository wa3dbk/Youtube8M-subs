00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.660 

find<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.660> big<00:02:50.380> london<00:02:50.800> buses<00:02:51.070> probably

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
find that the big london buses probably

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.220 
find that the big london buses probably
work<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:51.940> best<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:53.940> for<00:02:54.940> this<00:02:55.150> so<00:02:55.930> basically

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
work the best to for this so basically

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.380 
work the best to for this so basically
you<00:02:56.410> can<00:02:56.530> also<00:02:56.680> knock<00:02:57.100> in<00:02:57.310> a<00:02:57.340> lamp<00:02:57.580> posts<00:02:58.180> that

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
you can also knock in a lamp posts that

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.270 
you can also knock in a lamp posts that
kind<00:02:58.630> of<00:02:58.660> stuff<00:02:58.900> you<00:02:59.350> can<00:02:59.380> blast<00:02:59.710> them<00:02:59.920> as<00:03:00.070> well

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
kind of stuff you can blast them as well

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.200 
kind of stuff you can blast them as well
but<00:03:01.320> who<00:03:02.320> wants<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:02.770> go<00:03:02.920> by<00:03:03.040> hand<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:03.580> age<00:03:03.790> one

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
you're going to get a gold brick so

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.900 
you're going to get a gold brick so
there<00:03:26.440> are<00:03:26.500> 50<00:03:26.710> bricks<00:03:27.100> and<00:03:27.430> you<00:03:27.490> only<00:03:27.610> have<00:03:27.670> to

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
there are 50 bricks and you only have to

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.480 
there are 50 bricks and you only have to
collect<00:03:28.120> under<00:03:28.480> 50<00:03:29.410> but<00:03:29.920> then<00:03:30.130> there's<00:03:30.430> also

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
collect under 50 but then there's also

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.240 
collect under 50 but then there's also
the<00:03:30.850> additional<00:03:31.330> 24<00:03:31.750> told<00:03:31.960> Brooks<00:03:32.170> so<00:03:32.830> you're

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
the additional 24 told Brooks so you're

the additional 24 told Brooks so you're
going<00:03:33.340> to<00:03:33.400> be<00:03:33.490> collecting<00:03:33.940> like<00:03:35.250> only<00:03:36.250> around

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
going to be collecting like only around

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.750 
going to be collecting like only around
100<00:03:37.210> old<00:03:37.420> books<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:39.010> most<00:03:39.250> of<00:03:39.370> that<00:03:39.430> they're

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
100 old books and most of that they're

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.220 
100 old books and most of that they're
pretty<00:03:39.910> easy<00:03:40.030> you<00:03:40.450> can<00:03:40.540> just<00:03:40.750> find<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:41.080> linear

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
pretty easy you can just find the linear

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.540 
pretty easy you can just find the linear
and<00:03:41.440> hogwarts<00:03:43.680> so<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:44.740> get<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.130> gold<00:03:45.310> bricks

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
and hogwarts so to get the gold bricks

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.830 
and hogwarts so to get the gold bricks
I'd<00:03:45.760> suggest<00:03:46.240> you<00:03:46.480> try<00:03:47.220> poking<00:03:48.220> around<00:03:48.520> in<00:03:49.180> the

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
I'd suggest you try poking around in the

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.930 
I'd suggest you try poking around in the
teachers<00:03:50.530> classrooms<00:03:51.130> i<00:03:51.310> usually<00:03:51.640> have<00:03:51.790> only

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
teachers classrooms i usually have only

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.780 
teachers classrooms i usually have only
secret<00:03:52.360> chambers<00:03:52.870> like<00:03:53.530> snake<00:03:53.980> click<00:03:54.370> quick<00:03:54.580> i

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
secret chambers like snake click quick i

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.490 
secret chambers like snake click quick i
think<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:55.390> only<00:03:55.540> one<00:03:55.780> that<00:03:55.930> i'm<00:03:56.020> aware<00:03:56.320> that

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
think the only one that i'm aware that

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.380 
think the only one that i'm aware that
doesn't<00:03:56.830> have<00:03:56.920> secret<00:03:57.220> chamber<00:03:57.520> is<00:03:57.700> probably

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
doesn't have secret chamber is probably

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.850 
doesn't have secret chamber is probably
McConnell<00:03:58.840> also<00:03:59.380> you<00:03:59.920> should<00:04:00.100> be<00:04:00.400> where<00:04:00.640> I

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
McConnell also you should be where I

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.220 
McConnell also you should be where I
think<00:04:02.860> it<00:04:02.920> was<00:04:03.070> moody's<00:04:03.580> classroom<00:04:04.230> where

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
think it was moody's classroom where

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.250 
think it was moody's classroom where
during<00:04:06.220> Lockhart's<00:04:06.940> rain<00:04:07.239> when<00:04:07.989> he<00:04:08.110> was

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
during Lockhart's rain when he was

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.160 
during Lockhart's rain when he was
teaching<00:04:08.410> you<00:04:08.739> there<00:04:09.340> was<00:04:09.580> something<00:04:10.480> like<00:04:10.690> a

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.630 

cage<00:04:14.170> that<00:04:14.650> required<00:04:15.340> dark<00:04:16.030> arts<00:04:16.630> open<00:04:17.640> well

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
cage that required dark arts open well

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.130 
cage that required dark arts open well
if<00:04:18.820> you've<00:04:18.970> already<00:04:19.150> opened<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:19.810> cage<00:04:19.989> and

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
if you've already opened the cage and

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.530 
if you've already opened the cage and
you<00:04:20.290> can<00:04:20.410> go<00:04:20.560> inside<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.940> cage<00:04:22.210> or<00:04:22.450> the

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
you can go inside the cage or the

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.820 
you can go inside the cage or the
chamber<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:24.000> there<00:04:25.000> you're<00:04:25.390> going<00:04:25.540> to<00:04:25.600> be

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
chamber and there you're going to be

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.380 
chamber and there you're going to be
finding<00:04:26.830> yourself<00:04:27.160> in<00:04:27.250> a<00:04:27.370> pixel<00:04:27.820> and<00:04:28.000> we<00:04:28.210> have

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
finding yourself in a pixel and we have

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.510 
finding yourself in a pixel and we have
to<00:04:28.480> use<00:04:28.630> a<00:04:28.660> mobile<00:04:29.020> us<00:04:29.260> maybe<00:04:30.040> i'll<00:04:30.220> show<00:04:30.460> you

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
to use a mobile us maybe i'll show you

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.570 
to use a mobile us maybe i'll show you
next<00:04:30.880> video<00:04:31.120> but<00:04:31.900> anyway<00:04:32.230> just<00:04:32.770> remember<00:04:33.280> keep

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
next video but anyway just remember keep

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.810 
next video but anyway just remember keep
moving<00:04:33.640> and

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
moving and

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.500 
moving and
moving<00:04:35.240> and<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:36.320> moment<00:04:36.620> is<00:04:36.820> also<00:04:37.820> a<00:04:38.060> brick

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
moving and the moment is also a brick

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:39.730 
moving and the moment is also a brick
and<00:04:38.630> library<00:04:39.110> for<00:04:39.290> collecting<00:04:39.620> books

best and hopefully you'll be able to see

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.300 
best and hopefully you'll be able to see
this<00:04:46.820> level<00:04:47.180> on<00:04:47.390> your<00:04:47.570> own<00:04:47.750> as<00:04:47.930> well<00:04:47.960> in<00:04:48.410> a<00:04:49.250> few

this level on your own as well in a few
months
