00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
tomato plant will probably be but I

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.290

now this isn't easy because the tomato
plant<00:01:40.829> has<00:01:40.979> really<00:01:41.369> grown<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:41.939> all<00:01:42.180> sorts<00:01:42.570> of

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
plant has really grown in all sorts of

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.260 
plant has really grown in all sorts of
crazy<00:01:43.229> ways<00:01:43.829> reaching<00:01:44.490> for<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> light<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
crazy ways reaching for the light in the

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.789 
crazy ways reaching for the light in the
house<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.810> then<00:01:46.170> reaching<00:01:46.530> for<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.770> light

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
house and then reaching for the light

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.660 
house and then reaching for the light
out<00:01:47.159> here<00:01:48.590> but<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:49.950> see<00:01:51.680> how<00:01:52.680> many<00:01:53.250> roots

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
out here but you can see how many roots

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.149 
out here but you can see how many roots
are<00:01:54.060> on<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.659> tomato<00:01:54.990> plant<00:01:55.290> if<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.979> buy<00:01:56.130> a

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
are on that tomato plant if you buy a

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.469 
are on that tomato plant if you buy a
tomato<00:01:56.490> plant<00:01:56.640> from<00:01:56.880> your<00:01:57.030> local<00:01:57.329> garden

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
tomato plant from your local garden

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.270 
tomato plant from your local garden
center<00:01:57.899> very<00:01:58.170> often<00:01:58.530> when<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.740> pop<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:58.979> out<00:01:59.159> of

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
center very often when you pop it out of

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.980 
center very often when you pop it out of
the<00:01:59.340> container<00:01:59.640> it<00:02:00.149> may<00:02:00.360> even<00:02:00.509> be<00:02:00.600> smaller

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
the container it may even be smaller

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.719 
the container it may even be smaller
than<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.439> it's<00:02:01.799> going<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.100> have<00:02:02.219> all<00:02:02.490> these

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
than this it's going to have all these

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.319 
than this it's going to have all these
roots<00:02:02.969> looking<00:02:03.420> like<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:04.640> okay<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.060> when<00:02:06.240> you

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
roots looking like that okay so when you

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.999 
roots looking like that okay so when you
see<00:02:06.630> all<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:07.020> roots<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.500> goes<00:02:07.740> for<00:02:07.979> a

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
see all the roots and this goes for a

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.669 
see all the roots and this goes for a
tomato<00:02:08.310> plan<00:02:08.610> or<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:08.910> rhododendron<00:02:09.539> or<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.259> tree

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
tomato plan or a rhododendron or a tree

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.960 
tomato plan or a rhododendron or a tree
you<00:02:11.280> really<00:02:11.610> want<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:11.970> break<00:02:12.780> these<00:02:13.200> roots

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
you really want to break these roots

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.370 
you really want to break these roots
and<00:02:14.970> this<00:02:15.090> is<00:02:15.209> what<00:02:15.360> I<00:02:15.390> mean<00:02:15.540> by<00:02:15.660> plants<00:02:16.140> want

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
and this is what I mean by plants want

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.699 
and this is what I mean by plants want
to<00:02:16.590> live<00:02:16.800> now<00:02:17.340> if<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:18.000> put<00:02:18.270> this<00:02:18.420> in<00:02:18.660> there<00:02:18.870> it

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
to live now if I put this in there it

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.490 
to live now if I put this in there it
probably<00:02:20.489> would<00:02:20.640> be<00:02:20.670> okay<00:02:21.209> but<00:02:21.720> by<00:02:21.900> doing<00:02:22.349> this

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
probably would be okay but by doing this

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.190 
probably would be okay but by doing this
I'm<00:02:22.739> encouraging<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:24.120> roots<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.630> really

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
I'm encouraging the roots to really

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.280 
I'm encouraging the roots to really
develop<00:02:26.000> once<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.239> plant<00:02:27.510> is<00:02:27.690> in<00:02:27.900> its<00:02:28.110> new

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
develop once the plant is in its new

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.500 
develop once the plant is in its new
home<00:02:28.580> now<00:02:29.580> one<00:02:29.819> of<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:30.000> cool<00:02:30.180> things<00:02:30.420> about

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
home now one of the cool things about

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.990 
home now one of the cool things about
tomato<00:02:30.930> plants<00:02:31.290> unlike<00:02:31.800> a<00:02:31.830> tree<00:02:32.370> where<00:02:32.970> you

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
tomato plants unlike a tree where you

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.030 
tomato plants unlike a tree where you
need<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.510> see<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.840> flare<00:02:34.319> of<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.560> tree<00:02:34.890> when

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
need to see the flare of the tree when

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.890 
need to see the flare of the tree when
you<00:02:35.069> plant<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.730> tomato<00:02:36.390> plant<00:02:36.630> can<00:02:36.870> be

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
you plant it a tomato plant can be

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.350 
you plant it a tomato plant can be
planted<00:02:37.410> much<00:02:37.680> deeper<00:02:38.340> than<00:02:38.790> perhaps<00:02:39.060> you

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
planted much deeper than perhaps you

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.630 
planted much deeper than perhaps you
find<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.930> in<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.170> garden<00:02:40.500> center<00:02:40.709> so<00:02:41.190> very

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
find it in the garden center so very

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.120 
find it in the garden center so very
carefully<00:02:42.330> I'm<00:02:42.450> putting<00:02:42.870> this<00:02:42.989> in<00:02:43.230> the

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
carefully I'm putting this in the

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
container and I've bent the tomato stem

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.620

bent the stem here and we've got quite a
bit<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:55.709> this<00:02:55.799> plant<00:02:56.130> now<00:02:56.250> I'm<00:02:56.430> going<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.670> plant

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
bit of this plant now I'm going to plant

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.170 
bit of this plant now I'm going to plant
I'm<00:02:57.690> going<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:57.930> put<00:02:58.140> soil<00:02:58.410> right<00:02:58.769> over<00:02:59.100> that<00:02:59.180> so

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
I'm going to put soil right over that so

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.690 
I'm going to put soil right over that so
we'll<00:03:00.780> hold<00:03:01.049> this<00:03:01.290> plant<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:01.769> can<00:03:01.920> see<00:03:02.190> this

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
we'll hold this plant you can see this

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.390 
we'll hold this plant you can see this
plant<00:03:03.090> here<00:03:03.540> is<00:03:03.720> actually<00:03:04.230> because<00:03:05.100> it's<00:03:05.250> been

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
plant here is actually because it's been

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.420 
plant here is actually because it's been
hanging<00:03:05.940> is<00:03:06.510> actually<00:03:07.410> growing<00:03:07.650> upside<00:03:08.190> down

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
hanging is actually growing upside down

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.699 
hanging is actually growing upside down
so<00:03:09.150> now<00:03:09.360> I'm<00:03:09.569> going<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.750> put<00:03:09.989> in<00:03:10.140> some<00:03:10.410> of<00:03:10.470> my

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
so now I'm going to put in some of my

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.170 
so now I'm going to put in some of my
soil<00:03:11.040> now<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.459> am<00:03:11.730> using<00:03:12.030> an<00:03:12.390> organic<00:03:12.569> soil<00:03:13.410> and

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
soil now I am using an organic soil and

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.240 
soil now I am using an organic soil and
the<00:03:15.180> reason<00:03:15.540> why<00:03:15.690> I'm<00:03:16.019> using<00:03:16.230> organic<00:03:16.799> soil<00:03:17.040> in

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
the reason why I'm using organic soil in

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.210 
the reason why I'm using organic soil in
the<00:03:17.400> container<00:03:17.519> is<00:03:18.440> because<00:03:19.440> I'm<00:03:19.890> going<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.100> be

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
the container is because I'm going to be

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.560 
the container is because I'm going to be
eating<00:03:20.489> these<00:03:20.609> Tomatoes<00:03:21.060> hopefully<00:03:21.420> we'll

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
eating these Tomatoes hopefully we'll

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.630 
eating these Tomatoes hopefully we'll
get<00:03:21.660> some<00:03:21.870> Tomatoes<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.410> I<00:03:22.560> don't<00:03:23.100> like<00:03:23.459> to

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
get some Tomatoes and I don't like to

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.020 
get some Tomatoes and I don't like to
use<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:24.030> soils<00:03:24.510> that<00:03:24.720> have<00:03:25.530> food<00:03:26.519> in<00:03:26.820> them

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
use the soils that have food in them

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.199 
use the soils that have food in them
because<00:03:27.299> that's<00:03:27.420> a<00:03:27.600> synthetic<00:03:27.840> food<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:29.209> that

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
because that's a synthetic food and that

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.910 
because that's a synthetic food and that
synthetic<00:03:30.510> foods<00:03:31.049> going<00:03:31.260> to<00:03:31.320> get<00:03:31.470> into<00:03:31.739> my

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
synthetic foods going to get into my

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.759 
synthetic foods going to get into my
food<00:03:32.280> so<00:03:32.910> we've<00:03:33.750> got<00:03:33.930> an<00:03:34.019> organic<00:03:34.230> soil<00:03:34.620> and

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
food so we've got an organic soil and
