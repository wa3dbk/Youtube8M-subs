00:00:09.411 --> 00:00:12.209
The Lord of silver fountains,

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:17.119
The King of carven stone,

00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:22.681
The King beneath the mountain.

00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:27.634
Shall come into his own.

00:00:30.104 --> 00:00:32.257
And the bells shall ring in gladness

00:00:32.507 --> 00:00:34.259
At the Mountain-King's return.

00:00:35.336 --> 00:00:37.276
But all shall fail in sadness,

00:00:37.526 --> 00:00:39.973
and the lake will shine and burn.

00:00:42.978 --> 00:00:44.354
You have no right...

00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:47.773
No right to enter that mountain!

00:00:48.573 --> 00:00:50.173
I have the only right.

00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:56.406
What is this place?

00:00:57.388 --> 00:00:59.910
The desolation of Smaug.

00:01:02.388 --> 00:01:03.955
Destroy the dragon,

00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:06.333
take back your homeland.

00:01:08.064 --> 00:01:10.170
The Dwarf will never be king!

00:01:11.526 --> 00:01:13.882
Our time has come again.

00:01:16.954 --> 00:01:18.094
It is not our fight.

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.890
Are we not part of this world?

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:26.394
You seek that which would bestow
upon you the right to rule.

00:01:27.021 --> 00:01:28.480
The Arkenstone.

00:01:31.355 --> 00:01:32.455
What's that?

00:01:33.011 --> 00:01:33.849
That,

00:01:34.584 --> 00:01:35.762
Master Burglar,

00:01:37.062 --> 00:01:38.512
is why you're here.

00:01:47.645 --> 00:01:49.125
They are in grave danger.

00:01:52.128 --> 00:01:54.548
The world is in grave danger.

00:02:00.237 --> 00:02:01.429
I fear for you!

00:02:03.932 --> 00:02:05.350
If this is to end in fire,

00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:08.853
then we will all burn together.

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:16.945
You can't give up now!

00:02:20.454 --> 00:02:22.414
It never ceases to amaze me,

00:02:22.664 --> 00:02:24.398
the courage of Hobbits.

00:02:42.092 --> 00:02:44.723
I am King under the Mountain!
