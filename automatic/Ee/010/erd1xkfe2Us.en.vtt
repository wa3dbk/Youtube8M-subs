00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 hello conrad navarro once more by 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.230
 It's okay here. 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.270
 Today is the time for us to talk to one. 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.130
 about how we deal with the 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.719
 money in our daily lives and with the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.670
 decisions that we make that end 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.349
 making our money end 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.120
 at the end of the month I'm sure you 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.130
 has lived at some point some 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.480
 similar situation and of course with the 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.160
 Our help, you're changing this. 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.060
 Actually, I'm very happy and very grateful. 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.439
 so 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.900
 but we need to address these 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.400
 issues because people still struggled 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.140
 enough to keep your pocket up to date 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.300
 and especially in a way 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.369
 sustainable development so that they can 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.750
 realize your dreams your goals 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.270
 so today I'll tell you about 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.969
 Five tips for you guys to get there. 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.710
 at the end of the month with pocket money and 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.780
 more than that could invest 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.260
 The first suggestion today is that you 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.879
 avoid impulse purchases and then clear 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.500
 What are you going to tell me? 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.899
 I necessarily want to buy 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.180
 impulse I always go to the store thinking 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.160
 to plan on buying by necessity 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.449
 but eventually succumbed to the temptations of 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.000
 Discharges will not give two suggestions 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.620
 for you that will help you a lot 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.539
 avoid impulse buying 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.460
 The first of these is that you can 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.409
 put on your credit card a 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.720
 yellow warning with those labels 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.400
 stickers writing on this label 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.470
 What is the goal you want to accomplish? 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.689
 within this year in a few years 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.400
 You will paste this says that you had it in your 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.869
 credit card whenever you go 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.580
 buy something when you take the card 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.350
 you will read that one goal 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.670
 dream you have and there you will think 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.409
 Wow, I really need to 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.390
 buy this now or this will me 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.280
 a little of this dream that is 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.829
 written here so this is a cool tip 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.380
 that you can practice the second is never 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.060
 buy the first time you see the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.990
 the product or contact your local 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.530
 service 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.930
 Now try the test, come home if 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.790
 You can not sleep at night. 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.979
 an insomnia wake up desperate that you 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.479
 Did not buy so you wake up on the day it goes. 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.399
 there and buy with a clear conscience 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.490
 because we really need a lot of it will 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.079
 happen in 99% of the cases you go 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.520
 waking up is going to follow your life and that 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.469
 it was not a fundamental thing 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.200
 so this first item I of these two 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.880
 suggestions but is for you to avoid purchases 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.219
 by impulse remember them 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.829
 The second tip today is to pay attention 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.849
 the unknown expenses of your 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.459
 budget 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.860
 so it's critical that you understand 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.600
 Where your money is going 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.610
 How are you going to do this without a 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.040
 well done impossible impossible household budget 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.110
 so you need to record things 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.090
 that you spend or the things that you 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.370
 purchase and how you have spent your 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.110
 money in a very detailed way 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.940
 you have to classify these expenses 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.980
 for you to know what a gas is with 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.870
 chalet with a z1 shopping with 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.840
 Supermarket with superfluous things or 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.030
 do not forget to avoid that thing too much 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.570
 common to put in the worksheet categories 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.490
 different types or other things that 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.990
 You do not know what it is and when you go. 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.940
 make the sum at the end of the month you do not 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.920
 You will remember what you spent this 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.250
 money then the second tip is to 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.600
 attention to unknown expenses 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.430
 register very well what you have done 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.530
 with your money with the help of a 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.750
 worksheet application sheet for which 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.550
 you can control and measure 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.270
 really what have you been doing with your 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.550
 patrimony 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.400
 The third tip today is to avoid 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.340
 ostentation and of course no one holds 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.540
 for wanting or for wanting is doing evil 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.220
 for someone else to show 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.350
 necessarily superior to it but the 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.019
 people have seen a very 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.310
 advertising and services and 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.090
 products that make people 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.160
 often view or attitudes or 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.470
 is shown in front of people as a 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.360
 person that we really are not then 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.340
 we have lived our lives many times 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.290
 others and this means when the 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.850
 people talk about personal finances that 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.890
 people give a very large value to the 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.410
 status and a great example in the 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.480
 Brazil, the people we can use are the cars. 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.250
 which are positional goods often 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.320
 You have a simpler car than yours. 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.239
 colleague and you already feel 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.820
 unable to change cars to power 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.049
 appear equal to it within the environment 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.880
 Where do you work, and this is a great 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.830
 bullshit you're actually buying 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.269
 thing you do not need with the 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.549
 money you do not have to 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.500
 impress who you do not like it 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.410
 makes no sense then the third 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.930
 suggestion is that you take care 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.000
 status ostentation and make more purchases 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.890
 by necessity and supported by your 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.500
 financial budget than only for 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.209
 impress people the fourth tip of 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.030
 today are you watching what you 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.200
 really want is to have goals and goals is 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.750
 fundamental for its control 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.669
 make sense who does not have 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.530
 objectives and goals generally do not have a 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.450
 reason to save money or to 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.830
 save your money on a daily basis 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.660
 at the same time those who are already 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.760
 controlled when there are no 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.350
 have goals does not have a reason to 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.780
 invest your money better for 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.090
 save and increase your assets who 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.520
 those goals and those goals then 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.830
 The fourth tip today is for you to define 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.780
 best things you like you 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.460
 Do you want and where do you want to go? 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.770
 objectives are fundamental to 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.730
 guide their consumption decisions and to 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.440
 to help you 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.180
 investment choices then it is 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.310
 fundamental that you pay attention 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.680
 in this item so that you can get the 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.810
 from it to build one of the 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.660
 mainstream of financial education that is 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.030
 independence to freedom with the help of 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.680
 money and will only work if it has been 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.060
 the goal therefore this item is 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.919
 fundamental 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.540
 finally the fifth, the suggestion of today is 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:14.030
 that you have well-defined limits 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.040
 for spending within your budget 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.200
 of your financial reality we speak 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.810
 enough about the planning we talked about 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.790
 goals we talk about attitude and now the 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.860
 people talk only about tools and one of the 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.450
 tools is the domestic budget to 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.520
 your spreadsheet you will use the 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.350
 application you are going to use does not matter 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.810
 and within this reality you need 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.479
 have a budget with stipulated goals 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.880
 I'll give an example to stay inside 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:40.280
 month with expenditure of up to eg 500 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.880
 real power with maximum thousand 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.440
 real with a a maximum of 400 housing 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.780
 with transportation you will 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.039
 exercising by looking at your 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.390
 previous months 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:51.860
 what are the limits you can 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.050
 define so that your financial life 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.570
 be more organized then this fifth 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.400
 suggestion is crucial to connect all 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.110
 the others in this system that education 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.820
 financial lets you need to know 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.850
 Where the money is going but 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:07.490
 also stipulate amounts that you can 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:09.410
 spend within each month without harming 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.720
 the family's standard of living and ensure 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.400
 that you will invest with intelligence 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.260
 these were the tips of today I am 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.479
