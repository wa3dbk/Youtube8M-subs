00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 yes hello and would have come another 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.569
 follow let's play minecraft hunger games 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.820
 so minecraft games as it were 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.110
 player play less in any case 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.550
 we just got back the map with the same 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.590
 Persons I believe a two-thousand 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.940
 departure because they are based on time 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.050
 had no time left 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.369
 that it works now everything works and 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.960
 bad thank the boxes and the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.160
 countdown was on again I have the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.779
 all regulate so last time so too 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.510
 say be told three minutes 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.060
 the grace time that is we have the 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.720
 gun on and no one can not 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.520
 activate 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.200
 this data can land a lot 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.290
 no one can not do it 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.160
 say fight just at 9 6 5 4 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.940
 3 2 1 go faster and then we can 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.010
 right here 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.020
 I'll give you some too fast 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.059
 the focus will be on those who say that 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.079
 is probably on the too 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.840
 really have to be fast 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.969
 fast are everywhere are actually 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.539
 actually people who back there nate 2003 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.760
 on the legal nonsense 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:05.120
 So now start something easier 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.120
 just 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:20.020
 54 oh-so the wait dreizweieins going 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.020
 lobos 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.510
 Why 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.510
 year old 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.760
 bachelot 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.969
 so we have last time force 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.640
 already played now I know too 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:42.340
 directly where ne crate is I can directly 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.990
 either up there running to the box 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.679
 I would say now except others 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.420
 of course people are pretty stupid 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.939
 But I would try it gave it 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.740
 Nevertheless , maybe we have 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:58.149
 luck and talent no one forest 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.170
 the whole people are grading 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.170
 can this be 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:15.760
 no, then run 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.280
 good luck to you all yes yes I 'm going 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:28.660
 her good therefore, but will play anyway 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:30.400
 nail here vilbel no other transmitter too 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.090
 this box the last year already 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.070
 had seen 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.190
 he should be full now because now 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:39.450
 directly so now right from the beginning 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.450
 to run there because no one was before 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:48.390
 so what is in here 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.390
 yes you may well okay okay okay okay 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.750
 Rhein is a chart trader should now 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.489
 do not run 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.739
 we can run the race back there 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.750
 where we were last time it was brand new 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.220
 The gang well filled now in the 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.250
 last ddr circles under hunger games 3 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.020
 you do not stuff it so well you say 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.550
 the wunderkind every case sometime 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.140
 tykwers do not change so well I filled 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.560
 do not remember how the whole 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.340
 gameslab from daniel variations on each 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.110
 If this with these giant 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.330
 skyscrapers and those were the ones 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.489
 houses partly almost empty if you 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.560
 Somehow, but if it's difficult 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.700
 they found the power very much 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.110
 done better means a lot 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.110
 easier to cheaper 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.860
 I know the crafting table the 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.940
 means we can maybe three 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:39.430
 make wheat bread fast and we can 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:45.920
 Over here , the crane was definitely on 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:47.570
 It really does recognize someone here 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.110
 it was with me in Carinthia 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.670
 already open so was already in it 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.730
 Let me guess a box here 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.740
 yes that's clear 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:02.450
 then let's go this other big one 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:06.020
 house here that was all that was 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:11.720
 already those in there where we must swear 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:14.230
 here is still the pvp time out though 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.230
 I am afraid 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:23.470
 when running between therefore clip nothing 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.470
 but in it my house muslim 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.480
 and now this fast too 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.610
 already more damned 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.350
 Here all been that a box 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.990
 is already the natural open 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:41.410
 they empty 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:43.780
 yes she was guaranteed to learn 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:48.280
 People are waiting for something everywhere 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.300
 maybe at least the eighth 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.750
 sewer probably now too 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.750
 someone in there already 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.259
 Hello 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.220
 No 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.010
 they get it 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.320
 now pack for extreme 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:21.000
 neither does it exactly the same for us 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.000
 helpless we but we have 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.850
 com 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.389
 there comes 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.630

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:54.380

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:01.729
 Let's go 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:05.300
 no no no i have no sword of 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:11.840
 collected just fucking him 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:18.319
 damn it out of here so fast 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:21.229
 damn shit yes well then we have 

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:22.520
 that now also manages so this time 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:24.319
 died really early we have that 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.720
 last time was with place two so far 

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:28.610
 I have grad already coming 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.150
 now how much time has passed 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:34.430
 one two three four five six times 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.259
 died is not the problem 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.819
 we had planned pretty well 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:39.110
 have you seen so plan we have 

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:42.550
 it actually survived quite well and one 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.550
 computer damn 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.970
 ok so i finish now synonymous with it 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:57.500
 same and tell you then at the end yet 

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.599
 who is the winner or 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.539
 so that does not hesitate here so long from 

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:04.280
 because it probably is now anyway 

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:07.930
 it will take a while for bertram 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:10.789
 start arguing they have died and 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.050
 So then if you have the video 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:13.280
 I liked it again 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:16.389
 last time then maybe give me a 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.259
 rating would be very happy 

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:22.720
 we are hopefully in the next 

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:22.720
