00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:03.680
 now we hope sometime 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.440
 the mucus they say to nothing because effectively yokota was the fourth very well in 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.530
 weapons standards you see this one is complex and also a good ham de 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.080
 it also needs a good port cut 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.080
 sanahüja monde of acorn of good wine and we have cut them 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:22.980
 well we do not like ham as well as it is cut pp so that 

00:00:22.979 --> 00:00:26.300
 For sure we have put a small caravan and you have the table added a 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.560
 little bit but he's still an artist 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.560
 and until you're doing right now because now I'm shaping ham 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.559
 for consumption more or less what at home 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.080
 then for 100 more started this ham in the ela against mace because it is 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.040
 the driest part of ham is not pinto populated from the poplar 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.639
 to ham 

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:49.069
 here it's cooler because it's the part that worries her most, jamie has 

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:52.219
 fat between meats important for things like him 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.470
 in the jamonera comfortable in the table after the benfica that sent us many famous 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.480
 issf goes a little bit to the best you can cover the knife and tino fourth hand to 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.470
 hand 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.060
 so then 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.680
 by the way here because for example we are going to consume only for two people 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.729
 then we are going to cut this part of good haiti 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.689
 good tool has to be well sharpened knives a lace and a 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.329
 ham knife filmed orioko only with the clamp but if 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:18.690
 produces from gijón 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.310
 with your hand there will also be because you are a professional 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.600
 the average clamp is looking for us but for masonic hygiene more than anything else 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.790
 then do not touch it with your finger and 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.060
 take away my fellow mechanics 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.060
 so nothing the roots so far 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.400
 chemical sciences fight rows and transparent 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.550
 i little one 112 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.810
 I normally when I pick up the prim knife first I have to hook it and 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.130
 then left the knife that works 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.850
 or cold while throwing the same base knife just expensive for that is very 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.860
 important that is very sharp euros because I've been many years and you 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.740
 cutting ham chema riders and came pressure with attention the time of ham 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.820
 and ateneo having the doll 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.600
 A) Yes 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.850
 So let's go with Pam 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.460
 I said james b 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.410
 of entering the set that there are different types of cut that one thing is to cut 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.679
 ham for home 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.989
 an uncle transport it then in an event not in 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.650
 in which they are going through they carry ham bobbiners you will have 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.210
 seen several times those ham cutters go 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.629
 the entertainment section because it was the experience 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.409
 It was the difference 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.509
 we for example I the one that neither the hour of de of the events 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:32.089
 I had to clean the ham 

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:34.020
 at all or is it 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.109
 leave two fingers on the elbow 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:40.359
 and cleaned at all hopefully to prepare it to cut it to the 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:42.070
 moment to have a 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.640
 for 100 more comfort when cutting ham 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.449
 between the events then 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:52.499
 percent since that I usually start in the part of the north club 

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:54.389
 with that system 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.719
 the ham used much better 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:00.620
 and also with the community to cut it fast and such but good in 

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:03.639
 house is not necessary because we are not going to consume in Japan immediately 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:06.789
 but we will have it when we hold a ham at home 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:10.539
 at home while you know how to keep the vital and depends on 

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:11.769
 population that have 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.269
 well he knew is 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.680
 pm was known to last 1 2 3 4 5 months of doing comedy has to be in one place 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.889
 which is fresh and how important is the mass of bouquets to ham 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.099
 is for example 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:25.729
 min in the house 

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:29.019
 Well, it's not in the kitchen, for example, you can not put it in because that's when 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.729
 cook league appointment can give the heat to hams edith with hams like 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:38.039
 a living being that's when I started to sweat already started every day will start 

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:40.959
 until nothing of the málaga kitchen of the authoritarian 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.999
 Well, I do not know if you have a storage room, something like that, Balagueró, I would appreciate it cold, 

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:49.089
 there are officials and you have to look for good order in winter there is no 

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:52.189
 problem that will follow us if you do not leave Cartagena have no problem 

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:56.349
 What kind of ham are we cutting? 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.929
 Well, right now, we have the alba alba romero ham, which is 36 months 

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:01.809
 healing 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:05.280
 I was fed from de belloch 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.999
 so this is one of the best hams of 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:11.669
 so that the goal so real to the market this ham the freemasons 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.829
 about 400 and 1 50 euros line the kilo 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:16.759
 well nothing almost nothing 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:20.440
 well then we are seeing all this can be used or not the protests 

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:24.479
 cutting because people but taking advantage for kitchens and laundries has been what 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.619
 you can put in but let's say the part of what I'm removing is usually not 

00:04:28.619 --> 00:04:29.819
 can take advantage of nothing more 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:32.839
 he did not take advantage of it well because of the subject of the entity 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.180
 finely laden what is not not needed 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.830
 but hey the fat and all this fat is good stellar 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.569
 that fat is 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:47.689
 like that is because the motherboards are moving long before the table 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:49.130
 moves upnunders 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.510
 a master ham and what good 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.689
 in these weekly ham sessions 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:55.909
 but now again 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:57.930
 on that note absolutely nothing 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.430
 well, while 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.169
 the firewall 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.980
 tell us what advisory council we have said many tips at the time of 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.590
 buy ham but for this Christmas especially we think that people do not know 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.089
 stay in the bargains of ham not 

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:12.009
 Well, no 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.009
 Enciso and they give you sometimes and you buy a ham that we have also seen 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:21.740
 public at the time of buying a drawing monde make a decision because 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.530
 we have a good is an important decision and a disbursement as well 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.650
 important then 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.680
 yes 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.300
 e at the end or you have no faith in anyone the clear ideas of what is the type of 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.009
 game that wants the best is 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:39.789
 then consult it go to a specialized store and that a professional then 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:43.729
 I tell you that hams who in theory make the nickname I want to take 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:44.339
 t 

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:48.579
 so that at the time of declaring home, you will be taken away if you do not take a 

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:52.499
 surprise in the necessary reserves paid for a ham that in the end no no 

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:56.439
 necessarily bad that here at home against the osasuna and at the latest something 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.159
 which is above a tractor 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:59.150
 a classic 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.930
 do not cover 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.360
 ede aluminum 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.650
 the normally 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.500
 Well, usually not what they have to do at home is with their own fat I 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.529
 I will not realize that we have all learned to support Japan 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:14.059
 put his own fat we cover the meat 

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:17.819
 lüthi then yes japan is cut roads principle we can not cover what 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:22.199
 we can cover x and see it you have it totally covered still with 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:23.500
 she we reserve better 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.210
 it's worth it because once the ham is opened and to make disappear that the engine of 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.740
 that 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.750
 then with that and crazy we hold a little more 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.580
 that then the cloth whistled with the park rag not for dust or anything 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.340
 that but good as well as if they carry in magazines that makes grace 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.460
 booming 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.690
 makes an affected point to the people then at home know the coast by 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:44.490
 the sides 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.330
 not nothing more is to say doing counting is a technique 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.670
 the gala of his technique let's pa usable for example is here 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:53.740
 in this case not the bone we have it clear 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.719
 then with a lace we mark it 

00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:58.520
 c the bone 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.860
 and from there we are removing a little 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.479
 we declare going down 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:05.800
 well, that's what we're going to learn or the lesson 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.250
 who knows how many beds now the words we use the topics that 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.960
 Many thanks to data for having been with the others 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.509
 gentlemen this is take good note 

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:16.960
 ham doorleaf at home especially good 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.220
 every morning the news perez was famous return because we have a lot to 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:20.870
 say so far
