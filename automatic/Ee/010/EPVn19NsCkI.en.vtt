00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.020
 man can see what time the curious starts because I do not think it's a 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.550
 very associate person 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:11.370
 make a CD player dvd but more than once and another if it will be the other human 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:16.609
 or the dylan thomas in any case but good the truth that I go back to 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.699
 very special memories of me 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.560
 of my adolescence 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.589
 a 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:25.759
 was born in united states and and of environment and mentioned 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.539
 I count very special of the cmb that I love that is called the criminals 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.850
 I remembered that I say to stay here and I think it must be zero that we value 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.040
 in this conference 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.100
 because it increases and he knows why he is a master of 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.370
 he cut it what dairy he sees 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.880
 the language used so far the maxims of that 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.949
 aa restrictions not 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.850
 and I think it's the great secret of gender and in what remains a 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.489
 increase fascinating for today 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.290
 I think that also for a lot of good people 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.840
 in Merida until directing my own relationship with Cuba 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.559
 with the last century 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.400
 cnbc peppers am 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.400
 writer for journalist who knows 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.840
 yoquese pp and it has not been an extraordinary school 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.180
 to shelter good writers I do not know 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.390
 yes for such good journalists but certainly recorded the writers 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.850
 absolutely 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.840
 i think that in that sense it is not like him the absolute grandfather the father 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.370
 the pater families 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.229
 from all this to trend I want to have been destined 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.630
 what yes maybe we could have 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.210
 younger weddings like 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.850
 a confinement 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.140
 min the art the relationship so 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.120
 and I do the media 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.270
 for that you have, of course, gnv 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.040
 of course since I want to try in this conference today 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.560
 the club a cloak would be a son this month 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.869
 but that was a little beyond what you see was not willing to get 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:01.720
 do not 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.110
 and I imagine that it can be me and my generation of my time that has 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.840
 touched living and has my contemporaneity 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.489
 can wolves twist something much further than what should be imagined 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.150
 maybe 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.910
 what am I going to do with journalism with the media 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.999
 the lala the extension the disclosure 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:18.720
 The amplitude 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.119
 many of the media at this time do not and I think that 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:24.290
 first and what I do think I do believe that he 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.020
 established 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.460
 to the point of departure and what could split was that you too 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.879
 nothing could be part of the integrality of your work 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:37.900
 apart from being an extraordinary writer but he also knew that his own 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:42.289
 personality is part of another in prose even more 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:47.830
 the scope of the spokesperson in the framework of his own work 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.099
 but I think you should go beyond that 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.699
 cd and I think that there 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:52.630
 41 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.860
 a story to be clipped with would literally translate into the 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:57.839
 English 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:03.309
 adam of that great other horizon 31 stories the cedeao these reserves
