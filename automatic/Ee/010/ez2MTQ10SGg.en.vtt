00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.630 
of those get the tag into the line just
going<00:02:40.849> to<00:02:40.910> do<00:02:41.230> two<00:02:42.230> opposing<00:02:43.010> half<00:02:43.400> hitches

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.720 

this<00:02:50.989> helps<00:02:51.349> them<00:02:51.470> not<00:02:51.620> to<00:02:52.280> tighten<00:02:52.579> up

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
this helps them not to tighten up

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.080 
this helps them not to tighten up
