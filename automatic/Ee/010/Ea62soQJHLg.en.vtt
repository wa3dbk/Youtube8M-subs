00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.970
 what does the ball-leader do? 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.410
 if the enemy clears all 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:17.060
 has and all with 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:19.730
 covered are free running just like us 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.550
 deal with a special one today 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.730
 form of free running and that though 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.609
 running behind how they run this behind 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.789
 A wing player becomes out of the 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:35.510
 center on and is played by 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.790
 backplayer is called a 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.670
 fellow player runs behind his back in 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.650
 the free space and goes direction 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.960
 baseline 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.940
 which function has it running behind now 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.340
 the player running behind encounters the 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.280
 free space binds a counterpart 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.170
 and create for a short moment 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.980
 irritation in the enemy defense 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.440
 focusing on the new situation 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.289
 may have to adjust the 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.989
 must pass opponent even if 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:05.630
 Behind it , players do not run the ball 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.240
 so just get his 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.020
 more time on the ball and 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.410
 free space 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.090
 he now has several options either he 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.570
 sends his player behind 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.050
 Steep directional baseline 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:24.220
 or he pulls inwards shoots 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.690
 Tor plays a cross or is now fit 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.830
 which players are running behind 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.510
 As a rule, they are full-backs 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.310
 we think in bayern munich we have 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.729
 philipp lame on the left side of the 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.160
 ribery runs behind or rafinha on the 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.840
 Right the same with Arjen Robben 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.670
 does it but can also be a 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.369
 be the midfielder from the 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.640
 Central out a position change 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:51.780
 In exceptional cases it can also 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.780
 be the central striker 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.290
 the roughly 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.899
 easy in the fine form it comes up 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.329
 the right timing on and in 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.280
 of course also pointed football 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.149
 everything at the highest speed 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.970
 make 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.720
 many rows of defensive forces arise 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.060
 Of course, remember that the attacker 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.790
 runs behind and defend that 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.489
 we often see that in the game 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.489
 the backtracking is only faked 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.020
 running behind is quite 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.150
 just a simple tactical means 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.270
 to gain free space 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.280
 It should be a talented twelve year old 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.380
 dominate 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.690
 my experience as a trainer teaches me 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.150
 that even seasoned amateur footballer 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.590
 for the first time in training 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.710
 although they have been facing 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.930
 that's why decades in the club are playing 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.700
 My request to the colleagues too 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.120
 In the Kreisliga you can walk behind 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.120
 work out
