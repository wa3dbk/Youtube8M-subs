hard as la rambla la rambla is from the

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.880 
hard as la rambla la rambla is from the
90s<00:01:07.860> but<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:09.119> know<00:01:09.210> it's<00:01:09.450> still<00:01:09.570> there<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.229> in

a<00:01:11.040> lot<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.340> ways<00:01:11.490> same<00:01:12.030> time<00:01:12.270> as<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.570> always<00:01:12.689> was

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
a lot of ways same time as it always was

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.440 
a lot of ways same time as it always was
I<00:01:13.500> think<00:01:14.130> just<00:01:14.189> being<00:01:14.549> able<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.880> experience

able<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.549> experience<00:01:17.909> history<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.540> something

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
able to experience history is something

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.600 
able to experience history is something
that's<00:01:18.960> pretty<00:01:19.110> unique<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.500> climbing<00:01:20.040> I've

the journey with any hard root always

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.380 
the journey with any hard root always
begins<00:01:57.759> with<00:01:57.939> total<00:01:58.749> uncertainty<00:02:00.119> I've<00:02:01.119> gone

little beta refinements you feel like

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.770 
little beta refinements you feel like
maybe<00:02:09.700> you're<00:02:10.060> getting<00:02:10.209> a<00:02:10.420> little<00:02:10.569> better

exciting moments are milestones even
just<00:02:17.920> in<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.099> very<00:02:18.310> beginning<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:18.879> your

just in the very beginning of your

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.869 
just in the very beginning of your
process<00:02:19.510> like<00:02:20.049> I<00:02:20.379> can<00:02:21.280> do<00:02:21.400> all<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:21.640> moves

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
process like I can do all the moves

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.420 
process like I can do all the moves
maybe<00:02:22.780> you<00:02:23.019> can<00:02:23.170> do<00:02:23.260> all<00:02:23.379> the<00:02:23.500> moves<00:02:23.709> with<00:02:23.980> ten

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
maybe you can do all the moves with ten

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.479 
maybe you can do all the moves with ten
hangs<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:25.060> then<00:02:25.690> suddenly<00:02:25.959> you<00:02:26.590> can<00:02:26.769> do<00:02:26.950> the

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
hangs and then suddenly you can do the

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.910 
hangs and then suddenly you can do the
moves<00:02:27.760> in<00:02:28.209> sequence<00:02:28.810> you<00:02:28.959> can<00:02:29.110> do<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.709> route

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
moves in sequence you can do the route

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.319 
moves in sequence you can do the route
and<00:02:30.069> maybe<00:02:30.280> three<00:02:30.670> or<00:02:30.700> four<00:02:30.819> different

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
and maybe three or four different

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:38.100 
and maybe three or four different
sections<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:36.060> then<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.360> day<00:02:37.510> comes<00:02:37.750> along

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
sections and then the day comes along

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.350 
sections and then the day comes along
when<00:02:38.530> you<00:02:39.069> can<00:02:39.310> do<00:02:39.489> the<00:02:39.610> route<00:02:39.790> with<00:02:39.940> just<00:02:40.150> one

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
when you can do the route with just one

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.380 
when you can do the route with just one
fall

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:03:04.740 

I<00:03:01.050> really<00:03:02.050> feel<00:03:02.260> that<00:03:02.590> for<00:03:03.430> me<00:03:03.580> where<00:03:04.090> I<00:03:04.120> excel

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
I really feel that for me where I excel

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.990 
I really feel that for me where I excel
and<00:03:04.990> what<00:03:05.170> allows<00:03:05.709> me<00:03:05.980> to<00:03:06.100> reach<00:03:06.280> my<00:03:06.459> goals<00:03:06.700> is

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
and what allows me to reach my goals is

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.040 
and what allows me to reach my goals is
tenacity<00:03:08.520> my<00:03:09.520> success<00:03:09.970> has<00:03:10.150> been<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.450> product

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
tenacity my success has been the product

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.430 
tenacity my success has been the product
of<00:03:11.520> kind<00:03:12.520> of<00:03:12.610> you<00:03:13.060> know<00:03:13.180> rigid<00:03:13.720> training<00:03:16.440> in

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
of kind of you know rigid training in

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.130 
of kind of you know rigid training in
order<00:03:17.620> to<00:03:17.739> take<00:03:18.040> this<00:03:18.220> step<00:03:18.610> to<00:03:19.000> 9a<00:03:19.360> plus<00:03:19.810> it

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
order to take this step to 9a plus it

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.580 
order to take this step to 9a plus it
seems<00:03:20.800> essential<00:03:21.519> for<00:03:21.790> me<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.150> train<00:03:22.590> very

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
seems essential for me to train very

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.449 
seems essential for me to train very
systematically

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
systematically

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.479 
systematically
and<00:03:24.760> follow<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.600> same<00:03:25.780> plan<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.410> I<00:03:26.620> just<00:03:27.280> need

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
and follow the same plan and I just need

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:41.069 
and follow the same plan and I just need
to<00:03:27.519> punch<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.209> clock

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.110 

it's<00:03:42.079> incredible<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:43.069> go<00:03:43.280> from<00:03:43.700> total

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
it's incredible to go from total

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.240 
it's incredible to go from total
uncertainty<00:03:44.439> even<00:03:45.439> quite<00:03:45.739> a<00:03:45.769> bit<00:03:45.950> of<00:03:46.040> doubt

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.550 
regardless of how much I try to avoid it
I<00:03:51.859> always<00:03:52.250> need<00:03:52.549> to<00:03:52.579> go<00:03:53.090> through<00:03:54.019> the<00:03:54.140> motions

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
I always need to go through the motions

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.530 
I always need to go through the motions
of<00:03:54.829> feeling<00:03:55.609> as<00:03:55.730> though<00:03:55.879> it's<00:03:56.060> right<00:03:56.269> there

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
of feeling as though it's right there

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.470 
of feeling as though it's right there
getting<00:03:57.290> frustrated<00:03:58.040> having<00:03:58.730> some<00:03:59.000> struggle

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
and then finally having a moment of

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.470 
and then finally having a moment of
release<00:04:02.810> when<00:04:03.260> I<00:04:03.650> decide<00:04:04.280> that<00:04:04.310> I'd<00:04:05.120> like<00:04:05.359> to

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
release when I decide that I'd like to

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.839 
release when I decide that I'd like to
do<00:04:05.629> the<00:04:05.750> route<00:04:05.959> but<00:04:06.230> I'll<00:04:06.620> just<00:04:06.769> try<00:04:07.280> and<00:04:07.609> try

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
do the route but I'll just try and try

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:23.360 
do the route but I'll just try and try
is<00:04:07.969> all<00:04:08.239> I<00:04:08.269> can<00:04:08.450> do<00:04:08.719> and

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.960 

then<00:04:24.000> there's<00:04:24.510> a<00:04:24.570> moment<00:04:25.020> when<00:04:25.199> I<00:04:25.650> feel<00:04:26.130> quite

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
then there's a moment when I feel quite

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.939 
then there's a moment when I feel quite
confident<00:04:27.479> that<00:04:27.690> maybe<00:04:28.050> I<00:04:28.139> can<00:04:28.410> do<00:04:28.560> this<00:04:28.680> route

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
confident that maybe I can do this route

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.120 
confident that maybe I can do this route
it<00:04:29.760> is<00:04:29.820> a<00:04:30.000> really<00:04:30.449> really<00:04:30.600> important<00:04:31.169> step<00:04:31.830> in

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
it is a really really important step in

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.430 
it is a really really important step in
the<00:04:32.250> process<00:04:32.280> to<00:04:33.030> eventually<00:04:33.870> know<00:04:34.050> that<00:04:34.320> it's

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
the process to eventually know that it's

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.620 
the process to eventually know that it's
possible

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.740 

there<00:04:41.260> can<00:04:41.440> a<00:04:41.470> lot<00:04:41.710> of<00:04:41.830> times<00:04:42.010> be<00:04:42.430> a<00:04:42.750> long

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
there can a lot of times be a long

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.260 
there can a lot of times be a long
period<00:04:44.320> between<00:04:44.890> when<00:04:45.370> you<00:04:45.580> are<00:04:45.850> confident

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
period between when you are confident

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.760 
period between when you are confident
you<00:04:46.390> can<00:04:46.510> do<00:04:46.660> the<00:04:46.780> route<00:04:46.990> and<00:04:47.200> when<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:47.590> route

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
you can do the route and when the route

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.490 
you can do the route and when the route
is<00:04:47.920> actually<00:04:48.310> done<00:04:48.490> and<00:04:48.960> it's<00:04:49.960> during<00:04:50.350> this

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
is actually done and it's during this

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.260 
is actually done and it's during this
period<00:04:50.800> when<00:04:51.130> we<00:04:51.160> ride<00:04:51.670> a<00:04:51.700> crazy

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
period when we ride a crazy

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.630 
period when we ride a crazy
rollercoaster<00:04:52.630> of<00:04:52.990> emotion<00:04:53.800> and<00:04:54.070> excitement

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
rollercoaster of emotion and excitement

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.830 
rollercoaster of emotion and excitement
and<00:04:54.910> disappointment

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
and disappointment

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.230 
and disappointment
it's<00:04:56.590> normally<00:04:56.980> only<00:04:57.190> after<00:04:57.700> that<00:04:57.820> moment

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
it's normally only after that moment

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.760 
it's normally only after that moment
when<00:04:58.360> I've<00:04:58.480> kind<00:04:58.690> of<00:04:58.750> given<00:04:58.900> up<00:04:59.140> that<00:04:59.530> I

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
when I've kind of given up that I

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:57.890 
when I've kind of given up that I
actually<00:05:00.550> will<00:05:00.940> succeed

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:20.370 

I<00:05:59.300> can't<00:06:00.300> believe<00:06:00.570> that

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.440
