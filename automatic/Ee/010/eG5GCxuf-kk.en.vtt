there's diagrams that walk you through
all<00:00:27.340> nine<00:00:27.730> steps<00:00:30.029> one<00:00:31.029> small<00:00:31.300> piece<00:00:31.449> of

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.510 
all nine steps one small piece of

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.930 
all nine steps one small piece of
information<00:00:31.720> that<00:00:32.320> isn't<00:00:32.800> on<00:00:33.040> a<00:00:33.070> diagram<00:00:33.670> is

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
information that isn't on a diagram is

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.680 
information that isn't on a diagram is
that<00:00:34.300> when<00:00:34.660> you<00:00:34.989> load<00:00:35.710> the<00:00:35.739> spool<00:00:36.339> the<00:00:37.269> thread

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
that when you load the spool the thread

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.760 
that when you load the spool the thread
should<00:00:38.530> be<00:00:38.680> coming<00:00:39.180> towards<00:00:40.180> you<00:00:40.590> from<00:00:41.590> the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
should be coming towards you from the

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.959 
should be coming towards you from the
bottom<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:44.410> as<00:00:44.500> you<00:00:44.590> can<00:00:44.710> see<00:00:44.770> there<00:00:45.219> it's

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
bottom so as you can see there it's

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:47.910 
bottom so as you can see there it's
coming<00:00:46.360> off<00:00:46.510> the<00:00:46.660> back<00:00:46.870> underneath<00:00:47.350> the<00:00:47.500> spool

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
coming off the back underneath the spool

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.560 
coming off the back underneath the spool
towards<00:00:48.399> you<00:00:49.050> kind<00:00:50.050> of<00:00:50.170> wound<00:00:50.440> in<00:00:50.710> a

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
towards you kind of wound in a

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.319 
towards you kind of wound in a
counterclockwise<00:00:52.570> type<00:00:53.460> direction<00:00:57.329> then

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
counterclockwise type direction then

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.160 
counterclockwise type direction then
simply<00:00:58.930> slide<00:00:59.320> the<00:00:59.559> spool<00:00:59.800> onto<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.399> pin<00:01:01.170> find

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
simply slide the spool onto the pin find

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.590 
simply slide the spool onto the pin find
the<00:01:02.320> right<00:01:02.500> size<00:01:02.770> spool<00:01:03.520> cap<00:01:03.879> there's<00:01:04.330> three

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
the right size spool cap there's three

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.359 
the right size spool cap there's three
different<00:01:04.690> sizes<00:01:05.110> that<00:01:05.950> come<00:01:06.130> with<00:01:06.250> this

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
different sizes that come with this

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.670 
different sizes that come with this
particular<00:01:06.520> machine<00:01:07.000> you<00:01:07.390> can<00:01:07.539> see<00:01:07.750> this<00:01:08.470> is

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
particular machine you can see this is

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.730 
particular machine you can see this is
the<00:01:08.800> same<00:01:09.009> size<00:01:09.310> as<00:01:09.580> our<00:01:09.729> current<00:01:10.000> spool

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the same size as our current spool

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.279 
the same size as our current spool
diameter<00:01:11.740> and<00:01:11.979> then<00:01:12.700> that<00:01:13.569> will<00:01:13.780> just<00:01:13.810> slide

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 
diameter and then that will just slide

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:19.889 
diameter and then that will just slide
right<00:01:14.700> over<00:01:16.560> down<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.740> spool<00:01:18.039> pin<00:01:18.069> and<00:01:18.899> snugly

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
right over down the spool pin and snugly

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.949 
right over down the spool pin and snugly
fit<00:01:19.979> our<00:01:20.979> spool<00:01:21.640> in<00:01:21.880> place<00:01:22.240> so<00:01:22.630> that<00:01:22.780> when

00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:22.959 
fit our spool in place so that when

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:25.290 
fit our spool in place so that when
we're<00:01:23.140> sewing<00:01:23.380> it<00:01:24.190> doesn't<00:01:24.610> work<00:01:24.759> off<00:01:25.000> of<00:01:25.179> the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
we're sewing it doesn't work off of the

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.520 
we're sewing it doesn't work off of the
spool<00:01:25.569> pin<00:01:25.599> a<00:01:28.020> small<00:01:29.020> side<00:01:29.289> note<00:01:29.500> for

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530

basically<00:02:03.539> just<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:04.079> push<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.500> on<00:02:04.619> dirt<00:02:04.829> just

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
basically just you push it on dirt just

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.160 
basically just you push it on dirt just
slide<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.850> right<00:02:05.880> under<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.390> kind<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.600> snaps<00:02:06.929> in

going<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.730> pass<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.599> thread<00:02:27.900> underneath<00:02:28.410> and

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
going to pass the thread underneath and

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.119 
going to pass the thread underneath and
it's<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.190> little<00:02:29.720> like<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.750> little<00:02:31.200> shelf<00:02:31.739> that

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
it's a little like a little shelf that

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.190 
it's a little like a little shelf that
you<00:02:32.280> just<00:02:32.459> slide<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.910> right<00:02:32.940> underneath<00:02:33.360> it

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
you just slide it right underneath it

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.009 
you just slide it right underneath it
draws<00:02:34.500> it<00:02:34.709> into<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.190> channel<00:02:35.870> right<00:02:36.870> now

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
draws it into that channel right now

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.020 
draws it into that channel right now
with<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.200> better<00:02:37.440> view<00:02:37.829> after<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.760> have<00:02:38.880> the

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
with a better view after you have the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.089 
with a better view after you have the
thread<00:02:39.360> underneath<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:40.170> thread<00:02:40.470> plate<00:02:40.739> cover

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
thread underneath the thread plate cover

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.319 
thread underneath the thread plate cover
back<00:02:41.640> here<00:02:42.060> we<00:02:42.959> ran<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.290> down<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.560> channel<00:02:43.980> so

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
back here we ran it down the channel so

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.600 
back here we ran it down the channel so
it's<00:02:45.329> in<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.569> guide<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.220> under<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.370> cover

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
it's in the guide and under the cover

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.150 
it's in the guide and under the cover
and<00:02:48.000> you're<00:02:48.959> going<00:02:49.079> to<00:02:49.140> bring<00:02:49.349> it<00:02:49.530> down<00:02:49.769> and

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
and you're going to bring it down and

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.610 
and you're going to bring it down and
you'll<00:02:50.760> see<00:02:51.030> down<00:02:51.239> here<00:02:51.269> where<00:02:51.810> else<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:52.230> step

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
you'll see down here where else a step

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.860 
you'll see down here where else a step
number<00:02:52.829> three<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.610> you're<00:02:54.299> just<00:02:54.450> basically

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
number three and you're just basically

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.369 
number three and you're just basically
winding<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.709> around<00:02:56.099> that<00:02:56.400> little<00:02:57.329> hub<00:02:57.959> there

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
winding it around that little hub there

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.089 
winding it around that little hub there
and<00:02:58.650> then<00:02:59.160> it<00:02:59.250> comes<00:02:59.489> up<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.849> the<00:02:59.970> top<00:03:00.000> here<00:03:00.720> and

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
and then it comes up to the top here and

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.830 
and then it comes up to the top here and
it'll<00:03:02.099> connect<00:03:02.519> to<00:03:02.819> the<00:03:03.090> thread<00:03:03.569> take-up

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
it'll connect to the thread take-up

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.690 
it'll connect to the thread take-up
lever<00:03:04.190> which<00:03:05.190> moves<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:05.760> thread<00:03:06.030> up<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.360> down

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
lever which moves the thread up and down

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.180 
lever which moves the thread up and down
this<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:08.880> step<00:03:09.120> for<00:03:09.540> getting<00:03:09.840> it<00:03:10.590> hooked<00:03:10.769> on<00:03:10.950> to

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
this is step for getting it hooked on to

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.430 
this is step for getting it hooked on to
the<00:03:11.370> take-up<00:03:12.120> lever<00:03:12.299> coming<00:03:13.079> down<00:03:13.260> the

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
the take-up lever coming down the

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.729 
the take-up lever coming down the
channel<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.510> that's<00:03:15.510> step<00:03:15.840> five<00:03:16.200> I<00:03:16.470> like<00:03:16.620> to

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
channel and that's step five I like to

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.500 
channel and that's step five I like to
hold<00:03:16.889> my<00:03:17.010> finger<00:03:17.069> up<00:03:17.489> on<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.850> right<00:03:18.030> hand<00:03:18.269> side

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
hold my finger up on the right hand side

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.259 
hold my finger up on the right hand side
here<00:03:18.840> put<00:03:19.500> some<00:03:19.530> tension<00:03:19.920> on<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.549> thread<00:03:20.579> so

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
here put some tension on the thread so

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.809 
here put some tension on the thread so
it<00:03:21.359> doesn't<00:03:21.799> keep<00:03:22.799> pulling<00:03:23.220> on<00:03:23.340> me<00:03:23.549> when<00:03:23.700> I'm

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
it doesn't keep pulling on me when I'm

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.660 
it doesn't keep pulling on me when I'm
working<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.380> so<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:25.530> recap<00:03:25.709> we've<00:03:26.160> got<00:03:26.370> step

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
working it so to recap we've got step

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.569 
working it so to recap we've got step
one<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.180> guide<00:03:27.440> then<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.650> thread<00:03:28.920> runs<00:03:29.190> under

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
one the guide then the thread runs under

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.360 
one the guide then the thread runs under
the<00:03:29.609> guide<00:03:29.910> cover<00:03:30.299> comes<00:03:31.260> down<00:03:31.530> this<00:03:31.769> channel

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
the guide cover comes down this channel

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.030 
the guide cover comes down this channel
number<00:03:33.359> three<00:03:33.690> as<00:03:33.810> it<00:03:33.930> goes<00:03:34.079> back<00:03:34.410> up

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
number three as it goes back up

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.550 
number three as it goes back up
number<00:03:35.430> four<00:03:35.760> is<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.150> latches<00:03:36.419> on<00:03:36.750> comes<00:03:37.260> down

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
number four is it latches on comes down

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.920 
number four is it latches on comes down
for<00:03:37.919> five<00:03:38.329> and<00:03:40.519> I'll<00:03:41.519> go<00:03:41.730> ahead<00:03:41.819> and<00:03:42.239> show<00:03:42.840> you

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
for five and I'll go ahead and show you

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.710 
for five and I'll go ahead and show you
the<00:03:43.049> next<00:03:43.260> part<00:03:44.209> six<00:03:45.209> is<00:03:45.419> going<00:03:45.569> to<00:03:45.630> be<00:03:45.690> a

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
the next part six is going to be a

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.589 
the next part six is going to be a
little<00:03:45.959> harder<00:03:46.319> to<00:03:46.440> see

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
little harder to see

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.649 
little harder to see
there's<00:03:49.200> a<00:03:49.349> needle<00:03:49.860> bar<00:03:50.099> thread<00:03:50.790> guide<00:03:51.090> that

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
there's a needle bar thread guide that

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:53.690 
there's a needle bar thread guide that
is<00:03:52.019> attached<00:03:52.469> to<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.739> needle<00:03:53.040> bar<00:03:53.189> it's<00:03:53.489> just

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
is attached to the needle bar it's just

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.330 
is attached to the needle bar it's just
a<00:03:53.819> little<00:03:53.969> pin<00:03:54.349> right<00:03:55.349> here<00:03:55.409> you<00:03:55.829> can<00:03:55.980> see<00:03:56.250> it

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
a little pin right here you can see it

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.300 
a little pin right here you can see it
and<00:03:56.579> the<00:03:57.390> thread<00:03:57.750> is<00:03:57.780> going<00:03:58.049> to<00:03:58.319> black

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
and the thread is going to black

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.059 
and the thread is going to black
underneath<00:04:00.030> that<00:04:00.390> and<00:04:00.780> then<00:04:01.590> I'll<00:04:01.680> keep<00:04:01.859> the

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
underneath that and then I'll keep the

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.229 
underneath that and then I'll keep the
thread<00:04:02.370> close<00:04:02.670> to<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.959> needle<00:04:04.349> bar<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:05.239> run

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
thread close to the needle bar and run

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.349 
thread close to the needle bar and run
directly<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.409> next<00:04:07.799> point<00:04:08.129> here<00:04:08.459> which<00:04:09.329> is

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
directly to the next point here which is

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.330 
directly to the next point here which is
going<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:09.840> be<00:04:10.049> number<00:04:10.260> seven<00:04:10.890> it's<00:04:11.040> just<00:04:11.220> a

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
going to be number seven it's just a

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.009 
going to be number seven it's just a
little<00:04:11.609> groove<00:04:13.310> and<00:04:14.310> it<00:04:14.879> slides<00:04:15.090> up<00:04:15.359> and<00:04:15.629> you

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
little groove and it slides up and you

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.960 
little groove and it slides up and you
pull<00:04:16.259> it<00:04:16.289> for<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.560> left<00:04:16.829> and<00:04:17.430> it<00:04:17.519> locks<00:04:17.759> into

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
pull it for the left and it locks into

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.420 
pull it for the left and it locks into
place<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:21.470> now<00:04:22.470> we<00:04:22.530> brought<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:22.979> thread<00:04:23.280> up

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
place and now we brought the thread up

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.879 
place and now we brought the thread up
from<00:04:24.030> number<00:04:24.330> seven<00:04:24.780> to<00:04:25.110> number<00:04:25.380> eight<00:04:25.560> which

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
from number seven to number eight which

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.870 
from number seven to number eight which
is<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:26.220> thread<00:04:26.460> cutter<00:04:26.699> and<00:04:27.090> you<00:04:27.120> just<00:04:27.900> pull

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
is the thread cutter and you just pull

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.820 
is the thread cutter and you just pull
and<00:04:29.880> now<00:04:30.210> you've<00:04:30.360> got<00:04:30.509> the<00:04:30.750> exact<00:04:31.380> length<00:04:31.680> you

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
and now you've got the exact length you

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.850 
and now you've got the exact length you
need<00:04:31.949> to<00:04:32.130> thread<00:04:32.430> and<00:04:33.349> finally<00:04:34.349> step<00:04:34.620> nine

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
need to thread and finally step nine
