front it's made from two pieces of
threaded<00:01:06.140> bar<00:01:06.350> which<00:01:06.680> means<00:01:07.070> you<00:01:07.190> don't<00:01:07.310> have

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:07.399 
threaded bar which means you don't have

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:19.230 
threaded bar which means you don't have
to<00:01:07.490> screw<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:07.970> width<00:01:08.149> down<00:01:08.300> every<00:01:08.600> time

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.800 

I<00:01:20.369> then<00:01:21.369> routed<00:01:21.909> out<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.180> body<00:01:22.360> to<00:01:22.659> the

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
I then routed out the body to the

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.690 
I then routed out the body to the
correct<00:01:23.110> depth<00:01:23.380> and<00:01:23.799> here's<00:01:24.250> what<00:01:24.400> it<00:01:24.520> looks

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
correct depth and here's what it looks

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.660 
correct depth and here's what it looks
like<00:01:27.960> air<00:01:28.960> as<00:01:29.200> the<00:01:29.440> amounts<00:01:30.100> are<00:01:30.159> routed<00:01:30.550> on

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
like air as the amounts are routed on

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.999 
like air as the amounts are routed on
front<00:01:30.970> of<00:01:31.090> each<00:01:31.240> section<00:01:31.570> and<00:01:32.140> what<00:01:32.740> it<00:01:32.890> looks

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
front of each section and what it looks

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.320 
front of each section and what it looks
like<00:01:33.250> from<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.520> side<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.909> gives<00:01:37.119> you<00:01:37.300> a

like from the side this gives you a

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.999 
like from the side this gives you a
rough<00:01:37.540> idea<00:01:37.690> of<00:01:38.020> what<00:01:38.170> your<00:01:38.380> car<00:01:38.590> will<00:01:38.890> look

flown<00:02:43.650> across<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:44.160> garden<00:02:45.020> so<00:02:46.020> I<00:02:46.080> have<00:02:46.230> to

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
flown across the garden so I have to

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.920 
flown across the garden so I have to
change<00:02:46.590> this<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:47.250> carry<00:02:47.550> on<00:02:47.700> sandy

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:33.750 

and<00:03:25.239> noticed<00:03:25.959> Istanbul<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:26.920> send<00:03:27.159> them

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.720 

so<00:03:34.750> in<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:34.959> end<00:03:35.049> my<00:03:35.110> Ganga<00:03:35.439> in<00:03:35.860> Reverse<00:03:36.220> I'm

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
so in the end my Ganga in Reverse I'm

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.900 
so in the end my Ganga in Reverse I'm
sounding<00:03:37.209> like<00:03:37.269> usual

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.790 

because<00:03:43.300> the<00:03:43.480> obvious<00:03:43.600> downside<00:03:44.290> events<00:03:44.680> in

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
because the obvious downside events in

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.030

the<00:03:44.890> safe<00:03:45.100> absolutely<00:03:45.850> ages<00:03:46.740> so<00:03:47.740> here<00:03:47.920> the

the safe absolutely ages so here the

the safe absolutely ages so here the
time<00:03:48.250> maps<00:03:48.520> to<00:03:48.790> make<00:03:48.940> it<00:03:49.060> much<00:03:49.240> more<00:03:49.510> amusing

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.039 

I<00:03:54.739> strongly<00:03:55.549> suggest<00:03:55.819> find<00:03:56.269> a<00:03:56.359> belt<00:03:56.569> sander<00:03:57.019> to

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
I strongly suggest find a belt sander to

I strongly suggest find a belt sander to
do<00:03:57.290> this<00:03:57.469> job

however after standing forever through

however after standing forever through
the<00:04:02.840> ages<00:04:03.260> I<00:04:03.620> think<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.459> body<00:04:04.640> is<00:04:04.760> finally

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
the ages I think the body is finally

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:05.890 
the ages I think the body is finally

I glued off a body bite from some old

the top all that's left to do is the

the top all that's left to do is the

final sanding and the finishing process
you'll<00:04:20.060> probably<00:04:20.239> know<00:04:20.630> that<00:04:20.900> finishing

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
you'll probably know that finishing

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.140 
you'll probably know that finishing
takes<00:04:21.709> an<00:04:21.829> extremely<00:04:22.310> long<00:04:22.460> amount<00:04:22.759> of<00:04:22.880> time

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
takes an extremely long amount of time

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
so my next update will be in a few weeks

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:37.860 
so my next update will be in a few weeks
with<00:04:25.820> a<00:04:25.850> complete<00:04:26.270> video<00:04:26.600> of<00:04:26.870> how<00:04:27.020> to<00:04:27.080> do<00:04:27.349> it
