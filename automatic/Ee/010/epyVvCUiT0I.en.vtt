on<00:01:10.850> a<00:01:10.880> little<00:01:11.060> bias<00:01:11.329> coming<00:01:11.750> from<00:01:11.840> a<00:01:11.960> turbo

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350

on a little bias coming from a turbo
engine<00:01:12.380> I<00:01:12.740> really<00:01:12.979> like<00:01:13.130> that<00:01:13.310> kind<00:01:13.549> of

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
engine I really like that kind of

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.429

slingshot<00:01:14.509> feel<00:01:14.810> that<00:01:15.020> you<00:01:15.079> get<00:01:15.229> from<00:01:15.320> a

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
slingshot feel that you get from a

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.100 
slingshot feel that you get from a
turbocharger<00:01:16.040> but<00:01:16.880> there's<00:01:17.750> really

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
turbocharger but there's really

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.100 
turbocharger but there's really
something<00:01:18.649> to<00:01:18.710> be<00:01:18.830> said<00:01:19.130> about<00:01:20.110> instant

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
something to be said about instant

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.370 
something to be said about instant
throttle<00:01:21.530> response<00:01:21.649> and<00:01:23.380> complete

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
throttle response and complete

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.980 
throttle response and complete
predictability<00:01:24.740> when<00:01:25.399> it<00:01:25.490> comes<00:01:25.729> to<00:01:26.060> getting

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
predictability when it comes to getting

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.469 
predictability when it comes to getting
on<00:01:27.200> power<00:01:27.470> when<00:01:27.860> you're<00:01:27.979> exiting<00:01:28.460> a<00:01:28.610> corner<00:01:31.479> so

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
on power when you're exiting a corner so

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.359 
on power when you're exiting a corner so
in<00:01:32.600> terms<00:01:32.780> of<00:01:32.899> exterior<00:01:33.409> styling<00:01:33.830> I<00:01:33.979> really

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
in terms of exterior styling I really

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.600 
in terms of exterior styling I really
think<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:35.030> e46<00:01:35.630> chasity<00:01:36.320> in<00:01:36.380> particular<00:01:36.860> has

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
think the e46 chasity in particular has

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.600 
think the e46 chasity in particular has
held<00:01:38.479> up<00:01:38.750> amazingly<00:01:39.649> over<00:01:40.039> the<00:01:40.130> years<00:01:40.280> I<00:01:40.399> think

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
held up amazingly over the years I think

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.529 
held up amazingly over the years I think
it<00:01:40.700> looks<00:01:40.909> super<00:01:41.539> sleek<00:01:42.140> super<00:01:42.860> modern<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:43.909> I

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
it looks super sleek super modern and I

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.779 
it looks super sleek super modern and I
don't<00:01:45.440> know<00:01:45.619> it<00:01:45.709> just<00:01:45.740> holds<00:01:46.280> up<00:01:46.369> really<00:01:46.640> well

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
don't know it just holds up really well

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.880 
don't know it just holds up really well
in<00:01:47.090> my<00:01:47.270> opinion<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.750> lines<00:01:47.929> really<00:01:48.200> good<00:01:48.470> it's

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
in my opinion the lines really good it's

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.510 
in my opinion the lines really good it's

the<00:02:41.990> shifter<00:02:42.410> takes<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:42.980> little<00:02:43.100> bit<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.430> get

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
the shifter takes a little bit to get

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.790 
the shifter takes a little bit to get
used<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.880> but<00:02:44.150> once<00:02:44.270> you<00:02:44.450> do

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.000 

means<00:02:47.100> a<00:02:47.220> solid<00:02:47.700> throw<00:02:48.050> very<00:02:49.050> solid<00:02:49.590> feeling<00:02:49.800> I

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
means a solid throw very solid feeling I

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.050 
means a solid throw very solid feeling I
think<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.250> would<00:02:50.340> definitely<00:02:50.430> put<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.820> short

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
think I would definitely put a short

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.800 
think I would definitely put a short

for<00:02:52.230> sure<00:02:53.640> but<00:02:54.480> other<00:02:54.630> than<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:54.900> clutch

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
for sure but other than that clutch

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.070 
for sure but other than that clutch
feels<00:02:55.500> good<00:02:55.740> it<00:02:56.040> is<00:02:56.160> electronic<00:02:56.670> clutch<00:02:57.080> it's
