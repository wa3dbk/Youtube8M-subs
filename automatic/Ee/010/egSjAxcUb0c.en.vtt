want to start by turning the shirt
insider<00:02:04.079> inside<00:02:04.560> out<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.979> back<00:02:05.250> is

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
insider inside out and the back is

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.950 
insider inside out and the back is
facing<00:02:05.670> up<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.180> open<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.630> can<00:02:06.750> see<00:02:06.840> the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
facing up so I open it you can see the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.510 
facing up so I open it you can see the
design<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.560> there<00:02:07.740> because<00:02:07.920> obviously<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.399> want

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
design in there because obviously I want

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.639 
design in there because obviously I want
to<00:02:08.640> cut<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.090> front<00:02:09.360> I'm<00:02:09.840> pretty<00:02:10.410> sure<00:02:10.590> it

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
to cut the front I'm pretty sure it

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.090 
to cut the front I'm pretty sure it
inside<00:02:10.920> out<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.190> that

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
inside out so that

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.830 
inside out so that
because<00:02:12.340> when<00:02:12.490> I'm<00:02:12.580> marking<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.210> I'm<00:02:13.450> probably

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
because when I'm marking it I'm probably

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.940 
because when I'm marking it I'm probably
not<00:02:14.020> gonna<00:02:14.140> look<00:02:14.260> not<00:02:14.440> going<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.620> cut<00:02:14.770> on<00:02:14.860> the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
not gonna look not going to cut on the

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.340 
not gonna look not going to cut on the
lines<00:02:15.190> perfectly<00:02:15.580> so<00:02:16.450> this<00:02:16.990> will<00:02:17.080> just<00:02:17.200> be<00:02:17.290> the

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
lines perfectly so this will just be the

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.440 
lines perfectly so this will just be the
easiest<00:02:17.740> way<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:17.950> do<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.400> I<00:02:18.580> like<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.270> start

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450

over the part because it's the easiest
for<00:03:22.420> me<00:03:22.450> you<00:03:22.750> can<00:03:23.050> measure<00:03:23.350> a<00:03:23.740> line<00:03:24.550> all<00:03:24.820> the

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
for me you can measure a line all the

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.990 
for me you can measure a line all the
way<00:03:24.970> up<00:03:25.150> but<00:03:25.390> i'm<00:03:25.600> just<00:03:25.630> lazy<00:03:26.110> so<00:03:26.860> yeah<00:03:27.010> I'm

way up but i'm just lazy so yeah I'm
going<00:03:28.060> to<00:03:28.510> connect<00:03:28.960> those<00:03:29.230> and<00:03:29.650> i<00:03:30.010> will<00:03:30.310> show

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
going to connect those and i will show

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.960 
going to connect those and i will show
you<00:03:30.730> what<00:03:31.300> it<00:03:31.390> looks<00:03:31.420> like<00:03:31.600> when<00:03:31.840> i<00:03:31.930> come<00:03:32.110> back

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970

you what it looks like when i come back
okay<00:03:33.970> so<00:03:34.030> i'm<00:03:34.270> an<00:03:34.390> idiot<00:03:34.540> and<00:03:35.140> I<00:03:35.200> thought<00:03:35.410> the

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
okay so i'm an idiot and I thought the

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.530 
okay so i'm an idiot and I thought the
camera<00:03:35.890> was<00:03:36.010> recording<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:36.760> it<00:03:36.850> wasn't<00:03:37.360> so<00:03:37.510> I

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
camera was recording and it wasn't so I

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.300 
camera was recording and it wasn't so I
missed<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:38.020> couple<00:03:38.200> steps<00:03:38.620> I'm<00:03:38.950> gonna<00:03:39.130> go

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
missed a couple steps I'm gonna go

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.370 
missed a couple steps I'm gonna go
through<00:03:39.340> with<00:03:39.520> you<00:03:39.670> right<00:03:39.820> now<00:03:39.850> so<00:03:40.300> as<00:03:40.630> you<00:03:41.260> can

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
through with you right now so as you can

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.320 
through with you right now so as you can
see<00:03:41.620> i<00:03:41.650> drew<00:03:42.100> lines<00:03:42.370> all<00:03:42.730> at<00:03:42.850> the<00:03:42.940> back<00:03:43.090> of<00:03:43.120> the

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
see i drew lines all at the back of the

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.910 
see i drew lines all at the back of the
shirt<00:03:43.600> it's<00:03:43.900> actually<00:03:44.230> really<00:03:44.410> easy<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:44.800> see

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
shirt it's actually really easy to see

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.340 
shirt it's actually really easy to see
the<00:03:45.010> black<00:03:45.250> pan<00:03:45.550> on<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:45.730> black<00:03:46.030> shirt<00:03:46.690> so<00:03:47.140> i

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
the black pan on the black shirt so i

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.540 
the black pan on the black shirt so i
would<00:03:47.500> suggest<00:03:47.620> that<00:03:47.920> because<00:03:48.220> it's<00:03:48.460> the

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
would suggest that because it's the

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.250 
would suggest that because it's the
easiest<00:03:48.580> to<00:03:49.210> kind<00:03:49.420> of<00:03:49.450> camouflage<00:03:49.720> once<00:03:50.170> the

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
easiest to kind of camouflage once the

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.670 
easiest to kind of camouflage once the
shirt<00:03:50.440> is<00:03:50.560> on<00:03:50.880> um<00:03:51.880> I<00:03:51.940> drew<00:03:52.450> I<00:03:52.630> think<00:03:52.840> I<00:03:52.930> said<00:03:52.990> 18

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
shirt is on um I drew I think I said 18

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
lines from the bottom to the top of the

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.450 
lines from the bottom to the top of the
shirt<00:03:55.600> and<00:03:55.900> then<00:03:56.560> i<00:03:56.620> went<00:03:56.800> ahead<00:03:56.950> and<00:03:57.100> i<00:03:57.250> cut

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
shirt and then i went ahead and i cut

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.580 
shirt and then i went ahead and i cut
the<00:03:57.580> sleeves<00:03:57.880> and<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.180> collar<00:03:58.450> off<00:03:58.570> so<00:03:59.470> what

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
the sleeves and the collar off so what

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.650 
the sleeves and the collar off so what
you're<00:03:59.710> going<00:03:59.830> to<00:04:00.040> do<00:04:00.190> is<00:04:00.310> cut<00:04:00.520> just<00:04:00.970> outside

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
you're going to do is cut just outside

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.840 
you're going to do is cut just outside
of<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:02.610> stitching<00:04:03.610> kind<00:04:04.360> of<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:05.850> threading

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
of the stitching kind of the threading

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.270 
of the stitching kind of the threading
of<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:07.600> are<00:04:08.110> the<00:04:08.290> seam<00:04:08.560> is<00:04:08.860> what<00:04:09.010> i<00:04:09.040> meant<00:04:09.160> of

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
of the are the seam is what i meant of

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.270 
of the are the seam is what i meant of
the<00:04:09.430> sleeves<00:04:09.700> because<00:04:09.880> if<00:04:10.120> you<00:04:10.180> cut<00:04:10.470> too<00:04:11.470> far<00:04:12.040> I

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
the sleeves because if you cut too far I

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.890 
the sleeves because if you cut too far I
find<00:04:12.610> that<00:04:12.730> if<00:04:12.880> you<00:04:13.000> cut<00:04:13.210> off<00:04:13.330> too<00:04:13.570> much<00:04:13.690> of

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
find that if you cut off too much of

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.630 
find that if you cut off too much of
this<00:04:14.050> part<00:04:14.380> here<00:04:14.800> you're<00:04:15.310> going<00:04:15.430> to<00:04:15.490> end<00:04:15.580> up

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
this part here you're going to end up

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.330 
this part here you're going to end up
showing<00:04:15.790> a<00:04:15.940> lot<00:04:16.120> of<00:04:16.180> side<00:04:16.540> boob<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:17.680> you're

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
showing a lot of side boob and you're

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.550 
showing a lot of side boob and you're
gonna<00:04:18.430> end<00:04:18.609> up<00:04:18.730> kind<00:04:19.030> of<00:04:19.180> making<00:04:19.540> it<00:04:19.660> too

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
gonna end up kind of making it too

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.810 
gonna end up kind of making it too
skanky<00:04:20.830> to<00:04:21.070> wear<00:04:21.190> which<00:04:21.340> is<00:04:21.430> cool<00:04:21.580> because<00:04:21.669> you

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
skanky to wear which is cool because you

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.130 
skanky to wear which is cool because you
were<00:04:21.910> with<00:04:22.030> bando<00:04:22.419> but<00:04:22.600> I<00:04:22.630> just<00:04:22.870> like<00:04:22.960> it<00:04:23.080> a

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
were with bando but I just like it a

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.210 
were with bando but I just like it a
little<00:04:23.229> bit<00:04:23.380> higher<00:04:23.590> in<00:04:23.830> the

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
little bit higher in the

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.980 
little bit higher in the
I<00:04:24.250> then<00:04:24.580> you<00:04:24.640> can<00:04:24.760> always<00:04:25.030> go<00:04:25.150> back<00:04:25.180> and<00:04:25.390> cut<00:04:25.840> it

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
I then you can always go back and cut it

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.440 
I then you can always go back and cut it
more<00:04:26.920> once<00:04:27.280> you<00:04:27.400> put<00:04:27.640> it<00:04:27.730> on<00:04:27.850> so<00:04:28.150> what<00:04:28.270> I<00:04:28.300> do<00:04:28.390> is

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
more once you put it on so what I do is

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.480 
more once you put it on so what I do is
I<00:04:28.570> cut<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:28.840> sleeves<00:04:29.080> in<00:04:29.200> the<00:04:29.290> collar<00:04:29.500> and<00:04:29.830> then

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
I cut the sleeves in the collar and then

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.980 
I cut the sleeves in the collar and then
I<00:04:30.550> put<00:04:30.880> it<00:04:30.970> on<00:04:31.060> and<00:04:31.300> realize<00:04:31.570> that<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:31.780> caller

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
I put it on and realize that the caller

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.280 
I put it on and realize that the caller
was<00:04:32.140> too<00:04:32.320> high<00:04:32.500> for<00:04:32.830> me<00:04:32.860> so<00:04:33.190> I<00:04:33.220> cut<00:04:33.730> the<00:04:33.880> collar

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
was too high for me so I cut the collar

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.810 
was too high for me so I cut the collar
really<00:04:35.290> low<00:04:35.500> in<00:04:35.680> the<00:04:35.710> back<00:04:36.010> and<00:04:36.220> I<00:04:36.310> cut<00:04:36.580> it<00:04:36.700> on

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
really low in the back and I cut it on

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.390 
really low in the back and I cut it on
the<00:04:37.120> front<00:04:37.630> just<00:04:38.290> above<00:04:38.620> the<00:04:38.680> letters<00:04:39.070> because

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
the front just above the letters because

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.550 
the front just above the letters because
I<00:04:39.490> still<00:04:39.700> want<00:04:39.880> to<00:04:39.910> be<00:04:40.000> able<00:04:40.090> to<00:04:40.360> see<00:04:40.690> the<00:04:41.350> band

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
I still want to be able to see the band

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.670 
I still want to be able to see the band

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.640 
another line now I was an idiot and I
cut<00:05:37.000> right<00:05:37.330> through<00:05:37.360> my<00:05:37.720> shirt<00:05:37.990> at<00:05:38.230> one<00:05:38.380> point

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650
