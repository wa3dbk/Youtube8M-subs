00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
the read only domain controller you

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.070 
the read only domain controller you
start<00:00:16.560> out<00:00:16.650> by<00:00:16.770> clicking<00:00:16.830> start<00:00:17.840> run<00:00:18.840> and

dcpromo read only domain controllers are
a<00:00:22.410> feature<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:23.010> are<00:00:23.130> only<00:00:23.369> available<00:00:23.609> in

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160

a feature that are only available in
server<00:00:26.160> 2008<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.720> idea<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.380> this

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
server 2008 the idea is that this

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.820 
server 2008 the idea is that this
computer<00:00:29.039> will<00:00:29.189> be<00:00:29.279> in<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.519> branch<00:00:29.820> office<00:00:30.210> and

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
computer will be in a branch office and

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:37.069 
computer will be in a branch office and
will<00:00:32.329> cache<00:00:33.649> credentials<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.870> you<00:00:36.870> don't

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
will cache credentials so that you don't

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.340 
will cache credentials so that you don't
have<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.530> authenticate<00:00:38.070> across<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.000> domain

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
have to authenticate across the domain

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.139 
have to authenticate across the domain
the<00:00:40.350> benefit<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:41.100> being<00:00:41.399> read<00:00:41.670> only<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.739> it

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
the benefit of it being read only is it

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.630 
the benefit of it being read only is it
will<00:00:45.149> not<00:00:45.420> write<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.410> domain<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.399> if<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
will not write to the domain so if the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.100 
will not write to the domain so if the
computer<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:49.010> stolen<00:00:50.010> or<00:00:50.820> if<00:00:52.820> someone<00:00:53.820> should

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
computer is stolen or if someone should

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.630 
computer is stolen or if someone should
compromise<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.469> network<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> remote

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
compromise the network in the remote

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.430 
compromise the network in the remote
office<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.180> won't<00:00:57.390> affect<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:58.320> entire<00:00:58.620> domain

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
office it won't affect the entire domain

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.560 
office it won't affect the entire domain
if<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.590> computer<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:01.920> stolen<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:03.300> will<00:01:03.420> give

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
if the computer is stolen it will give

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.140 
if the computer is stolen it will give
me<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.750> option<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.580> reset<00:01:05.580> all<00:01:05.820> passwords

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
me the option to reset all passwords

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.820 
me the option to reset all passwords
stored<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:09.200> that<00:01:10.200> read<00:01:10.409> only<00:01:10.590> domain

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
stored on that that read only domain

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
the name of my domain is my dot domain

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.370 
the name of my domain is my dot domain
and<00:01:29.240> this<00:01:30.240> computer<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.720> member<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.320> a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.940 
controller but it is not a member of the
domain<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.110> have<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.290> use<00:01:37.439> alternate

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
domain so I have to use alternate

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.130 
domain so I have to use alternate
credentials<00:01:38.400> if<00:01:38.579> not<00:01:38.790> my<00:01:39.570> credentials<00:01:40.049> would

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
credentials if not my credentials would

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.760 
credentials if not my credentials would
be<00:01:40.229> just<00:01:40.470> fine<00:01:41.329> so<00:01:42.329> I'm<00:01:42.390> going<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.770> set

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
be just fine so I'm going to set

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.249 
be just fine so I'm going to set
alternate<00:01:44.250> credentials<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.600> put<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.049> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
alternate credentials and put in the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:54.469 
alternate credentials and put in the
domain<00:01:46.890> administrators<00:01:47.850> password<00:01:53.360> and<00:01:54.360> that

domain administrators password and that

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.090 
domain administrators password and that
should<00:01:54.689> do<00:01:54.780> it

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
should do it

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.450 
should do it
and<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.549> will<00:01:56.640> attempt<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.119> resolve<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:59.310> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
and it will attempt to resolve to the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.889 
and it will attempt to resolve to the
domain<00:01:59.790> there<00:02:00.119> we<00:02:00.180> go<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.570> found<00:02:00.719> the

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
domain there we go so it found the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.569 
domain there we go so it found the
domain<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:02.090> not<00:02:03.090> exactly<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.659> forest

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
domain this is a not exactly a forest

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.850 
domain this is a not exactly a forest
because<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.820> only<00:02:05.969> have<00:02:06.149> one<00:02:06.180> domain<00:02:06.509> there<00:02:06.930> if

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
because I only have one domain there if

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.550 
because I only have one domain there if
I<00:02:08.640> had<00:02:08.789> installed<00:02:09.149> extra<00:02:09.629> sites<00:02:09.989> on<00:02:10.349> the

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
I had installed extra sites on the

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.860 
I had installed extra sites on the
domain<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:10.920> would<00:02:11.220> be<00:02:11.310> listed<00:02:11.520> here<00:02:11.700> so

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
domain that would be listed here so

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.380 
domain that would be listed here so
if<00:02:13.560> this<00:02:13.950> were<00:02:14.129> a<00:02:14.160> branch<00:02:14.519> office<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:15.150> may<00:02:15.330> be

if this were a branch office it may be

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.750 
if this were a branch office it may be
listed<00:02:15.660> here<00:02:15.810> choose<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.260> appropriate<00:02:16.620> site

this is going to be a DNS server a

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
that you have to run is our OD c prep

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:13.010 
that you have to run is our OD c prep
there's<00:05:03.060> another<00:05:03.330> one<00:05:03.570> for<00:05:08.360> forest<00:05:09.360> prep<00:05:12.020> but

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
there's another one for forest prep but

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.400 
there's another one for forest prep but
um<00:05:14.720> generally<00:05:15.720> what<00:05:15.870> I've<00:05:15.960> read<00:05:16.140> you<00:05:16.380> just

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
um generally what I've read you just

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.260 
um generally what I've read you just
need<00:05:16.740> ro<00:05:16.950> DC<00:05:18.170> prep<00:05:19.790> but<00:05:20.790> since<00:05:21.030> I'm<00:05:21.240> not

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
need ro DC prep but since I'm not

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:28.520 
need ro DC prep but since I'm not
running<00:05:21.780> a<00:05:23.210> server<00:05:24.560> 2003<00:05:25.560> in<00:05:25.860> my<00:05:26.100> domain<00:05:27.530> then

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
running a server 2003 in my domain then

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.450 
running a server 2003 in my domain then
I'm<00:05:29.280> okay<00:05:29.730> I<00:05:29.940> don't<00:05:30.390> have<00:05:30.600> to<00:05:30.690> run<00:05:30.900> this<00:05:31.460> now

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
I'm okay I don't have to run this now

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.570 
I'm okay I don't have to run this now
it's<00:05:32.880> come<00:05:33.150> back<00:05:33.180> up<00:05:33.510> so<00:05:33.750> let<00:05:33.870> me<00:05:34.400> go<00:05:35.400> to<00:05:35.460> the

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
it's come back up so let me go to the

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.260 
it's come back up so let me go to the
properties<00:05:36.030> of<00:05:36.060> the<00:05:36.390> domain<00:05:36.720> controller<00:05:37.110> and

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
properties of the domain controller and

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.010 
properties of the domain controller and
there's<00:05:39.270> only<00:05:39.420> one<00:05:39.690> domain<00:05:39.870> controller

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
there's only one domain controller

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.010 
there's only one domain controller
showing<00:05:40.910> but<00:05:41.910> if<00:05:41.970> I<00:05:42.060> right<00:05:42.300> click<00:05:42.330> and<00:05:43.040> refresh

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
showing but if I right click and refresh

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.420 
showing but if I right click and refresh
there<00:05:46.020> should<00:05:46.230> be<00:05:46.260> two<00:05:46.590> domain<00:05:47.010> controllers

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
there should be two domain controllers

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.010 
there should be two domain controllers
so<00:05:47.640> let<00:05:47.730> me<00:05:47.820> go<00:05:47.910> to<00:05:48.000> the<00:05:48.090> properties<00:05:48.540> of<00:05:48.750> this

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
so let me go to the properties of this

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.480 
so let me go to the properties of this
other<00:05:49.440> domain<00:05:49.680> controller<00:05:50.570> and<00:05:52.490> the

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
other domain controller and the

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.370 
other domain controller and the
properties<00:05:54.060> of<00:05:54.090> the<00:05:54.390> two<00:05:54.570> domain<00:05:54.930> controllers

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
properties of the two domain controllers

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.400 
properties of the two domain controllers
are<00:05:55.590> similar<00:05:56.070> except<00:05:56.460> for<00:05:56.490> this<00:05:56.730> one<00:05:56.790> tab

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
are similar except for this one tab

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.200 
are similar except for this one tab
password<00:05:58.410> replication<00:05:58.980> policy<00:05:59.100> so<00:05:59.970> here's

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
password replication policy so here's

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.170 
password replication policy so here's

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
where I add the permissions or deny

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.260 
where I add the permissions or deny
permissions<00:06:03.690> for<00:06:04.680> users<00:06:05.220> to<00:06:05.730> cache<00:06:05.970> their

you can't really write to it and add
