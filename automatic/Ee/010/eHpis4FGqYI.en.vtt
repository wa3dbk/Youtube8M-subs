00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.780
 loe 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.360
 In b 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.390
 a situation as serious as this one to the ground having many causes one 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.480
 immediate in the financial markets 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.480
 acid very low interest rates at the beginning of this decade 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.419
 ii excessive indebtedness in the first place by entities 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.040
 financiers who are not suffering right now but also from the point of 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.550
 view of the companies 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.010
 that has caused the abundant and cheap financing to be considered 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.820
 has enjoyed for many years 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.820
 it was a situation that will last forever 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.990
 the long-term assets assets the voice the immobilized the 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.170
 fixed assets 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.330
 they are relatively easier to manage 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.560
 both in crisis and out of crisis 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.510
 because the commitment of funds that will be made 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.670
 she is already committed to be worth the redundancy of some 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.890
 time is done or not done and there is little else to do in cam in the 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.350
 circulating there you can do many things 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.909
 I think that some more important issues are early detection and anticipation 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.930
 of the financial problems of starting to understand 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.870
 when and how the crisis is affecting us in the current currency 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.190
 what is happening with 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.520
 with our clients what is happening with the suppliers as we have to 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.910
 manage the state 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.090
 Stocs or company i in liquidity 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.080
 a very important element of d of the crisis in which we live is percent and 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.290
 to be able to monitor our customers and suppliers 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.290
 in being aware of the financial health of some and others 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.570
 earnings account ps has to manage in ben an increase was 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.650
 how are you attending to the box that they generate 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.939
 I believe that now more than ever the st you really know that one said 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.009
 mike that maybe it was repeated a lot and sometimes without meaning that almost 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.909
 corner 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:13.739
 and it is that I believe that now it follows we have to keep in mind that it was to treasure 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:14.559
 liquidity 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:18.989
 In the company, it can be vital for subsistence. 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.040
 financial entities actually 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.550
 financial entities have access to liquidity through the line of the 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.540
 central banks 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.210
 and yet are not willing to lend money or are less willing 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.610
 that in other times I think that companies also have to manage 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.749
 taking into account the liquidity that as I said is vital 

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:40.299
 but here and another element that is important also to recognize that 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:41.789
 the crises also 

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:44.169
 has a limited duration in time 

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:48.559
 nelly is this situation of economic depression will end 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:52.589
 by 100 later or earlier there we have to be aware also of 

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:54.599
 that we have to protect the business 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.499
 we have to have a competitive position enough for when 

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:01.499
 cycle change 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.129
 in many financial strategies that you have to take into account in one of 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.459
 they have to do with indebtedness 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.719
 percent and I believe that there is also another word that is repeated today 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.139
 much in chili bichi 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.779
 or the debt relief, so to speak 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:20.079
 I believe that we will not see the levels of indebtedness that we had 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.029
 recently 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:24.809
 until very recently iii I think that this is a permanent situation during 

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:28.839
 enough time in it we have to get used to working with much less 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:32.540
 debt and also in the short term with a debt that will be 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.209
 per cent va stanted unstable 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.849
 in the compaÃ±eras the financial to the financial entities are 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.079
 suffering also 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.829
 in case this funding crisis 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.269
 When it is solved that it is solved it will also take some time until 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.939
 can recompose their operating systems so that until we have 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:54.260
 a bank what we can trust as a provider to trust us as 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:57.999
 financing providers spend some time I think that that is a one 

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:02.599
 of the elements that keep in mind that we are going to work with less debt 

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:06.529
 another thing that we have to take into account on the revenue side 

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:12.479
 p is that the financial situation is going to last some time we know that in 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:13.579
 2009 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:17.380
 in most of the world will have negative growth reduction of 

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:22.289
 Many countries will also pass in 2010, so we have to prepare 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.729
 for for two years and maybe more 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.379
 what that favorable andes therefore 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:32.020
 we have to assess the costs, I think that's what that is something very 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.319
 important indeed to show the costs there as far as we can 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:40.119
 merchants trying to protect business and also be very cautious in 

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:43.150
 which in financial investments we have to 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.400
 also adapt the investment plan 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.800
 to a period of lower economic activity
