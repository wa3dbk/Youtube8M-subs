stationary for a good long time the way
it<00:03:36.770> is<00:03:36.980> spinning<00:03:37.930> shows<00:03:38.930> that<00:03:39.110> it's<00:03:39.260> not<00:03:39.440> it's

not actually wobbling around on the

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.340 
not actually wobbling around on the
counter<00:03:41.600> it's<00:03:41.810> actually<00:03:42.170> it<00:03:42.320> actually

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
counter it's actually it actually

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.980 
counter it's actually it actually
rotates<00:03:43.130> and<00:03:43.430> then<00:03:43.940> move<00:03:44.209> was<00:03:44.450> like<00:03:44.570> almost<00:03:44.870> as

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
rotates and then move was like almost as

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.680 
rotates and then move was like almost as
if<00:03:45.110> somebody<00:03:45.470> moved<00:03:46.160> at<00:03:46.310> now<00:03:46.490> also<00:03:47.030> there's<00:03:47.450> no

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
if somebody moved at now also there's no

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.120 
if somebody moved at now also there's no
Breeze<00:03:47.930> in<00:03:47.959> there<00:03:48.410> there's<00:03:48.590> no<00:03:48.650> wind<00:03:49.010> that

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
Breeze in there there's no wind that

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.680 
Breeze in there there's no wind that
could<00:03:49.250> have<00:03:49.340> pushed<00:03:49.520> it<00:03:49.760> it<00:03:50.300> was<00:03:50.420> it<00:03:50.570> was<00:03:50.660> a

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
could have pushed it it was it was a

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.310 
could have pushed it it was it was a
dead<00:03:51.110> still<00:03:51.470> night<00:03:51.709> and<00:03:52.250> it<00:03:52.930> appears<00:03:53.930> to<00:03:54.290> me

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
dead still night and it appears to me

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.830 
dead still night and it appears to me
that<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:55.070> ball<00:03:55.459> was<00:03:55.670> actually<00:03:56.060> manipulated

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
that the ball was actually manipulated

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.020 
that the ball was actually manipulated
and<00:03:57.050> just<00:03:57.500> kind<00:03:57.680> of<00:03:57.739> pushed<00:03:57.950> away<00:03:58.100> is<00:03:58.700> what<00:03:58.970> it

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
and just kind of pushed away is what it

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.190 
and just kind of pushed away is what it
looks<00:03:59.209> like<00:03:59.330> but<00:03:59.450> there's<00:03:59.600> a<00:03:59.660> marking<00:03:59.989> on<00:04:00.080> the

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
looks like but there's a marking on the

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.229 
looks like but there's a marking on the
ball<00:04:00.410> that<00:04:00.950> actually<00:04:01.370> demonstrates<00:04:01.940> it

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
ball that actually demonstrates it

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.900 
ball that actually demonstrates it
actually<00:04:02.720> rotated<00:04:03.470> around<00:04:03.770> first<00:04:04.160> and<00:04:04.400> then

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
actually rotated around first and then

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.660 
actually rotated around first and then
move<00:04:05.150> which<00:04:05.450> is<00:04:05.780> absolutely<00:04:06.440> phenomenal<00:04:06.670> this

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
move which is absolutely phenomenal this

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.040 
move which is absolutely phenomenal this
video<00:04:07.970> that<00:04:08.150> I'm<00:04:08.239> watching<00:04:08.630> is<00:04:08.720> something

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
video that I'm watching is something

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.479 
video that I'm watching is something
I've<00:04:09.170> never<00:04:09.350> seen<00:04:09.620> before<00:04:09.800> and<00:04:10.070> I'm<00:04:10.190> such<00:04:10.459> a

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
I've never seen before and I'm such a

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.729 
I've never seen before and I'm such a
skeptic<00:04:10.850> so<00:04:11.630> when<00:04:11.840> watching<00:04:12.080> it<00:04:12.350> I<00:04:12.500> keep

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
skeptic so when watching it I keep

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.530 
skeptic so when watching it I keep
trying<00:04:13.010> to<00:04:13.040> think<00:04:13.130> it<00:04:13.640> has<00:04:13.880> to<00:04:14.060> be<00:04:14.090> something

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
trying to think it has to be something

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.560 
trying to think it has to be something
moving<00:04:14.750> that<00:04:14.989> ball<00:04:15.910> but<00:04:16.910> what<00:04:17.120> I<00:04:17.150> do<00:04:17.269> know<00:04:17.540> is

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
moving that ball but what I do know is

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.050 
moving that ball but what I do know is
that<00:04:17.840> I'm<00:04:18.200> watching<00:04:18.890> this<00:04:19.130> video<00:04:19.430> and<00:04:19.700> I<00:04:20.000> know

we're watching this and it doesn't make

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:32.439 
we're watching this and it doesn't make
sense<00:04:30.680> and<00:04:30.889> so<00:04:31.400> like<00:04:31.550> I<00:04:31.669> said<00:04:31.729> we're<00:04:32.090> outside

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
sense and so like I said we're outside

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:34.270 
sense and so like I said we're outside
with<00:04:32.569> the<00:04:32.629> two-way<00:04:32.810> radios<00:04:33.259> and<00:04:33.530> I<00:04:34.009> cannot

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
with the two-way radios and I cannot

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.589 
with the two-way radios and I cannot
figure<00:04:34.520> out<00:04:34.699> because<00:04:34.879> I<00:04:35.030> keep<00:04:35.150> staring

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:35.599 
figure out because I keep staring

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:37.420 
figure out because I keep staring
watching<00:04:35.900> this<00:04:35.990> ball<00:04:36.199> move<00:04:36.530> and<00:04:36.889> it's<00:04:37.279> like

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
watching this ball move and it's like

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.189 
watching this ball move and it's like
something<00:04:37.819> is<00:04:37.939> holding<00:04:38.120> it<00:04:38.449> and<00:04:38.599> turning<00:04:39.080> it

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
something is holding it and turning it

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.999 
something is holding it and turning it
and<00:04:39.860> then<00:04:40.069> it<00:04:40.159> just<00:04:40.310> rocks<00:04:40.520> back<00:04:40.759> and<00:04:40.789> forth

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
and then it just rocks back and forth

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.050 
and then it just rocks back and forth
we've<00:04:43.009> done<00:04:43.159> a<00:04:43.189> lot<00:04:43.340> of<00:04:43.370> experiments<00:04:43.909> in<00:04:43.999> the

simultaneously
we<00:05:00.469> had<00:05:00.560> no<00:05:00.800> idea<00:05:00.830> we<00:05:01.400> would<00:05:01.520> capture

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 
we had no idea we would capture

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.610 
we had no idea we would capture
something<00:05:02.330> else<00:05:02.479> when<00:05:03.199> we<00:05:03.289> shot<00:05:03.500> at<00:05:03.590> the

something else when we shot at the
cabinets<00:05:04.069> and<00:05:04.250> that<00:05:04.610> was<00:05:04.729> this<00:05:04.879> ball<00:05:05.150> moving<00:05:05.569> I

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
cabinets and that was this ball moving I

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.200 
cabinets and that was this ball moving I
had<00:05:06.469> to<00:05:06.560> watch<00:05:06.740> it<00:05:06.770> hundred<00:05:07.370> times<00:05:07.400> was

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
had to watch it hundred times was

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.740 
had to watch it hundred times was
strange<00:05:08.509> it<00:05:08.719> didn't<00:05:09.229> roll<00:05:10.129> it's<00:05:11.000> sort<00:05:11.240> of<00:05:11.300> spun

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
strange it didn't roll it's sort of spun

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.219 
strange it didn't roll it's sort of spun
and<00:05:12.199> then<00:05:12.770> moved<00:05:13.039> so<00:05:13.610> it<00:05:13.639> was<00:05:13.759> very<00:05:13.939> odd<00:05:14.229> very

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
and then moved so it was very odd very

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.670 
and then moved so it was very odd very
interesting<00:05:15.650> to<00:05:15.740> see<00:05:16.330> we<00:05:17.330> knew<00:05:17.479> we<00:05:17.629> had<00:05:17.680> caught

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
interesting to see we knew we had caught

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.399 
interesting to see we knew we had caught
something<00:05:19.189> moving<00:05:20.000> in<00:05:20.389> the<00:05:20.569> kitchen<00:05:20.870> when<00:05:21.289> we
