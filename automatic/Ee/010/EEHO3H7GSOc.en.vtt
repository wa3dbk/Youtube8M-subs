00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.300
 where we bought it came out 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.130
 only from today google nexus and 7 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.430
 for those who do not know it, practice a tablet 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.880
 7 inch with HD screen and boasts a 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.940
 nvidia tegra 3 quad core processor 1 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.649
 gigahertz i and ii so let's proceed with 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.079
 the unboxing let's have a look at the 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.329
 box back and forth on the side we have 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.850
 nexus 7 is the producer and asus 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.129
 then a nexus product then supported 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.620
 from google and android updates 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.120
 and screen first for nexus products a 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.320
 me on the bed of the box we see beautiful 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.960
 google play logo for google play is 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.969
 practically the fact that he really can 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.580
 interact with google services 15 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.070
 chrome pre installed google plus is 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.240
 also youtube 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.240
 so we have the package 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.030
 inside the package we find the 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.810
 Tablet 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:26.080
 obviously properly packaged 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.430
 and we see it back and forth we can 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.900
 see here is also an indication 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.900
 of the word nfc 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:40.740
 and then there is the written nexus and then it 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:48.700
 let's see then the tablet 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:54.340
 then there is this box with 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:58.020
 inside the usb cable a couple of 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:03.640
 quick guide manuals practically at 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:13.500
 to the tablet and then to the last cup andros 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:16.120
 if we open it we find the loader 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.360
 practically so that with the attack 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.400
 usb comes connected to the current 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.140
 marked asus we can also see from 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.140
 close here it is 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.670
 ok now this in cellophane i call the 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.110
 tablet and proceed with the first start o 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.270
 that we applied the film 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.620
 let's get protective first let's start 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.890
 take a look at this for the tablet without 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.200
 fairly simple protection 7 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.550
 inches we can see behind 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:50.709
 therefore, practically at the cash desk 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:52.510
 on the lower side to the chop nexus the keys 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.090
 Physicists we have are where this 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.090
 Power button control 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.200
 volume and then below we have the connector 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.870
 for 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.870
 mini usb and headphone jack 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.459
 then on the side here we have four 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.470
 connectors that should be used for 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.040
 any accessories such as bases 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.060
 and doc 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:20.739
 to what we currently know after 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.739
 that we turn on the tablet 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.740
 we see the first start with a nice logo of 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.740
 nec of google nexus 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:54.780
 let's start select the language 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:59.370
 Italian then the wifi network we need 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.600
 authorize we do it for a moment then 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.830
 choose if we have an account of 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.870
 Google 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.560
 select we have inserted mine 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.240
 credentials ok now managers yes 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.770
 colleague and therefore should practically 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.230
 put all the settings that 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.079
 we have on our google account not 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.970
 instead we don't put a credit card 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:22.620
 we set the backup and also the 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:27.450
 restore practically allow the 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.830
 location and we're done 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.230
 we see that the interface opens 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.680
 jelly bean primary took fish 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.680
 from the first information 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.880
 we see that this interface penn 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.650
 primary we have on jelly beans e 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.990
 this is the pure google roma so 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.800
 practically we see that we have 5 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.169
 desktop 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.630
 then starting from the central one here 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:55.340
 there is information on the books for 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:58.290
 example we see pirandello verga 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.510
 recommended apps on google play 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.400
 and recommended applications for what 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.390
 concerns in this case ok advertising 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.000
 of the 119 below we have the main menu 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.980
 that with itself 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.160
 consisting of seven applications such as 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.720
 we can see a collection made by 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.430
 google applications 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.020
 this is a folder he tells us 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:23.220
 organized applications in folders 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:26.340
 here we have various including the services of 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.840
 google plus the gallery the calendar e 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.830
 then we have as you said before 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.360
 google chrome installed by default 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.280
 and then there's the welcome applications 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:40.140
 which is always in style of course 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:41.640
 google the Rome cure and then there are all 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.890
 the various widgets we can put on 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.020
 desktop 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:49.260
 we also have voice search then 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.410
 google noun absent vowel that time 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.410
 does 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.100
 let's try again that time ago 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.300
 the classic woman we do and see 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.990
 which charges us as we have also seen 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.790
 previously the appropriate form 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.830
 interactive so this is the case 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.840
 marano and there are 22 degrees we have the 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.550
 weather from today to Thursday until 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.690
 week so we can also scroll 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.910
 even more until Saturday 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:23.650
 next with the adjoining temperatures 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:25.750
 minimum and maximum below we have three buttons 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.960
 not physical but touch therefore hangs 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.220
 a main button to return 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.380
 at least before the main screen 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.630
 the back button and the button that tells us 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.950
 how many applications are open taking 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.660
 with the central button we saw 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.130
 which opens the google thing then 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.650
 we open we are also open so google 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.970
 map 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.800
 and oh well for the moment there won't be 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.230
 100 already installed no detail 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.730
 application only the default ones 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.860
 what we have seen are the essential ones 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.390
 among which we can also note google 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:58.150
 music that in Italy 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:59.710
 actually there is no see a little 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.210
 keep on tablet information e 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.540
 we see that the version actually 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:10.720
 android 4.1 with the kernel of course 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:13.210
 normal then gave us a backup on 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:18.880
 and so a pop up on the battery is 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:22.090
 we open for the moment I would say that before 

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:24.150
 he sees everything and soon we will see one 

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:26.080
 review of this tablet that 

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.880
 too performant too 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.160
 considering the low cost it has 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.680
 or only 250 euros 

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.510
 but making a quick rapid 

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.180
 comparison we can say that it is even more 

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:39.340
 powerful of a modest ipad or what 

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.590
 can be a samsung tablet from 

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:44.890
 costs while 500 to 600 euros 

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:47.170
 this is a nvidia tegra 3 of 1.3 g 

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:49.330
 that of quad core frequency plus a core 

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:51.100
 still additional for simple calculations 

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.450
 and as many as 12 runs for the management of the 

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.740
 graphics then a tablet also has 

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:58.720
 brought for what may be the 

00:07:53.740 --> 00:08:03.330
 perfect gaming said this a greeting a 

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.330
 all and see you at the next video
