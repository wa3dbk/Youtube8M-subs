first begin no matter what game it is

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.820 
first begin no matter what game it is
how<00:00:25.770> far<00:00:26.070> behind<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.580> am<00:00:26.609> or<00:00:27.320> it<00:00:28.320> doesn't<00:00:28.529> matter

what<00:00:29.189> was<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.670> line<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:30.180> always<00:00:31.109> believed

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
what was on the line I always believed

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.920 
what was on the line I always believed
that<00:00:31.769> at<00:00:32.220> the<00:00:32.340> end<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.640> game<00:00:32.669> it's<00:00:33.570> always

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
that at the end the game it's always

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.220 
that at the end the game it's always
either<00:00:34.970> my<00:00:35.970> fault<00:00:36.239> or<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.809> can<00:00:37.080> do<00:00:37.199> something

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
either my fault or I can do something

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.860 
either my fault or I can do something
better<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.040> improve<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.610> game<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.059> never<00:00:39.390> try

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
better to improve this game I never try

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.619 
better to improve this game I never try
to<00:00:39.900> blame<00:00:40.230> somebody<00:00:40.830> else<00:00:41.100> or<00:00:41.580> I<00:00:42.030> never<00:00:42.120> tried

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
to blame somebody else or I never tried

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.810 
to blame somebody else or I never tried
to<00:00:42.870> say<00:00:43.620> someone<00:00:44.070> else's<00:00:44.309> fault<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:44.610> that's

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
to say someone else's fault so that's

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.850 
to say someone else's fault so that's
the<00:00:44.969> only<00:00:45.120> reason<00:00:45.300> why<00:00:45.690> we<00:00:45.870> lost<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.410> that

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
the only reason why we lost and that

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.990 
the only reason why we lost and that
makes<00:00:47.790> it<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.270> no<00:00:49.020> matter<00:00:49.670> what<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.850> do

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
makes it so that no matter what you do

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.729

better is quite key to making sure that
the<00:01:17.910> next<00:01:18.090> game<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.420> won't<00:01:18.660> be<00:01:18.840> doing<00:01:19.200> the

the next game you won't be doing the

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:22.100 
the next game you won't be doing the
same<00:01:19.500> mistakes<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.220> think<00:01:20.970> if<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.720> don't<00:01:21.899> look

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
same mistakes I think if you don't look

could improve on you're not really
growing<00:01:26.190> you're<00:01:26.550> just<00:01:26.840> improving<00:01:27.840> your

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
growing you're just improving your

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.779 
growing you're just improving your
muscle<00:01:28.560> memory<00:01:28.679> which<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.009> still<00:01:29.310> pretty<00:01:29.490> good

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
muscle memory which is still pretty good

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.440 
muscle memory which is still pretty good
but<00:01:30.030> it's<00:01:30.840> much<00:01:31.080> better<00:01:31.349> and<00:01:31.800> it<00:01:32.459> will<00:01:32.550> help

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
but it's much better and it will help

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.839
