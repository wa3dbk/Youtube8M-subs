 I use sweet cherries but also sour 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.699
 Perfect to go first 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.210
 we in a bowl the sea that 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.140
 cocoa powder and the baking powder and 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.790
 then add everything afterwards 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.320
 thoroughly into each other 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.540
 bowl we pour to the liquid 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.670
 butter the sugar give a pinch of salt 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.740
 and then mix with the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.689
 whisk flight now everything to one 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.490
 bright creamy mass and here is one 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.359
 little patience asked for the whole 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.499
 takes about eight to ten minutes 

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:24.689
 then we go one after the other 

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:26.179
 Add both eggs and stir well 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.950
 on 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:31.289
 then we give in portions and 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.289
 alternately from the mixture and the 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:36.780
 Milk to stir but constantly on 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:38.759
 until we spread several milk so on 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.859
 about three portions completely 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.210
 have stirred in and we have a homogeneous 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:46.740
 received dark dough 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.960
 a springform will be on the sides 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.450
 slightly greased undersurface baking paper 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.450
 laid out on it we give the dough 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.010
 paint them something smoothly push the 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.600
 briefly form the work surface 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.090
 or shake something back and forth 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.950
 so that the file is distributed evenly 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.500
 and then put the mold in the oven 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:11.000
 and there will be in the lower third of the 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.720
 dough at 180 degrees air circulation 160 degrees for 25 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.730
 to 30 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.190
 baked just makes it to the end 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.720
 the chopsticks sample ready baked 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.480
 Let's leave them on a wire rack 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.150
 then cool it off from the 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.450
 form and it is quite easy to pull that 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:30.740
 Baking paper and give it to a 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.200
 cake plate and now the baked 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.209
 erosion of soil is best 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.640
 that with a big spoon that's what you 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.620
 Replacement gives in a bowl load thereby 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.470
 a border of about two centimeters 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.000
 stand and pay attention to the hollow too 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.160
 the fact that he come not too deep 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.570
 not that there is a hole in the ground so 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.890
 be a little careful 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.160
 but you do not have to be too timid 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:55.370
 Then she is done and sees 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.000
 about the whole crumbles with the 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.380
 hands 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.850
 the selected pie biggest the 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.560
 washed halved and the 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.250
 rising cherries are still partly 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.989
 cut through 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.630
 Then we beat the cream stiff that 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.160
 are trickling in the vanilla sugar 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.070
 and then one or two packets 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.709
 eaten by salehs butter cake 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.600
 1 off is still a little stand or 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:24.709
 has to be transported then there are two 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.150
 better to go to the stiff whipped cream 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.470
 We now cut those in churches and 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.470
 cancel these 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.930
 and with this mixture we fill now 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.730
 the hollowed out we have the 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.550
 full page already distributed thereon 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.080
 we have to shape the dome-shaped and 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.450
 with such a palette knife that works 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.240
 excellent but also cake server or 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.680
 a larger knife is suitable for it 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.100
 and letting on the bridges left 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.880
 ran 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.250
 one with a little cream and everything is what 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.620
 only to be done is often the sample 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.410
 shaped saale mass that crumbled 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:04.340
 distribute cake dough evenly around 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.390
 around always up to squeeze it too 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.450
 the down turned 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.220
 crumbs with process at the end 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.740
 everything is a bit clean around 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.470
 and then we'll put them up 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.330
 to serve cold where the name of the 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.640
 Cake stand opens up, I think 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.989
 decorated by yourself at the sight 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.160
 maybe still with her around 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.320
 some fresh cherries 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.720
 I mean the cake is made by one 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.700
 original shape also visually something 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.920
 it tastes fresh and very delicious 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.990
 I wish you a lot of fun with the 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.880
 preparation and a pretty good one 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.410
 appetite 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.630
 and if you have the recipe again 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.820

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.890
 other channels would like to have then 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.770

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.720
 at our church and if not yet 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.390
 Of course I am very happy 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:54.610
