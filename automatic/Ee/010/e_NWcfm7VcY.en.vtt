00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580
 the reporter henrique jÃºlio went to 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.230
 Columbus to show a skateboard 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.560
 the first concrete bow of the 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.560
 parana 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.960
 the practice of skateboarding in swimming pools 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.950
 emerged in the United States in the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.710
 70 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.080
 Since then, the sport has evolved and today 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.390
 there is even a mega ramp 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.940
 despite this the practice of walking in 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.920
 pools are still very much appreciated 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.620
 by the practitioners of the sport 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.110
 but here in Brazil here is a problem and 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.930
 there were not many options for this 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.390
 mode known as mouth now 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.790
 at least for the curitibanos the 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.159
 problem ended up with a group of friends 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.070
 built a track in the shape of y in 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:52.290
 in the metropolitan region more than 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.170
 three meters deep 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.409
 the colombo is considered a masterpiece 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.600
 by practitioners clearly characterizes 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:03.720
 California pool that as well as the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.519
 drawing is also because it is round the 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.890
 people out here are round 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.560
 these petistas who came from sao paulo 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.630
 was amazed by the clue 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.760
 The track level is impressive. 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.190
 here in Brazil so most 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.790
 tracks of a whole world very poorly made 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.780
 by the government, this is what focuses the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.479
 investment exceeded one hundred thousand reais 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.000
 one of the differentials are the edges and 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.150
 were developed in curitiba 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.130
 copy in blocks as they are called 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:38.020
 facilitate maneuvers in question that 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.310
 practitioners and even taller 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.770
 as nobody produces here in Brazil 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.390
 People ended up doing her skateboarding help. 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.040
 stay on the track with several 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.940
 aerial maneuvers and children going to 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.540
 inside the track 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.580
 if it does not end, either the person 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.860
 ends up falling on top of everything on the edge right 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.740
 and the new boa de colombo is already 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.560
 revealing new talent in the case of 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:06.590
 15 years with one of the future promises of 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:08.269
 Every paranaense skateboard has a 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.300
 different logic that you can give 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:13.700
 run from Friday to Sunday and the 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.830
 cost for who wants to take a spin is 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.860
 15 reais per day 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:22.690
 but even those who do not play the sport 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.690
 it's worth concluding the note 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.660
 this kind of sport that I love but I 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.860
 I can not stand, I said. 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.860
 same very cool thing
