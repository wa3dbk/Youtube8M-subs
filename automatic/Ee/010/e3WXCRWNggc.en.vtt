00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
video rather than purple which is kind

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.499 
video rather than purple which is kind
of<00:01:45.240> blowing<00:01:45.720> my<00:01:45.840> mind<00:01:46.079> here<00:01:46.409> but<00:01:47.100> anyway<00:01:47.700> maybe

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
of blowing my mind here but anyway maybe

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.999 
of blowing my mind here but anyway maybe
on<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.840> next<00:01:49.079> video<00:01:49.350> I'll<00:01:49.560> be<00:01:49.619> able<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.829> figure

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
on the next video I'll be able to figure

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.800 
on the next video I'll be able to figure
out<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> setting<00:01:50.700> or<00:01:50.820> something<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.390> camera

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
out a setting or something on the camera

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.800 
out a setting or something on the camera
that<00:01:51.840> changes<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.950> but<00:01:53.640> anyway<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.420> trailer

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
that changes that but anyway the trailer

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.510 
that changes that but anyway the trailer
turned<00:01:55.049> out<00:01:55.229> beautiful

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.840 
really happy with it everything turned
out<00:02:04.680> beautiful<00:02:06.409> anyhow<00:02:08.660> as<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.840> can<00:02:09.989> see

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.270 

back<00:02:13.850> it's<00:02:14.840> kind<00:02:15.110> of<00:02:15.170> a<00:02:15.230> protective<00:02:15.740> area<00:02:15.920> here

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
back it's kind of a protective area here

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.210 
back it's kind of a protective area here
for<00:02:16.820> the<00:02:16.970> rudder<00:02:17.500> so<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.590> doesn't<00:02:18.830> bottom<00:02:18.980> out

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
for the rudder so it doesn't bottom out

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:29.740
