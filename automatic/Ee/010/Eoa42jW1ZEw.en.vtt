coincidentally<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.500> interesting<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.159> note

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
coincidentally it is interesting to note

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.830 
coincidentally it is interesting to note
that<00:01:14.400> he<00:01:14.610> traveled<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.030> New<00:01:15.240> York<00:01:15.479> City<00:01:15.540> and

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
that he traveled to New York City and

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.469 
that he traveled to New York City and
got<00:01:16.080> inspiration<00:01:16.439> for<00:01:16.920> black<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.189> white<00:01:17.610> so

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
got inspiration for black and white so

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.700 
got inspiration for black and white so
it<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.630> very<00:01:18.750> likely<00:01:19.020> he<00:01:19.259> did<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> same<00:01:19.650> thing

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710

like to discuss the future of the series
after<00:01:44.910> this<00:01:45.150> the<00:01:45.780> names<00:01:45.960> x<00:01:46.260> and<00:01:46.440> y<00:01:46.530> are<00:01:46.560> really

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
after this the names x and y are really

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.070 
after this the names x and y are really
interesting<00:01:47.640> they're<00:01:48.360> similar<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
interesting they're similar to the

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.410 
interesting they're similar to the
coordinate<00:01:49.470> plane<00:01:49.500> aka<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.760> two<00:01:50.910> dimensions

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
coordinate plane aka the two dimensions

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.190 
coordinate plane aka the two dimensions
x<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.960> y<00:01:52.110> but<00:01:52.830> you<00:01:52.920> probably<00:01:53.130> saw<00:01:53.400> in<00:01:53.550> geometry

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
x and y but you probably saw in geometry

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.380 
x and y but you probably saw in geometry
these<00:01:55.200> games<00:01:55.380> are<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.620> the<00:01:55.770> 3ds<00:01:56.360> meaning<00:01:57.360> that

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
these games are on the 3ds meaning that

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.710 
these games are on the 3ds meaning that
the<00:01:57.600> 3ds<00:01:57.900> has<00:01:58.260> a<00:01:58.290> third<00:01:58.650> dimension<00:01:59.220> depth

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
the 3ds has a third dimension depth

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.990 
the 3ds has a third dimension depth
known<00:02:00.720> as<00:02:00.900> z<00:02:01.250> making<00:02:02.250> pokemon<00:02:02.700> see<00:02:02.970> a

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
known as z making pokemon see a

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.109 
known as z making pokemon see a
possibility<00:02:03.920> however<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.280> japanese<00:02:05.760> logos

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
possibility however the japanese logos

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.330 
possibility however the japanese logos
point<00:02:06.390> out<00:02:06.479> another<00:02:06.600> possibility<00:02:07.340> these

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
point out another possibility these

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.740 
point out another possibility these
little<00:02:08.490> things<00:02:08.640> look<00:02:09.060> like<00:02:09.090> double<00:02:09.570> alpha

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
little things look like double alpha

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.820 
little things look like double alpha
helixes<00:02:10.410> AKA<00:02:10.950> DNA<00:02:11.810> strands<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:13.530> it's<00:02:13.680> also

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
helixes AKA DNA strands so it's also

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.260 
helixes AKA DNA strands so it's also
very<00:02:14.070> possible<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.580> there<00:02:14.820> could<00:02:14.850> be<00:02:14.970> two

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
very possible that there could be two

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.000 
very possible that there could be two
sequels<00:02:15.690> named<00:02:16.020> after<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.380> male<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.709> female

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
sequels named after the male and female

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.080 
sequels named after the male and female
chromosome<00:02:17.550> X<00:02:17.880> Y<00:02:18.239> and<00:02:18.480> X<00:02:18.690> X<00:02:19.940> well<00:02:20.940> this<00:02:21.060> is

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
chromosome X Y and X X well this is

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.240 
chromosome X Y and X X well this is
basically<00:02:21.480> all<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:21.720> have<00:02:21.989> right<00:02:22.020> now<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.680> i<00:02:23.040> may

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
basically all I have right now and i may

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.250 
basically all I have right now and i may
post<00:02:23.430> more<00:02:23.700> z's<00:02:23.910> games<00:02:24.150> develop<00:02:24.600> so<00:02:24.900> stay

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
post more z's games develop so stay

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.590 
post more z's games develop so stay
tuned
