first what we're going to do is we're
going<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.150> take<00:00:27.360> a<00:00:27.570> dry<00:00:27.900> piece<00:00:28.110> of<00:00:28.289> wood<00:00:28.470> drill

a hole and what's going to be the top

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.619 
a hole and what's going to be the top

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
side of the closed nine o'clock would be

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:35.660 
side of the closed nine o'clock would be
closed<00:00:33.960> as<00:00:34.230> well<00:00:34.260> order<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.220> that<00:00:35.250> we<00:00:35.400> can

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
closed as well order so that we can

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.450 
closed as well order so that we can
begin<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:36.360> turn<00:00:36.540> our<00:00:37.340> before<00:00:38.340> we

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
begin to turn our before we

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.460 
begin to turn our before we
turn<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.820> cannon<00:00:39.210> again<00:00:39.720> I<00:00:39.840> need<00:00:39.900> to<00:00:39.989> get<00:00:40.199> set

turn the cannon again I need to get set

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.439 
turn the cannon again I need to get set
which<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.949> a<00:00:40.980> shearing<00:00:41.340> cut<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.879> just

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
which is a shearing cut and just

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.299 
which is a shearing cut and just
continue<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.110> curve<00:00:43.320> up<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.769> then<00:00:43.920> stop

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
continue the curve up and then stop

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.330 
continue the curve up and then stop
leaving<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.940> shoulder<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:46.170> ball<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.620> make

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
leaving a shoulder the ball and make

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.070 
leaving a shoulder the ball and make
cuts<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.850> go<00:00:47.910> from<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.300> top<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.900> ball

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
cuts that go from the top of the ball

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:58.369 
cuts that go from the top of the ball
down<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.589> the<00:00:49.830> bottom<00:00:56.900> and<00:00:57.900> this<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.049> always

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
down to the bottom and this is always

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.590 
down to the bottom and this is always
fun<00:00:58.559> because<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.280> finally<00:00:59.519> allows<00:00:59.879> us<00:00:59.909> to<00:01:00.420> see

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
fun because it finally allows us to see

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.210 
fun because it finally allows us to see
what<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.900> wood<00:01:01.080> is<00:01:01.199> going<00:01:01.409> to<00:01:01.530> look<00:01:01.680> like<00:01:01.860> I've

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
what the wood is going to look like I've

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.130 
what the wood is going to look like I've
replaced<00:01:02.610> the<00:01:02.760> smaller<00:01:03.119> jaws<00:01:03.449> in<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.839> Chuck

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
replaced the smaller jaws in this Chuck

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.350 
replaced the smaller jaws in this Chuck
with<00:01:04.440> these<00:01:04.619> large<00:01:04.949> jaws<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.210> the

with these large jaws that have the
cushions<00:01:06.780> buttons<00:01:07.970> we're<00:01:08.970> going<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.299> have<00:01:09.420> to

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
cushions buttons we're going to have to

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.420 
cushions buttons we're going to have to
stand<00:01:09.750> up<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.049> little<00:01:10.320> way<00:01:10.440> is<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.070> part<00:01:11.340> that

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
stand up a little way is the part that

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.910 
stand up a little way is the part that
has<00:01:11.580> been<00:01:11.880> found<00:01:12.180> at<00:01:12.330> night<00:01:12.510> before<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.799> now

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
has been found at night before and now

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.320 
has been found at night before and now
we<00:01:13.979> get<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.310> put<00:01:14.430> some<00:01:14.610> finish<00:01:14.909> on<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.210> bottom

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
we get to put some finish on the bottom

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.080 
we get to put some finish on the bottom
side<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.990> ball<00:01:16.200> again<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.830> see<00:01:17.760> what<00:01:17.970> it's

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
side of the ball again and see what it's

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.190 
side of the ball again and see what it's
really<00:01:18.270> going<00:01:18.510> to<00:01:18.600> look<00:01:18.810> like<00:01:18.990> you're

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
really going to look like you're

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.160 
really going to look like you're
returning<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.310> ball<00:01:20.520> out<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.760> dry<00:01:21.090> stock

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.140 

some<00:01:26.170> of<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:26.410> advantages<00:01:27.040> of<00:01:27.310> making

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
some of the advantages of making

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.940 
some of the advantages of making
custom-made<00:01:28.660> handles<00:01:29.080> are<00:01:29.260> you<00:01:29.680> can<00:01:29.830> use

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
custom-made handles are you can use

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.530 
custom-made handles are you can use
different<00:01:30.160> colors<00:01:30.580> of<00:01:30.610> wood<00:01:30.940> so<00:01:31.210> that<00:01:31.330> you<00:01:31.420> can

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
different colors of wood so that you can

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.700 
different colors of wood so that you can
color-code<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:32.140> handles<00:01:32.500> for<00:01:32.680> easy

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
color-code the handles for easy

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.930 
color-code the handles for easy
identification

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
identification

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.600 
identification
you<00:01:34.510> can<00:01:34.690> make<00:01:34.870> sure<00:01:34.900> that<00:01:35.110> you<00:01:35.380> get<00:01:35.620> a<00:01:35.890> handle

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
you can make sure that you get a handle

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.970 
you can make sure that you get a handle
that<00:01:36.820> fits<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.360> tool<00:01:37.600> well<00:01:37.930> that<00:01:38.380> is<00:01:38.530> weighted

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 
that fits the tool well that is weighted

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.950 
that fits the tool well that is weighted
properly<00:01:39.160> you<00:01:40.060> can<00:01:40.180> make<00:01:40.210> sure<00:01:40.510> that<00:01:40.630> it<00:01:40.750> fits

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
properly you can make sure that it fits

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.170 
properly you can make sure that it fits
that<00:01:41.200> your<00:01:41.440> hand<00:01:41.740> in<00:01:42.310> the<00:01:42.490> right<00:01:42.640> place<00:01:42.910> is<00:01:43.120> the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
that your hand in the right place is the

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.700 
that your hand in the right place is the
way<00:01:43.300> you<00:01:43.360> like<00:01:43.540> you<00:01:43.720> so<00:01:43.870> it<00:01:43.990> feels<00:01:44.260> really<00:01:44.470> good

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
way you like you so it feels really good

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.380 
way you like you so it feels really good
and<00:01:45.010> functions<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.550> way<00:01:45.580> that<00:01:45.850> you<00:01:45.940> like<00:01:46.120> to

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
and functions the way that you like to

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.840 
and functions the way that you like to
calipers<00:01:46.990> and<00:01:47.290> pick<00:01:48.130> up<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.490> critical

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
calipers and pick up the critical

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.550 
calipers and pick up the critical
diameters<00:01:49.420> for<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.690> tool<00:01:49.900> handle<00:01:50.140> that<00:01:50.440> we're

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
diameters for the tool handle that we're

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.070 
diameters for the tool handle that we're
using<00:01:50.680> as<00:01:50.890> a<00:01:50.950> template<00:01:51.479> here<00:01:52.479> are<00:01:52.630> just<00:01:52.870> going

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
using as a template here are just going

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.020 
using as a template here are just going
to<00:01:53.229> establish<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:54.070> end<00:01:54.280> of<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.580> tool<00:01:54.760> handle

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
to establish the end of the tool handle

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.859 
to establish the end of the tool handle
and<00:01:55.720> also<00:01:56.229> where<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.590> ferrule<00:01:56.950> is<00:01:57.869> relatively

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
and also where the ferrule is relatively

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.380 
and also where the ferrule is relatively
quickly<00:01:59.290> but<00:02:00.070> also<00:02:00.220> leaves<00:02:00.580> a<00:02:00.729> nice<00:02:00.880> surface

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
quickly but also leaves a nice surface

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.690 
quickly but also leaves a nice surface
and<00:02:01.930> it's<00:02:02.229> really<00:02:02.560> a<00:02:02.590> nice<00:02:02.830> tool<00:02:03.130> for<00:02:03.160> making

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
and it's really a nice tool for making

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.820 
and it's really a nice tool for making
gradual<00:02:04.150> flowing<00:02:04.690> curves<00:02:04.960> like<00:02:05.320> we<00:02:05.500> have<00:02:05.650> on

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
gradual flowing curves like we have on

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.010 
gradual flowing curves like we have on
this<00:02:06.009> jewelry<00:02:06.640> to<00:02:07.030> do<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:07.630> final<00:02:07.840> shaping

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.440 

we'll<00:02:11.530> continue<00:02:11.740> here<00:02:12.370> with<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:12.580> 3/8<00:02:13.000> spindle

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
we'll continue here with a 3/8 spindle

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.180

you<00:04:44.519> get<00:04:44.669> from<00:04:44.879> a<00:04:44.939> chatter<00:04:45.179> to<00:04:45.449> probably<00:04:45.929> make

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
you get from a chatter to probably make

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.749 
you get from a chatter to probably make
the<00:04:46.259> surface<00:04:46.589> shine<00:04:46.800> a<00:04:46.830> little<00:04:47.129> bit<00:04:47.309> but<00:04:47.639> we'll

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
the surface shine a little bit but we'll

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.339 
the surface shine a little bit but we'll
bring<00:04:47.939> out<00:04:48.179> the<00:04:48.360> pattern<00:04:48.749> in<00:04:48.989> the<00:04:49.080> chatter

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:49.349 
bring out the pattern in the chatter

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.409 
bring out the pattern in the chatter
work<00:04:49.589> it<00:04:49.769> with<00:04:49.919> the<00:04:50.009> lace<00:04:50.189> top<00:04:50.519> and<00:04:50.909> then<00:04:51.179> turn

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
work it with the lace top and then turn

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.149 
work it with the lace top and then turn
the<00:04:51.569> lathe<00:04:51.749> on<00:04:51.989> and<00:04:52.259> pretty<00:04:52.409> much<00:04:52.619> immediately

00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:53.159 
the lathe on and pretty much immediately

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:55.040 
the lathe on and pretty much immediately
wiped<00:04:53.489> off<00:04:53.729> the<00:04:53.909> excess<00:04:54.300> finish<00:04:54.689> from<00:04:54.899> the

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
wiped off the excess finish from the

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.350 
wiped off the excess finish from the
surface<00:04:55.469> we're<00:04:56.069> going<00:04:56.279> to<00:04:56.369> use<00:04:56.519> epoxy<00:04:56.909> here

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
surface we're going to use epoxy here

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.779 
surface we're going to use epoxy here
this<00:04:57.959> is<00:04:58.110> two-part<00:04:58.589> epoxy<00:04:58.709> that<00:04:59.129> will<00:04:59.429> mix<00:04:59.580> up

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
this is two-part epoxy that will mix up

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.599 
this is two-part epoxy that will mix up
in<00:04:59.909> equal<00:05:00.239> parts
