00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.099
 hello I'll put you another one now 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.200
 model from the nokia touch and type 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.040
 series 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:16.320
 this is the nokia x3 02 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.570
 and it's one of the few cell phones she has 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.380
 Both a classic numeric keypad 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.369
 as well as have this touchscreen here 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.019
 So for all who are not between 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.369
 decide these two functions 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:34.890
 can the x3 02 be just right 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:38.100
 it is 100 62 mm long 48 4 millimeters 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.690
 wide and just under 10 mm to be precise 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.140
 96 millimeters thick and weighs only 78 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.060
 gram 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.700
 and i have the version in here 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.690
 color white silver 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.540
 there are four more in total 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.480
 those from petrol bispinck full color 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.860
 and at Amazon he gets the x3 at the moment 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.140
 for almost 130 euros 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.400
 what is now all in the scope of delivery 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.110
 contain 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.659
 the packet looks already times very large 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.569
 but there is not really much in it 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.770
 I'll show you this as if it takes a while 

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:12.270
 bit until he actually arrives 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.319
 Scope of delivery reaches here 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.319
 usually the cell phone in there then 

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:22.609
 can you take this off and on here 

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:25.530
 work out so and there is now so 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:26.159
 scope of delivery and as I said a lot 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.009
 not inside 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:38.869
 the charging cable here with the nokia own 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:40.020
 buchs is still a headset here 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.189
 contain 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.009
 as you can see and otherwise 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.799
 in fact, only this data cable 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.369
 Of course, definitely 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.189
 it's just too short so you have her 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.740
 because the good piece of nokia x3 02 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.439
 I think that's pretty fancy 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.490
 Looks like the buttons here are pretty 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.950
 Great but I like that you like that 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.899
 angular I think that had quite 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.720
 cool look 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.550
 The display has a diagonal of 2.4 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.770
 inch and I'm curious if that 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.560
 really for a touchscreen 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.620
 There are still enough here 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.230
 these four physical keys are the ones 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.870
 each very left and the right 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.160
 are the phone keys with the button 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.590
 here with the letter comes to 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.300
 logically to the news and 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.300
 with this one arrives then to 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.920
 music player and how you see and how 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.040
 I already said that is the x3 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.760
 very very flat and really lies 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:49.470
 good and great in the hand and also gives 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:52.550
 this cover here at the back of the whole 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.080
 one more yes I say noble touch 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.650
 and here at the back you see, too 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:02.250
 equal to the objective of 5 megapixels 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.880
 camera on this side here we have 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.130
 then once a volume rocker 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.610
 and then underneath the button for the 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.920
 Key lock here on the other side 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.020
 there is nothing except this one 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.540
 elevation here is on the other 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.910
 again, and that is very 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.010
 interesting because if you both 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.040
 here 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.470
 at the same time you press 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:33.180
 seen the battery pack and her dissolves 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:37.040
 You can take it off quite comfortably 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:41.790
 up here then you have the 35 mm 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:45.720
 jack socket for the headset this 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:49.320
 is just the usb micro usb connection and 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.250
 this is the jack for the nokia 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.840
 own battery 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.209
 I already had your battery 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.540
 but take them again 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:01.260
 out that's all very easy 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:06.720
 and you see here factory is already one 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:10.350
 2GB memory card with your own 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.490
 but can expand to 16 gb and so 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.080
 I put the battery now 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:19.780
 Just take me back here 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:23.260
 Battery Cover You can see these two here 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:28.300
 small hooks have to be lifted down 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:29.920
 so here and then here what is easy here 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.610
 you can still stand so easily 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.950
 push in 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.290
 So you see, that's really possible 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.510
 Convenient and easy when I am there to others 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.400
 Manufacturers think their battery cover 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.480
 just go down incredibly difficult 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.160
 and you definitely the 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.100
 aborts fingernails is here 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.710
 really very well resolved and like yourself 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.910
 the nokia x3 02 can operate I show 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.910
 you guys in the next video
