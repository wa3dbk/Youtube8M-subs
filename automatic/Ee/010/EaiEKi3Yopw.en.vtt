in a sense the trees that we salvaged

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.389 
in a sense the trees that we salvaged
would<00:00:52.420> otherwise<00:00:52.780> be<00:00:53.199> turned<00:00:53.499> into<00:00:53.679> mulch<00:00:54.010> and

a road or cut into firewood and to my
way<00:01:01.149> of<00:01:01.179> thinking<00:01:01.690> you<00:01:02.260> know<00:01:02.350> why<00:01:02.649> are<00:01:02.710> we

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
way of thinking you know why are we

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.410 
way of thinking you know why are we
cutting<00:01:03.100> down<00:01:03.370> healthy<00:01:03.729> trees<00:01:03.999> when<00:01:04.239> there's

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
cutting down healthy trees when there's

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.690 
cutting down healthy trees when there's
so<00:01:04.570> many<00:01:04.690> falling<00:01:05.170> over<00:01:05.409> and<00:01:05.560> dying<00:01:05.740> there's<00:01:06.640> a

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
so many falling over and dying there's a

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.530 
so many falling over and dying there's a
lot<00:01:06.940> of<00:01:07.090> thinking<00:01:08.050> in<00:01:08.229> what<00:01:08.860> she<00:01:09.250> does<00:01:09.460> now<00:01:10.390> she

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
lot of thinking in what she does now she

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.340 
lot of thinking in what she does now she
harvests<00:01:10.930> her<00:01:11.380> wood<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.760> that<00:01:13.060> really<00:01:13.659> is<00:01:13.930> an

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
harvests her wood and that really is an

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.530 
harvests her wood and that really is an
important<00:01:14.890> story<00:01:15.100> for<00:01:15.460> people<00:01:16.090> who<00:01:16.450> are

like what New York hardwoods is doing

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.920 
like what New York hardwoods is doing
