00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.560 

so<00:00:00.980> the<00:00:01.069> trick<00:00:01.249> about<00:00:01.430> vitamin<00:00:01.819> D<00:00:01.969> is<00:00:02.270> it's

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:02.570 
so the trick about vitamin D is it's

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.749 
so the trick about vitamin D is it's
actually<00:00:02.840> more<00:00:03.290> of<00:00:03.350> a<00:00:03.620> hormone<00:00:04.069> that<00:00:04.490> it<00:00:04.610> is<00:00:04.730> a

00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:04.759 
actually more of a hormone that it is a

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:06.670 
actually more of a hormone that it is a
vitamin<00:00:05.330> you<00:00:05.480> want<00:00:05.870> to<00:00:05.960> think<00:00:06.110> about<00:00:06.320> it<00:00:06.500> in

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:06.680 
vitamin you want to think about it in

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.280 
vitamin you want to think about it in
that<00:00:06.740> way<00:00:06.950> our<00:00:07.850> body<00:00:08.120> can<00:00:08.420> make<00:00:08.630> vitamin<00:00:09.140> D

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.290 
that way our body can make vitamin D

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.680 
that way our body can make vitamin D
when<00:00:09.620> it<00:00:09.740> has<00:00:09.950> adequate<00:00:10.490> exposure<00:00:11.000> to<00:00:11.330> the<00:00:11.450> Sun

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
when it has adequate exposure to the Sun

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.720 
when it has adequate exposure to the Sun
so<00:00:12.050> we<00:00:12.139> don't<00:00:12.290> necessarily<00:00:12.410> need<00:00:12.860> to<00:00:12.889> ingest

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
so we don't necessarily need to ingest

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.060 
so we don't necessarily need to ingest
it<00:00:13.969> but<00:00:14.660> because<00:00:14.960> we're<00:00:15.290> all<00:00:15.320> afraid<00:00:15.620> of<00:00:15.710> skin

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
it but because we're all afraid of skin

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.630 
it but because we're all afraid of skin
cancer

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
cancer

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.850 
cancer
we<00:00:16.760> put<00:00:17.029> sunscreen<00:00:17.240> on<00:00:17.720> our<00:00:17.900> skin<00:00:18.230> and<00:00:18.470> then

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:18.860 
we put sunscreen on our skin and then

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.680 
we put sunscreen on our skin and then
that<00:00:19.039> blocks<00:00:19.340> our<00:00:19.550> ability<00:00:19.910> to<00:00:20.060> make<00:00:20.270> vitamin

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:20.690 
that blocks our ability to make vitamin

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.260 
that blocks our ability to make vitamin
D<00:00:20.840> so<00:00:21.500> many<00:00:21.800> Americans<00:00:22.460> are<00:00:22.699> deficient<00:00:22.880> and

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
D so many Americans are deficient and

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.240 
D so many Americans are deficient and
vitamin<00:00:23.689> D<00:00:23.840> and<00:00:24.080> don't<00:00:24.529> even<00:00:24.650> know<00:00:24.800> it<00:00:24.949> so<00:00:25.220> a

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
vitamin D and don't even know it so a

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.439 
vitamin D and don't even know it so a
lot<00:00:25.430> of<00:00:25.460> times<00:00:25.670> when<00:00:25.789> people<00:00:25.850> are<00:00:26.150> thinking

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
lot of times when people are thinking

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.240 
lot of times when people are thinking
about<00:00:26.600> taking<00:00:27.019> supplements<00:00:27.260> they'll<00:00:27.949> hear

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
about taking supplements they'll hear

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.650 
about taking supplements they'll hear
the<00:00:28.369> advice<00:00:28.640> that<00:00:28.670> they<00:00:29.000> should<00:00:29.240> get<00:00:29.420> these

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
the advice that they should get these

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.049 
the advice that they should get these
nutrients<00:00:30.109> from<00:00:30.170> their<00:00:30.380> diet<00:00:30.680> and<00:00:31.130> ideally

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
nutrients from their diet and ideally

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.270 
nutrients from their diet and ideally
you<00:00:32.419> would<00:00:32.629> if<00:00:32.870> we<00:00:33.319> lived<00:00:33.499> in<00:00:33.589> a<00:00:33.710> perfect<00:00:33.889> world

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
you would if we lived in a perfect world

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.759 
you would if we lived in a perfect world
we<00:00:34.609> would<00:00:34.760> all<00:00:34.909> eat<00:00:35.420> really<00:00:35.839> healthy<00:00:35.989> diets

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:36.769 
we would all eat really healthy diets

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.770 
we would all eat really healthy diets
that<00:00:37.010> were<00:00:37.159> rich<00:00:37.429> in<00:00:37.460> fruits<00:00:37.969> and<00:00:38.239> vegetables

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
that were rich in fruits and vegetables

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.259 
that were rich in fruits and vegetables
that<00:00:38.960> came<00:00:39.379> from<00:00:39.769> wonderful<00:00:40.670> soil<00:00:40.969> that

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 
that came from wonderful soil that

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:42.849 
that came from wonderful soil that
allowed<00:00:41.569> them<00:00:41.809> to<00:00:41.839> grow<00:00:42.139> their<00:00:42.229> nutrients

00:00:42.849 --> 00:00:42.859 
allowed them to grow their nutrients

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:45.489 
allowed them to grow their nutrients
optimally<00:00:43.809> unfortunately<00:00:44.809> most<00:00:45.229> Americans

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:45.499 
optimally unfortunately most Americans

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:48.219 
optimally unfortunately most Americans
don't<00:00:46.129> eat<00:00:46.519> an<00:00:46.789> adequate<00:00:47.329> amount<00:00:47.359> of<00:00:47.870> fruits

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:48.229 
don't eat an adequate amount of fruits

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:50.559 
don't eat an adequate amount of fruits
and<00:00:48.409> vegetables<00:00:48.889> and<00:00:49.159> perhaps<00:00:49.819> the<00:00:50.209> ones<00:00:50.389> that

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:50.569 
and vegetables and perhaps the ones that

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:52.840 
and vegetables and perhaps the ones that
they<00:00:50.690> eat<00:00:50.929> are<00:00:51.170> not<00:00:51.709> nearly<00:00:52.129> as<00:00:52.249> healthy<00:00:52.729> as

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
they eat are not nearly as healthy as

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.029 
they eat are not nearly as healthy as
they<00:00:53.059> were<00:00:53.119> when<00:00:53.899> our<00:00:54.049> ancestors<00:00:54.379> used<00:00:54.619> to<00:00:54.889> go

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
they were when our ancestors used to go

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.649 
they were when our ancestors used to go
and<00:00:55.219> pluck<00:00:55.459> them<00:00:55.670> from<00:00:55.699> their<00:00:56.030> gardens<00:00:56.479> and

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:56.659 
and pluck them from their gardens and

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.109 
and pluck them from their gardens and
from<00:00:57.049> their<00:00:57.199> fruit<00:00:57.440> trees<00:00:57.739> many<00:00:58.519> people<00:00:58.879> will

00:00:59.109 --> 00:00:59.119 
from their fruit trees many people will

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:00.669 
from their fruit trees many people will
choose<00:00:59.479> to<00:00:59.779> take<00:00:59.899> a<00:00:59.959> supplement<00:01:00.499> that

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:00.679 
choose to take a supplement that

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:03.399 
choose to take a supplement that
contains<00:01:01.010> omega-3<00:01:01.699> most<00:01:02.299> commonly<00:01:02.779> fish<00:01:03.019> oil

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
contains omega-3 most commonly fish oil

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.010 
contains omega-3 most commonly fish oil
and<00:01:03.679> this<00:01:04.100> is<00:01:04.250> to<00:01:04.369> balance<00:01:04.579> out<00:01:05.000> their<00:01:05.269> diet<00:01:05.539> so

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
and this is to balance out their diet so

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.649 
and this is to balance out their diet so
most<00:01:06.619> of<00:01:06.770> us<00:01:06.890> think<00:01:07.159> of<00:01:07.369> omega-3<00:01:08.030> as<00:01:08.210> being

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
most of us think of omega-3 as being

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.779 
most of us think of omega-3 as being
beneficial<00:01:09.649> to<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.070> heart<00:01:10.430> really

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:10.789 
beneficial to the heart really

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:12.789 
beneficial to the heart really
protecting<00:01:11.539> you<00:01:11.689> from<00:01:11.840> having<00:01:12.079> heart<00:01:12.439> attacks

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
protecting you from having heart attacks

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.800 
protecting you from having heart attacks
but<00:01:13.579> we<00:01:13.759> know<00:01:13.969> too<00:01:14.030> that<00:01:14.960> omega-3<00:01:15.500> is<00:01:16.039> a

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
but we know too that omega-3 is a

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.819 
but we know too that omega-3 is a
anti-inflammatory<00:01:17.810> so<00:01:18.170> it<00:01:18.259> can<00:01:18.380> help<00:01:18.590> in

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829 
anti-inflammatory so it can help in

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.730 
anti-inflammatory so it can help in
other<00:01:19.039> ways<00:01:19.189> as<00:01:19.700> well<00:01:20.439> multivitamins<00:01:21.439> are<00:01:21.619> the

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
other ways as well multivitamins are the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.459 
other ways as well multivitamins are the
most<00:01:21.950> commonly<00:01:22.490> ingested<00:01:23.479> supplement<00:01:24.020> here

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:24.469 
most commonly ingested supplement here

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:26.649 
most commonly ingested supplement here
in<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:24.710> United<00:01:24.979> States<00:01:25.039> and<00:01:25.850> for<00:01:26.090> good<00:01:26.270> reason

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
in the United States and for good reason

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.510 
in the United States and for good reason
we'd<00:01:27.409> like<00:01:27.710> to<00:01:27.979> think<00:01:28.130> that<00:01:28.340> all<00:01:28.490> our

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
we'd like to think that all our

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.399 
we'd like to think that all our
nutrients<00:01:28.999> come<00:01:29.149> from<00:01:29.179> our<00:01:29.450> diets<00:01:29.780> but<00:01:30.079> since

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
nutrients come from our diets but since

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.410 
nutrients come from our diets but since
they<00:01:30.619> don't<00:01:30.770> always<00:01:31.100> it<00:01:31.549> can<00:01:31.729> be<00:01:31.850> good<00:01:32.060> to<00:01:32.119> have

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
they don't always it can be good to have

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.289 
they don't always it can be good to have
a<00:01:32.450> multivitamin<00:01:32.990> on<00:01:33.469> board<00:01:34.100> especially<00:01:34.729> as<00:01:35.179> we

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
a multivitamin on board especially as we

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.300 
a multivitamin on board especially as we
go<00:01:35.420> into<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:35.840> winter<00:01:36.229> months<00:01:36.619> where<00:01:36.890> maybe

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
go into the winter months where maybe

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.429 
go into the winter months where maybe
you're<00:01:37.640> traveling<00:01:37.999> or<00:01:38.570> you're<00:01:38.689> getting<00:01:39.020> colds

think<00:01:44.030> a<00:01:44.090> multivitamin<00:01:44.450> is<00:01:44.749> a<00:01:44.810> really<00:01:45.079> good

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
think a multivitamin is a really good

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.649 
think a multivitamin is a really good
idea<00:01:45.549> the<00:01:46.549> most<00:01:46.729> important<00:01:47.270> thing<00:01:47.420> about<00:01:47.509> a

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
idea the most important thing about a

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.690 
idea the most important thing about a
multivitamin<00:01:48.439> is<00:01:48.679> you<00:01:48.920> choose<00:01:49.249> one<00:01:49.520> that's

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
multivitamin is you choose one that's

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.230 
multivitamin is you choose one that's
well<00:01:49.969> matched<00:01:50.270> to<00:01:50.630> you<00:01:50.960> so<00:01:51.499> sex<00:01:52.039> specific<00:01:52.369> take

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
well matched to you so sex specific take

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.120 
well matched to you so sex specific take
a<00:01:53.270> woman's<00:01:53.659> formula<00:01:54.109> or<00:01:54.350> a<00:01:54.380> men's<00:01:54.679> formula

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
a woman's formula or a men's formula

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.179 
a woman's formula or a men's formula
take<00:01:55.939> a<00:01:55.969> fifty<00:01:56.389> plus<00:01:56.659> formula<00:01:57.049> if<00:01:57.499> that<00:01:57.799> fits

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
take a fifty plus formula if that fits

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.580 
take a fifty plus formula if that fits
you<00:01:58.579> and<00:01:58.609> I<00:01:59.420> would<00:01:59.569> highly<00:01:59.990> encourage<00:02:00.020> people

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
you and I would highly encourage people

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.529 
you and I would highly encourage people
to<00:02:00.740> look<00:02:01.159> down<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.369> list<00:02:01.609> of<00:02:01.789> ingredients<00:02:02.420> and

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
to look down the list of ingredients and

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.859 
to look down the list of ingredients and
make<00:02:02.899> sure<00:02:03.229> that<00:02:03.829> they<00:02:04.009> have<00:02:04.219> around<00:02:04.939> 100

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
make sure that they have around 100

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.929 
make sure that they have around 100
percent<00:02:06.319> of<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.649> RDA<00:02:07.009> for<00:02:07.369> each<00:02:07.639> of<00:02:07.819> the

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
percent of the RDA for each of the

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.630 
percent of the RDA for each of the
components<00:02:08.659> certainly<00:02:09.409> not<00:02:09.619> much<00:02:10.039> much<00:02:10.340> more

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
components certainly not much much more

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.250 
components certainly not much much more
than

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
than

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.770 
than
that<00:02:11.620> a<00:02:11.980> lot<00:02:12.849> of<00:02:12.970> people<00:02:13.180> have<00:02:13.269> trouble<00:02:13.450> taking

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
that a lot of people have trouble taking

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.690 
that a lot of people have trouble taking
multivitamins<00:02:14.140> because<00:02:14.739> they're<00:02:14.890> so<00:02:15.099> big<00:02:15.400> and

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
multivitamins because they're so big and

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.670 
multivitamins because they're so big and
one<00:02:16.180> trick<00:02:16.480> for<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:16.840> is<00:02:17.049> to<00:02:17.200> look<00:02:17.349> for<00:02:17.530> one

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
one trick for that is to look for one

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.619 
one trick for that is to look for one
that's<00:02:17.709> low<00:02:18.010> in<00:02:18.159> calcium<00:02:18.400> because<00:02:19.239> that's<00:02:19.450> the

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
that's low in calcium because that's the

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.509 
that's low in calcium because that's the
biggest<00:02:19.810> component<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:20.680> then<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.040> pill<00:02:21.370> will

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
biggest component and then the pill will

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:22.619 
biggest component and then the pill will
be<00:02:21.640> smaller

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
be smaller

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.500 
be smaller
I<00:02:22.659> think<00:02:23.620> of<00:02:23.709> multivitamins<00:02:24.400> as<00:02:24.610> being<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.209> seat

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
I think of multivitamins as being a seat

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.930 
I think of multivitamins as being a seat
belt<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:26.079> doesn't<00:02:26.530> replace<00:02:26.680> safe<00:02:27.400> driving

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
belt it doesn't replace safe driving

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.149 
belt it doesn't replace safe driving
like<00:02:28.209> a<00:02:28.239> healthy<00:02:28.629> diet<00:02:28.870> but<00:02:29.530> it<00:02:29.650> is<00:02:29.799> kind<00:02:30.069> of

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
like a healthy diet but it is kind of

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:32.009 
like a healthy diet but it is kind of
that<00:02:30.280> safety<00:02:30.790> mechanism<00:02:31.420> that<00:02:31.750> could<00:02:31.930> be

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
that safety mechanism that could be

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.990 
that safety mechanism that could be
added<00:02:32.349> on<00:02:32.470> board<00:02:32.739> to<00:02:33.280> support<00:02:33.640> your<00:02:33.730> immune

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
added on board to support your immune

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.899 
added on board to support your immune
system<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.480> overall<00:02:34.930> health<00:02:35.170> in<00:02:35.319> general

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
system and overall health in general

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.710 
system and overall health in general
antioxidants<00:02:36.909> are<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:37.030> little<00:02:37.209> controversial

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
antioxidants are a little controversial

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.259 
antioxidants are a little controversial
they're<00:02:38.379> very<00:02:38.920> wonderful<00:02:39.549> when<00:02:39.730> they<00:02:39.849> come<00:02:40.090> in

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
they're very wonderful when they come in

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.059 
they're very wonderful when they come in
food<00:02:40.540> so<00:02:40.750> we<00:02:40.810> think<00:02:41.019> of<00:02:41.109> antioxidant<00:02:41.859> foods

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
food so we think of antioxidant foods

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.339 
food so we think of antioxidant foods
like<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.549> dark<00:02:42.790> berries<00:02:43.269> for<00:02:43.540> example<00:02:44.019> and

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
like the dark berries for example and

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.259 
like the dark berries for example and
people<00:02:44.859> should<00:02:45.159> eat<00:02:45.190> those<00:02:45.489> as<00:02:45.760> much<00:02:45.970> as<00:02:46.120> they

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
people should eat those as much as they

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.630 
people should eat those as much as they
would<00:02:46.420> like<00:02:46.659> but<00:02:47.260> regarding<00:02:47.709> antioxidant

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
would like but regarding antioxidant

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.149 
would like but regarding antioxidant
supplements<00:02:49.450> there<00:02:49.900> can<00:02:50.200> be<00:02:50.230> some<00:02:50.680> toxicity

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
supplements there can be some toxicity

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.479 
supplements there can be some toxicity
associated<00:02:51.900> so<00:02:52.900> particularly<00:02:53.859> if<00:02:54.099> you<00:02:54.310> look

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
associated so particularly if you look

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.360 
associated so particularly if you look
at<00:02:54.760> very<00:02:55.060> high<00:02:55.180> doses<00:02:55.389> of<00:02:56.049> some<00:02:56.859> of<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.040> forms

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
at very high doses of some of the forms

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.270 
at very high doses of some of the forms
of<00:02:57.489> vitamin<00:02:57.909> A<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.180> vitamin<00:02:58.480> E<00:02:59.170> they're<00:02:59.799> even

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
of vitamin A and vitamin E they're even

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.920 
of vitamin A and vitamin E they're even
associated<00:03:00.819> with<00:03:01.090> an<00:03:01.209> increased<00:03:01.569> risk<00:03:01.659> of

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
associated with an increased risk of

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.849 
associated with an increased risk of
death<00:03:02.200> so<00:03:03.040> I<00:03:03.069> avoid<00:03:04.200> antioxidants<00:03:05.200> in<00:03:05.349> general

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
death so I avoid antioxidants in general

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.199 
death so I avoid antioxidants in general
I<00:03:06.540> do<00:03:07.540> recommend<00:03:08.230> vitamin<00:03:08.859> C<00:03:09.159> for<00:03:09.609> patients

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
I do recommend vitamin C for patients

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.869 
I do recommend vitamin C for patients
who<00:03:10.629> are<00:03:10.659> starting<00:03:11.049> to<00:03:11.319> have<00:03:11.560> colds<00:03:12.459> or<00:03:12.609> flu

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
who are starting to have colds or flu

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.539 
who are starting to have colds or flu
symptoms<00:03:13.329> I<00:03:13.959> think<00:03:14.470> that<00:03:14.620> earlier<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.340> better

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
symptoms I think that earlier the better

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.089 
symptoms I think that earlier the better
while<00:03:16.329> the<00:03:16.480> science<00:03:16.840> isn't<00:03:16.989> very<00:03:17.319> strong<00:03:17.799> for

while the science isn't very strong for

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.099 
while the science isn't very strong for
that<00:03:18.220> that's<00:03:18.639> a<00:03:18.699> very<00:03:18.849> traditional<00:03:19.180> use<00:03:19.840> of

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
that that's a very traditional use of

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.159 
that that's a very traditional use of
vitamin<00:03:20.349> C<00:03:20.889> and<00:03:21.190> something<00:03:21.639> I<00:03:21.760> use<00:03:21.940> myself<00:03:22.480> so

vitamin C and something I use myself so
