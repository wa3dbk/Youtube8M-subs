it's actually working that like swiping
through<00:00:21.539> menus<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:23.480> play<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.510> game<00:00:24.810> but<00:00:25.910> trying

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
through menus I play a game but trying

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.640 
through menus I play a game but trying
to<00:00:26.939> do<00:00:27.060> this<00:00:27.240> with<00:00:27.390> one<00:00:27.570> hand<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:27.960> maybe<00:00:28.529> I

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
to do this with one hand so maybe I

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.590 
to do this with one hand so maybe I
won't<00:00:30.830> but<00:00:31.830> that's<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.820> it's<00:00:32.969> all<00:00:33.090> set<00:00:33.360> I

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
won't but that's it so it's all set I

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.569 
won't but that's it so it's all set I
think<00:00:33.630> there's<00:00:33.989> definitely<00:00:34.110> some<00:00:34.680> spit<00:00:35.489> and

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
think there's definitely some spit and

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.190 
think there's definitely some spit and
polish<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.180> want<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.540> add<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
polish that I want to add to this to

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.100 
polish that I want to add to this to
complete<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.710> but<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.730> works<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.690> think<00:00:39.899> for

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
complete it but it works and I think for

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.299

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:20.110 
mentioned on Alibaba I found mechanisms
that<00:02:14.130> allows<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.850> raise<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.600> table<00:02:16.610> up<00:02:17.610> here

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.440 

Wow

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
voila and so it's a flip up table and

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.809 
voila and so it's a flip up table and
the<00:02:28.050> two<00:02:28.500> cool<00:02:28.739> things<00:02:29.010> about<00:02:29.160> this<00:02:29.459> is<00:02:29.700> that

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
the two cool things about this is that

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.670 
the two cool things about this is that
if<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.120> actually<00:02:30.300> did<00:02:30.630> want<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.930> sit<00:02:31.110> here<00:02:31.380> and

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
if I actually did want to sit here and

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.880 
if I actually did want to sit here and

eat dinner and watch television I could

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.620 
eat dinner and watch television I could
do<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.489> actually<00:02:35.519> provides<00:02:35.880> a<00:02:36.450> good

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
do that it actually provides a good

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.470 
do that it actually provides a good
three<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.739> four<00:02:37.950> inches<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.340> extra<00:02:39.000> height<00:02:39.209> on

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
three to four inches of extra height on

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.390 
three to four inches of extra height on
a<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:40.260> know<00:02:40.290> on<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.560> regular-sized<00:02:41.100> coffee

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
table which is pretty far down so this

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.400 
table which is pretty far down so this
actually<00:02:44.910> makes<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.239> more<00:02:45.570> convenient<00:02:45.989> to<00:02:46.170> eat

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
actually makes it more convenient to eat

now<00:02:50.640> got<00:02:51.090> access<00:02:51.660> inside<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:52.950> if<00:02:53.100> I<00:02:53.220> want<00:02:53.400> to

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
now got access inside so if I want to

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.420 
now got access inside so if I want to
change<00:02:53.610> anything<00:02:54.590> make<00:02:55.590> any<00:02:55.800> adjustments

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
it's easy to get inside and I don't have

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.880 
it's easy to get inside and I don't have

to unscrew anything you can see there is
a<00:03:01.920> speaker<00:03:02.750> bunch<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:03.870> wires<00:03:04.820> there's<00:03:05.820> that

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
a speaker bunch of wires there's that

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.900 
a speaker bunch of wires there's that
Lea<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:07.290> then<00:03:07.890> over<00:03:08.130> there<00:03:08.250> that<00:03:08.489> blue<00:03:08.700> piece

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
Lea and then over there that blue piece

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.970 
Lea and then over there that blue piece
is<00:03:09.150> external<00:03:09.840> power<00:03:09.989> outlet<00:03:10.470> that<00:03:10.829> I

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
is external power outlet that I

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.229 
is external power outlet that I
installed<00:03:12.079> here's<00:03:13.079> the<00:03:13.260> LED<00:03:13.530> monitor<00:03:13.920> and

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
installed here's the LED monitor and

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.340 
installed here's the LED monitor and
this<00:03:15.239> is<00:03:15.329> an<00:03:15.450> extra<00:03:15.750> speaker<00:03:16.110> right<00:03:16.320> here

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
this is an extra speaker right here

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.319 
this is an extra speaker right here
that's<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.040> other<00:03:17.130> Logitech<00:03:17.910> speaker<00:03:18.299> I

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
that's the other Logitech speaker I

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.830 
that's the other Logitech speaker I
think<00:03:18.540> that's<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.780> left<00:03:18.989> channel<00:03:20.329> and<00:03:21.329> I<00:03:21.690> also

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
think that's the left channel and I also

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.199 
think that's the left channel and I also
mentioned<00:03:22.410> in<00:03:22.500> my<00:03:22.650> blog<00:03:22.920> that<00:03:22.950> I<00:03:24.170> added<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.290> a

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
mentioned in my blog that I added a a

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.349 
mentioned in my blog that I added a a
little<00:03:27.209> hole<00:03:27.420> down<00:03:27.660> here<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:28.430> in<00:03:29.430> that<00:03:29.489> hole

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
little hole down here and in that hole

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.890 
little hole down here and in that hole
is<00:03:30.600> a<00:03:30.630> retractable<00:03:31.320> power<00:03:31.500> cord<00:03:32.510> you<00:03:33.510> can<00:03:33.660> see

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
is a retractable power cord you can see

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.380 
is a retractable power cord you can see
and<00:03:34.109> so<00:03:34.739> goes<00:03:35.040> all<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.280> way<00:03:35.820> over<00:03:35.910> here<00:03:36.180> into

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
and so goes all the way over here into

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.080 
and so goes all the way over here into
the<00:03:36.480> wall<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:37.680> it's<00:03:37.799> retractable<00:03:38.280> so<00:03:38.519> you

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
the wall and it's retractable so you

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.000 
the wall and it's retractable so you
know<00:03:39.180> just<00:03:39.450> a<00:03:39.570> quick<00:03:39.720> tug<00:03:40.019> on<00:03:40.049> that<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:40.650> the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
know just a quick tug on that and the

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.530 
know just a quick tug on that and the
cord<00:03:41.220> goes<00:03:41.430> back<00:03:41.640> in<00:03:41.850> and<00:03:41.880> it's<00:03:42.150> out<00:03:42.359> of<00:03:42.390> the

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
cord goes back in and it's out of the

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.120 
cord goes back in and it's out of the
way<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:42.780> off<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.109> floor<00:03:43.410> which<00:03:43.620> is<00:03:43.650> really

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
where dowels would go obviously I don't

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.870 
where dowels would go obviously I don't
need<00:04:07.260> them<00:04:07.440> anymore<00:04:07.530> so<00:04:07.859> I<00:04:08.160> can<00:04:08.489> fill<00:04:08.670> in<00:04:08.790> these

holes and then
you<00:04:10.440> know<00:04:10.530> maybe<00:04:10.709> I'll<00:04:10.920> paint<00:04:11.670> paint<00:04:12.090> those

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
you know maybe I'll paint paint those

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.730 
you know maybe I'll paint paint those
sides<00:04:12.510> a<00:04:12.660> little<00:04:12.780> bit<00:04:13.050> make<00:04:13.290> it<00:04:13.410> look<00:04:13.530> a<00:04:13.620> little

better<00:04:20.389> right<00:04:21.389> now<00:04:21.540> you<00:04:21.600> can<00:04:21.810> still<00:04:22.079> see<00:04:22.440> some

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
better right now you can still see some

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.290 
better right now you can still see some
of<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:22.950> frame<00:04:23.310> when<00:04:23.790> you<00:04:23.880> close<00:04:24.120> this

tabletop<00:04:24.720> lid<00:04:25.190> and<00:04:26.190> I'd<00:04:26.310> like<00:04:26.460> to<00:04:26.580> take<00:04:26.700> care

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
tabletop lid and I'd like to take care

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.360 
tabletop lid and I'd like to take care
of<00:04:26.910> that<00:04:27.060> but<00:04:27.330> it's<00:04:27.480> not<00:04:27.950> killing<00:04:28.950> me<00:04:29.100> it's

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
of that but it's not killing me it's

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.950 
of that but it's not killing me it's
just<00:04:29.610> one<00:04:29.790> of<00:04:29.880> those<00:04:29.970> nagging<00:04:30.540> little<00:04:30.690> things

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
just one of those nagging little things

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.110 
just one of those nagging little things
that<00:04:31.050> I'd<00:04:31.200> like<00:04:31.230> to<00:04:31.380> get<00:04:31.560> to<00:04:31.710> eventually<00:04:32.120> but

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
that I'd like to get to eventually but

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.940 
that I'd like to get to eventually but
that's<00:04:33.330> it<00:04:33.540> other<00:04:33.750> than<00:04:34.020> that<00:04:34.169> it's<00:04:34.380> it's<00:04:34.710> good

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
that's it other than that it's it's good

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:35.480 
that's it other than that it's it's good
to<00:04:35.070> go

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
to go

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.510 
to go
I<00:04:35.520> got<00:04:35.760> one<00:04:35.970> last<00:04:36.240> thing<00:04:36.570> to<00:04:36.930> show<00:04:36.960> you<00:04:40.520> might

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
I got one last thing to show you might

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.260 
I got one last thing to show you might
be<00:04:41.669> better<00:04:41.880> to<00:04:43.190> put<00:04:44.190> this<00:04:44.340> down<00:04:44.580> for<00:04:44.640> a<00:04:44.880> second

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
be better to put this down for a second

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:55.530 
be better to put this down for a second
I'll<00:04:45.480> hit<00:04:45.660> some<00:04:45.840> lights

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.740 

and

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
and

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.460 
and
voila<00:04:58.440> it<00:04:58.950> lights<00:04:59.220> up<00:04:59.430> so<00:05:00.420> that's<00:05:00.630> the<00:05:00.900> LED

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
voila it lights up so that's the LED

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.990 
voila it lights up so that's the LED
strip<00:05:01.800> that<00:05:01.920> I<00:05:01.980> bought<00:05:02.480> its<00:05:03.480> installed<00:05:03.900> and<00:05:05.000> I

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
strip that I bought its installed and I

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.120 
strip that I bought its installed and I
put<00:05:06.690> it<00:05:06.900> oh<00:05:07.050> I<00:05:07.350> put<00:05:07.530> it<00:05:07.650> all<00:05:07.740> the<00:05:07.890> way<00:05:08.010> around

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
put it oh I put it all the way around

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.720 
put it oh I put it all the way around
the<00:05:08.640> bottom<00:05:09.090> of<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.600> table<00:05:10.020> and<00:05:10.200> then<00:05:10.980> I<00:05:11.010> had<00:05:11.400> a

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
the bottom of the table and then I had a

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.150 
the bottom of the table and then I had a
bunch<00:05:12.060> left<00:05:12.450> over<00:05:12.870> like<00:05:13.080> the<00:05:13.320> strip<00:05:13.860> itself

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
bunch left over like the strip itself

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.020 
bunch left over like the strip itself
was<00:05:14.400> really<00:05:14.580> long<00:05:14.880> so<00:05:15.270> all<00:05:15.990> I<00:05:16.050> did<00:05:16.380> was<00:05:16.940> hard<00:05:17.940> to

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
was really long so all I did was hard to

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.500 
was really long so all I did was hard to
see<00:05:18.240> but<00:05:18.510> I<00:05:18.980> created<00:05:19.980> a<00:05:20.100> little<00:05:20.250> hole<00:05:20.520> in<00:05:20.880> here

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
see but I created a little hole in here

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.170 
see but I created a little hole in here
and<00:05:21.690> I<00:05:22.590> routed<00:05:22.860> her<00:05:23.130> around<00:05:23.310> the<00:05:23.520> outside<00:05:23.940> and

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
and I routed her around the outside and

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.670 
and I routed her around the outside and
then<00:05:24.300> I<00:05:24.330> had<00:05:24.540> so<00:05:24.720> much<00:05:24.870> I<00:05:25.080> just<00:05:25.290> came<00:05:25.470> back

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
then I had so much I just came back

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.550 
then I had so much I just came back
inside<00:05:26.250> and<00:05:26.640> then<00:05:27.360> just<00:05:27.630> went<00:05:27.870> along<00:05:28.140> the

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
inside and then just went along the

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.090 
inside and then just went along the
edges<00:05:29.130> of<00:05:30.030> this<00:05:30.750> side<00:05:31.110> of<00:05:31.290> the<00:05:31.350> table<00:05:31.620> where

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
edges of this side of the table where

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.040 
edges of this side of the table where
all<00:05:32.490> of<00:05:32.820> the<00:05:32.910> electronics<00:05:33.510> are<00:05:33.690> I<00:05:33.720> just

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
all of the electronics are I just

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.320 
all of the electronics are I just
thought<00:05:34.950> it'd<00:05:35.070> be<00:05:35.100> nice<00:05:35.400> as<00:05:35.700> a<00:05:35.730> way<00:05:35.940> to<00:05:36.000> have<00:05:36.300> a

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
thought it'd be nice as a way to have a

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.090 
thought it'd be nice as a way to have a
little<00:05:36.630> extra<00:05:36.870> light<00:05:38.180> and<00:05:39.530> the<00:05:40.530> other<00:05:40.680> kind<00:05:41.040> of

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
little extra light and the other kind of

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.500 
little extra light and the other kind of
cool<00:05:41.250> thing<00:05:41.430> about<00:05:41.550> this<00:05:41.820> is<00:05:41.880> that<00:05:42.030> it's<00:05:42.360> not

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
cool thing about this is that it's not

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.170 
cool thing about this is that it's not
just<00:05:42.870> one<00:05:43.110> color<00:05:43.380> I<00:05:43.530> can<00:05:44.120> scroll<00:05:45.120> through

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
just one color I can scroll through

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.240 
just one color I can scroll through
pretty<00:05:46.110> much<00:05:46.350> every<00:05:46.740> color<00:05:46.950> in<00:05:47.130> the<00:05:47.190> rainbow

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
pretty much every color in the rainbow

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.770 
pretty much every color in the rainbow
you<00:05:50.250> know<00:05:50.370> weight<00:05:50.669> is<00:05:50.790> just<00:05:50.820> kind<00:05:51.510> of<00:05:51.570> classy

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
you know weight is just kind of classy

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:58.120 
you know weight is just kind of classy
and<00:05:52.020> nice<00:05:53.300> and<00:05:54.300> so<00:05:54.480> that's<00:05:54.690> the<00:05:54.840> added<00:05:55.140> bling

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.490 
through YouTube but this is mine and I'm
really<00:06:29.370> proud<00:06:29.610> of<00:06:29.669> it<00:06:29.970> it<00:06:30.870> doesn't<00:06:31.080> have<00:06:31.229> the

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.170 
really proud of it it doesn't have the
physical<00:06:31.890> controllers<00:06:32.640> like<00:06:32.820> some<00:06:33.030> other

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
physical controllers like some other

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.620 
physical controllers like some other
ones<00:06:33.390> do<00:06:33.600> it<00:06:34.590> may<00:06:34.890> not<00:06:35.130> look<00:06:35.760> as<00:06:36.000> pretty<00:06:36.090> on<00:06:36.390> the

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630

outside<00:06:36.660> as<00:06:37.169> some<00:06:37.350> other<00:06:37.500> ones<00:06:37.590> do<00:06:37.919> but<00:06:38.990> it

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
outside as some other ones do but it

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.300 
outside as some other ones do but it
actually<00:06:40.380> came<00:06:40.530> out<00:06:40.650> really<00:06:40.890> great<00:06:41.040> and<00:06:41.250> I

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310
