 something there is a theory that we are all recycled 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:27.229
 another theory is the fifth of the day 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:31.919
 twitter the root beng theory that since the beginning of time the avatar

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:40.589

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.529
 terrifying superstore that I carry in the middle of the night 

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:13.209

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:54.179

 kick PCs to the face of the tire 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.830
 the only certain thing is that they were attacked had to be something 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.210
 big of very dangerous we hope that women are well because they do not control 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.389
 on the internet the police reports I have already checked do not talk about 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.779
 missing tramps don't make the news 

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:56.609

 there is some women's news 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:37.819
 everyone we talked to had at least one missing friend 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.020
 via one of these delivered a club news 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.380
 new signals are concentrated in the port area well then it is free 

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:55.240
 someone explains to me why it always touches fresh mind 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.680
 especially when they are hunting for sharks 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.159
 but what a friction 

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:01.649
 I almost hope it comes soon but 

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:03.189
 nothing happens here 

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:04.110
