00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.639
 How about how you are welcome to come to 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:14.510
 the green route on youtube on the day of 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:16.939
 today more curious data notes 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.880
 interesting about more of this room 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:22.850
 planet in our full solar system 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.580
 of iron oxide that gives that hue 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.460
 reddish although not as reddish as 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.289
 principle they really showed us their 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.780
 structure and its form is quite 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:36.470
 similar to the land to a desert 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.870
 terrestrial at least and it is known that no 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.000
 the planet was as dead as it was 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.210
 I thought you know now certain 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.760
 water fluids from stations that although 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.260
 some things were theoretically now 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.570
 they have been confirmed with the probe 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.320
 curiosity this curious way that we 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.290
 will probably bring information 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.780
 incredible about this planet in our 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.059
 solar system and it also seems to me 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.920
 that this planet known as the 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.240
 planet of war since the Romans 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.799
 the news of the century at some point 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.860
 right now I am struck by this 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.310
 image is one of the most images 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:20.549
 interesting mars can see several 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.490
 characteristics of this supposed object 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.470
 that looks like the star destroyer of 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.750
 star wars not to this image that you see now 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.880
 but good regardless of the 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.119
 similar ones that have the characteristics 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.970
 of this object are incredible 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.970
 first the texture is very different from the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.580
 texture that is around this 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.369
 object in second also the object 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.560
 it stands out as if it were something 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.500
 different as if its structure were 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.659
 different you can simply can 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.569
 seem artificial the truth the object 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.520
 it does not seem like as has the 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.700
 formations if you see the image 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.580
 complete since you will realize that the 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.080
 way is quite interesting 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.600
 obviously we can not know if this 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.080
 it's artificial at least at the moment 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.180
 although there would be 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.150
 and analyze this image well 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.250
 in detail and if we had another 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.800
 angle of this image would be amazing 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.160
 because if we could really see 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.310
 complete the form for now this is from 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.810
 the most curious images more 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.940
 interesting and strange of those who have 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.640
 sent this probe curiosity that your 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.980
 same name says it all I invite you 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.140
 also to watch the next video of 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.600
 the route to see where we are going to analyze 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.750
 some aspects that have arisen about 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.750
 the moon pretty weird pretty 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.760
 curious and good because they connect yes by 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.500
 there to our social networks is the route 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.590
 green we are now that they come down in 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.310
 instagram on twitter on facebook and 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.440
 obviously here on youtube as well 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.150
 at night we have been broadcasting 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.150
 via pedis with quite interesting 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.270
 because it allows us to talk live and it's 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.730
 pretty final and that is this network 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.270
 social for now, I invite you to mena 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:13.080
 continue in the next video 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.080
 Until that
