going to be mostly either a physical
witch<00:00:20.850> doctor<00:00:21.330> or<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.660> physical<00:00:22.529> monk<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.580> don't

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
witch doctor or a physical monk I don't

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.509 
witch doctor or a physical monk I don't
really<00:00:24.539> see<00:00:24.689> where<00:00:25.109> else<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.410> could<00:00:25.560> get<00:00:25.769> real

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
really see where else you could get real

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.060 
really see where else you could get real
good<00:00:26.789> damage<00:00:27.210> or<00:00:27.359> real<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.689> real<00:00:27.779> necessity<00:00:28.380> for

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
good damage or real a real necessity for

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.560 
good damage or real a real necessity for
it<00:00:29.189> um<00:00:30.349> but<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.710> want<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.579> say<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.969> as<00:00:33.149> it

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
it um but I want to say that as it

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.170 
it um but I want to say that as it
applies<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.840> which<00:00:34.200> doctors<00:00:34.649> very<00:00:35.610> carefully

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
applies to which doctors very carefully

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.260 
applies to which doctors very carefully
because<00:00:37.670> the<00:00:38.809> critical<00:00:39.809> hit<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.590> pet

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
because the critical hit of a pet

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.209 
because the critical hit of a pet
doesn't<00:00:42.270> cause<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.750> effect<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.170> occur<00:00:43.440> so

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
doesn't cause this effect to occur so

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.160 
doesn't cause this effect to occur so
