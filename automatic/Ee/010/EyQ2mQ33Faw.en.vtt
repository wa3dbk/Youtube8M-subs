00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:12.769
 this moment we will do any 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.769
 I tended to a point. we will have a medium carrier 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.800
 it's either herbal feed 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.610
 it needs to be soaked with something 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.610
 sputum 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.080
 salt pepper salt pepper and everything and more 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.080
 nothing 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.990
 not 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:52.449
 if you speak Russian then this is a neck 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:54.280
 closer the neck closer to the shoulder blade is itself alone 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.620
 of the fattest parts one of the most 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.550
 fatty portions this is the juiciest steaks 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.550
 always it turns out 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.890
 it is desirable to roast media player 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.890
 then it will be the most delicious 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.840
 and to the maximum and that's neat all 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.390
 my technology up is that 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:48.710
 turn over every 15 seconds then 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.710
 succulence remains 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.300
 so everything is everything yes yes yes yes we turn off 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.829
 sorry to find 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.829
 so put 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.569
 so now see rosemary 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.299
 one twig take a twig and 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.690
 This is such a big half. 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:33.210
 in half 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.150
 for each worth 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:40.280
 in front of me with his hand do not be afraid of it 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.280
 this food is all accepted by hand 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.040
 marbling the higher the marble meat 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.400
 better and more tasty and juicier and flavor 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.400
 a certain
