00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
beautiful little adulation if you catch

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.560 
beautiful little adulation if you catch
your<00:01:42.250> big<00:01:42.430> fish<00:01:42.670> you<00:01:42.820> can<00:01:42.940> throw<00:01:43.119> your<00:01:43.270> paddle

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
your big fish you can throw your paddle

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.840 
your big fish you can throw your paddle
hook<00:01:43.780> if<00:01:44.289> you<00:01:44.560> you<00:01:45.460> know<00:01:45.520> for<00:01:45.700> whatever

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
hook if you you know for whatever

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.100 
hook if you you know for whatever
reasonable<00:01:46.420> is<00:01:46.479> you<00:01:46.600> paddle<00:01:46.869> you're<00:01:46.990> not

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
reasonable is you paddle you're not

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.640 
reasonable is you paddle you're not
going<00:01:47.259> to<00:01:47.610> lose<00:01:48.610> your<00:01:48.820> paddle

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
going to lose your paddle

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.770 
going to lose your paddle
so<00:01:51.220> that's<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:51.610> one<00:01:51.730> for<00:01:52.000> this<00:01:52.090> guy<00:01:52.330> in<00:01:52.570> here

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
so that's the one for this guy in here

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.320 
so that's the one for this guy in here
this<00:01:52.900> is<00:01:52.960> just<00:01:53.200> a<00:01:53.320> separate<00:01:53.680> one<00:01:53.970> get<00:01:54.970> one<00:01:55.210> of

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
this is just a separate one get one of

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.780 
this is just a separate one get one of
them<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:57.250> you<00:01:57.970> just<00:01:59.280> once<00:02:00.280> you've<00:02:00.430> unwrapped

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
them so you just once you've unwrapped

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.550 
them so you just once you've unwrapped
your<00:02:00.940> kayak<00:02:01.270> you<00:02:01.300> get<00:02:01.600> this<00:02:01.720> all<00:02:02.140> this<00:02:02.260> stuff

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
your kayak you get this all this stuff

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.480 
your kayak you get this all this stuff
out<00:02:02.740> and<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.010> first<00:02:03.220> thing<00:02:03.370> you<00:02:03.460> probably

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
out and the first thing you probably

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.240 
out and the first thing you probably
going<00:02:03.850> to<00:02:03.910> do<00:02:04.000> is<00:02:04.120> just<00:02:04.270> pop<00:02:04.510> this<00:02:05.380> in<00:02:06.240> so

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
going to do is just pop this in so

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.650 
going to do is just pop this in so
actually<00:02:09.250> comes<00:02:09.490> with<00:02:09.670> an<00:02:09.790> allen<00:02:10.060> key<00:02:10.090> that

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
actually comes with an allen key that

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.770 
actually comes with an allen key that
most<00:02:10.869> people<00:02:11.200> got<00:02:11.320> an<00:02:11.470> allen<00:02:11.710> key<00:02:11.740> around<00:02:12.780> now

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
most people got an allen key around now

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.590 
most people got an allen key around now
the<00:02:13.840> thing<00:02:14.230> is<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:15.580> may<00:02:15.760> find<00:02:16.060> there's<00:02:16.330> not<00:02:16.570> a

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
the thing is you may find there's not a

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.660 
the thing is you may find there's not a
perfect<00:02:17.440> match<00:02:17.710> between<00:02:17.950> this<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:18.550> this

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
perfect match between this and this

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.220 
perfect match between this and this
because<00:02:19.030> there's<00:02:19.210> all<00:02:19.360> sorts<00:02:19.630> of<00:02:19.720> forces<00:02:20.110> of

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
because there's all sorts of forces of

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.050 
because there's all sorts of forces of
expansion<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:20.950> contraction<00:02:21.130> in<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.640> molding

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
expansion and contraction in the molding

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.540 
expansion and contraction in the molding
process<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.600> kayak<00:02:23.250> there<00:02:24.250> could<00:02:24.400> be<00:02:24.430> a

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
process to the kayak there could be a

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.600 
process to the kayak there could be a
meal<00:02:24.910> or<00:02:25.150> two<00:02:25.390> mil<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:26.860> expansion<00:02:27.580> and

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
meal or two mil of expansion and

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.550 
meal or two mil of expansion and
contraction<00:02:27.850> that<00:02:30.990> it<00:02:31.990> might<00:02:32.140> take<00:02:32.170> this

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
contraction that it might take this

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.050 
contraction that it might take this
slightly<00:02:33.040> off-center<00:02:33.730> just<00:02:33.940> the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
slightly off-center just the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.700 
slightly off-center just the
ever-so-slight<00:02:34.810> so<00:02:37.020> you<00:02:38.020> just<00:02:38.200> don't<00:02:38.470> want<00:02:38.650> to

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
ever-so-slight so you just don't want to

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.550 
ever-so-slight so you just don't want to
screw<00:02:39.220> them<00:02:39.400> all<00:02:39.520> in<00:02:39.700> at<00:02:39.790> once<00:02:40.230> screw<00:02:41.230> them<00:02:41.410> all

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
screw them all in at once screw them all

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.460 
screw them all in at once screw them all
in<00:02:42.540> what<00:02:43.540> I<00:02:43.570> mean<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.840> say<00:02:43.990> is<00:02:44.050> you<00:02:44.110> don't<00:02:44.230> want

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
in what I mean to say is you don't want

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.260 
in what I mean to say is you don't want
to<00:02:44.560> screw<00:02:44.800> one<00:02:44.920> in<00:02:45.070> really<00:02:45.400> hard<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:45.910> then<00:02:46.060> try

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
to screw one in really hard and then try

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.430 
to screw one in really hard and then try
and<00:02:46.420> screw<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.750> others<00:02:46.990> because<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.290> might

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
and screw the others because you might

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.140 
and screw the others because you might
find<00:02:47.620> doesn't<00:02:48.040> fit<00:02:48.160> but<00:02:48.280> if<00:02:48.400> you<00:02:48.520> start<00:02:49.000> them

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
find doesn't fit but if you start them

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.260 
find doesn't fit but if you start them
all<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:51.070> you<00:02:51.160> just<00:02:51.370> make<00:02:51.610> sure<00:02:51.640> they<00:02:52.000> all<00:02:52.710> bite

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
all and you just make sure they all bite

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.030 
all and you just make sure they all bite
then<00:02:55.270> you'll<00:02:55.420> be<00:02:55.510> fine<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:55.959> you<00:02:56.050> just<00:02:56.230> tighten

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
then you'll be fine and you just tighten

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.100 
then you'll be fine and you just tighten
them<00:02:57.250> up<00:02:57.340> it's<00:02:57.970> that<00:02:58.150> critical<00:02:58.390> but<00:02:58.780> better<00:02:58.989> to

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
them up it's that critical but better to

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.990 
them up it's that critical but better to
start<00:02:59.440> first<00:02:59.860> you<00:03:00.100> do<00:03:00.310> all<00:03:00.520> of<00:03:00.550> them<00:03:00.790> just

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
start first you do all of them just

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.640 
start first you do all of them just
really<00:03:01.270> couple<00:03:01.810> of<00:03:01.900> times<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.470> make<00:03:02.620> sure

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
really couple of times to make sure

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.500 
really couple of times to make sure
they're<00:03:03.040> getting<00:03:03.750> where<00:03:04.750> they<00:03:04.780> need<00:03:04.930> to<00:03:05.110> be

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.259 

then<00:03:09.379> you<00:03:09.470> can<00:03:09.620> type<00:03:09.799> them<00:03:09.950> up<00:03:10.069> now<00:03:10.370> in<00:03:10.970> mind

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
then you can type them up now in mind

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.740 
then you can type them up now in mind
