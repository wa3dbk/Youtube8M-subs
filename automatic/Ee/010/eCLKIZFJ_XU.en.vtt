00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:15.660
 what the kipper are cordially 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.150
 Welcome to the next part of two ports 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.009
 minutes though I have this time 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.480
 it will halve in half 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.700
 than two minutes before Günter the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.470
 to come crying out 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.259
 you wanted a little bit this time 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.009
 know more and once what are 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.930
 my hobbies outside the shed 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.000
 and what 's my favorite food plus 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.899
 Favorite drinking that concludes the whole thing 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.820
 somehow with one 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.940
 and for those who may not yet 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.680
 quite know these ports two minutes there 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.390
 That's why it's a little bit for me 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.270
 I get to know the questions 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.520
 answer that you ask me so you 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.050
 then these videos comments on her sorry 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.120
 the commentary for you on 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.370
 is most interesting and I'll read then 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.260
 Exactly on this comment one if it 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.600
 most likes having so if that 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.730
 number one comment is it's me 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.369
 decide that they so comments 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.689
 So a bit borderline is that 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.630
 the community again all the way to 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.399
 was crazy or or that a topic 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.840
 maybe something will be picked up 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.819
 ever mentioned but everything looks up 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.889
 every case again in the playlist 

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:18.060
 There are already many consequences 

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:19.950
 ports two minutes 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.929
 that's a bit like a faq 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.030
 has that over a longer time 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.409
 pull and where you always something new 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.149
 you remember what they know about me 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.709
 wanted with what you always 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.600
 and then I try 

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:32.459
 to approach you in any case 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.740

 Outside of London definitely do 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.600
 I really like to sport our whole 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.159
 Family is super sporty 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.249
 In any case , our role model is already ours 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.829
 father of marathon runners is also in 

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:51.420
 high age or middle age like 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.159
 Whatever you see in any case 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.990
 he still hopes marathon I think 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.170
 Coming Tomorrow even something again 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.599
 Well, definitely we are all doing great 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.439
 I like to go into the sport 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:03.689
 fitness studio 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.009
 this is my hobby number 1 so me 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.669
 Try me too 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.670
 feed 

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:11.220
 I train three times a week I give 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.349
 always full gas so as this in my 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.640
 knows videos knows I'm always right 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.750
 with emotions being outside the 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.820
 gyms 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.470
 I like inliner so much then 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.030
 I like to take my girlfriends 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.520
 we're going to ride together I would be great 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.490
 great ways here super good stretch where 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.350
 you just simply times right 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.270
 long straight where you have really nice 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.180
 can give full throttle or we have to 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.550
 example once every few months i 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.780
 want this skate by night 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.970
 Maybe that one or the one knows 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.230
 others of you just in the evening with 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.360
 really many friends relatives 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.630
 driving inliner 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.660
 and now that the summer I'm swimming 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.570
 and I really like grilling there 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.810
 actually rather free places so with 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.410
 meadow with beach with the possibility too 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.500
 grilling 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.600
 So I do not like bathing 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.910
 although there are hot tubs there as well 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.470
 but sometimes I like it 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.570
 It is better if you stop the possibility 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.880
 has its once in the wild nature too 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.140
 be and also to barbecue and 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.760
 you can not do that in the pictures 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.200
 just a good piece of meat 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.120
 then eat in the sun 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.520
 bit yourself to sizzle and if it is 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.050
 too hot will get wet in the cool and if 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.549
 The whole thing then repeat again 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.080
 because you calorie them a little 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.810
 has burned like a game unbelievable 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.299
 like to take volleyball or or 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.850
 us little football with us in the hotel 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.709
 throw most of the girlfriend with friends 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.299
 known and yes then again a few 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.980
 Burn calories out again 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.510
 eat a sausage or study good 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.890
 piece of meat then back in the sun 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.600
 and repeat the whole thing 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.570
 repeat until it is sometime in the evening 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.910
 or the sun goes down and outside 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.579
 this whole sporty 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.680
 outdoor activities I go extremely 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.880
 happy to go to the cinema i love this whole 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.380
 fantasy genre 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.989
 That's probably why I moved like that 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.299
 like to league of legends and that means 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.910
 for me godzilla oh yeah i have god 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.650

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.660
 i grew up with godzilla since i can 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.790
 you absolutely recommend otherwise have 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.820
 I lately in the cinema still spiderman 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.530
 Then I looked at it with a rise of electro 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.470
 I looked at x-men now as 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.510
 next transformer so this 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.070

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.200
 now come out and eat 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.350
 I like to try as I said 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.430
 to consciously feed myself healthy 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.600
 I have such a little bit 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.310
 background knowledge because I too one 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.760
 completed studies in this direction 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.430
 have 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.950
 but my favorite food I eat 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.380

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.480

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.790
