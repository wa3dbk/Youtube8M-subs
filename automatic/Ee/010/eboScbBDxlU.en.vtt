00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
is complete crap as tears six but that's

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.740 
is complete crap as tears six but that's
just<00:02:30.340> my<00:02:30.519> opinion<00:02:30.549> you<00:02:31.060> guys<00:02:31.239> can<00:02:31.420> buy<00:02:31.569> it<00:02:31.629> if

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
just my opinion you guys can buy it if

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.020 
just my opinion you guys can buy it if
you<00:02:31.840> want<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:33.250> looks<00:02:34.049> actually<00:02:35.049> looks<00:02:36.030> pretty

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.300 
you want it looks actually looks pretty
cool<00:02:37.299> with<00:02:37.690> this<00:02:37.870> cage<00:02:38.410> mesh<00:02:38.739> thing<00:02:41.190> but<00:02:42.190> it

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
cool with this cage mesh thing but it

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.039 
cool with this cage mesh thing but it
doesn't<00:02:42.549> move<00:02:42.610> any<00:02:42.819> faster<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.599> doesn't<00:02:43.900> turn

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
doesn't move any faster it doesn't turn

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:50.099 
doesn't move any faster it doesn't turn
any<00:02:44.319> faster<00:02:44.769> and<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:46.390> shoots<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:49.540> same<00:02:49.810> round

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
any faster and it shoots the same round

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.930 
any faster and it shoots the same round
as<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.500> panther<00:02:50.799> m10<00:02:51.660> so<00:02:52.660> i<00:02:52.690> guess<00:02:53.170> if<00:02:53.590> you

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
as the panther m10 so i guess if you

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.050 
as the panther m10 so i guess if you
wanted<00:02:54.940> a<00:02:55.060> panther<00:02:55.390> m10<00:02:56.609> but<00:02:57.609> you<00:02:57.730> didn't<00:02:57.940> have

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
wanted a panther m10 but you didn't have

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.819 
wanted a panther m10 but you didn't have
the<00:02:58.239> credits<00:02:58.569> I<00:02:58.780> mean<00:02:59.079> you<00:02:59.379> didn't<00:02:59.620> have<00:02:59.739> the

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
the credits I mean you didn't have the
