advantage in points in the paint I think

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.460 
advantage in points in the paint I think
the<00:05:55.490> defense<00:05:55.669> hostage<00:05:56.330> in<00:05:56.479> points<00:05:57.139> in<00:05:57.319> the

the defense hostage in points in the

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.550 
the defense hostage in points in the
paint<00:05:57.770> I<00:05:58.310> think<00:05:58.789> the<00:05:58.940> defense<00:05:59.539> has<00:05:59.930> to<00:05:59.960> make<00:06:00.440> an

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
paint I think the defense has to make an

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.980 
paint I think the defense has to make an
adjustment<00:06:00.650> to<00:06:01.159> protect<00:06:01.610> the<00:06:01.699> middle<00:06:01.990> both

adjustment to protect the middle both

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:11.270 
adjustment to protect the middle both
teams<00:06:03.319> will<00:06:03.590> make<00:06:03.740> substitutions
