00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.890 
so what I do to my eyes for college
usually<00:00:54.160> depends<00:00:54.760> on<00:00:54.850> the<00:00:54.940> mood<00:00:55.090> I'm<00:00:55.210> in<00:00:55.420> but

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
the color was evenly distributed and I

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.950 
the color was evenly distributed and I
just<00:01:18.550> picked<00:01:18.729> up<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:19.030> same<00:01:19.210> eyeliner<00:01:19.660> brush

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960

palette<00:01:21.850> and<00:01:22.360> I<00:01:22.869> applied<00:01:23.170> that<00:01:23.200> to<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.680> outer

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
palette and I applied that to the outer

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.560 
palette and I applied that to the outer
half<00:01:24.130> of<00:01:24.310> my<00:01:24.369> bottom<00:01:24.789> lash<00:01:24.970> line<00:01:25.210> and<00:01:25.330> kind<00:01:25.479> of

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
half of my bottom lash line and kind of

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.029 
half of my bottom lash line and kind of
smudged<00:01:25.840> it<00:01:26.020> out<00:01:26.140> to<00:01:26.590> make<00:01:26.680> my<00:01:26.830> eyes<00:01:27.009> look

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:29.490 
smudged it out to make my eyes look
bigger<00:01:27.880> because<00:01:28.300> my<00:01:28.539> eyes<00:01:28.869> are<00:01:29.080> really<00:01:29.200> small
