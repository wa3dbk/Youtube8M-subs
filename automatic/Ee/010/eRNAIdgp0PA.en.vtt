00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.770
 Hi guys, I'm 188 and today we're going to 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.050
 cure the cold of our birds 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.289
 as 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.480
 with garlic this is a home remedy that goes 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.980
 to come great when your bird 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.380
 he is decayed that he does not eat that he does not drink 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.940
 You see that he is not as active as you are 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.519
 and garlic zasca garlic smells good a 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.860
 bit as strong as bad in your 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:42.930
 pestilent aroma and its strength is 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.720
 responsible for this smell is a compound 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.239
 sulfur that is called sulfide de ali what 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.489
 which decomposes on contact with the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.829
 air to decompose creates another 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.899
 substance called allicin there is 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.920
 where I want to get to the allicin the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:02.370
 allicin is let's go for the allicin is the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.500
 strongest component that has the the 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.590
 stronger and acts like a strong 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.940
 antibiotic and an effective fungicide 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.820
 let's cure fungi and bacteria at 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.679
 he kills them but he kills them 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.500
 his fame after he lived tico comes to that the 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:21.560
 Allicin from garlic copes with germs and 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.009
 bacteria such as 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.369
 the gastro in infections 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.580
 gastrointestinal infections 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.640
 bronchopulmonary 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.880
 so what happens that garlic is going to 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.310
 save from all this how garlic how and 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.520
 where do we have to put it on then we're going to 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.520
 it 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:54.280
 well once with the peeled garlic 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:57.610
 we proceed to cut it cut it by the 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:01.030
 half and of this half we use only 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:05.380
 medium means as we receive so by the 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:08.460
 half and so on four pieces 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.190
 this where we are going to put it 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.880
 in the drinking fountain 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.050
 we throw it like this in the drinking fountain 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.050
 we closed the sprue 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.830
 and we have our antibiotic ready 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.380
 for our birds 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.100
 with this the bird will notice a 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.380
 improvement in one or two days we go thing 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.510
 bad if you see that once put to 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.090
 bird pooch react in time 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.090
 with garlic is a terrific antibiotic and 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.370
 the bird improves perfect if at the second 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.230
 day you see that the bird is still equal to 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.820
