this<00:05:34.830> economic<00:05:35.400> climate<00:05:35.430> that<00:05:35.970> more<00:05:36.180> and<00:05:36.270> more

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
this economic climate that more and more

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.240 
this economic climate that more and more
parents<00:05:36.840> are<00:05:37.080> in<00:05:37.289> that<00:05:37.410> situation<00:05:37.560> where<00:05:38.100> they

tough<00:05:59.430> we<00:05:59.610> just<00:05:59.849> can't<00:06:00.030> afford<00:06:00.060> to<00:06:00.330> do<00:06:00.479> it<00:06:00.510> this

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
tough we just can't afford to do it this

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.839 
tough we just can't afford to do it this
year<00:06:00.720> so<00:06:01.320> it's<00:06:01.860> becoming<00:06:02.250> more<00:06:02.520> and<00:06:02.580> more

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849 
year so it's becoming more and more

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:04.610 
year so it's becoming more and more
acceptable<00:06:03.599> to<00:06:03.840> talk<00:06:04.020> about<00:06:04.169> it<00:06:04.349> which<00:06:04.470> means

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
acceptable to talk about it which means

this<00:06:04.950> is<00:06:05.130> a<00:06:05.160> great<00:06:05.700> time<00:06:05.940> to<00:06:06.000> bring<00:06:06.270> it<00:06:06.389> up

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
this is a great time to bring it up

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.060 
this is a great time to bring it up

to get hundred percent of everything in
front<00:06:23.820> of<00:06:24.000> us<00:06:24.060> before<00:06:24.419> we<00:06:24.450> even<00:06:24.660> get<00:06:24.870> started

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
front of us before we even get started

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.750 
front of us before we even get started
we<00:06:25.440> need<00:06:25.470> to<00:06:25.650> have<00:06:25.770> all<00:06:25.800> of<00:06:26.099> our<00:06:26.190> accounts<00:06:26.430> laid

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
our money's going and of course we end

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.029 
our money's going and of course we end
up<00:06:30.210> doing<00:06:30.510> nothing<00:06:30.660> the<00:06:31.530> eighty-five<00:06:31.890> percent

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 
up doing nothing the eighty-five percent

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:33.649 
up doing nothing the eighty-five percent
solution<00:06:32.370> says<00:06:32.789> it's<00:06:33.030> better<00:06:33.360> to<00:06:33.539> get

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:33.659 
solution says it's better to get

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:34.820 
solution says it's better to get
eighty-five<00:06:34.169> percent<00:06:34.289> of<00:06:34.530> the<00:06:34.590> way<00:06:34.650> there

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
eighty-five percent of the way there

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:35.460 
eighty-five percent of the way there
then

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470 
then

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.260 
then
to<00:06:35.530> get<00:06:35.680> zero<00:06:36.160> percent<00:06:36.520> of<00:06:36.580> the<00:06:36.640> way<00:06:36.730> there<00:06:36.910> so

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.270 
to get zero percent of the way there so

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.300 
to get zero percent of the way there so
