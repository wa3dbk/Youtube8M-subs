00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.719
 we find today here in gta 5 for pc and 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.400
 the truth is that a long time ago 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.170
 that does not count 5 for pc said these 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.699
 because of playing a few races in ger 5 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.230
 for pc can be a good choice and 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.480
 effectively that's what I 've done 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.580
 my god is really worth is critical 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.920
 when I started it was 5 pc no no no no no 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.779
 can control the car well a girl 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.149
 you know you were here a very cool race 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.190
 in which there is a piece of lupine I do not know 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.290
 nor what is that what there is there that 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.760
 gigantic has like a looping with with 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.950
 trucks on the sides there is a keyboard on 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.660
 bike thing that I think it will not come out 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.309
 well because the race put in the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.050
 dismissed from the race only is 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.430
 anqing xl which is the car that I have 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.079
 so nobody has put on the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.300
 car so I hope to win because the 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.129
 description of the case 22 thousand times 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.750
 repeated so I hope the momentum 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.070
 projects and what recipe 5 seems to stop 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.199
 a piece of life without many people 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.190
 that is most console but think 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.079
 that here there are races that you have not 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.079
 seen and can be very cool how it is 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.409
 careful states and as if like 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.399
 stabilized the car when I'm in the 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.259
 air 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:12.850
 I think with the keyboard numbers there 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.020
 I do not know how to buy a command of this 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.979
 it is taking this that you plug them in 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:23.200
 computer and then well do not scratch this 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.119
 I do not know how to handle everything 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.979
 perfectly you know I think it's here not 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.340
 effectively clear with the balls 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.340
 they 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.590
 what is that 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:46.550
 like a shower listening to the guys 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.830
 what is said when when it is in the air 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.670
 You can control the car with different 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.670
 eyes 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:02:00.830
 albino kills authorities he wants 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:02.660
 when I say it but well we will try 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.910
 catch him guys for I do not know how much 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.080
 missing how you look at the uncle is that no 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.060
 I want to press a button to see if I get out 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.160
 the race gave hundred controls 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.370
 discards five parts to see if why 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.080
 be the marker not on the cv that 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.900
 neither is the radio career 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.240
 link is the ac is effectively 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.460
 Okay, so I was about to complete 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.600
 back ok then let's pummeling 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.600
 the motorcycle only passed the first 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.300
 bush 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:42.120
 dabul because it looks very good there is 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.489
 say that 5 eye 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.140
 massa seÃ±orito that you fall Pring 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:51.390
 well because it's in quotes it 's 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.739
 cheating but I take a motorcycle the 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.460
 motorcycles this has allowed to put the 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.260
 description only shanklin xl 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.640
 we can not worth it forward policies 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.740
 guys under any of the concepts 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.910
 have under any of the concepts 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.910
 guys we can allow later 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.430
 the good thing about this being playing on pc 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.739
 is that you can do anything that makes me 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.989
 overtake with the jump god I thought 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.329
 the good thing about this kind of genre 5 for 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.829
 fish that you can look very good at your 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:26.450
 around by the middle of things is 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.129
 a piggy is really a 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.540
 guarrindongas then I have over 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.540
 I have the bad luck that I just 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.450
 it's our only chance that in 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.190

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.260
 partner and I will tell you why there

 to turn around and the goal is here 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.659
 so our nick opportunities has 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.099
 four companions of the return here 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.310
 where we put a smack in 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.310
 here 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.490

00:03:52.280 --> 00:04:00.170
 and is that many smart 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.720

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.840
 liberator and I guys go to four 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:11.239
 Checkpoints are going to leave me 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:14.770
 to go on the last male please that 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.770
 it will be files 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.820
 As the 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:33.710
 I have no paying for a few millimeters 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:37.640
 guys I want to revenge 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:42.050
 in a race more I do not know in which but 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.850
 I want the rematch and the return as 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.900
 writer is a little trick I do not know why 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.850
 there's an uncle who has put on a whole 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.830
 backwards super little the truth but good the 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.840
 classic is to win everything clear 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.070
 you know it and we all know it and I do not know why 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.290
 what do I take the time when this reality is 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.300
 handles with one hand here to do the 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.650
 horse is already that we also at the same 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.980
 human but you buy complicated by 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.980
 here 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:06.650
 but 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:08.360
 madryn and guys I just found out about 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.990
 that the SUV runs more than the 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:15.450
 motorcycles guys the bulls 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:19.980
 everything runs as you are listening 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:23.400
 to sack to catch read some way 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.930
 useful I'm on top of the bike over 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.450
 what he wanted and when he can forward us 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.910
 hit a smack guys you put the thing 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.639
 quite tense the truth to see how 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:37.430
 we would arrive this day 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:41.319
 it's difficult is now the time now and 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:43.580
 is at the moment he is not being piggy 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:45.110
 for love there is the I was 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.419
 concentrated trying to stay 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.710
 I will advance alpine to the curves just 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:50.270
 what you seek a site already runs more than 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.099
 the bike and what is it that happens 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.379
 see these races are cars and motorcycles 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:55.879
 because good if you put in the class of 

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:57.259
 off-road race racing 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:58.729
 You can take motorcycle knots and take the motorbike 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:01.039
 because the one that runs the most but it seems that 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:03.229
 the car of this last dlc runs more 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.969
 that motorcycles with it purple because 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:07.099
 so people can also host cars 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:10.310
 paraguay then let's give cane to see 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:13.439
 if we manage to win it costs a lot and 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:16.659
 run very much I feel guys 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:19.960
 left left and this one I have 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:21.250
 very stuck to the highs to the best in the 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.050
 high not because the bike can be 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.900
 die but the tall little ones is a lot 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.129
 better the motorbike because so I think 7 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.930
 stabilizes faster and all fishing 

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:30.669
 for guys if we carry it behind a lot 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.770
 be very careful because we could 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:35.700
 encourage or how are we going 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.910
 ok no no no no no no no no no no 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.910

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.800
 I do not know how I'll miss seeing there for 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.120
 stay seven checkpoints guys 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.400
