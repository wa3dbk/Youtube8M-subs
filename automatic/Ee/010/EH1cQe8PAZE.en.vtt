00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
probably looking at about three to four

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.810 
probably looking at about three to four
days<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.840> refrigerator<00:00:34.399> so<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.670> can

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
days in the refrigerator so that it can

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
fall out because you can't just take a

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.010 
fall out because you can't just take a
turkey<00:00:37.739> out<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:37.980> freezer<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.430> cook<00:00:38.760> it

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
okay the next step is actually

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.840 
okay the next step is actually
unwrapping<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.350> turkey<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.010> be<00:00:44.399> sure<00:00:44.610> when

with everyone so I mean that's that's

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.509 
with everyone so I mean that's that's
the<00:04:09.959> gist<00:04:10.260> of<00:04:10.440> it<00:04:10.590> it's<00:04:10.769> it's<00:04:11.010> not<00:04:11.160> a<00:04:11.220> very

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
the gist of it it's it's not a very

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.940 
the gist of it it's it's not a very
complex<00:04:12.000> process<00:04:12.590> but<00:04:13.590> it's<00:04:13.769> definitely

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
complex process but it's definitely

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.039 
complex process but it's definitely
something<00:04:14.459> that<00:04:14.730> I'm<00:04:14.850> sure<00:04:14.880> you're<00:04:15.420> not<00:04:15.989> a

something that I'm sure you're not a

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.659 
something that I'm sure you're not a
hundred<00:04:16.289> percent<00:04:16.410> familiar<00:04:17.130> with<00:04:17.250> how<00:04:17.370> to<00:04:17.430> do
