at<00:00:26.020> the<00:00:26.109> nursery<00:00:26.439> that<00:00:26.710> we<00:00:26.800> looked<00:00:27.010> at<00:00:27.250> now

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
at the nursery that we looked at now

at the nursery that we looked at now
before<00:00:28.359> of<00:00:28.480> course<00:00:28.510> we<00:00:28.810> start<00:00:29.050> planting<00:00:29.380> where

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
before of course we start planting where

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.500 
before of course we start planting where
the<00:00:29.800> most<00:00:29.949> important<00:00:30.490> things<00:00:30.730> is<00:00:31.000> to<00:00:31.029> actually

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.510 
the most important things is to actually

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.689 
the most important things is to actually
have<00:00:31.630> water<00:00:31.930> being<00:00:32.529> able<00:00:32.680> to<00:00:32.890> be<00:00:33.010> discharged

to<00:00:34.090> each<00:00:34.269> of<00:00:34.449> the<00:00:34.510> locations<00:00:35.110> you<00:00:35.680> may

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:35.830 
to each of the locations you may

to each of the locations you may
remember<00:00:36.129> from<00:00:36.460> our<00:00:36.640> last<00:00:36.699> episode<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:38.290> water

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
remember from our last episode the water

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.710 
remember from our last episode the water
is<00:00:38.949> going<00:00:39.160> to<00:00:39.280> be<00:00:39.370> discharged<00:00:40.059> through<00:00:40.510> these

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
is going to be discharged through these

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.930 
is going to be discharged through these
small<00:00:41.110> emitters<00:00:41.680> right<00:00:42.040> here<00:00:42.339> that<00:00:42.820> are

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
small emitters right here that are

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.630 
small emitters right here that are
actually<00:00:43.089> tied<00:00:43.720> in<00:00:43.930> to<00:00:44.320> our<00:00:44.470> drip<00:00:44.680> line<00:00:44.890> but

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
actually tied in to our drip line but

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.640 
actually tied in to our drip line but
how<00:00:45.850> the<00:00:45.909> drip<00:00:46.390> line<00:00:46.420> is<00:00:46.809> tied<00:00:47.049> into<00:00:47.229> the<00:00:47.470> main

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
how the drip line is tied into the main

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.490 
how the drip line is tied into the main
water<00:00:47.949> source<00:00:48.220> the<00:00:48.549> risers<00:00:49.150> that<00:00:49.720> are<00:00:49.870> used<00:00:50.290> to

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
water source the risers that are used to

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.320 
water source the risers that are used to
tie<00:00:50.680> that<00:00:50.890> in<00:00:51.100> and<00:00:51.309> how<00:00:51.640> it's<00:00:51.820> all<00:00:51.940> connected

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.330 
tie that in and how it's all connected

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.229 
tie that in and how it's all connected
is<00:00:52.769> what<00:00:53.769> we'll<00:00:53.920> take<00:00:54.100> a<00:00:54.159> look<00:00:54.400> at<00:00:54.549> next<00:00:54.760> so

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
is what we'll take a look at next so

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:56.789 
is what we'll take a look at next so
let's<00:00:55.449> go<00:00:55.600> down<00:00:55.809> and<00:00:56.019> the<00:00:56.260> other<00:00:56.290> end<00:00:56.619> of<00:00:56.710> the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:56.799 
let's go down and the other end of the

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:00.899 
let's go down and the other end of the
rose<00:00:57.040> and<00:00:57.339> we'll<00:00:57.519> have<00:00:57.640> a<00:00:57.670> look<00:00:59.430> so<00:01:00.430> let's<00:01:00.699> take

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
rose and we'll have a look so let's take

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:03.539 
rose and we'll have a look so let's take
a<00:01:00.940> look<00:01:01.330> at<00:01:01.540> the<00:01:01.750> main<00:01:01.960> line<00:01:02.379> how<00:01:02.739> it's<00:01:03.010> tied<00:01:03.339> in

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:03.549 
a look at the main line how it's tied in

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:05.609 
a look at the main line how it's tied in
to<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:03.879> risers<00:01:04.299> and<00:01:04.510> how<00:01:04.659> those<00:01:04.900> actually<00:01:05.199> tie

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
to the risers and how those actually tie

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.490 
to the risers and how those actually tie
into<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.190> drip<00:01:06.760> line<00:01:06.790> itself<00:01:07.360> now<00:01:07.990> the<00:01:08.020> first

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
into the drip line itself now the first

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.469 
into the drip line itself now the first
thing<00:01:08.680> we<00:01:08.860> did<00:01:09.100> of<00:01:09.340> course<00:01:09.430> naturally<00:01:10.180> we<00:01:10.299> dug

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
thing we did of course naturally we dug

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.330 
thing we did of course naturally we dug
the<00:01:10.630> trench<00:01:10.780> first<00:01:11.260> and<00:01:11.500> then<00:01:11.890> after<00:01:12.159> that<00:01:12.280> I

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
the trench first and then after that I

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.890 
the trench first and then after that I
used<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:12.760> string<00:01:13.060> just<00:01:13.300> so<00:01:13.480> we<00:01:13.600> can<00:01:13.720> keep

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
used the string just so we can keep

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.260 
used the string just so we can keep
everything<00:01:14.200> nice<00:01:14.590> and<00:01:14.620> straight<00:01:15.130> after<00:01:16.090> that

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
everything nice and straight after that

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.390 
everything nice and straight after that
we<00:01:16.540> ran<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:17.260> mainline<00:01:17.800> what<00:01:18.070> you<00:01:18.190> see<00:01:18.370> right

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
we ran the mainline what you see right

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.790 
we ran the mainline what you see right
here<00:01:18.610> it's<00:01:19.450> a<00:01:19.600> one-inch<00:01:20.020> line<00:01:20.290> that<00:01:20.500> runs<00:01:20.620> from

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
here it's a one-inch line that runs from

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.100 
here it's a one-inch line that runs from
the<00:01:21.010> well<00:01:21.220> so<00:01:21.580> at<00:01:21.850> fifty<00:01:22.420> five<00:01:22.600> pounds<00:01:22.840> of

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
the well so at fifty five pounds of

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.320 
the well so at fifty five pounds of
pressure<00:01:23.320> as<00:01:23.890> it<00:01:24.100> is<00:01:24.220> now<00:01:24.460> it'll<00:01:24.730> be<00:01:24.820> plenty<00:01:25.030> to

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
pressure as it is now it'll be plenty to

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.750 
pressure as it is now it'll be plenty to
run<00:01:25.480> what<00:01:25.660> we<00:01:25.750> need<00:01:25.930> to<00:01:26.140> then<00:01:26.920> what<00:01:27.190> we<00:01:27.340> did<00:01:27.580> is

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
run what we need to then what we did is

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.110 
run what we need to then what we did is
we<00:01:28.000> pre-made<00:01:28.870> ahead<00:01:29.290> of<00:01:29.410> time<00:01:29.620> all<00:01:30.160> the<00:01:30.610> risers

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
we pre-made ahead of time all the risers

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.940 
we pre-made ahead of time all the risers
makes<00:01:31.630> it<00:01:31.780> a<00:01:31.810> little<00:01:31.960> bit<00:01:32.110> faster<00:01:32.320> than<00:01:32.680> trying

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
makes it a little bit faster than trying

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.710 
makes it a little bit faster than trying
to<00:01:33.010> actually<00:01:33.160> do<00:01:33.490> it<00:01:33.640> in<00:01:33.730> place<00:01:34.060> we<00:01:34.270> built<00:01:34.570> them

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
to actually do it in place we built them

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.070 
to actually do it in place we built them
all<00:01:34.930> ahead<00:01:35.590> and<00:01:35.800> then<00:01:36.460> you<00:01:37.030> can<00:01:37.240> see<00:01:37.480> from<00:01:37.780> here

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
all ahead and then you can see from here

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.860 
all ahead and then you can see from here
that<00:01:38.140> this<00:01:38.440> is<00:01:38.590> a<00:01:38.620> rigid<00:01:38.920> PVC<00:01:39.360> but<00:01:40.360> down<00:01:40.570> here

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
that this is a rigid PVC but down here

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.600 
that this is a rigid PVC but down here
what<00:01:41.020> we<00:01:41.140> actually<00:01:41.440> did<00:01:41.560> was<00:01:41.590> we<00:01:41.800> installed<00:01:42.370> a

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
what we actually did was we installed a

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.149 
what we actually did was we installed a
flex<00:01:43.150> line<00:01:43.420> so<00:01:44.020> that<00:01:44.050> that<00:01:44.440> way<00:01:44.620> if<00:01:44.740> I<00:01:44.860> ever<00:01:44.950> run

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
flex line so that that way if I ever run

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:46.530 
flex line so that that way if I ever run
into<00:01:45.340> it<00:01:45.520> with<00:01:45.610> my<00:01:45.730> lawnmower<00:01:45.970> we're

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
into it with my lawnmower we're

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.030 
into it with my lawnmower we're
rototilling<00:01:47.020> or<00:01:47.230> something<00:01:47.620> there's<00:01:47.950> a

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
rototilling or something there's a

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.130 
rototilling or something there's a
little<00:01:48.250> bit<00:01:48.370> of<00:01:48.460> flexibility<00:01:49.120> in<00:01:49.360> that<00:01:49.600> so<00:01:50.020> it

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
little bit of flexibility in that so it

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.649 
little bit of flexibility in that so it
doesn't<00:01:50.700> mean<00:01:51.700> so<00:01:51.880> that<00:01:52.030> it<00:01:52.120> doesn't<00:01:52.450> break

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
doesn't mean so that it doesn't break

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.910 
doesn't mean so that it doesn't break
down<00:01:52.720> underground<00:01:53.290> all<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.670> gluing<00:01:55.920> goes

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
down underground all the gluing goes

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.190 
down underground all the gluing goes
pretty<00:01:57.159> quick<00:01:57.550> but<00:01:57.850> I<00:01:58.060> wanted<00:01:58.600> to<00:01:58.659> let<00:01:58.840> it<00:01:58.990> sit

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
pretty quick but I wanted to let it sit

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.899 
pretty quick but I wanted to let it sit
for<00:01:59.229> a<00:01:59.409> whole<00:01:59.650> day<00:01:59.890> before<00:02:00.280> I<00:02:00.310> turn<00:02:00.550> the<00:02:00.700> water

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
for a whole day before I turn the water

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.170 
for a whole day before I turn the water
on<00:02:01.409> PVC<00:02:02.409> glue<00:02:02.740> can<00:02:03.070> dry<00:02:03.280> in<00:02:03.340> as<00:02:03.520> little<00:02:03.700> as<00:02:03.909> 30

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
on PVC glue can dry in as little as 30

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.300 
on PVC glue can dry in as little as 30
minutes<00:02:04.330> to<00:02:04.780> an<00:02:04.900> hour<00:02:04.960> or<00:02:05.350> so<00:02:05.560> but<00:02:05.950> I<00:02:06.010> just

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
minutes to an hour or so but I just

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.039 
minutes to an hour or so but I just
wanted<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.610> be<00:02:06.700> sure<00:02:06.940> that<00:02:06.970> we<00:02:07.330> didn't<00:02:07.600> put<00:02:07.930> the

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.049 
wanted to be sure that we didn't put the

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:10.020 
wanted to be sure that we didn't put the
pressure<00:02:08.289> on<00:02:08.500> it<00:02:08.649> too<00:02:08.830> quick<00:02:09.129> now<00:02:09.670> as<00:02:09.879> I

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
pressure on it too quick now as I

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.360 
pressure on it too quick now as I
mentioned<00:02:10.450> we<00:02:10.869> pre-built<00:02:11.680> ahead<00:02:12.040> of<00:02:12.159> time

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
mentioned we pre-built ahead of time

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.869 
mentioned we pre-built ahead of time
these<00:02:12.730> risers<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.599> each<00:02:14.140> of<00:02:14.349> these<00:02:14.470> has<00:02:14.799> a

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
these risers and each of these has a

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.610 
these risers and each of these has a
component<00:02:15.879> to<00:02:16.239> it<00:02:16.390> that<00:02:16.780> we<00:02:16.900> could<00:02:17.080> do<00:02:17.230> very

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
component to it that we could do very

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.280 
component to it that we could do very
quickly<00:02:17.950> we<00:02:18.490> probably<00:02:18.850> have<00:02:19.330> about<00:02:19.569> oh<00:02:19.930> I'd

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
quickly we probably have about oh I'd

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.410 
quickly we probably have about oh I'd
say<00:02:20.319> twelve<00:02:20.830> or<00:02:20.980> fifteen<00:02:21.100> man-hours

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
say twelve or fifteen man-hours

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.540 
say twelve or fifteen man-hours
in<00:02:22.690> all<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.110> PVC<00:02:23.710> work<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.070> really<00:02:24.190> didn't

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
in all the PVC work it really didn't

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.880 
in all the PVC work it really didn't
take<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:24.910> long<00:02:25.180> but<00:02:25.750> there's<00:02:25.990> about<00:02:26.260> one<00:02:26.560> two

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
take that long but there's about one two

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.680 
take that long but there's about one two
three<00:02:27.160> four<00:02:27.400> five<00:02:27.610> six<00:02:27.880> there's<00:02:28.120> about<00:02:28.300> seven

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
three four five six there's about seven

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.900 
three four five six there's about seven
different<00:02:28.780> pieces<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.590> this<00:02:29.800> that<00:02:30.400> once<00:02:30.670> it's

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
different pieces to this that once it's

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.700 
different pieces to this that once it's
all<00:02:31.090> glued<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:32.020> in<00:02:32.110> place<00:02:32.350> you<00:02:32.530> can<00:02:32.680> just

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
all glued and in place you can just

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.610 
all glued and in place you can just
splice<00:02:33.160> it<00:02:33.370> right<00:02:33.580> in<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:34.000> then<00:02:34.260> because<00:02:35.260> the

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
splice it right in and then because the

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.130 
splice it right in and then because the
line<00:02:35.890> here<00:02:36.340> varies<00:02:36.850> in<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.150> trench<00:02:37.480> we<00:02:37.960> use

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
line here varies in the trench we use

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.140 
line here varies in the trench we use
the<00:02:38.350> flexible<00:02:38.740> line<00:02:39.070> to<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.700> make<00:02:39.880> up<00:02:40.030> the

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
the flexible line to to make up the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.270 
the flexible line to to make up the
variations<00:02:40.750> in<00:02:40.960> the<00:02:41.350> in<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.710> main<00:02:41.890> supply

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
variations in the in the main supply

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.340 
variations in the in the main supply
line<00:02:42.520> so<00:02:43.030> let's<00:02:43.210> go<00:02:43.360> take<00:02:43.510> a<00:02:43.570> look<00:02:43.870> at<00:02:44.050> the

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
line so let's go take a look at the

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.020 
line so let's go take a look at the
different<00:02:44.650> components<00:02:44.770> here<00:02:45.430> that<00:02:45.460> this<00:02:45.850> is

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
different components here that this is

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.700 
different components here that this is
made<00:02:46.210> up<00:02:46.360> with<00:02:46.390> and<00:02:46.810> how<00:02:47.170> those<00:02:47.350> go<00:02:47.590> together

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
made up with and how those go together

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.960 
made up with and how those go together
so<00:02:50.710> here's<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.160> riser<00:02:51.370> here's<00:02:51.850> the

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
so here's the riser here's the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.340 
so here's the riser here's the
components<00:02:52.480> that<00:02:52.510> actually<00:02:52.690> make<00:02:52.990> the<00:02:53.140> riser

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
components that actually make the riser

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.260 
components that actually make the riser
up<00:02:53.620> it's<00:02:54.100> a<00:02:54.190> lot<00:02:54.370> easier<00:02:54.520> to<00:02:54.730> put<00:02:54.970> these<00:02:55.120> all

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
up it's a lot easier to put these all

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.760 
up it's a lot easier to put these all
together<00:02:55.420> away<00:02:55.930> from<00:02:55.960> the<00:02:56.170> trench<00:02:56.530> and

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
together away from the trench and

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.890 
together away from the trench and
otherwise<00:02:57.580> you're<00:02:57.850> just<00:02:58.030> trying<00:02:58.300> to<00:02:58.420> work

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
otherwise you're just trying to work

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.390 
otherwise you're just trying to work
around<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.320> dirt<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.740> getting<00:03:00.010> that<00:03:00.130> in<00:03:00.310> the

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
around the dirt and getting that in the

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.400 
around the dirt and getting that in the
PVC<00:03:00.910> glue<00:03:01.060> this<00:03:01.690> is<00:03:01.900> a<00:03:01.930> pretty<00:03:02.140> simple

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
PVC glue this is a pretty simple

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.710 
PVC glue this is a pretty simple
component<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.370> build<00:03:03.580> and<00:03:03.820> you<00:03:04.090> can<00:03:04.270> vary<00:03:04.540> the

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
component to build and you can vary the

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.270 
component to build and you can vary the
lengths<00:03:05.020> of<00:03:05.200> these<00:03:05.320> little<00:03:05.770> sections

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
lengths of these little sections

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.730 
lengths of these little sections
depending<00:03:06.460> how<00:03:06.760> high<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.600> riser<00:03:08.080> actually<00:03:08.620> is

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
depending how high the riser actually is

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.280 
depending how high the riser actually is
and<00:03:08.920> on<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.400> drip<00:03:09.580> line<00:03:09.610> this<00:03:10.510> is<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:11.050> piece

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
and on the drip line this is the piece

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.650 
and on the drip line this is the piece
that<00:03:11.560> ties<00:03:11.800> in<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.580> the<00:03:12.610> drip<00:03:12.880> line<00:03:13.000> itself<00:03:13.480> you

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
that ties in to the drip line itself you

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.510 
that ties in to the drip line itself you
can<00:03:13.840> see<00:03:14.020> it's<00:03:14.140> got<00:03:14.320> a<00:03:14.350> little<00:03:14.440> screen<00:03:15.280> there

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
can see it's got a little screen there

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.220 
can see it's got a little screen there
that<00:03:15.550> filters<00:03:16.120> it<00:03:16.300> and<00:03:16.480> then<00:03:16.870> this<00:03:17.020> is<00:03:17.200> just

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
that filters it and then this is just

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.200 
that filters it and then this is just
basically<00:03:17.770> a<00:03:17.890> little<00:03:18.130> hose<00:03:18.280> bib<00:03:18.580> with<00:03:19.000> two

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
basically a little hose bib with two

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.450 
basically a little hose bib with two
valves<00:03:19.600> on<00:03:19.750> it<00:03:19.870> that<00:03:20.020> allows<00:03:20.260> me<00:03:20.500> to<00:03:20.740> regulate

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
valves on it that allows me to regulate

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.370 
valves on it that allows me to regulate
the<00:03:21.940> water<00:03:22.210> coming<00:03:22.630> in<00:03:22.690> going<00:03:22.900> so<00:03:23.110> we<00:03:23.200> just

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
the water coming in going so we just

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.620 
the water coming in going so we just
thread<00:03:23.620> that<00:03:23.650> on<00:03:23.890> and<00:03:24.370> then<00:03:25.000> our<00:03:25.120> valve<00:03:25.330> here

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
thread that on and then our valve here

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.770 
thread that on and then our valve here
will<00:03:25.780> allow<00:03:25.900> us<00:03:26.260> to<00:03:26.940> regulate<00:03:27.940> which<00:03:28.510> of<00:03:28.690> the

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
will allow us to regulate which of the

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.110 
will allow us to regulate which of the
lines<00:03:29.020> are<00:03:29.740> are<00:03:30.130> open<00:03:30.490> and<00:03:30.610> which<00:03:30.700> aren't<00:03:30.940> and

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
lines are are open and which aren't and

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.370 
lines are are open and which aren't and
then<00:03:31.240> this<00:03:31.330> will<00:03:31.570> give<00:03:31.690> us<00:03:31.750> a<00:03:31.959> little<00:03:32.110> bit<00:03:32.260> of

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
then this will give us a little bit of

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.560 
then this will give us a little bit of
discharge<00:03:32.800> if<00:03:32.980> we<00:03:33.100> need<00:03:33.280> it<00:03:33.459> then<00:03:34.030> we<00:03:34.240> need<00:03:34.420> to

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
discharge if we need it then we need to

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.990 
discharge if we need it then we need to
go<00:03:34.720> from<00:03:34.959> thread<00:03:35.440> what<00:03:36.010> you<00:03:36.160> see<00:03:36.340> here<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:36.970> a

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
go from thread what you see here to a

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.940 
go from thread what you see here to a
slip<00:03:37.480> fitting<00:03:37.780> PVC<00:03:38.290> so<00:03:38.500> we<00:03:38.590> just<00:03:38.740> have<00:03:38.920> a

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
slip fitting PVC so we just have a

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.980 
slip fitting PVC so we just have a
half-inch<00:03:39.430> fitting<00:03:39.790> just<00:03:39.910> like<00:03:40.150> this<00:03:40.360> that

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
half-inch fitting just like this that

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.199 
half-inch fitting just like this that
slides<00:03:41.380> in<00:03:41.620> and<00:03:41.830> tightens<00:03:42.490> in<00:03:42.640> just<00:03:42.850> like<00:03:43.000> that

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
slides in and tightens in just like that

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.870 
slides in and tightens in just like that
then<00:03:44.110> we<00:03:44.530> cut<00:03:44.740> another<00:03:45.010> little<00:03:45.370> piece<00:03:45.580> of

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
then we cut another little piece of

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.750 
then we cut another little piece of
half-inch<00:03:46.330> PVC<00:03:47.020> just<00:03:47.680> long<00:03:47.920> enough<00:03:47.950> to<00:03:48.220> give

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
half-inch PVC just long enough to give

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.610 
half-inch PVC just long enough to give
us<00:03:48.880> a<00:03:48.970> little<00:03:49.090> bit<00:03:49.270> of<00:03:49.390> distance<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:49.959> then

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
us a little bit of distance and then

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.590 
us a little bit of distance and then
because<00:03:51.220> of<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.430> angle<00:03:51.880> of<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.180> hose<00:03:52.390> bib

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
because of the angle of the hose bib

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.080 
because of the angle of the hose bib
I'll<00:03:52.810> use<00:03:52.990> a<00:03:53.020> half-inch<00:03:53.590> 45<00:03:54.190> like<00:03:54.520> you<00:03:54.700> can<00:03:54.880> see

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
I'll use a half-inch 45 like you can see

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.270 
I'll use a half-inch 45 like you can see
right<00:03:55.270> here<00:03:55.330> and<00:03:55.810> that<00:03:56.290> slides<00:03:56.650> in<00:03:56.890> just<00:03:56.920> like

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
right here and that slides in just like

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.570 
right here and that slides in just like
that

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
that

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.610 
that
so<00:03:58.209> that's<00:03:58.420> part<00:03:58.750> of<00:03:58.840> it<00:03:58.959> you<00:03:59.140> can<00:03:59.170> see<00:03:59.500> it's

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
so that's part of it you can see it's

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.050 
so that's part of it you can see it's
already<00:03:59.800> starting<00:03:59.950> to<00:04:00.310> be<00:04:00.400> built<00:04:00.550> just<00:04:00.910> like

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
already starting to be built just like

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.449 
already starting to be built just like
that<00:04:01.300> now<00:04:01.780> we<00:04:01.840> can<00:04:02.290> put<00:04:02.620> in<00:04:02.800> a<00:04:02.890> piece<00:04:03.130> here<00:04:03.430> that

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
that now we can put in a piece here that

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.190 
that now we can put in a piece here that
gets<00:04:03.790> us<00:04:03.970> down<00:04:04.150> a<00:04:04.180> little<00:04:04.450> ways<00:04:04.690> toward<00:04:05.050> the

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
gets us down a little ways toward the

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.190 
gets us down a little ways toward the
ground<00:04:05.410> and<00:04:05.830> as<00:04:06.160> I<00:04:06.280> mentioned<00:04:06.670> you<00:04:06.730> can

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
ground and as I mentioned you can

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.510 
ground and as I mentioned you can
pre-cut<00:04:08.200> these<00:04:08.440> to<00:04:08.890> whatever<00:04:09.010> length<00:04:09.430> you

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
pre-cut these to whatever length you

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.240 
pre-cut these to whatever length you
like<00:04:09.820> and<00:04:10.120> then<00:04:10.660> one<00:04:10.930> final<00:04:11.260> fitting<00:04:11.860> a<00:04:11.980> slip

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
like and then one final fitting a slip

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.160 
like and then one final fitting a slip
to<00:04:12.430> slip<00:04:12.700> fitting<00:04:13.060> here<00:04:13.450> which<00:04:13.810> is<00:04:13.959> where

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
to slip fitting here which is where

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.770 
to slip fitting here which is where
we'll<00:04:14.350> tie<00:04:14.620> in<00:04:14.890> the<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:15.730> flexible<00:04:16.150> line<00:04:16.330> so

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
we'll tie in the the flexible line so

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.479 
we'll tie in the the flexible line so
there<00:04:16.959> it<00:04:17.020> is<00:04:17.169> just<00:04:17.590> as<00:04:17.709> quick<00:04:17.919> and<00:04:18.070> as<00:04:18.190> simple

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
there it is just as quick and as simple

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.490 
there it is just as quick and as simple
as<00:04:18.609> that<00:04:18.760> it<00:04:19.150> can<00:04:19.270> be<00:04:19.390> built<00:04:19.570> so<00:04:20.049> let's<00:04:20.230> see<00:04:20.350> how

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
as that it can be built so let's see how

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.070 
as that it can be built so let's see how
we<00:04:20.560> tie<00:04:20.890> them<00:04:21.010> into<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.370> line<00:04:21.549> itself<00:04:22.020> so<00:04:23.020> to

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
we tie them into the line itself so to

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.020 
we tie them into the line itself so to
show<00:04:23.290> how<00:04:23.470> we<00:04:23.530> actually<00:04:23.830> spliced<00:04:24.460> in<00:04:24.730> since

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
show how we actually spliced in since

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.280 
show how we actually spliced in since
we've<00:04:25.210> spliced<00:04:25.540> the<00:04:25.750> system<00:04:26.110> together

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
we've spliced the system together

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.130 
we've spliced the system together
already<00:04:26.860> I<00:04:27.130> ran<00:04:27.580> a<00:04:27.610> little<00:04:27.910> piece<00:04:28.150> of<00:04:28.180> drip

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
already I ran a little piece of drip

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.690 
already I ran a little piece of drip
line<00:04:29.350> right<00:04:29.590> here<00:04:29.890> that<00:04:30.040> you<00:04:30.130> can<00:04:30.310> see<00:04:30.520> that

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
line right here that you can see that

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.550 
line right here that you can see that
will<00:04:30.790> simulate<00:04:31.000> that<00:04:31.450> that<00:04:32.050> we<00:04:32.169> have<00:04:32.350> down

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
will simulate that that we have down

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.830 
will simulate that that we have down
below<00:04:32.590> and<00:04:33.160> then<00:04:33.520> what<00:04:33.669> I<00:04:33.700> did<00:04:33.820> was<00:04:33.970> I<00:04:34.419> took<00:04:34.810> a

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
below and then what I did was I took a

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.999 
below and then what I did was I took a
piece<00:04:35.169> here

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
piece here

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.489 
piece here
of<00:04:36.099> one-inch<00:04:36.789> PVC<00:04:37.150> that<00:04:37.659> would<00:04:37.779> simulate<00:04:38.020> the

00:04:38.489 --> 00:04:38.499 
of one-inch PVC that would simulate the

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:40.170 
of one-inch PVC that would simulate the
mainline<00:04:38.860> that<00:04:39.039> comes<00:04:39.219> across<00:04:39.339> with<00:04:39.729> dhoti

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
mainline that comes across with dhoti

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.450 
mainline that comes across with dhoti
and<00:04:40.360> the<00:04:40.419> riser<00:04:40.629> that<00:04:40.809> goes<00:04:41.080> up<00:04:41.319> so<00:04:41.949> when<00:04:42.339> you

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
and the riser that goes up so when you

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.399 
and the riser that goes up so when you
go<00:04:42.639> to<00:04:42.669> set<00:04:43.059> these<00:04:43.270> basically<00:04:43.900> all<00:04:44.110> you<00:04:44.259> need

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:44.409 
go to set these basically all you need

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.350 
go to set these basically all you need
to<00:04:44.529> do<00:04:44.649> is<00:04:44.770> just<00:04:44.979> hang<00:04:45.219> them<00:04:45.460> all<00:04:45.610> in<00:04:45.819> a<00:04:45.909> row<00:04:46.089> and

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
to do is just hang them all in a row and

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.329 
to do is just hang them all in a row and
you<00:04:46.839> can<00:04:46.869> pick<00:04:47.259> the<00:04:47.409> center<00:04:47.740> line<00:04:47.949> just<00:04:48.189> with

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:48.339 
you can pick the center line just with

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:50.879 
you can pick the center line just with
that<00:04:48.369> piece<00:04:48.759> of<00:04:49.110> string<00:04:50.110> that<00:04:50.349> you<00:04:50.469> had<00:04:50.649> and

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
that piece of string that you had and

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.969 
that piece of string that you had and
then<00:04:51.369> just<00:04:51.550> use<00:04:51.699> a<00:04:51.729> sharp<00:04:52.089> knife<00:04:52.180> to<00:04:52.990> cut<00:04:53.199> right

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
then just use a sharp knife to cut right

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.469 
then just use a sharp knife to cut right
through<00:04:54.009> the<00:04:54.819> drip<00:04:55.029> line

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
through the drip line

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.109 
through the drip line
once<00:04:56.229> that's<00:04:56.469> done<00:04:56.830> these<00:04:57.399> just<00:04:57.759> slide

00:04:58.109 --> 00:04:58.119 
once that's done these just slide

00:04:58.119 --> 00:05:00.179 
once that's done these just slide
together<00:04:58.389> very<00:04:58.899> easily<00:04:59.139> there's<00:04:59.529> no<00:04:59.589> gluing

00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:00.189 
together very easily there's no gluing

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:02.279 
together very easily there's no gluing
necessary<00:05:00.939> it<00:05:01.149> just<00:05:01.629> fits<00:05:01.869> right<00:05:02.080> together

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
necessary it just fits right together

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:04.529 
necessary it just fits right together
just<00:05:02.740> like<00:05:02.830> that<00:05:03.159> and<00:05:03.430> then<00:05:03.999> the<00:05:04.119> next<00:05:04.389> one

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 
just like that and then the next one

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:08.670 
just like that and then the next one
fits<00:05:05.529> together<00:05:05.710> right<00:05:06.669> here<00:05:07.289> so<00:05:08.289> then<00:05:08.529> these

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
fits together right here so then these

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.549 
fits together right here so then these
can<00:05:08.979> be<00:05:09.099> pushed<00:05:09.430> right<00:05:09.699> together<00:05:09.879> and

00:05:10.549 --> 00:05:10.559 
can be pushed right together and

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:12.779 
can be pushed right together and
tightened<00:05:11.559> by<00:05:11.680> just<00:05:11.979> the<00:05:12.129> compression<00:05:12.699> of

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
tightened by just the compression of

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:14.579 
tightened by just the compression of
those<00:05:12.969> fitting<00:05:13.330> together<00:05:13.449> the<00:05:14.199> next<00:05:14.379> thing

00:05:14.579 --> 00:05:14.589 
those fitting together the next thing

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:15.959 
those fitting together the next thing
you<00:05:14.680> would<00:05:14.770> do<00:05:14.919> is<00:05:15.039> just<00:05:15.249> do<00:05:15.339> them<00:05:15.490> on<00:05:15.580> every

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:15.969 
you would do is just do them on every

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:17.730 
you would do is just do them on every
single<00:05:16.389> row<00:05:16.599> and<00:05:16.899> then<00:05:17.199> they'll<00:05:17.379> all<00:05:17.529> be

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
single row and then they'll all be

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.429 
single row and then they'll all be
hanging<00:05:18.099> loosely<00:05:18.460> like<00:05:18.729> this<00:05:18.999> now<00:05:19.599> underneath

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:20.439 
hanging loosely like this now underneath

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:23.730 
hanging loosely like this now underneath
will<00:05:21.249> have<00:05:21.520> the<00:05:21.969> main<00:05:22.180> line<00:05:22.539> the<00:05:23.050> supply<00:05:23.439> line

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
will have the main line the supply line

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.790 
will have the main line the supply line
that<00:05:24.339> has<00:05:24.550> the<00:05:24.849> the<00:05:24.879> tee<00:05:25.449> this<00:05:25.719> is<00:05:25.930> one<00:05:26.319> inch<00:05:26.529> on

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
that has the the tee this is one inch on

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.709 
that has the the tee this is one inch on
either<00:05:27.219> side<00:05:27.550> and<00:05:27.789> half<00:05:27.999> inch<00:05:28.209> in<00:05:28.360> the<00:05:28.449> middle

00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:28.719 
either side and half inch in the middle

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:31.079 
either side and half inch in the middle
the<00:05:29.319> the<00:05:29.680> main<00:05:29.919> line<00:05:30.159> is<00:05:30.339> going<00:05:30.459> to<00:05:30.550> vary<00:05:30.879> as

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:31.089 
the the main line is going to vary as

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:32.879 
the the main line is going to vary as
the<00:05:31.360> elevation<00:05:31.719> of<00:05:31.930> the<00:05:32.050> trench<00:05:32.349> varies<00:05:32.740> and

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
the elevation of the trench varies and

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.609 
the elevation of the trench varies and
that<00:05:33.399> makes<00:05:34.180> it<00:05:34.330> really<00:05:34.479> easy<00:05:34.749> to<00:05:34.869> attach<00:05:35.319> it

00:05:35.609 --> 00:05:35.619 
that makes it really easy to attach it

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:38.070 
that makes it really easy to attach it
if<00:05:35.770> you<00:05:36.219> use<00:05:36.490> the<00:05:36.699> rubber<00:05:36.939> tubing<00:05:37.479> and<00:05:37.659> cut<00:05:37.930> it

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
if you use the rubber tubing and cut it

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.170 
if you use the rubber tubing and cut it
varying<00:05:38.529> distances<00:05:39.159> to<00:05:39.399> maintain<00:05:39.819> the<00:05:39.969> same

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
varying distances to maintain the same

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.659 
varying distances to maintain the same
height<00:05:40.389> above<00:05:40.719> so<00:05:41.259> this<00:05:41.770> course<00:05:42.490> would<00:05:42.639> be

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
height above so this course would be

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.760 
height above so this course would be
glued<00:05:42.999> slips<00:05:43.389> and<00:05:43.539> very<00:05:43.719> easy<00:05:43.959> just<00:05:44.289> like<00:05:44.529> that

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
glued slips and very easy just like that

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.670 
glued slips and very easy just like that
and<00:05:45.300> you<00:05:46.300> slip<00:05:46.539> this<00:05:46.689> in<00:05:46.930> from<00:05:47.110> above<00:05:47.379> and

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
and you slip this in from above and

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.619 
and you slip this in from above and
there<00:05:48.129> it<00:05:48.219> is<00:05:48.309> that's<00:05:48.849> all<00:05:49.059> there<00:05:49.209> is<00:05:49.240> to<00:05:49.509> it

00:05:49.619 --> 00:05:49.629 
there it is that's all there is to it

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:52.199 
there it is that's all there is to it
and<00:05:49.779> you've<00:05:50.139> got<00:05:50.319> your<00:05:50.469> riser<00:05:50.680> so<00:05:51.639> really<00:05:51.939> now

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:52.209 
and you've got your riser so really now

00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:54.209 
and you've got your riser so really now
only<00:05:52.479> the<00:05:52.659> last<00:05:52.870> thing<00:05:53.169> to<00:05:53.319> do<00:05:53.469> or<00:05:53.860> the<00:05:54.069> last

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:54.219 
only the last thing to do or the last

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:56.489 
only the last thing to do or the last
thing<00:05:54.490> to<00:05:54.699> do<00:05:54.909> with<00:05:55.149> our<00:05:55.330> our<00:05:55.659> drip<00:05:55.990> lines<00:05:56.229> turn

00:05:56.489 --> 00:05:56.499 
thing to do with our our drip lines turn

00:05:56.499 --> 00:05:59.009 
thing to do with our our drip lines turn
the<00:05:56.620> water<00:05:56.800> on<00:05:56.949> and<00:05:57.249> purge<00:05:57.759> the<00:05:57.969> system<00:05:58.360> so<00:05:58.839> the

00:05:59.009 --> 00:05:59.019 
the water on and purge the system so the

00:05:59.019 --> 00:06:00.689 
the water on and purge the system so the
glue<00:05:59.199> is<00:05:59.349> good<00:05:59.559> and<00:05:59.680> dried<00:05:59.860> by<00:06:00.069> now<00:06:00.249> so<00:06:00.519> let's

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:00.699 
glue is good and dried by now so let's

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:02.219 
glue is good and dried by now so let's
go<00:06:00.819> turn<00:06:00.999> the<00:06:01.029> water<00:06:01.269> on<00:06:01.419> will<00:06:01.870> purge<00:06:02.080> the

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229 
go turn the water on will purge the

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:03.659 
go turn the water on will purge the
lines<00:06:02.439> out<00:06:02.680> and<00:06:02.949> see<00:06:03.129> the<00:06:03.249> emitters<00:06:03.519> get

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
lines out and see the emitters get

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:09.929 
lines out and see the emitters get
underway<00:06:07.649> so<00:06:08.649> once<00:06:08.949> we've<00:06:09.129> got<00:06:09.159> the<00:06:09.459> water<00:06:09.669> on

00:06:09.929 --> 00:06:09.939 
underway so once we've got the water on

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:11.219 
underway so once we've got the water on
the<00:06:10.120> next<00:06:10.330> thing<00:06:10.449> we<00:06:10.569> want<00:06:10.599> to<00:06:10.749> do<00:06:10.870> is<00:06:10.959> purge

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
the next thing we want to do is purge

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:12.719 
the next thing we want to do is purge
the<00:06:11.439> system<00:06:11.620> because<00:06:12.069> any<00:06:12.249> little<00:06:12.309> bit<00:06:12.639> of

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729 
the system because any little bit of

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:14.879 
the system because any little bit of
debris<00:06:12.999> that<00:06:13.360> might<00:06:13.839> be<00:06:14.050> in<00:06:14.229> there<00:06:14.439> we<00:06:14.620> want<00:06:14.830> to

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:14.889 
debris that might be in there we want to

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:16.619 
debris that might be in there we want to
push<00:06:15.099> out<00:06:15.339> through<00:06:15.550> the<00:06:15.699> tubes<00:06:15.969> before<00:06:16.509> we

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:16.629 
push out through the tubes before we

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:18.089 
push out through the tubes before we
would<00:06:16.809> get<00:06:16.930> any<00:06:17.139> pressure<00:06:17.409> on<00:06:17.620> the<00:06:17.740> emitters

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:18.099 
would get any pressure on the emitters

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:19.709 
would get any pressure on the emitters
now<00:06:18.669> there's<00:06:18.879> a<00:06:18.939> number<00:06:19.240> of<00:06:19.330> different<00:06:19.599> ways

00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:19.719 
now there's a number of different ways

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:21.809 
now there's a number of different ways
to<00:06:19.990> close<00:06:20.289> the<00:06:20.529> end<00:06:20.740> of<00:06:20.889> this<00:06:21.069> you<00:06:21.639> can

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:21.819 
to close the end of this you can

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:23.579 
to close the end of this you can
actually<00:06:21.939> put<00:06:22.269> fittings<00:06:22.689> on<00:06:22.870> it<00:06:23.050> but<00:06:23.379> a<00:06:23.409> real

00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:23.589 
actually put fittings on it but a real

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:26.309 
actually put fittings on it but a real
inexpensive<00:06:23.860> way<00:06:24.370> to<00:06:24.399> do<00:06:24.610> it<00:06:24.759> is<00:06:24.909> to<00:06:25.389> just<00:06:26.050> kink

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 
inexpensive way to do it is to just kink

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:28.320 
inexpensive way to do it is to just kink
it<00:06:26.469> just<00:06:26.709> like<00:06:26.889> that<00:06:26.919> and<00:06:27.399> I<00:06:27.729> used<00:06:27.909> a<00:06:27.969> piece<00:06:28.120> of

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
it just like that and I used a piece of

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.420 
it just like that and I used a piece of
tight<00:06:28.539> ape<00:06:28.809> to<00:06:29.499> just<00:06:29.740> go<00:06:29.889> around<00:06:30.009> it<00:06:30.870> and<00:06:32.430> that

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
tight ape to just go around it and that

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.509 
tight ape to just go around it and that
keeps<00:06:33.699> it<00:06:33.819> nice<00:06:33.999> and<00:06:34.059> tight<00:06:35.039> bring<00:06:36.039> it<00:06:36.159> up<00:06:36.279> and

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:36.519 
keeps it nice and tight bring it up and

00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:37.829 
keeps it nice and tight bring it up and
just<00:06:36.939> tie<00:06:37.089> a<00:06:37.120> knot<00:06:37.330> in<00:06:37.569> it

00:06:37.829 --> 00:06:37.839 
just tie a knot in it

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:40.920

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:51.789 
and then we'll have that line up and

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:54.060 
and then we'll have that line up and
running<00:06:52.199> so<00:06:53.199> as<00:06:53.320> you<00:06:53.440> can<00:06:53.590> see<00:06:53.650> we've<00:06:54.039> got
