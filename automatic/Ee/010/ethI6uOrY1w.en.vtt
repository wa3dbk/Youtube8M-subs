software is available one point six zero

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.670 
software is available one point six zero
rest<00:02:46.920> next<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.690> it's<00:02:48.690> copying<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.320> update

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
rest next and it's copying the update

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.970 
rest next and it's copying the update
file<00:02:49.890> from<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.640> thumb<00:02:51.150> drive<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.660> as<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:52.800> see

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
file from the thumb drive and as you see

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.890 
file from the thumb drive and as you see
that<00:02:53.160> is<00:02:53.280> way<00:02:53.760> faster<00:02:54.300> because<00:02:54.600> it's<00:02:54.750> already

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
that is way faster because it's already

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.140 
that is way faster because it's already
been<00:02:55.080> downloaded<00:02:55.380> all<00:02:55.890> this<00:02:56.670> doing<00:02:56.880> is<00:02:56.970> it's

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
been downloaded all this doing is it's

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.900 
been downloaded all this doing is it's
copying<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.660> from<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.930> thumb<00:02:58.140> drive<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:59.010> the

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
copying it from the thumb drive to the

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.750 
copying it from the thumb drive to the
software<00:03:00.300> we<00:03:00.720> started<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.140> system<00:03:01.440> software

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
software we started the system software

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.979 
software we started the system software
update<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:03.170> what<00:03:04.170> it<00:03:04.290> actually<00:03:04.500> just<00:03:04.980> did<00:03:05.160> was

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
update and what it actually just did was

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.400 
update and what it actually just did was
if<00:03:06.989> my<00:03:07.050> memory<00:03:07.560> serves<00:03:07.590> me<00:03:07.830> correctly<00:03:09.410> it

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
if my memory serves me correctly it

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.930 
if my memory serves me correctly it
didn't<00:03:10.800> actually<00:03:10.920> installed<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.640> update

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
didn't actually installed the update

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.150 
didn't actually installed the update
just<00:03:12.150> then<00:03:12.300> what<00:03:12.989> it<00:03:13.110> did<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.470> initializes

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
just then what it did is it initializes

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.520 
just then what it did is it initializes
the<00:03:14.489> update<00:03:14.819> and<00:03:15.090> it<00:03:15.300> verified<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.170> update

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
the update and it verified the update

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.610 
the update and it verified the update
and<00:03:16.799> now<00:03:17.430> it's<00:03:17.700> going<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.060> actually<00:03:18.620> install

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
and now it's going to actually install

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.710 
and now it's going to actually install
the<00:03:19.799> update<00:03:22.160> yeah<00:03:23.160> here<00:03:23.579> it<00:03:23.670> is<00:03:23.790> so<00:03:24.329> now<00:03:24.510> it's

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
the update yeah here it is so now it's

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.710 
the update yeah here it is so now it's
going<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:25.110> actually<00:03:25.549> do<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.880> installation

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
going to actually do the installation

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.220 
going to actually do the installation
what<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:28.290> just<00:03:28.470> did<00:03:28.620> is<00:03:29.840> initialized<00:03:30.840> it<00:03:31.079> it

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
what it just did is initialized it it

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.289 
what it just did is initialized it it
might<00:03:32.130> have<00:03:32.280> copied<00:03:32.640> it<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.940> hard<00:03:33.120> drive

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
might have copied it to the hard drive

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.500 
might have copied it to the hard drive
I'm<00:03:33.450> not<00:03:33.630> sure<00:03:33.870> it's<00:03:34.560> a<00:03:34.709> four<00:03:35.100> hundred

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
I'm not sure it's a four hundred

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.440 
I'm not sure it's a four hundred
megabyte<00:03:36.510> update<00:03:36.870> just<00:03:37.049> then<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.530> this<00:03:38.190> is<00:03:38.370> a

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
megabyte update just then and this is a

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.349 
megabyte update just then and this is a
USB<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.810> flash<00:03:40.079> drive<00:03:40.350> so<00:03:40.530> I'm<00:03:40.620> not<00:03:40.769> sure<00:03:40.829> if<00:03:41.700> it

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
USB to flash drive so I'm not sure if it

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.509 
USB to flash drive so I'm not sure if it
had<00:03:42.600> enough<00:03:42.840> time<00:03:43.019> to<00:03:43.079> copy<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.950> entire<00:03:44.070> thing

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
had enough time to copy the entire thing

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:45.740 
had enough time to copy the entire thing
however<00:03:44.880> you<00:03:45.000> can<00:03:45.150> see<00:03:45.269> that<00:03:45.480> it<00:03:45.630> is

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
however you can see that it is

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.440 
however you can see that it is
installing<00:03:46.170> really<00:03:46.530> quickly<00:03:46.920> so<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:48.180> entire

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
installing really quickly so the entire

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.599 
installing really quickly so the entire
process<00:03:48.690> normally<00:03:49.140> takes<00:03:49.320> about<00:03:49.620> five

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
process normally takes about five

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.030 
process normally takes about five
minutes<00:03:50.970> on<00:03:51.090> this<00:03:51.269> end<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.660> then<00:03:52.500> the

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
minutes on this end and then the

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.310 
minutes on this end and then the
downloading<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:53.880> file<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.450> just<00:03:54.810> take<00:03:55.170> my

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
downloading the file I just take my

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.569 
downloading the file I just take my
computer<00:03:55.680> to<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.700> nearest<00:03:57.000> place<00:03:57.209> with<00:03:57.480> a

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
computer to the nearest place with a

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:03.500 
computer to the nearest place with a
really<00:03:59.579> solid<00:03:59.790> connection<00:04:01.459> and<00:04:02.459> download<00:04:03.269> the

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
really solid connection and download the

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.800 
really solid connection and download the
file<00:04:04.079> and<00:04:05.090> so<00:04:06.090> that's<00:04:06.510> it<00:04:07.220> yeah<00:04:08.220> it's<00:04:08.670> a<00:04:09.390> and

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
file and so that's it yeah it's a and

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.340 
file and so that's it yeah it's a and
I'm<00:04:10.739> not<00:04:10.950> sure<00:04:11.100> if<00:04:11.190> that<00:04:11.250> this<00:04:11.519> is<00:04:11.700> a<00:04:12.350> thing

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
I'm not sure if that this is a thing

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.529 
I'm not sure if that this is a thing
that<00:04:13.380> is<00:04:13.859> available<00:04:14.280> for<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:16.579> the<00:04:17.579> Xbox<00:04:18.329> one

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
that is available for the the Xbox one

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:19.969 
that is available for the the Xbox one
if<00:04:18.750> this<00:04:18.900> is<00:04:19.049> a<00:04:19.079> feature<00:04:19.289> that<00:04:19.470> you<00:04:19.709> can<00:04:19.859> do

if this is a feature that you can do

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.880 
if this is a feature that you can do
with<00:04:20.130> that<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.549> don't<00:04:21.150> think<00:04:21.450> that<00:04:21.630> it<00:04:21.750> is<00:04:21.900> but<00:04:22.830> I

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
with that I don't think that it is but I

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.279 
with that I don't think that it is but I
could<00:04:23.190> be<00:04:23.310> wrong<00:04:23.490> on<00:04:23.669> that<00:04:23.729> but<00:04:24.120> as<00:04:24.599> far<00:04:25.080> as<00:04:25.110> a
