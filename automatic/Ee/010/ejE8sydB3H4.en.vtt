you<00:04:07.669> know<00:04:07.790> soon<00:04:08.329> and<00:04:08.479> take<00:04:08.540> a<00:04:08.659> long<00:04:08.870> time<00:04:10.359> okay

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
you know soon and take a long time okay

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.949 
you know soon and take a long time okay
so<00:04:11.419> let's<00:04:11.720> try<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:11.959> another<00:04:12.349> guy<00:04:13.780> might<00:04:14.780> be

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
so let's try the another guy might be

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.409 
so let's try the another guy might be
easier<00:04:15.439> inside<00:04:15.889> this<00:04:16.099> room<00:04:16.489> here<00:04:16.820> we<00:04:17.299> have

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
easier inside this room here we have

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.440 
easier inside this room here we have
some<00:04:17.630> room<00:04:17.870> to<00:04:17.900> maneuver<00:04:18.530> around

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.900 

I<00:04:22.570> think<00:04:23.350> getting<00:04:23.560> behind<00:04:23.770> these<00:04:24.190> guys<00:04:24.400> will

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
I think getting behind these guys will

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:35.820 
I think getting behind these guys will
make<00:04:25.030> it<00:04:25.210> easier<00:04:34.320> yeah<00:04:35.320> this<00:04:35.500> is<00:04:35.620> definitely

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
make it easier yeah this is definitely

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:52.980 
make it easier yeah this is definitely
easier<00:04:48.960> okay<00:04:50.940> so<00:04:51.940> you<00:04:52.180> beat<00:04:52.390> those<00:04:52.570> guys<00:04:52.780> you

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
easier okay so you beat those guys you

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.900 
easier okay so you beat those guys you
just<00:04:53.020> need<00:04:53.350> to<00:04:53.440> give<00:04:53.590> behind<00:04:53.950> them<00:04:54.130> and<00:04:54.310> avoid

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
just need to give behind them and avoid
