00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
fine image sizing though I need to

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:56.770 
fine image sizing though I need to
change<00:00:55.699> because<00:00:55.970> remember<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:56.420> last<00:00:56.540> one<00:00:56.720> we

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.460 
going to be huge still if I don't change
the<00:01:10.030> pixel<00:01:11.030> dimensions<00:01:11.420> so<00:01:12.170> I'm<00:01:12.229> just<00:01:12.350> going

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
the pixel dimensions so I'm just going

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.990 
the pixel dimensions so I'm just going
to<00:01:12.530> change<00:01:12.799> this<00:01:12.920> to<00:01:13.070> a<00:01:13.100> long<00:01:13.340> edge<00:01:13.580> and<00:01:13.850> then

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
to change this to a long edge and then

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.460 
to change this to a long edge and then
on<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.180> long<00:01:14.360> edge<00:01:14.540> I<00:01:14.659> want<00:01:14.840> to<00:01:14.960> be<00:01:15.080> no<00:01:15.290> more

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
on the long edge I want to be no more

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.389 
on the long edge I want to be no more
than<00:01:15.680> say<00:01:15.920> 700<00:01:16.520> pixels<00:01:17.649> all<00:01:18.649> right<00:01:18.859> output

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
than say 700 pixels all right output

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.249 
than say 700 pixels all right output
sharpening<00:01:19.820> I<00:01:19.969> do<00:01:20.030> want<00:01:20.450> it<00:01:20.539> to<00:01:20.659> sharpen<00:01:21.170> on
