2007 server will be scheduled for this
friday<00:00:12.630> this<00:00:13.230> 22nd<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.100> may<00:00:14.460> or<00:00:14.670> may<00:00:14.850> not<00:00:14.880> be

friday this 22nd it may or may not be
online<00:00:15.510> late<00:00:16.379> but<00:00:16.980> they're<00:00:17.280> just<00:00:17.430> trying<00:00:17.670> to

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
online late but they're just trying to

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.180 
online late but they're just trying to
get<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.270> patch<00:00:18.600> almost<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.470> game<00:00:19.890> breaking

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.190 
get the patch almost the game breaking

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.760 
get the patch almost the game breaking
bugs<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.640> have<00:00:20.789> been<00:00:21.150> around<00:00:21.270> during<00:00:21.900> 2007

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
bugs that have been around during 2007

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.740 
bugs that have been around during 2007
so<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:23.460> will<00:00:23.670> be<00:00:23.820> twofold<00:00:23.970> release<00:00:24.510> they<00:00:24.690> do

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
so this will be twofold release they do

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.720 
so this will be twofold release they do
not<00:00:24.960> try<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.260> roll<00:00:25.830> back<00:00:26.010> anybody<00:00:26.490> unless

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
not try to roll back anybody unless

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.850 
not try to roll back anybody unless
maybe<00:00:27.480> if<00:00:27.690> they<00:00:27.810> miss<00:00:27.990> something<00:00:28.020> important

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
maybe if they miss something important

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.800 
maybe if they miss something important
but<00:00:29.279> we're<00:00:29.670> going<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.029> be<00:00:30.119> looking<00:00:30.270> at<00:00:30.539> about

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
but we're going to be looking at about

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.410 
but we're going to be looking at about
50<00:00:31.380> worlds<00:00:31.770> at<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.070> start<00:00:32.369> they<00:00:33.030> will<00:00:33.210> have

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
50 worlds at the start they will have

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.330 
50 worlds at the start they will have
extra<00:00:33.840> servers<00:00:34.320> if<00:00:34.590> there<00:00:34.860> are<00:00:35.040> not<00:00:35.310> enough

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
extra servers if there are not enough

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.600 
extra servers if there are not enough
world<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.600> there's<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.410> ask<00:00:37.710> for<00:00:38.100> tutorial

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
world so there's that ask for tutorial

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.430 
world so there's that ask for tutorial
island<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:39.480> probably<00:00:39.750> going<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.960> be<00:00:40.020> awfully

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
island it's probably going to be awfully

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.139 
island it's probably going to be awfully
crowded<00:00:40.770> at<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.220> start<00:00:41.489> but<00:00:41.550> they're<00:00:41.820> looking

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
crowded at the start but they're looking

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.319 
crowded at the start but they're looking
into<00:00:42.239> solutions<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.290> solve<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.680> as<00:00:44.329> for

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
into solutions to solve that as for

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.120 
into solutions to solve that as for
gambling<00:00:45.630> there<00:00:46.020> will<00:00:46.320> be<00:00:46.350> no<00:00:46.469> professor

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.130 
gambling there will be no professor

it can be something they address in the

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.610 
it can be something they address in the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
be nothing to prevent it this first post

be nothing to prevent it this first post
on<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.040> top<00:00:56.250> here<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.730> pretty<00:00:57.090> interesting<00:00:57.450> if

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
on the top here is pretty interesting if

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.170 
on the top here is pretty interesting if
the<00:00:58.710> vote<00:00:58.860> comes<00:00:59.129> just<00:00:59.430> below<00:00:59.760> a<00:01:00.000> certain

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
the vote comes just below a certain

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.959 
the vote comes just below a certain
threshold<00:01:00.390> they're<00:01:01.020> willing<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.350> consider

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
threshold they're willing to consider

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.939 
threshold they're willing to consider
disregarding<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.120> difference<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.809> say<00:01:04.469> if<00:01:04.799> we

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
disregarding the difference so say if we

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.859 
disregarding the difference so say if we
just<00:01:05.129> hit<00:01:05.280> below<00:01:05.549> like<00:01:05.790> 500,000<00:01:06.780> they're

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
just hit below like 500,000 they're

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.539 
just hit below like 500,000 they're
willing<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.290> disregard<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:08.070> difference<00:01:08.430> of

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
willing to disregard the difference of

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.600 
willing to disregard the difference of
that<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.420> just<00:01:09.540> go<00:01:09.720> with<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.400> 500,000<00:01:11.400> plan

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
that and just go with the 500,000 plan

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.700 
that and just go with the 500,000 plan
so<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.510> nice<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.690> see<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.380> makes<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.680> a

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
so it's nice to see that it makes it a

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.980 
so it's nice to see that it makes it a
little<00:01:14.159> bit<00:01:14.490> more<00:01:14.700> obtainable<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.690> logout

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
little bit more obtainable the logout

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.899 
little bit more obtainable the logout
timer<00:01:16.350> will<00:01:16.830> be<00:01:16.979> changed<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.400> five<00:01:17.580> minutes

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
timer will be changed to five minutes

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.940 
timer will be changed to five minutes
rather<00:01:18.210> than<00:01:18.390> 90<00:01:18.960> seconds<00:01:19.350> like<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.590> was<00:01:19.740> back

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
rather than 90 seconds like it was back

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.920 
rather than 90 seconds like it was back
then<00:01:20.010> but<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.580> kind<00:01:20.760> of<00:01:20.820> depends<00:01:21.150> off<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:21.689> it

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
then but it kind of depends off if it

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.440 
then but it kind of depends off if it
makes<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.229> into<00:01:22.680> development<00:01:23.280> there<00:01:23.850> will<00:01:24.210> be

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
makes it into development there will be

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.539 
makes it into development there will be
a<00:01:24.479> separate<00:01:24.930> high<00:01:25.080> score<00:01:25.470> their<00:01:25.920> stats<00:01:26.250> on

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
learning it's cami will not be how it

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.149 
learning it's cami will not be how it

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
the current game sad but well it's just

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.899 
the current game sad but well it's just
that<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:37.439> wilderness<00:01:37.920> stitch<00:01:38.159> will<00:01:38.460> remain

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
that the wilderness stitch will remain

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.080 
that the wilderness stitch will remain
there<00:01:39.210> willing<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:40.590> turn<00:01:40.950> luring<00:01:41.700> but

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
there willing to the turn luring but

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.819 
there willing to the turn luring but
they're<00:01:42.659> not<00:01:42.810> going<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.049> punish<00:01:43.320> people<00:01:43.650> for

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
they're not going to punish people for

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.940 
they're not going to punish people for
it<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.549> oh<00:01:44.850> well<00:01:45.450> you'll<00:01:46.200> be<00:01:46.229> able<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.740> change

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
it so oh well you'll be able to change
