00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
this next section is on hand rigs back

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.440 
this next section is on hand rigs back
to<00:00:08.300> the<00:00:08.890> demo<00:00:09.890> character<00:00:10.370> here<00:00:10.550> and<00:00:10.760> the<00:00:11.300> way

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.450 
to the demo character here and the way

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.110 
to the demo character here and the way
I've<00:00:11.570> rigged<00:00:11.840> the<00:00:11.960> hand<00:00:12.610> you<00:00:13.610> can<00:00:13.730> see<00:00:13.910> once

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
I've rigged the hand you can see once

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.150 
I've rigged the hand you can see once
again<00:00:14.420> I've<00:00:14.600> modeled<00:00:15.200> up<00:00:15.380> the<00:00:15.590> palm<00:00:16.010> of<00:00:16.039> the

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
again I've modeled up the palm of the

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.859 
again I've modeled up the palm of the
hand<00:00:16.400> with<00:00:16.490> an<00:00:16.609> edit<00:00:16.789> mesh<00:00:17.029> I'll<00:00:17.420> just<00:00:17.689> turn

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
hand with an edit mesh I'll just turn

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.019 
hand with an edit mesh I'll just turn
that<00:00:17.930> off<00:00:18.260> for<00:00:18.470> now<00:00:18.650> so<00:00:19.369> you<00:00:19.460> can<00:00:19.609> see<00:00:19.820> how<00:00:19.970> the

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029 
that off for now so you can see how the

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.069 
that off for now so you can see how the
bone<00:00:20.359> structure<00:00:20.749> is<00:00:21.999> this<00:00:22.999> is<00:00:23.179> a<00:00:23.329> basic<00:00:23.749> bone

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:24.079 
bone structure is this is a basic bone

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.489 
bone structure is this is a basic bone

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.090 
correctly down near the wrist your index
finger<00:00:40.070> and<00:00:40.190> I<00:00:40.370> place<00:00:40.640> the<00:00:40.880> joint<00:00:41.830> up<00:00:42.830> at<00:00:43.010> the

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
finger and I place the joint up at the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.630 
finger and I place the joint up at the
first<00:00:43.310> knuckle<00:00:43.600> you<00:00:44.600> could<00:00:44.810> actually<00:00:45.640> attach

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
first knuckle you could actually attach

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.980 
first knuckle you could actually attach
it<00:00:46.820> in<00:00:46.880> and<00:00:47.000> let<00:00:47.090> it<00:00:47.120> Bend<00:00:47.420> up<00:00:47.660> and<00:00:47.810> down<00:00:47.960> a

it in and let it Bend up and down a

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.540 
it in and let it Bend up and down a
little<00:00:48.200> bit<00:00:48.350> as<00:00:48.440> well<00:00:48.650> but<00:00:48.920> don't<00:00:49.220> find<00:00:49.490> that

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
little bit as well but don't find that

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.220 
little bit as well but don't find that
it's<00:00:49.730> necessary<00:00:51.160> same<00:00:52.160> thing<00:00:52.400> with<00:00:52.580> the<00:00:53.230> next

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
it's necessary same thing with the next

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.410 
it's necessary same thing with the next
two<00:00:54.350> fingers<00:00:54.740> the<00:00:55.370> baby<00:00:55.610> finger<00:00:56.030> I<00:00:56.060> actually

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
two fingers the baby finger I actually

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.900 
two fingers the baby finger I actually
add<00:00:56.900> a<00:00:56.960> joint<00:00:57.530> all<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:57.800> way<00:00:57.920> down<00:00:58.190> down<00:00:58.760> near

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
add a joint all the way down down near

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.569 
add a joint all the way down down near
the<00:00:58.970> wrist<00:00:59.240> again<00:00:59.540> and<00:01:00.110> this<00:01:00.230> is<00:01:00.380> because<00:01:00.770> you

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
the wrist again and this is because you

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.780 
the wrist again and this is because you
can<00:01:01.730> cup<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:02.690> palm<00:01:02.900> of<00:01:02.930> your<00:01:03.110> hand<00:01:03.530> by<00:01:04.250> pulling

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
can cup the palm of your hand by pulling

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.640 
can cup the palm of your hand by pulling
and<00:01:04.970> flexing<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:05.930> palm<00:01:06.140> of<00:01:06.170> your<00:01:06.350> hand

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
and flexing the palm of your hand

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.870 
and flexing the palm of your hand
because<00:01:06.890> of<00:01:07.070> all<00:01:07.159> the<00:01:07.280> bones<00:01:07.490> that<00:01:07.670> are<00:01:07.760> in

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
because of all the bones that are in

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.820 
because of all the bones that are in
your<00:01:07.970> hand<00:01:08.240> so<00:01:08.870> this<00:01:08.990> helps<00:01:09.290> me<00:01:09.409> be<00:01:09.530> able<00:01:09.680> to<00:01:09.740> do

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
your hand so this helps me be able to do

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.360 
your hand so this helps me be able to do
that<00:01:09.950> as<00:01:10.130> well<00:01:11.590> now<00:01:12.590> you<00:01:12.680> can<00:01:12.740> just<00:01:12.980> grab<00:01:13.159> and

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
that as well now you can just grab and

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.850 
that as well now you can just grab and
rotate<00:01:13.850> these<00:01:14.000> bones<00:01:14.300> and<00:01:14.570> animation<00:01:15.110> but

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
rotate these bones and animation but

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.500 
rotate these bones and animation but
that<00:01:15.980> becomes<00:01:16.220> very<00:01:16.490> very<00:01:16.610> time-consuming

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
that becomes very very time-consuming

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.180 
that becomes very very time-consuming
and<00:01:18.080> difficult<00:01:18.140> to<00:01:18.560> go<00:01:18.650> in<00:01:18.800> and<00:01:18.920> try<00:01:19.070> and

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
and difficult to go in and try and

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.130 
and difficult to go in and try and
select<00:01:19.610> and<00:01:19.760> pick<00:01:20.000> all<00:01:20.210> these<00:01:20.360> bones<00:01:20.659> one<00:01:20.990> at<00:01:21.080> a

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
select and pick all these bones one at a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.649 
select and pick all these bones one at a
time<00:01:22.240> so<00:01:24.159> your<00:01:25.159> average<00:01:25.490> hand<00:01:25.820> rig<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:26.300> very

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
time so your average hand rig and very

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.030 
time so your average hand rig and very
solid<00:01:27.170> one<00:01:27.380> is<00:01:27.620> to<00:01:28.100> just<00:01:28.310> wire<00:01:29.150> or<00:01:30.040> reactor

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
solid one is to just wire or reactor

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.460 
solid one is to just wire or reactor
control<00:01:31.780> all<00:01:32.780> of<00:01:33.080> your<00:01:34.390> joint<00:01:35.390> rotations<00:01:36.020> back

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
control all of your joint rotations back

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.289 
control all of your joint rotations back
to<00:01:36.680> a<00:01:36.710> series<00:01:37.100> of<00:01:37.159> sliders<00:01:37.549> or<00:01:37.820> spinners<00:01:38.180> or

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
to a series of sliders or spinners or

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.800 
to a series of sliders or spinners or
something<00:01:39.940> again<00:01:40.940> I<00:01:40.970> ran<00:01:41.270> into<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.570> problem

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
something again I ran into the problem

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.630 
something again I ran into the problem
of<00:01:41.930> this<00:01:42.110> is<00:01:42.290> very<00:01:42.830> time<00:01:43.100> consuming<00:01:43.130> for

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
of this is very time consuming for

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.460 
of this is very time consuming for
animating<00:01:44.180> because<00:01:44.479> you<00:01:44.600> have<00:01:44.810> to<00:01:44.990> sit<00:01:45.290> there

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
animating because you have to sit there

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.430 
animating because you have to sit there
and<00:01:45.560> slide<00:01:45.860> one<00:01:46.190> at<00:01:46.340> a<00:01:46.430> time<00:01:47.020> when<00:01:48.020> after<00:01:48.229> the

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
and slide one at a time when after the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.590 
and slide one at a time when after the
other<00:01:48.590> to<00:01:48.860> try<00:01:49.430> and<00:01:49.610> get<00:01:49.790> your<00:01:49.940> pose<00:01:50.210> that<00:01:50.479> you

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
other to try and get your pose that you

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.740 
other to try and get your pose that you
want<00:01:50.869> and<00:01:51.170> you<00:01:51.670> find<00:01:52.670> often<00:01:52.909> that<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.299> poses

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
want and you find often that the poses

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.899 
want and you find often that the poses
you're<00:01:53.869> going<00:01:54.170> after<00:01:54.350> or<00:01:55.100> poses<00:01:55.610> that<00:01:55.640> you've

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
you're going after or poses that you've

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.570 
you're going after or poses that you've
used<00:01:56.240> over<00:01:56.659> and<00:01:56.810> over<00:01:56.990> and<00:01:57.229> over<00:01:57.320> again<00:01:57.580> from

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
used over and over and over again from

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:06.790 
used over and over and over again from
one<00:01:58.610> shot<00:01:59.119> to<00:01:59.150> another

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.880 

for<00:02:07.370> that<00:02:07.460> reason<00:02:07.520> I<00:02:08.120> developed<00:02:08.810> an<00:02:09.440> attribute

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
for that reason I developed an attribute

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.790 
for that reason I developed an attribute
holder<00:02:10.040> is<00:02:11.050> attributed<00:02:12.050> holder<00:02:12.320> the<00:02:12.590> pen

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
holder is attributed holder the pen

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.370 
holder is attributed holder the pen
attribute<00:02:13.190> holder<00:02:13.690> which<00:02:14.690> is<00:02:14.720> available<00:02:15.230> from

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
of these controls for a hand you also

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.910 
of these controls for a hand you also
notice<00:03:01.580> how<00:03:01.610> put<00:03:02.030> a<00:03:02.300> separate<00:03:03.080> control<00:03:03.470> object

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
notice how put a separate control object

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.590 
notice how put a separate control object
on<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.040> back<00:03:04.280> of<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.520> hand<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:04.910> I<00:03:05.000> didn't<00:03:05.300> go

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
on the back of the hand and I didn't go

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.810 
on the back of the hand and I didn't go
and<00:03:05.750> put<00:03:05.930> this<00:03:06.110> modifier<00:03:06.770> on<00:03:06.800> say<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.550> wrist

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
and put this modifier on say the wrist

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.750 
and put this modifier on say the wrist
control<00:03:07.970> that's<00:03:08.930> because<00:03:09.320> when<00:03:10.280> you<00:03:10.400> pick

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
control that's because when you pick

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.449 
control that's because when you pick
this<00:03:11.690> object<00:03:12.500> it<00:03:12.739> will<00:03:12.860> show<00:03:13.160> all<00:03:13.310> the

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
this object it will show all the

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.720 
this object it will show all the
animation<00:03:14.000> tracks<00:03:17.410> for<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.530> hand<00:03:18.800> and<00:03:19.520> when<00:03:19.700> I

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
animation tracks for the hand and when I

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.360 
animation tracks for the hand and when I
pick<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.720> control<00:03:21.500> for<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.739> wrist<00:03:22.010> it

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
pick the control for the wrist it

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.540 
pick the control for the wrist it
doesn't<00:03:23.180> if<00:03:23.530> all<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:24.650> hand<00:03:24.890> controls<00:03:25.280> are<00:03:25.430> on

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
doesn't if all the hand controls are on

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.430 
doesn't if all the hand controls are on
the<00:03:25.670> wrist<00:03:25.880> I'd<00:03:26.120> have<00:03:26.270> a<00:03:26.300> mess<00:03:26.630> of<00:03:26.810> keys<00:03:27.110> for

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
the wrist I'd have a mess of keys for

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.010 
the wrist I'd have a mess of keys for
all<00:03:27.890> my<00:03:28.070> hand<00:03:28.489> gestures<00:03:29.000> as<00:03:29.239> well<00:03:29.690> as<00:03:29.840> my

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
all my hand gestures as well as my

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.790 
all my hand gestures as well as my
overall<00:03:30.470> large<00:03:30.800> arm<00:03:31.130> motions<00:03:32.090> I<00:03:32.800> separated

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
overall large arm motions I separated

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.890 
overall large arm motions I separated
into<00:03:33.950> two<00:03:34.070> controls<00:03:34.640> to<00:03:35.270> make<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.540> animators

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
into two controls to make the animators

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.020 
into two controls to make the animators
life<00:03:36.140> easier<00:03:36.560> and<00:03:36.590> separating<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.670> kind<00:03:37.940> of

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
life easier and separating the kind of

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.880 
life easier and separating the kind of
animation<00:03:38.420> that<00:03:38.660> you<00:03:38.750> want<00:03:38.989> you<00:03:39.440> really<00:03:39.709> don't

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
animation that you want you really don't

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.440 
animation that you want you really don't
want<00:03:40.040> your<00:03:40.100> hand<00:03:40.370> animation<00:03:40.910> mixed<00:03:41.239> in<00:03:41.330> with

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
want your hand animation mixed in with

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.120 
want your hand animation mixed in with
your<00:03:41.630> arm<00:03:41.780> they<00:03:42.410> tend<00:03:42.650> to<00:03:42.680> be<00:03:42.800> done<00:03:43.010> at

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
your arm they tend to be done at

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.650 
your arm they tend to be done at
different<00:03:43.459> times<00:03:43.670> in<00:03:43.820> different<00:03:43.880> ways<00:03:44.270> so<00:03:46.660> in

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
different times in different ways so in

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.210 
different times in different ways so in
this<00:03:47.810> section<00:03:48.320> we're<00:03:48.590> going<00:03:48.680> to<00:03:48.770> discuss<00:03:49.100> how

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
this section we're going to discuss how

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.520 
this section we're going to discuss how
to<00:03:49.250> use<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:49.610> pen<00:03:49.760> attribute<00:03:50.180> holder<00:03:50.530> once

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
to use the pen attribute holder once

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.190 
to use the pen attribute holder once
again<00:03:51.680> how<00:03:51.980> to<00:03:52.040> build<00:03:52.340> an<00:03:53.440> interface<00:03:54.440> for<00:03:55.250> our

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
again how to build an interface for our

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.820 
again how to build an interface for our
hands<00:03:58.660> connecting<00:03:59.660> spinners<00:04:00.080> and<00:04:00.290> sliders

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
hands connecting spinners and sliders

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.430 
hands connecting spinners and sliders
together<00:04:01.160> into<00:04:01.550> a<00:04:01.580> single<00:04:01.670> attribute

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.980 

and<00:04:05.530> setting<00:04:06.430> up<00:04:06.580> a<00:04:06.760> hand<00:04:07.330> that's<00:04:07.570> able<00:04:07.750> to<00:04:07.900> be

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
and setting up a hand that's able to be

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.230 
and setting up a hand that's able to be
posed<00:04:08.290> and<00:04:09.070> get<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.340> kind<00:04:09.490> of<00:04:09.550> gestures<00:04:10.000> that

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
posed and get the kind of gestures that

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.190 
posed and get the kind of gestures that
you<00:04:10.480> really<00:04:10.750> need<00:04:10.990> for<00:04:11.440> animation<00:04:13.080> going<00:04:14.080> to

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
you really need for animation going to

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.800 
you really need for animation going to
build<00:04:14.440> the<00:04:14.620> bones<00:04:14.830> for<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.070> hand<00:04:15.510> once<00:04:16.510> again

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
build the bones for the hand once again

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.180 
build the bones for the hand once again
i<00:04:16.840> tend<00:04:17.140> to<00:04:17.170> start<00:04:17.470> on<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:17.620> top<00:04:17.650> viewport<00:04:18.160> here

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
i tend to start on the top viewport here

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.980 
i tend to start on the top viewport here
and<00:04:21.190> i'm<00:04:21.610> going<00:04:21.880> to<00:04:21.970> create<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.750> bones<00:04:23.280> first

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
and i'm going to create the bones first

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.450 
and i'm going to create the bones first
for<00:04:25.990> just<00:04:26.200> one<00:04:26.350> of<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.560> fingers<00:04:26.950> i'm<00:04:27.310> actually

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
for just one of the fingers i'm actually

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.860 
for just one of the fingers i'm actually
going<00:04:27.670> to<00:04:27.760> make<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:28.030> bones<00:04:28.210> a<00:04:28.330> bit<00:04:28.480> smaller

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
going to make the bones a bit smaller

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:35.400 
going to make the bones a bit smaller
too<00:04:29.230> so<00:04:30.160> they<00:04:30.280> don't<00:04:30.870> stick<00:04:31.870> out<00:04:32.110> too<00:04:32.350> far<00:04:34.410> and

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
too so they don't stick out too far and

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.630 
too so they don't stick out too far and
