using Photoshop projects in Final Cut

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.370 
using Photoshop projects in Final Cut
Pro<00:00:02.399> is<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:02.970> great<00:00:03.300> workflow<00:00:03.750> because<00:00:03.929> Final

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
Pro is a great workflow because Final

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.869 
Pro is a great workflow because Final
Cut<00:00:04.500> will<00:00:04.680> allow<00:00:04.859> you<00:00:04.920> to<00:00:05.069> use<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.580> Photoshop

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
Cut will allow you to use the Photoshop

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.330 
Cut will allow you to use the Photoshop

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
layers independently in Photoshop I'm

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.660 
layers independently in Photoshop I'm
going<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.700> start<00:00:09.030> with<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.780> 1920<00:00:10.710> by<00:00:10.740> 1080<00:00:11.309> film

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
going to start with a 1920 by 1080 film

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.539 
going to start with a 1920 by 1080 film
and<00:00:11.790> video<00:00:12.030> project<00:00:12.540> preset<00:00:13.040> the<00:00:14.040> first<00:00:14.309> step

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
and video project preset the first step

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.189 
and video project preset the first step
will<00:00:14.759> be<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.880> use<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.179> rectangle<00:00:15.809> tool<00:00:15.990> to

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
will be to use the rectangle tool to

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.080 
will be to use the rectangle tool to
create<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.710> lower<00:00:16.890> third<00:00:17.220> box<00:00:17.490> at<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.789> bottom

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
create the lower third box at the bottom

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.540 
create the lower third box at the bottom
of<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.210> screen<00:00:18.740> next<00:00:19.740> drop<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.100> opacity<00:00:20.160> to

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
of the screen next drop the opacity to

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.019 
of the screen next drop the opacity to
50%<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.779> rasterize<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.350> layer<00:00:22.789> now<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:23.939> is

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
50% and rasterize the layer now it is

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.120 
50% and rasterize the layer now it is
time<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.390> add<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.539> text<00:00:24.810> layer<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.830> biggest

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
time to add a text layer the biggest

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.529 
time to add a text layer the biggest
reason<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.430> use<00:00:26.580> Photoshop<00:00:26.760> for<00:00:27.090> creating

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
reason I use Photoshop for creating

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.480 
reason I use Photoshop for creating
titles<00:00:27.720> like<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.830> because<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.189> love<00:00:29.369> the

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
titles like this is because I love the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.659 
titles like this is because I love the
look<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.820> beveled<00:00:30.179> text<00:00:30.539> in<00:00:30.630> Photoshop<00:00:31.669> once

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
look of beveled text in Photoshop once

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.250 
look of beveled text in Photoshop once
the<00:00:32.790> text<00:00:33.000> layer<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.329> complete<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.960> will<00:00:33.989> want

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
the text layer is complete you will want

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.020 
the text layer is complete you will want
to<00:00:34.350> duplicate<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.520> all<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.850> attributes

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
to duplicate it so all the attributes

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.840 
to duplicate it so all the attributes
carry<00:00:36.630> over<00:00:36.870> from<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.110> first<00:00:37.350> text<00:00:37.649> layer<00:00:37.850> in

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
carry over from the first text layer in

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.670 
carry over from the first text layer in
this<00:00:39.030> case<00:00:39.270> we<00:00:39.510> will<00:00:39.660> reduce<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.020> size<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
this case we will reduce the size of the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.310 
this case we will reduce the size of the
font<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.219> second<00:00:41.579> text<00:00:41.820> layer<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.290> have<00:00:43.290> a

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
font in the second text layer I have a

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.170 
font in the second text layer I have a
football<00:00:43.739> graphic<00:00:44.100> open<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.460> Photoshop<00:00:44.940> that

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
football graphic open in Photoshop that

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.029 
football graphic open in Photoshop that
I<00:00:45.360> will<00:00:45.570> move<00:00:45.719> into<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.079> lower<00:00:46.230> third<00:00:46.530> project

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
I will move into the lower third project

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.069 
I will move into the lower third project
after<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.000> get<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.239> graphic<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.690> way<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.840> want

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
after I get the graphic the way I want

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.450 
after I get the graphic the way I want
it<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.289> will<00:00:49.440> reposition<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.039> text<00:00:50.250> and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
it I will reposition the text and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.130 
it I will reposition the text and
rectangle<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.210> lower<00:00:51.390> third<00:00:51.690> looks<00:00:51.930> good

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
turn off the background layer and

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.160 
turn off the background layer and

remember<00:01:22.890> how<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.040> Photoshop<00:01:23.520> project

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
remember how the Photoshop project

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.550 
remember how the Photoshop project
showed<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.180> sequence<00:01:24.630> icon<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.140> browser

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
showed a sequence icon in the browser

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.440 
showed a sequence icon in the browser
well<00:01:26.460> that's<00:01:26.640> because<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.150> its<00:01:27.330> own

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
well that's because it is its own

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.020 
well that's because it is its own
sequence<00:01:27.920> within<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.130> sequence<00:01:29.520> we<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:29.850> see

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
sequence within the sequence we can see

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.520 
sequence within the sequence we can see
the<00:01:30.119> various<00:01:30.420> layers<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.079> created<00:01:31.380> in

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the various layers that we created in

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.890 
the various layers that we created in
Photoshop<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.220> we<00:01:32.880> can<00:01:33.000> now<00:01:33.119> manipulate<00:01:33.299> them

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
Photoshop and we can now manipulate them

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.130 
Photoshop and we can now manipulate them
independently<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:35.030> am<00:01:36.030> now<00:01:36.180> keyframing<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.930> 4

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
independently I am now keyframing the 4

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.469 
independently I am now keyframing the 4
layers<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.369> rectangle<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.090> graphic

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
layers so that the rectangle the graphic

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.660 
layers so that the rectangle the graphic
and<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.689> text<00:01:40.200> all<00:01:40.380> move<00:01:41.009> onto<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.369> screen

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670
