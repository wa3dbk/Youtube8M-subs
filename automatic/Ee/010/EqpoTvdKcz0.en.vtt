taking<00:02:21.060> different<00:02:21.180> courses<00:02:21.600> you<00:02:21.780> could<00:02:21.930> get<00:02:22.080> a

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
taking different courses you could get a

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.290 
taking different courses you could get a
notepad<00:02:22.410> for<00:02:22.890> every<00:02:23.220> course<00:02:23.460> and<00:02:23.790> just<00:02:23.910> put<00:02:24.210> it

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
notepad for every course and just put it

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.750 
notepad for every course and just put it
in<00:02:24.390> here<00:02:24.570> when<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:24.780> need<00:02:25.020> it<00:02:25.730> something<00:02:26.730> like

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
that you could you know split up a

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.190 
that you could you know split up a
little<00:02:29.460> pad<00:02:29.760> uniquely<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.600> can<00:02:30.720> do<00:02:30.780> all<00:02:30.930> sorts

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
little pad uniquely you can do all sorts

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.320 
little pad uniquely you can do all sorts
of<00:02:31.260> things<00:02:31.320> what<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.310> like<00:02:32.580> about<00:02:32.760> this<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.300> that

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
of things what I like about this is that

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.570 
of things what I like about this is that
it<00:02:33.570> allows<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.530> carry<00:02:34.740> a<00:02:34.920> lot<00:02:35.100> of<00:02:35.130> stuff

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
it allows you to carry a lot of stuff

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.800 
it allows you to carry a lot of stuff
with<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.320> because<00:02:37.320> right<00:02:37.590> here<00:02:37.920> I've<00:02:38.190> got<00:02:38.370> a

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
you see I've got a pen pocket you can

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.160 
you see I've got a pen pocket you can
put<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.070> pen<00:02:44.310> in<00:02:44.340> there<00:02:44.930> clearly<00:02:45.930> it's<00:02:46.080> not

put a pen in there clearly it's not

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.960 
put a pen in there clearly it's not
really<00:02:46.590> made<00:02:46.800> for<00:02:46.830> fountain<00:02:47.400> pens<00:02:47.610> if<00:02:47.820> you

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
really made for fountain pens if you

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.040 
really made for fountain pens if you
have<00:02:48.120> big<00:02:48.360> pens<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:48.990> it<00:02:49.080> won't<00:02:49.620> really<00:02:49.830> work

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
have big pens and it won't really work

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.950 
have big pens and it won't really work
I've<00:02:52.050> got<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.260> small<00:02:52.530> pen<00:02:52.770> here<00:02:53.510> so<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:54.720> works

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
I've got a small pen here so that works

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.470 
I've got a small pen here so that works
that<00:02:55.320> works<00:02:55.380> pretty<00:02:55.770> well<00:02:56.060> there's<00:02:57.060> another

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
that works pretty well there's another

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.050 
that works pretty well there's another
little<00:02:58.050> loop<00:02:58.650> here<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.040> sort<00:02:59.340> of<00:02:59.430> an<00:02:59.490> elastic

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
little loop here and sort of an elastic

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.920 
little loop here and sort of an elastic
band<00:03:00.420> type<00:03:01.110> loop<00:03:01.820> which<00:03:02.820> you<00:03:03.000> can<00:03:03.180> use<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:03.780> can

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
band type loop which you can use you can

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.190 
band type loop which you can use you can
put<00:03:03.960> a<00:03:04.110> pen<00:03:04.350> in<00:03:04.380> there<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:06.090> then<00:03:06.870> there<00:03:07.080> are

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
put a pen in there and then there are

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.480 
put a pen in there and then there are
two<00:03:07.530> I<00:03:08.010> think<00:03:08.310> yeah<00:03:08.730> so<00:03:09.000> here<00:03:09.270> is<00:03:09.450> one<00:03:10.430> sort<00:03:11.430> of

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
two I think yeah so here is one sort of

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.630 
two I think yeah so here is one sort of
full<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:12.150> thing<00:03:12.360> you<00:03:12.630> can<00:03:12.840> put<00:03:13.050> paper<00:03:13.650> in<00:03:13.860> and

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
full of thing you can put paper in and

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.710 
full of thing you can put paper in and
here's<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.090> second<00:03:15.510> one

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
here's the second one

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.949 
here's the second one
and<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.740> lining<00:03:17.220> is<00:03:17.400> is<00:03:17.610> fairly<00:03:17.880> soft<00:03:18.390> feels<00:03:18.840> a

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
and the lining is is fairly soft feels a

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.720 
and the lining is is fairly soft feels a
bit<00:03:19.080> like<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.500> don't<00:03:19.560> know<00:03:19.709> some<00:03:19.950> nylon<00:03:20.430> type

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730

compartment which is good if you need to
put<00:03:26.700> something<00:03:26.940> in<00:03:27.180> there<00:03:27.420> that<00:03:28.200> you<00:03:28.320> really

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
put something in there that you really

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.449

computation you know what to do it no my

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.540 
computation you know what to do it no my
hand<00:04:08.940> because<00:04:09.120> you<00:04:09.330> just<00:04:09.510> you<00:04:09.750> know<00:04:10.370> wanted<00:04:11.370> to
