okay<00:00:24.330> ready<00:00:24.859> start<00:00:26.390> there's<00:00:27.390> definitely<00:00:27.779> a

okay ready start there's definitely a
stigma<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.410> think<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.890> part<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.609> has

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
stigma and I think that part of it has

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.529 
stigma and I think that part of it has
come<00:00:29.910> from<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.119> scientific<00:00:30.269> community

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
come from the scientific community

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.110 
come from the scientific community
talking<00:00:31.230> about<00:00:31.380> curing<00:00:31.769> autism<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:33.059> I

talking about curing autism and and I

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.700 
talking about curing autism and and I
don't<00:00:33.180> really<00:00:33.600> want<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.020> talk<00:00:34.320> about<00:00:34.380> autism

I<00:00:35.730> think<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.180> we<00:00:36.840> should<00:00:36.989> talk<00:00:37.079> about<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.500> in

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
I think that we should talk about it in

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.220 
I think that we should talk about it in
terms<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.920> strengths<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.340> weaknesses

Troy at that time I'm starting to feel I
could<00:01:58.330> use<00:01:58.509> about<00:01:58.840> 12<00:01:59.380> hours<00:01:59.590> of<00:01:59.830> sleep<00:02:00.100> when

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
could use about 12 hours of sleep when

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
could use about 12 hours of sleep when
you're<00:02:01.210> having<00:02:01.360> a<00:02:01.539> conversation<00:02:01.659> with

someone it needs to be too cited a
two-way<00:02:04.360> conversation<00:02:04.569> you<00:02:05.319> ask<00:02:05.470> good

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
two-way conversation you ask good

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.169 
two-way conversation you ask good
follow-up<00:02:06.250> questions<00:02:06.789> what<00:02:07.030> kind<00:02:07.149> of

someone who's on their wavelength all of
us<00:02:28.630> parents<00:02:28.959> are<00:02:29.140> like<00:02:29.260> I<00:02:29.760> should<00:02:30.760> use<00:02:30.910> this

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
us parents are like I should use this

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.630 
us parents are like I should use this
because<00:02:31.900> it's<00:02:32.410> it<00:02:32.650> gives<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:33.040> that<00:02:33.160> guidance

you<00:02:34.150> know<00:02:34.239> we're<00:02:34.480> all<00:02:34.600> awkward<00:02:34.989> in<00:02:35.170> certain

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
you know we're all awkward in certain

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.370 
you know we're all awkward in certain
situations<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:37.090> broke<00:02:37.269> it<00:02:37.450> down<00:02:37.600> to<00:02:38.350> a

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
situations and it broke it down to a

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.630 
situations and it broke it down to a
fine<00:02:38.620> thing<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:39.130> could<00:02:39.310> use<00:02:39.489> it

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
fine thing that you could use it

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.910 
fine thing that you could use it
yourself<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:41.200> know<00:02:41.260> I<00:02:41.320> think<00:02:41.380> that<00:02:41.650> sometimes

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
yourself you know I think that sometimes

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.100 
yourself you know I think that sometimes

that part of our nature is human

that part of our nature is human
is<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.640> be<00:02:50.730> social<00:02:51.210> and<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.540> changes<00:02:51.990> the

we are the only site in the country

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.210 
we are the only site in the country
looking<00:03:00.960> at<00:03:01.230> how<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.410> brain<00:03:01.620> in<00:03:01.950> autism

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
looking at how the brain in autism

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.940 
looking at how the brain in autism
responds<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.090> therapy<00:03:03.240> the<00:03:04.020> kid<00:03:04.200> strains

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
responds to therapy the kid strains

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.890 
responds to therapy the kid strains
and<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.610> left<00:03:05.820> side<00:03:06.030> becomes<00:03:06.300> more<00:03:06.540> active

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
and the left side becomes more active

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.190 
and the left side becomes more active
after<00:03:07.020> peers<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:08.250> that's<00:03:08.400> really

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
after peers and that's really

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.870 
after peers and that's really
groundbreaking<00:03:10.200> because<00:03:10.610> when<00:03:11.610> you<00:03:11.700> have

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
groundbreaking because when you have
