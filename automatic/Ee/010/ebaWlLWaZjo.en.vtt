pretty<00:01:51.409> difficult<00:01:51.729> i'm<00:01:52.729> under<00:01:52.939> the<00:01:52.969> idea<00:01:53.360> that

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
pretty difficult i'm under the idea that

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.770 
pretty difficult i'm under the idea that
you're<00:01:54.439> going<00:01:54.590> to<00:01:54.649> record<00:01:55.450> through<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.539> air

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
you're going to record through the air

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.859 
you're going to record through the air
without<00:01:58.149> cleaning<00:01:59.149> it<00:01:59.360> up<00:01:59.479> as<00:01:59.659> much<00:01:59.689> as

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
without cleaning it up as much as

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.260 
without cleaning it up as much as
possible<00:02:01.210> by<00:02:02.210> deadening<00:02:02.929> the<00:02:03.110> sound<00:02:03.380> I<00:02:04.270> think

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
possible by deadening the sound I think

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.359 
possible by deadening the sound I think
you<00:02:05.390> should<00:02:05.539> just<00:02:05.720> be<00:02:05.810> either<00:02:06.319> in<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:06.979> high-end

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
you should just be either in a high-end

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.960 
you should just be either in a high-end
studio<00:02:08.179> or<00:02:08.599> keep<00:02:09.289> this<00:02:09.500> debt<00:02:10.160> as<00:02:10.310> possible<00:02:10.849> and

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
studio or keep this debt as possible and

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.309 
studio or keep this debt as possible and
run<00:02:11.150> it<00:02:11.269> through<00:02:11.299> effects<00:02:11.870> for<00:02:12.049> any

run it through effects for any
environmental<00:02:13.299> factors<00:02:15.819> so<00:02:16.819> I<00:02:17.150> tend<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.660> shy

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
decided to use two cases on top of each

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.440 
decided to use two cases on top of each
other<00:02:41.989> to<00:02:42.140> make<00:02:42.470> one<00:02:42.680> large<00:02:42.890> case<00:02:43.220> because<00:02:43.670> it

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
other to make one large case because it

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.960 
other to make one large case because it
would<00:02:44.569> allow<00:02:44.600> me<00:02:45.350> to<00:02:45.650> take<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.130> top<00:02:46.370> off<00:02:46.579> and

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
would allow me to take the top off and

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.250 
would allow me to take the top off and
take<00:02:47.810> a<00:02:47.840> portable<00:02:48.350> rig<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:48.769> leave<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:49.959> then<00:02:50.959> I

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
take a portable rig and leave and then I

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.930 
take a portable rig and leave and then I
could<00:02:51.410> use<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.560> bottom<00:02:51.980> house<00:02:52.190> which<00:02:52.730> has

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.750 
could use the bottom house which has
mainly<00:02:53.239> studio<00:02:53.810> gear<00:02:54.109> and<00:02:54.350> keep<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:55.489> here

basically allows me to say have my
preamp<00:04:22.380> and<00:04:23.630> my<00:04:24.630> effect<00:04:25.050> switched<00:04:25.380> out<00:04:25.590> at

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
preamp and my effect switched out at

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.500 
preamp and my effect switched out at

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
program I put into the foot pedal so

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.690 
program I put into the foot pedal so
basically<00:04:31.169> it'll<00:04:31.380> cut<00:04:31.770> off<00:04:31.919> any<00:04:32.160> connections

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700

and<00:04:32.850> add<00:04:33.090> any<00:04:33.330> connections<00:04:33.840> I<00:04:33.900> want<00:04:34.140> based<00:04:34.380> on

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
and add any connections I want based on

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.430 
and add any connections I want based on
a<00:04:34.650> preset<00:04:35.540> configuration<00:04:36.540> so<00:04:37.169> you<00:04:37.229> can

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
a preset configuration so you can

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.719 
a preset configuration so you can
basically<00:04:37.530> change<00:04:38.360> everything<00:04:39.360> on<00:04:39.570> the<00:04:39.660> fly

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
basically change everything on the fly

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.390 
basically change everything on the fly
and<00:04:41.729> I<00:04:41.970> based<00:04:42.300> on<00:04:42.510> 8<00:04:43.320> channels<00:04:43.950> worth<00:04:44.220> of

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
and I based on 8 channels worth of

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.770 
and I based on 8 channels worth of
stereo<00:04:44.610> inputs<00:04:46.190> so<00:04:47.270> essential<00:04:48.270> feature<00:04:48.479> if

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.930 
stereo inputs so essential feature if
you<00:04:48.870> have<00:04:48.990> more<00:04:49.290> than<00:04:49.350> one<00:04:49.470> amp<00:04:49.800> I<00:04:50.130> typically

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
you have more than one amp I typically

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.730 
you have more than one amp I typically
just<00:04:51.060> use<00:04:51.330> it<00:04:51.450> with<00:04:51.540> my<00:04:51.690> one<00:04:51.930> amp<00:04:52.140> I<00:04:52.350> could

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
just use it with my one amp I could

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.990 
just use it with my one amp I could
essentially<00:04:53.130> take<00:04:53.540> my<00:04:54.540> ad<00:04:54.840> a<00:04:54.870> into<00:04:55.320> two<00:04:55.560> and

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
essentially take my ad a into two and

it is a total bear there's a pc
interface<00:05:52.580> for<00:05:53.000> it<00:05:53.120> but<00:05:53.240> i've<00:05:53.300> never<00:05:53.330> really

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
interface for it but i've never really

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.469 
interface for it but i've never really
used<00:05:54.020> it<00:05:54.229> i<00:05:54.409> have<00:05:55.220> my<00:05:55.370> presets<00:05:55.789> mainly<00:05:56.240> in

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
used it i have my presets mainly in

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:01.360 
used it i have my presets mainly in
already<00:05:56.870> so<00:05:57.229> i<00:05:57.530> haven't<00:05:58.520> utilized<00:05:58.759> that<00:06:00.370> so

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
already so i haven't utilized that so

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.100 
already so i haven't utilized that so
that's<00:06:01.550> basically<00:06:01.789> used<00:06:02.210> for<00:06:02.389> all<00:06:02.569> main

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
that's basically used for all main

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.350 
that's basically used for all main
effects<00:06:03.710> it's<00:06:03.860> a<00:06:04.069> has<00:06:04.400> a<00:06:04.430> low<00:06:04.639> quality<00:06:04.940> set

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
effects it's a has a low quality set

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.210 
effects it's a has a low quality set
where<00:06:05.599> you<00:06:05.780> can<00:06:06.050> switch<00:06:06.590> between<00:06:06.710> effects

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 
where you can switch between effects

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.860 
where you can switch between effects
without<00:06:07.340> any<00:06:07.580> kind<00:06:07.729> of<00:06:07.849> delays<00:06:08.120> or<00:06:08.360> dropouts

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
without any kind of delays or dropouts

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.700 
without any kind of delays or dropouts
it<00:06:09.560> doesn't<00:06:09.889> use<00:06:10.009> as<00:06:10.159> much<00:06:10.340> processing<00:06:10.880> power

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
it doesn't use as much processing power

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.379 
it doesn't use as much processing power
so<00:06:12.710> I<00:06:13.280> would<00:06:13.550> typically<00:06:13.789> use<00:06:13.909> that<00:06:14.150> for<00:06:14.360> a

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:14.389 
so I would typically use that for a

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:17.140 
so I would typically use that for a
chorus<00:06:14.840> or<00:06:15.050> any<00:06:15.169> special<00:06:15.380> effects<00:06:16.150> because

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
chorus or any special effects because

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.149 
chorus or any special effects because
this<00:06:17.300> thing<00:06:17.509> can<00:06:17.720> do<00:06:17.840> some<00:06:18.020> wild<00:06:18.199> sound<00:06:18.680> so

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:19.159 
this thing can do some wild sound so

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:21.610 
this thing can do some wild sound so
that's<00:06:19.759> mainly<00:06:20.000> my<00:06:20.330> main<00:06:20.720> special<00:06:21.319> effects

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
that's mainly my main special effects

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.430 
that's mainly my main special effects

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:15.289 
sounds great but I would say it's

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:22.340 
everything it doesn't really get much

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.600 
everything it doesn't really get much
use<00:07:23.440> so<00:07:24.440> from<00:07:24.710> there<00:07:24.889> we<00:07:24.919> have<00:07:25.279> the<00:07:25.310> Mesa

very<00:07:54.660> well<00:07:54.900> I<00:07:55.140> went<00:07:55.920> with<00:07:56.070> the<00:07:56.160> triple

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:56.370 
very well I went with the triple

very well I went with the triple
rectifier<00:07:56.550> for<00:07:57.240> a<00:07:57.270> while<00:07:57.710> did<00:07:58.710> not<00:07:58.830> play<00:07:59.430> well

00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 
rectifier for a while did not play well

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.270 
rectifier for a while did not play well
with<00:08:00.120> most<00:08:00.420> of<00:08:00.600> my<00:08:00.660> effects<00:08:01.260> leveling<00:08:02.130> was

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:02.280 
with most of my effects leveling was

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:06.790 
with most of my effects leveling was
just<00:08:02.520> a<00:08:03.150> total<00:08:03.630> nightmare<00:08:04.130> so<00:08:05.130> I<00:08:05.750> sold

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:10.530 
fortunately the triple rectifier for a

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:12.500 
fortunately the triple rectifier for a
lot<00:08:10.680> of<00:08:10.800> what<00:08:10.920> i<00:08:10.950> paid<00:08:11.370> for<00:08:11.400> it<00:08:11.850> and<00:08:11.880> got<00:08:12.180> most
