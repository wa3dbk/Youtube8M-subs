00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:01.180
 good 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.180
 Our focus is very simple. 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.230
 so you step on 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.170
 the goal is stolen from a very 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.200
 practical to samsung 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.200

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.180
 Next, it 's imperative that we get the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.110
 block because we just do not 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.980
 return 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.810

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.430
 material that you will use that is 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.760

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.930
 the middle 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:51.820
 the two do not have data and those that are 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:55.630
 a way to a coup that will put this 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.790
