 understand but it's very simple I 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.100
 apologize because at times there is a little 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.570
 jew blurs so shadows and everything 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.579
 because I've never done a thousand 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.710
 kind of videos so here it is a 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.329
 first I sincerely hope that it's going 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.329
 to please you and we start right away 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.859
 the first recipe is going to be a recipe 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.080
 zinc with the cow laughing she 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.080
 is called double would put the recipe 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.000
 such as the team for the book apart 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.920
 of a fake so you need a 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.180
 glass or bug I had been able to me him 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:22.110
 I had a new glass of salt and 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:23.640
 pepper from the olive oil nuclear 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.650
 masked people rice 3 that's 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.689
 better what I find that this is 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.840
 not enough yeast flour 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.840
 chemical 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.280
 and of course fungi after you 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.920
 do a little to your liking you can 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.719
 remove an ingredient then if you 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.860
 do not like mushrooms etc 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:48.320
 we start by breaking the egg nothing 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:54.470
 simpler we will put salt from 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:02:01.069
 like pepper is another taste and we 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:03.460
 then mix three spoons of oil 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:03.460
 olive 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.920
 we mix the mixture I do a lot 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.550
 better at the fork 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:26.230
 then I come shredded but cow 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:30.790
 who laughs but downright so 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.990
 looks like nothing but I mix it we 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.380
 said marc it's not at all 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:38.590
 appetizing but the end result is 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:42.190
 delicious and then I'll put my 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.200
 flour leather it will take six who I 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.390
 advise you to mix everything in 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.190
 another container than your bowl or 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.570
 your cup is very much 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.570
 much simpler 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.980
 and then you add the yeast 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.300
 chemical we mix it again that's 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.280
 bercy can go see the recipe 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.990
 next it was totally difficult 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.350
 a disaster if you fall dangerous 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.350
 Not good 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:25.660
 minutes the mushrooms cut on 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.510
 mix and that's it gone 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.100
 a middle of twenty in the microwave 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.960
 the result so I added a small 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.810
 laughing cow on top for that 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.030
 would be even better and that's it 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:42.730
 really a cake savenas boufflers on 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:45.580
 a delicious the second recipe his 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.140
 Nutella models this one delicious 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.520
 so the two g20 video that was the 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:58.360
 first time the testers you have 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:04:01.930
 need a sugar nerve tunnels to 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.570
 the flour of the baking powder of 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:11.170
 chocolate powder 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:12.280
 we just break their mix we're going 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.510
 much better at fair skin 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:21.010
 we put gold spoon sugar in 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:23.740
 mixture is brought spoons 8 then 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.280
 like this to taste it's not so much 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.280
 obvious 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.250
 is there I had a problem so you have 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.639
 I put in a lot more place 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:51.990
 great 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:51.990
 5 tablespoons flour baking powder 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.320
 powdered chocolate and mixed 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.240
 so I honestly wondered 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.100
 how I was going to do so I 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.550
 also do my opinion because otherwise I 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:10.930
 will not arrive then we go to migron 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:14.560
 a minute at 1,850 watts 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.560
 this is the result 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.890
 where I understand it does not look at all 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.870
 appetizing but honestly it's 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.370
 so much but so good I you 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.700
