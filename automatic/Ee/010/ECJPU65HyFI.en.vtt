00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
now i'm just going to fast-forward

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:36.650 
now i'm just going to fast-forward
through<00:04:15.940> this

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.330 

okay<00:04:37.660> so<00:04:37.720> by<00:04:38.080> doing<00:04:38.139> that<00:04:38.620> we<00:04:39.009> just<00:04:39.160> created

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
okay so by doing that we just created

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.909 
okay so by doing that we just created
some<00:04:39.669> really<00:04:40.060> loose<00:04:40.300> volume<00:04:40.840> in<00:04:41.050> the<00:04:41.110> hair<00:04:41.440> now

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
some really loose volume in the hair now

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.680 
some really loose volume in the hair now
we're<00:04:42.130> going<00:04:42.250> to<00:04:42.340> go<00:04:42.490> back<00:04:42.520> in<00:04:42.940> and<00:04:43.120> grab<00:04:43.660> some

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
we're going to go back in and grab some

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.230 
we're going to go back in and grab some
smaller<00:04:44.410> sections<00:04:45.039> and<00:04:45.190> start<00:04:45.759> adding<00:04:45.880> some

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
smaller sections and start adding some

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.710 
smaller sections and start adding some
definition<00:04:46.870> by<00:04:46.990> using<00:04:47.229> some<00:04:47.590> smaller<00:04:47.949> curls

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
definition by using some smaller curls

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.430 
definition by using some smaller curls
are<00:04:49.720> some<00:04:49.960> smaller<00:04:50.259> sections<00:04:50.860> I<00:04:51.009> should<00:04:51.400> say

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
are some smaller sections I should say

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.350 
are some smaller sections I should say
so<00:04:53.440> this<00:04:53.650> if<00:04:53.860> this<00:04:54.220> will<00:04:54.430> work<00:04:54.460> if<00:04:54.970> you<00:04:55.120> have

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
so this if this will work if you have

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.300 
so this if this will work if you have
shorter<00:04:55.870> hair<00:04:55.900> maybe<00:04:56.259> try<00:04:56.560> to<00:04:56.620> go<00:04:56.830> one<00:04:57.099> and<00:04:57.220> a

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
shorter hair maybe try to go one and a

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.620
