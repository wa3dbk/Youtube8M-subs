00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
bit low to high and really the spin is

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.560 
bit low to high and really the spin is
your<00:01:32.490> best<00:01:32.640> friend<00:01:33.000> if<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.390> little

your best friend if you have a little

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.570 
your best friend if you have a little
bit<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.810> extra<00:01:34.080> topspin<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:35.190> can<00:01:35.310> kind<00:01:35.520> of

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
bit of extra topspin you can kind of

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.490 
bit of extra topspin you can kind of
still<00:01:35.760> swing<00:01:36.030> away<00:01:36.180> at<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.510> ball<00:01:36.690> and<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.350> can

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
still swing away at the ball and you can

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.980 
still swing away at the ball and you can
ideally<00:01:38.310> keep<00:01:38.490> control<00:01:38.940> the<00:01:39.030> ball<00:01:39.210> better<00:01:39.450> but

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
ideally keep control the ball better but

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.050 
ideally keep control the ball better but
keeping<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.620> backswing<00:01:41.070> short<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.760> not

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
keeping the backswing short and not

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.500 
keeping the backswing short and not
really<00:01:42.920> going<00:01:43.920> too<00:01:44.070> far<00:01:44.460> back<00:01:44.790> with<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.210> makes

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
really going too far back with it makes

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.750 
really going too far back with it makes
it<00:01:45.660> a<00:01:45.690> lot<00:01:45.840> easier<00:01:45.900> so<00:01:46.860> you're<00:01:47.460> looking<00:01:47.580> to

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
it a lot easier so you're looking to

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.060 
it a lot easier so you're looking to
really<00:01:47.970> keep<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.450> short<00:01:48.900> and<00:01:49.020> sweet<00:01:49.200> low<00:01:50.010> to

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
really keep it short and sweet low to

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.290 
really keep it short and sweet low to
high<00:01:50.280> if<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.460> don't<00:01:50.640> hit<00:01:50.760> with<00:01:50.850> tops<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.270> I

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
high if you don't hit with tops and I

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.040 
high if you don't hit with tops and I
suggest<00:01:52.490> trying<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.550> learn<00:01:53.730> that<00:01:54.330> that<00:01:54.660> spin

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
suggest trying to learn that that spin

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.630 
suggest trying to learn that that spin
because<00:01:55.260> that<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.770> your<00:01:55.950> one<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.340> your<00:01:56.430> best

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
because that is your one of your best

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.520 
because that is your one of your best
friends<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.690> warm<00:01:57.870> weather<00:01:58.080> it'll<00:01:58.380> keep

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
friends in the warm weather it'll keep

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.960 
friends in the warm weather it'll keep
that<00:01:58.590> ball<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:59.010> play<00:01:59.220> allows<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.760> swing

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
that ball in play allows you to swing

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.730 
that ball in play allows you to swing
away

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
away

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.800 
away
so<00:02:01.740> that's<00:02:01.920> aspect<00:02:02.310> number<00:02:02.490> one<00:02:02.670> alright<00:02:03.630> one

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
so that's aspect number one alright one

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.050 
so that's aspect number one alright one
of<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.960> biggest<00:02:04.260> aspects<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.880> one<00:02:05.880> weather

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
of the biggest aspects of one weather

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.169 
of the biggest aspects of one weather
paddle<00:02:06.510> is<00:02:06.690> your<00:02:07.110> volley<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:08.039> it's<00:02:08.489> gonna<00:02:09.030> be

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
paddle is your volley and it's gonna be

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.080 
paddle is your volley and it's gonna be
harder<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.509> control<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:11.099> way<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.340> you

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
harder to control so the way you you

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.990 
harder to control so the way you you
approach<00:02:12.420> this<00:02:12.629> shot<00:02:12.930> is<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:14.340> tension<00:02:14.819> in<00:02:14.909> the

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
approach this shot is the tension in the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.160 
approach this shot is the tension in the
arm<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.300> think<00:02:15.330> is<00:02:15.540> one<00:02:15.629> of<00:02:15.659> the<00:02:15.720> biggest<00:02:15.989> things

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
arm I think is one of the biggest things

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.149 
arm I think is one of the biggest things
you<00:02:16.230> can<00:02:16.349> do<00:02:16.440> in<00:02:16.530> warm<00:02:16.709> weather<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:16.980> I'm<00:02:17.069> gonna

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
you can do in warm weather so I'm gonna

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.589 
you can do in warm weather so I'm gonna
hit<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.340> few<00:02:17.550> balls<00:02:17.670> here<00:02:17.940> watch<00:02:18.150> watch<00:02:18.390> my

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
hit a few balls here watch watch my

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.330 
hit a few balls here watch watch my
paddle<00:02:18.959> here<00:02:19.080> I'm<00:02:19.440> going<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.709> keep<00:02:20.069> it<00:02:20.220> in

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
paddle here I'm going to keep it in

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.009 
paddle here I'm going to keep it in
close<00:02:20.670> but<00:02:21.269> really<00:02:21.510> I'm<00:02:21.599> gonna<00:02:21.720> use<00:02:21.989> that

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
close but really I'm gonna use that

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.410 
close but really I'm gonna use that
non-dominant<00:02:22.860> hand<00:02:23.159> to<00:02:23.280> take<00:02:23.489> pressure<00:02:24.090> off

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
non-dominant hand to take pressure off

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.199 
non-dominant hand to take pressure off
of<00:02:24.810> my<00:02:25.319> dominant<00:02:25.920> hand<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.519> that<00:02:26.849> way<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.030> won't

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
of my dominant hand and that way I won't

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.759 
of my dominant hand and that way I won't
be<00:02:27.330> squeezing<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:27.989> won't<00:02:28.140> be<00:02:28.260> reaching<00:02:28.620> out

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
be squeezing it I won't be reaching out

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.140 
be squeezing it I won't be reaching out
because<00:02:29.069> if<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:29.310> go<00:02:29.430> out<00:02:29.519> a<00:02:29.549> little<00:02:29.730> bit<00:02:29.970> warm

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
because if I go out a little bit warm

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.759 
because if I go out a little bit warm
weather<00:02:30.330> paddle<00:02:30.659> that<00:02:30.750> ball<00:02:30.930> will<00:02:31.110> fly<00:02:31.290> on<00:02:31.440> me

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
weather paddle that ball will fly on me

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.289 
weather paddle that ball will fly on me
I'm<00:02:32.040> going<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.250> be<00:02:32.340> in<00:02:32.489> close<00:02:32.760> in<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.090> warm

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
I'm going to be in close in the warm

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.330 
I'm going to be in close in the warm
weather<00:02:33.480> I'm<00:02:33.930> gonna<00:02:34.140> be<00:02:34.290> loose<00:02:34.709> with<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:34.980> arms

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
weather I'm gonna be loose with the arms

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.339 
weather I'm gonna be loose with the arms
enough<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.150> keep<00:02:36.299> obviously<00:02:36.959> squeezing

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
enough to keep obviously squeezing

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.110 
enough to keep obviously squeezing
enough<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.680> keep<00:02:37.799> the<00:02:37.950> paddle<00:02:38.250> steady<00:02:38.520> but<00:02:39.030> I'm

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
enough to keep the paddle steady but I'm

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.760 
enough to keep the paddle steady but I'm
really<00:02:39.330> not<00:02:39.540> looking<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.990> go<00:02:40.110> out<00:02:40.140> forward

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
really not looking to go out forward

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.930 
really not looking to go out forward
towards<00:02:41.069> it<00:02:41.190> I'm<00:02:41.310> gonna<00:02:41.430> let<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.730> ball<00:02:41.910> come

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
towards it I'm gonna let the ball come

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.130 
towards it I'm gonna let the ball come
to<00:02:42.300> me<00:02:42.390> contact<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.230> ball<00:02:43.440> within

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
to me contact the ball within

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.410 
to me contact the ball within
probably<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:44.530> 12-inch<00:02:45.190> spam<00:02:45.760> from<00:02:45.970> my<00:02:46.060> paddle

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
probably a 12-inch spam from my paddle

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.420 
probably a 12-inch spam from my paddle
to<00:02:46.510> my<00:02:46.630> chest<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.170> not<00:02:47.260> not<00:02:47.740> a<00:02:47.770> far<00:02:48.040> distance

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
to my chest and not not a far distance

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.309 
to my chest and not not a far distance
at<00:02:48.550> all<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:48.940> I'm<00:02:49.000> just<00:02:49.180> gonna<00:02:49.300> absorb<00:02:49.840> the

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
at all and I'm just gonna absorb the

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.040 
at all and I'm just gonna absorb the
pace<00:02:50.560> each<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.190> every<00:02:51.370> time<00:02:51.610> so<00:02:52.000> it's<00:02:52.690> it's

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
pace each and every time so it's it's

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.510 
pace each and every time so it's it's
one<00:02:53.440> of<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.709> most<00:02:53.920> important<00:02:54.220> things<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.430> can

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
one of the most important things you can

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.090 
one of the most important things you can
do<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:55.000> probably<00:02:55.480> any<00:02:55.630> weather<00:02:55.870> but<00:02:56.170> in<00:02:56.740> warm

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
do and probably any weather but in warm

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.220 
do and probably any weather but in warm
weather<00:02:57.280> you<00:02:57.760> really<00:02:58.150> have<00:02:58.300> to<00:02:58.450> make<00:02:58.959> sure

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
weather you really have to make sure

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.080 
weather you really have to make sure
that<00:02:59.380> you're<00:02:59.560> in<00:02:59.800> close<00:03:00.190> on<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.880> volley

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
that you're in close on the volley

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.490 
that you're in close on the volley
because<00:03:01.420> that<00:03:01.570> ball<00:03:01.780> will<00:03:01.959> go<00:03:02.140> in<00:03:02.290> warm

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
because that ball will go in warm

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.880 
because that ball will go in warm
weather

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
weather

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.850 
weather
that's<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:03.910> SPECT<00:03:04.120> number<00:03:04.300> too<00:03:04.450> so<00:03:04.750> I<00:03:05.350> noticed

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
that's a SPECT number too so I noticed

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
that's a SPECT number too so I noticed
Peter<00:03:06.040> when<00:03:06.340> you<00:03:06.430> were<00:03:06.520> hitting<00:03:06.730> those

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
Peter when you were hitting those

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.449 
Peter when you were hitting those
volleys<00:03:07.420> you<00:03:08.410> made<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.709> contact<00:03:09.100> with<00:03:09.310> your

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
volleys you made the contact with your

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.180 
volleys you made the contact with your
paddle<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:11.050> actually<00:03:11.230> retracted<00:03:12.040> your

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
paddle and you actually retracted your

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.900 
paddle and you actually retracted your
paddle<00:03:12.520> after<00:03:12.790> contact<00:03:14.370> yeah<00:03:15.370> I<00:03:15.400> mean<00:03:15.700> a<00:03:15.760> lot

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
paddle after contact yeah I mean a lot

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.490 
paddle after contact yeah I mean a lot
of<00:03:15.970> times<00:03:16.180> your<00:03:16.360> weight<00:03:16.930> when<00:03:17.110> the<00:03:17.170> balls<00:03:17.380> are

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
of times your weight when the balls are

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.710 
of times your weight when the balls are
coming<00:03:17.860> to<00:03:18.010> you<00:03:18.220> you<00:03:18.459> have<00:03:19.150> to<00:03:19.180> be<00:03:19.420> able<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:19.600> go

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
coming to you you have to be able to go

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.720 
coming to you you have to be able to go
backwards<00:03:20.230> a<00:03:20.320> little<00:03:20.350> bit<00:03:20.620> because<00:03:20.950> if<00:03:21.430> it's

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
backwards a little bit because if it's

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.030 
backwards a little bit because if it's
hit<00:03:21.940> let's<00:03:22.209> say<00:03:22.360> 30<00:03:22.630> 40<00:03:22.720> miles<00:03:23.140> an<00:03:23.320> hour

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
hit let's say 30 40 miles an hour

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.920 
hit let's say 30 40 miles an hour
the<00:03:24.459> ball<00:03:24.670> will<00:03:25.000> just<00:03:25.030> fly<00:03:25.360> on<00:03:25.660> you<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:25.870> you

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
the ball will just fly on you and you

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.320 
the ball will just fly on you and you
have<00:03:26.080> to<00:03:26.230> take<00:03:26.380> pace<00:03:26.650> off<00:03:26.920> the<00:03:27.580> volley<00:03:28.000> should

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
have to take pace off the volley should

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.720 
have to take pace off the volley should
be<00:03:28.450> a<00:03:28.480> slower<00:03:29.019> ball<00:03:29.380> that's<00:03:30.160> struck<00:03:30.459> them<00:03:30.640> to

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
be a slower ball that's struck them to

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.960 
be a slower ball that's struck them to
dry<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.570> drives<00:03:31.810> faster<00:03:32.440> then<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:33.610> then<00:03:33.790> your

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
dry the drives faster then and then your

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.130 
dry the drives faster then and then your
volley<00:03:34.180> then<00:03:34.450> you're<00:03:34.570> doing<00:03:34.750> all<00:03:34.840> right<00:03:35.019> if

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
volley then you're doing all right if

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.390 
volley then you're doing all right if
you<00:03:35.230> start<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.470> match<00:03:35.680> pace<00:03:35.980> you<00:03:36.190> get<00:03:36.340> in

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
you start to match pace you get in

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.979 
you start to match pace you get in
trouble<00:03:36.700> so<00:03:36.820> yes<00:03:36.970> if<00:03:37.450> that<00:03:37.510> paddle<00:03:37.900> goes

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
trouble so yes if that paddle goes

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.500 
trouble so yes if that paddle goes
backwards<00:03:38.560> you're<00:03:38.920> gonna<00:03:39.010> take<00:03:39.310> pace<00:03:39.910> off<00:03:40.209> and

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
backwards you're gonna take pace off and

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.729 
backwards you're gonna take pace off and
in<00:03:40.630> you're<00:03:41.050> gonna<00:03:41.140> make<00:03:41.320> more<00:03:41.440> volleys

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
in you're gonna make more volleys

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.250 
in you're gonna make more volleys
because<00:03:42.220> of<00:03:42.310> it<00:03:42.630> alright<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.660> third<00:03:43.900> aspect

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
because of it alright the third aspect

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.650 
because of it alright the third aspect
is<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.890> way<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.220> ball<00:03:45.400> behaves<00:03:45.850> in<00:03:46.150> the

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
is the way the ball behaves in the

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.630 
is the way the ball behaves in the
screens<00:03:47.050> and<00:03:47.470> if<00:03:47.890> you're<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.220> team<00:03:48.400> at<00:03:48.519> the

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
I can drive that ball and be aggressive

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.440 
I can drive that ball and be aggressive
on<00:04:06.130> these<00:04:06.360> so<00:04:07.360> again<00:04:07.690> I<00:04:08.579> can<00:04:09.579> come<00:04:09.790> in<00:04:10.000> it's

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
on these so again I can come in it's

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.490 
on these so again I can come in it's
just<00:04:10.840> much<00:04:11.049> more<00:04:11.079> of<00:04:11.380> a<00:04:11.440> drive<00:04:11.709> opportunity<00:04:13.500> if

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
just much more of a drive opportunity if

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.870 
just much more of a drive opportunity if
they<00:04:14.860> hit<00:04:15.010> it<00:04:15.130> too<00:04:15.280> hard

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
they hit it too hard

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.090 
they hit it too hard
now<00:04:16.209> look<00:04:16.450> how<00:04:16.600> far<00:04:16.900> in<00:04:17.229> I<00:04:17.350> mean<00:04:17.560> on<00:04:17.680> this<00:04:17.859> one<00:04:18.070> I

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
now look how far in I mean on this one I

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.490 
now look how far in I mean on this one I
mean<00:04:18.459> a<00:04:18.489> couple<00:04:18.700> feet<00:04:19.060> I'm<00:04:19.180> in<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.450> blue<00:04:19.720> the

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
mean a couple feet I'm in the blue the

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.780 
mean a couple feet I'm in the blue the
closer<00:04:20.739> I<00:04:20.919> get<00:04:20.979> to<00:04:21.130> the<00:04:21.220> volley<00:04:21.459> or<00:04:21.669> the

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
closer I get to the volley or the

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.820 
closer I get to the volley or the
tougher<00:04:22.150> it<00:04:22.210> is<00:04:22.330> for<00:04:22.540> them<00:04:22.690> so<00:04:23.020> on<00:04:23.650> your

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
tougher it is for them so on your

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.780 
tougher it is for them so on your
override<00:04:24.070> you're<00:04:24.250> really<00:04:24.460> looking<00:04:24.550> to<00:04:24.729> take

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
override you're really looking to take

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.180 
override you're really looking to take
pace<00:04:25.060> off<00:04:25.300> that<00:04:25.600> and<00:04:25.750> that<00:04:26.290> will<00:04:26.500> keep<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:26.740> the

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
pace off that and that will keep the the

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.130 
pace off that and that will keep the the
opponent's<00:04:27.610> back<00:04:27.789> behind<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.539> base<00:04:28.690> line<00:04:28.930> for

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
opponent's back behind the base line for

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.080 
opponent's back behind the base line for
me<00:04:29.800> I'm<00:04:29.950> hoping<00:04:30.100> to<00:04:30.310> lob<00:04:30.460> deep<00:04:30.700> I<00:04:30.820> hope<00:04:30.940> they

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:46.980 
looking to just take a little off make
them<00:05:45.729> generate<00:05:46.060> their<00:05:46.180> own<00:05:46.210> pace<00:05:46.510> maybe<00:05:46.750> they

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
them generate their own pace maybe they

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.420 
them generate their own pace maybe they
over<00:05:47.260> hit<00:05:47.410> because<00:05:47.680> of<00:05:47.770> the<00:05:47.830> warm<00:05:48.010> weather<00:05:48.160> and

backwards to absorb pace a little bit
and<00:06:14.860> the<00:06:15.430> third<00:06:15.610> item<00:06:15.760> is<00:06:16.169> the<00:06:17.169> behavior<00:06:17.560> of

because if it's over hit you're gonna

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:26.790 
because if it's over hit you're gonna
get<00:06:24.310> Drive<00:06:24.880> opportunities<00:06:25.599> from<00:06:26.349> for<00:06:26.710> your
