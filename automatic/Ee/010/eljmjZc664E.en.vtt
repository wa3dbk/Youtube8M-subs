the<00:02:41.920> 3-pack<00:02:42.550> I<00:02:42.910> think<00:02:43.870> it<00:02:43.989> was<00:02:44.080> nine<00:02:44.290> dollars

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800

another<00:03:09.210> plane<00:03:09.800> it<00:03:10.800> never<00:03:11.010> stops

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.580 

and<00:03:14.340> that's<00:03:14.550> it<00:03:14.900> okay<00:03:15.900> like<00:03:16.110> I<00:03:16.140> know<00:03:16.320> that

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
and that's it okay like I know that

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.320 
and that's it okay like I know that
looks<00:03:16.890> very<00:03:17.190> orange<00:03:17.730> at<00:03:18.270> the<00:03:18.390> moment<00:03:20.240> but<00:03:21.240> the

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
looks very orange at the moment but the

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.930 
looks very orange at the moment but the
next<00:03:21.570> phase<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:22.080> that<00:03:22.250> will<00:03:23.250> be<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.430> tone<00:03:23.730> that

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
next phase of that will be to tone that

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.229 
next phase of that will be to tone that
down<00:03:25.280> using<00:03:26.280> the

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.309 

local<00:03:29.989> rail<00:03:30.739> Brown<00:03:31.540> so<00:03:32.540> that's<00:03:32.720> that<00:03:32.870> bit<00:03:33.110> done

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
local rail Brown so that's that bit done

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.789 
local rail Brown so that's that bit done
and<00:03:33.950> then<00:03:34.610> all<00:03:35.299> night<00:03:35.480> it<00:03:35.599> next<00:03:36.019> is<00:03:36.200> find<00:03:36.500> the

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
and then all night it next is find the

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.270 
and then all night it next is find the
rail<00:03:37.310> tie<00:03:37.670> brown<00:03:38.860> where<00:03:39.860> is<00:03:39.980> it

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
rail tie brown where is it

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.729 
rail tie brown where is it
there<00:03:40.610> we<00:03:40.730> go<00:03:40.909> rail<00:03:41.269> tie<00:03:42.049> Brown<00:03:43.390> sleepers

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
there we go rail tie Brown sleepers

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:51.759 
there we go rail tie Brown sleepers
language<00:03:45.739> get<00:03:46.579> a<00:03:46.700> bit<00:03:46.849> of<00:03:46.909> a<00:03:46.970> shame<00:03:50.560> prime<00:03:51.560> it

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
language get a bit of a shame prime it

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.199 
language get a bit of a shame prime it
and<00:03:52.599> then<00:03:53.599> all<00:03:53.750> I<00:03:53.780> do<00:03:53.930> here<00:03:54.879> let's<00:03:55.879> just<00:03:55.970> go

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
and then all I do here let's just go

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:07.480 
and then all I do here let's just go
over<00:03:57.730> the<00:03:58.730> sleepers<00:03:59.209> like<00:04:00.489> this

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.300 

and<00:04:08.000> as<00:04:08.150> I<00:04:08.300> mentioned<00:04:08.780> in<00:04:09.020> the<00:04:09.160> one<00:04:10.160> of<00:04:10.250> my

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
and as I mentioned in the one of my

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.030 
and as I mentioned in the one of my
other<00:04:10.430> videos<00:04:10.550> I'm<00:04:10.970> not<00:04:11.000> too<00:04:11.300> worried<00:04:11.540> about

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
other videos I'm not too worried about

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.860 
other videos I'm not too worried about
the<00:04:13.040> ballasting<00:04:13.610> and<00:04:13.880> getting<00:04:14.540> it<00:04:14.630> on<00:04:14.690> the

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
the ballasting and getting it on the

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.740 
the ballasting and getting it on the
ballast<00:04:15.200> because<00:04:15.500> I'm<00:04:15.620> gonna<00:04:15.800> be<00:04:16.480> going<00:04:17.480> over

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
ballast because I'm gonna be going over

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.000 
ballast because I'm gonna be going over
that<00:04:17.780> with<00:04:18.050> it

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
that with it

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.610 
that with it
balanced<00:04:20.820> itself<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:22.080> finish<00:04:22.320> this<00:04:22.440> off

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
balanced itself to finish this off

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.050 
balanced itself to finish this off
anyway<00:04:23.010> so<00:04:23.070> I'm<00:04:23.820> not<00:04:23.970> worried<00:04:24.270> about<00:04:26.060> getting

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
anyway so I'm not worried about getting

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.750 
anyway so I'm not worried about getting
paint<00:04:27.330> on<00:04:27.540> the<00:04:27.720> gray<00:04:28.650> stuff<00:04:28.920> and<00:04:29.280> there's

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
paint on the gray stuff and there's

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:47.230 
paint on the gray stuff and there's
another<00:04:29.970> Cessna

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.180 

great<00:04:48.229> thing<00:04:48.380> about<00:04:48.470> I<00:04:48.590> find<00:04:48.889> about<00:04:49.070> these

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
great thing about I find about these

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.320 
great thing about I find about these
pens<00:04:49.400> is<00:04:49.610> actually<00:04:50.080> is<00:04:51.080> that<00:04:51.139> you<00:04:51.940> can<00:04:52.940> make<00:04:53.120> it

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
pens is actually is that you can make it

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.060 
pens is actually is that you can make it
just<00:04:53.960> just<00:04:54.289> doing<00:04:54.530> this<00:04:54.620> backwards<00:04:54.860> and

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
just just doing this backwards and

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.749 
just just doing this backwards and
forwards<00:04:55.520> like<00:04:55.669> this<00:04:57.340> it's<00:04:58.340> actually<00:04:58.639> not

00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:58.759 
forwards like this it's actually not

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:02.279 
forwards like this it's actually not
even<00:04:58.820> touching<00:04:59.360> the<00:04:59.449> chairs<00:04:59.750> so<00:05:00.440> the<00:05:00.530> chairs

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
even touching the chairs so the chairs

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.070 
even touching the chairs so the chairs
end<00:05:03.289> up<00:05:04.280> with<00:05:04.430> that<00:05:04.550> nice<00:05:04.759> sort<00:05:05.090> of<00:05:05.180> bit<00:05:05.990> of

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
end up with that nice sort of bit of

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:25.670 
end up with that nice sort of bit of
rust<00:05:06.320> looking<00:05:06.680> on<00:05:06.830> it

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:32.030 

and<00:05:26.840> those<00:05:27.840> ones<00:05:28.110> at<00:05:28.320> the<00:05:28.410> end<00:05:30.380> and<00:05:31.380> that's<00:05:31.830> the

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
and those ones at the end and that's the

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.060 
and those ones at the end and that's the
sleepers<00:05:32.940> painted<00:05:33.919> obviously<00:05:34.919> they're

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
sleepers painted obviously they're

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.140 
sleepers painted obviously they're
shining<00:05:35.310> at<00:05:35.490> a<00:05:35.550> moment<00:05:35.820> because<00:05:35.970> they're

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
shining at a moment because they're

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.580 
shining at a moment because they're
still<00:05:36.389> wet<00:05:36.690> and<00:05:37.380> then<00:05:38.280> the<00:05:38.430> last<00:05:38.580> thing<00:05:39.590> let's

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
still wet and then the last thing let's

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:49.429 
still wet and then the last thing let's
just<00:05:40.889> go<00:05:41.130> over<00:05:41.280> the<00:05:41.580> edges<00:05:42.000> of<00:05:42.770> the<00:05:43.770> sleepers

00:05:49.429 --> 00:05:49.439 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:51.290 

again<00:05:50.189> I'm<00:05:50.309> not<00:05:50.339> too<00:05:50.610> worried<00:05:50.849> about<00:05:51.089> getting

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
again I'm not too worried about getting

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.320 
again I'm not too worried about getting
the<00:05:51.479> paint<00:05:51.719> on<00:05:52.259> the<00:05:52.949> gray<00:05:53.159> plastic<00:05:53.699> ballast

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
the paint on the gray plastic ballast

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.929 
the paint on the gray plastic ballast
and<00:05:55.019> the<00:05:55.589> shoulder<00:05:56.039> because<00:05:56.429> I've<00:05:56.580> been<00:05:56.729> doing

00:05:56.929 --> 00:05:56.939 
and the shoulder because I've been doing

00:05:56.939 --> 00:06:04.339 
and the shoulder because I've been doing
that<00:05:58.099> with<00:05:59.099> loose<00:05:59.339> ballast<00:05:59.789> I<00:06:03.169> presume<00:06:04.169> if<00:06:04.259> you

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:04.349 
that with loose ballast I presume if you

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:05.929 
that with loose ballast I presume if you
wanted<00:06:04.679> if<00:06:04.919> you<00:06:04.949> weren't<00:06:05.279> gonna<00:06:05.399> do<00:06:05.580> that<00:06:05.610> and

00:06:05.929 --> 00:06:05.939 
wanted if you weren't gonna do that and

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:08.419 
wanted if you weren't gonna do that and
you<00:06:06.059> were<00:06:06.239> just<00:06:06.449> gonna<00:06:06.659> paint<00:06:06.929> it<00:06:07.139> and<00:06:07.439> not<00:06:07.979> do

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:08.429 
you were just gonna paint it and not do

00:06:08.429 --> 00:06:09.829 
you were just gonna paint it and not do
the<00:06:08.610> loose<00:06:08.729> ballasting<00:06:09.300> obviously<00:06:09.659> you'd

00:06:09.829 --> 00:06:09.839 
the loose ballasting obviously you'd

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:14.599 
the loose ballasting obviously you'd
take<00:06:10.679> a<00:06:10.709> bit<00:06:10.919> more<00:06:11.119> time<00:06:12.119> and<00:06:12.149> care
