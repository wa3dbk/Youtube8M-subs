00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
okay after that we go to the very simple

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.410 
okay after that we go to the very simple
chords<00:01:34.460> which<00:01:34.610> are<00:01:34.850> making<00:01:35.660> up<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:36.110> verse<00:01:36.860> and

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
chords which are making up the verse and

00:01:37.420 --> 00:02:06.830 
chords which are making up the verse and
you're<00:01:38.420> slate<00:01:38.659> in<00:01:38.810> between<00:01:39.170> an<00:01:39.440> ear

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.339 

after<00:02:07.840> that<00:02:07.990> kicks<00:02:08.289> in<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.679> chorus<00:02:09.009> riff<00:02:09.250> and

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
after that kicks in the chorus riff and

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.960 
after that kicks in the chorus riff and
again<00:02:11.349> you<00:02:11.739> keep<00:02:11.920> an<00:02:12.040> exactly<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.489> same<00:02:12.670> chord

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
again you keep an exactly the same chord

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.630 
again you keep an exactly the same chord
shape<00:02:13.269> and<00:02:13.870> you<00:02:14.050> just<00:02:14.230> slide<00:02:14.680> no<00:02:15.040> previous<00:02:15.489> to

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
shape and you just slide no previous to

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.440 
shape and you just slide no previous to
the<00:02:15.760> D<00:02:15.970> then<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.140> e<00:02:17.170> then<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:18.040> F<00:02:18.300> then<00:02:19.300> you

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
the D then to the e then the F then you

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.360 
the D then to the e then the F then you
have<00:02:19.540> sharp<00:02:19.810> then<00:02:20.560> you're<00:02:20.769> coming<00:02:20.920> back<00:02:21.129> down

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
have sharp then you're coming back down

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:51.940 
have sharp then you're coming back down
again<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:25.060> I'll<00:02:25.150> just<00:02:25.299> play<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:25.540> for<00:02:25.629> you

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.590 

after<00:02:52.950> you've<00:02:53.070> done<00:02:53.220> that<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.430> few<00:02:53.490> times<00:02:53.640> you

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
after you've done that a few times you

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.660 
after you've done that a few times you
go<00:02:54.720> back<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.170> intro<00:02:55.470> riff<00:02:55.710> and<00:02:56.040> then

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
go back to the intro riff and then

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.960 
go back to the intro riff and then
there's<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:57.000> slight<00:02:58.340> different<00:02:59.340> part<00:02:59.640> just

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
there's a slight different part just

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.110 
there's a slight different part just
before<00:03:00.270> the<00:03:00.330> guitar<00:03:00.660> solo<00:03:01.080> kicks<00:03:01.380> in<00:03:01.620> so<00:03:02.610> I'll

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
before the guitar solo kicks in so I'll

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.700 
before the guitar solo kicks in so I'll
play<00:03:03.330> it<00:03:03.360> for<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:03.630> really<00:03:03.960> all<00:03:04.110> it<00:03:04.230> is<00:03:04.350> is<00:03:04.530> that

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.000 

see<00:04:26.810> quite<00:04:26.990> similar<00:04:27.350> in<00:04:27.410> essence<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.980> the

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
see quite similar in essence to the

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:43.019 
see quite similar in essence to the
intro<00:04:28.430> riff

00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:43.029 

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:46.350 

after<00:04:43.959> that<00:04:44.169> chorus<00:04:45.099> kicks<00:04:45.309> in<00:04:45.519> again<00:04:45.639> and

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
after that chorus kicks in again and

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.089 
after that chorus kicks in again and
that's<00:04:46.989> pretty<00:04:47.319> much<00:04:47.469> the<00:04:47.679> song<00:04:47.889> in<00:04:48.039> a

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
that's pretty much the song in a

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:51.749 
that's pretty much the song in a
nutshell<00:04:48.309> and<00:04:49.299> I<00:04:50.049> hope<00:04:50.949> everything's<00:04:51.429> fairly

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 
nutshell and I hope everything's fairly

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.489 
nutshell and I hope everything's fairly
straightforward<00:04:52.629> I've<00:04:53.110> explained

00:04:53.489 --> 00:04:53.499 
straightforward I've explained

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:56.369 
straightforward I've explained
everything<00:04:53.679> particularly<00:04:54.279> well<00:04:55.259> let's<00:04:56.259> see

00:04:56.369 --> 00:04:56.379 
everything particularly well let's see

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.769 
everything particularly well let's see
it's<00:04:56.649> not<00:04:57.009> a<00:04:57.279> really<00:04:57.729> complicated<00:04:58.059> truck<00:04:58.599> to

00:04:58.769 --> 00:04:58.779 
it's not a really complicated truck to

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:01.619 
it's not a really complicated truck to
do<00:04:58.959> the<00:04:59.649> only<00:04:59.769> part<00:05:00.069> which<00:05:00.249> may<00:05:00.699> be<00:05:00.999> a<00:05:01.509> little

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:01.629 
do the only part which may be a little

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:04.379 
do the only part which may be a little
bit<00:05:02.079> complicated<00:05:02.409> is<00:05:03.009> the<00:05:03.309> guitar<00:05:03.639> solo<00:05:03.909> which

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
bit complicated is the guitar solo which

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.299 
bit complicated is the guitar solo which
as<00:05:04.689> I<00:05:05.049> see<00:05:05.229> it<00:05:05.349> I'm<00:05:05.499> not<00:05:05.619> even<00:05:05.709> gonna<00:05:05.919> do<00:05:06.129> it

00:05:06.299 --> 00:05:06.309 
as I see it I'm not even gonna do it

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:08.759 
as I see it I'm not even gonna do it
