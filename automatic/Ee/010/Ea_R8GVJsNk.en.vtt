ant-man crystal's next week or whenever

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.780 
ant-man crystal's next week or whenever
they<00:01:27.600> come<00:01:27.799> so<00:01:28.799> we're<00:01:29.070> gonna<00:01:29.159> spin<00:01:29.490> out<00:01:29.640> this

they come so we're gonna spin out this
singular<00:01:30.540> crystal<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.140> let's<00:01:31.950> just<00:01:32.100> check<00:01:32.310> it

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
singular crystal and let's just check it

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.069 
singular crystal and let's just check it
out<00:01:32.549> real<00:01:32.729> quick<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.630> it's<00:01:33.780> kind<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:33.990> like

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
out real quick so it's kind of like

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.140 
out real quick so it's kind of like
black<00:01:34.740> on<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.490> corners<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.090> edges

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
black on the the corners and the edges

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.899 
black on the the corners and the edges
and<00:01:36.960> blue<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.280> center<00:01:38.750> bright<00:01:39.750> blue

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
and blue in the center bright blue

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.460 
and blue in the center bright blue
obviously<00:01:41.909> does<00:01:42.030> look<00:01:42.150> like<00:01:42.270> cosmic<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.409> it

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
obviously does look like cosmic and it

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.530 
obviously does look like cosmic and it
does<00:01:43.560> look<00:01:43.680> like<00:01:43.799> any<00:01:44.040> humans<00:01:44.490> as<00:01:44.610> well<00:01:44.640> so

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
favorite crystal the defender crystal

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.190 
favorite crystal the defender crystal
was<00:02:28.790> my<00:02:29.790> least<00:02:30.000> favorite<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.600> now<00:02:30.630> this<00:02:31.020> one

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
was my least favorite and now this one

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.700 
was my least favorite and now this one
is<00:02:31.850> 150<00:02:32.850> units<00:02:33.060> for<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.690> Tuesday<00:02:34.140> champion<00:02:34.560> I

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
is 150 units for a Tuesday champion I

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.110 
is 150 units for a Tuesday champion I
wanted<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.460> I<00:02:35.640> would<00:02:35.940> spin<00:02:36.330> out<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:38.120> premium

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
wanted that I would spin out a premium

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.210 
wanted that I would spin out a premium
and<00:02:39.150> crystal<00:02:39.540> or<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:40.260> soccer<00:02:40.650> so<00:02:40.890> this<00:02:41.010> is<00:02:41.130> the

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
and crystal or to soccer so this is the

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.280 
and crystal or to soccer so this is the
equivalent<00:02:41.490> to<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.820> two<00:02:42.060> star<00:02:42.330> crystal<00:02:42.720> which

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
equivalent to a two star crystal which

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.420 
equivalent to a two star crystal which
you<00:02:43.440> can<00:02:43.590> get<00:02:43.740> for<00:02:43.920> free<00:02:44.240> so<00:02:45.240> uh<00:02:46.100> yeah<00:02:47.100> that's

you can get for free so uh yeah that's

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.130 
you can get for free so uh yeah that's
gonna<00:02:47.790> have<00:02:48.210> to<00:02:48.240> be<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.630> for<00:02:48.720> this<00:02:48.810> video<00:02:48.990> I'm

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
gonna have to be it for this video I'm

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.070 
gonna have to be it for this video I'm
just<00:02:49.260> gonna<00:02:49.350> claim<00:02:49.650> my<00:02:49.860> crystals<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.520> then<00:02:51.150> be

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
just gonna claim my crystals and then be

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.060 
just gonna claim my crystals and then be
on<00:02:52.110> my<00:02:52.260> way<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:53.100> someone<00:02:53.690> asked<00:02:54.690> how<00:02:54.990> I<00:02:55.070> store

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
on my way so someone asked how I store

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.480 
on my way so someone asked how I store
all<00:02:56.100> my<00:02:56.310> daily<00:02:57.000> crystals<00:02:57.480> I'll<00:02:58.100> do<00:02:59.100> an<00:02:59.220> example

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
all my daily crystals I'll do an example

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.120 
all my daily crystals I'll do an example
on<00:02:59.790> their<00:03:00.030> free<00:03:00.209> set<00:03:00.420> free<00:03:00.750> crystal<00:03:01.560> so<00:03:02.070> you

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
on their free set free crystal so you

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.730 
on their free set free crystal so you
press<00:03:02.340> claim<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:03.110> then<00:03:04.110> once<00:03:04.320> they've<00:03:04.560> all

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
press claim and then once they've all

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.760 
press claim and then once they've all
loaded<00:03:05.640> up<00:03:05.820> you<00:03:06.390> just<00:03:06.570> simply<00:03:07.230> go<00:03:07.440> back<00:03:07.620> into

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
loaded up you just simply go back into

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.520 
loaded up you just simply go back into
the<00:03:07.860> vault<00:03:08.070> up<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.400> top<00:03:08.640> left<00:03:09.180> arrow<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:10.080> boom

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
the vault up the top left arrow so boom

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.500 
the vault up the top left arrow so boom
strip<00:03:10.920> again<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.580> don't<00:03:11.670> lose<00:03:11.940> your<00:03:12.150> crystals

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
strip again you don't lose your crystals

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.460 
strip again you don't lose your crystals
or<00:03:12.600> anything<00:03:12.870> they<00:03:12.930> just<00:03:12.959> stay<00:03:13.230> there<00:03:13.380> and

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
or anything they just stay there and

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.979 
or anything they just stay there and
they're<00:03:13.650> just<00:03:13.770> stick<00:03:14.040> up<00:03:14.280> which<00:03:14.459> is<00:03:14.610> cool<00:03:14.989> I'm

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
they're just stick up which is cool I'm

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.620 
they're just stick up which is cool I'm
saving<00:03:16.560> these<00:03:16.709> for<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.340> crystal<00:03:18.180> opening<00:03:18.480> video

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
saving these for a crystal opening video

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.500 
saving these for a crystal opening video
I<00:03:19.370> think<00:03:20.370> I<00:03:20.400> can<00:03:20.550> get<00:03:20.640> one<00:03:20.670> of<00:03:20.790> these<00:03:20.910> perfectly

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
I think I can get one of these perfectly

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.490 
I think I can get one of these perfectly
now<00:03:21.780> right<00:03:22.440> now<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.709> I<00:03:22.769> have<00:03:22.980> zero<00:03:24.200> zero<00:03:25.200> Lions

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
now right now and I have zero zero Lions

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.750 
now right now and I have zero zero Lions
points<00:03:25.739> so<00:03:26.070> that's<00:03:26.220> going<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.400> have<00:03:26.550> to<00:03:26.580> be

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
points so that's going to have to be

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.630 
points so that's going to have to be
after<00:03:27.030> this<00:03:27.090> video<00:03:28.250> reason<00:03:29.250> why<00:03:29.370> I<00:03:29.400> only<00:03:29.519> did

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
after this video reason why I only did

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.180 
after this video reason why I only did
one<00:03:29.910> as<00:03:30.150> I<00:03:30.450> said<00:03:30.510> before<00:03:30.720> is<00:03:31.260> because<00:03:31.320> I'm

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
one as I said before is because I'm

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.580 
one as I said before is because I'm
opening<00:03:32.700> 10<00:03:33.000> of<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.360> ant-man<00:03:33.690> crystals<00:03:34.380> or

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
opening 10 of the ant-man crystals or

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.180 
opening 10 of the ant-man crystals or
yellow<00:03:35.310> Jack<00:03:35.519> crystals<00:03:36.320> depending<00:03:37.320> on<00:03:37.560> the

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
yellow Jack crystals depending on the

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.470 
yellow Jack crystals depending on the
odds<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.850> lake<00:03:40.430> like<00:03:41.430> I<00:03:41.459> watch<00:03:41.910> super<00:03:42.239> gaming

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
odds the lake like I watch super gaming

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.390 
odds the lake like I watch super gaming
families<00:03:42.840> videos<00:03:43.230> in<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.560> morning<00:03:43.890> when<00:03:44.340> I

wake up so I kind of tests me so I so I

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.050 
wake up so I kind of tests me so I so I
don't<00:03:49.890> buy<00:03:50.010> like<00:03:50.220> 10<00:03:50.489> of<00:03:50.550> these<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:50.970> then

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
don't buy like 10 of these and then

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.800 
don't buy like 10 of these and then
waste<00:03:51.269> my<00:03:51.420> money<00:03:51.860> um<00:03:52.940> if<00:03:53.940> he<00:03:54.120> was<00:03:54.330> 10<00:03:54.570> and<00:03:54.720> then
