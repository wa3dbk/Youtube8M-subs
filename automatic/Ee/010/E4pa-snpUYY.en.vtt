00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
was it felt like a miracle and certainly

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.160

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
but certainly an extremely tough

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.420 
but certainly an extremely tough

fizzy and have taken his job but it

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.450 
fizzy and have taken his job but it

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
would require to do a lot of diligence

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.770
