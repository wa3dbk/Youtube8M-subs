waiting for me and it's my lipo battery
I'm<00:00:11.429> gonna<00:00:11.670> try<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:11.969> replace<00:00:13.130> the<00:00:14.130> battery<00:00:14.549> in

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
I'm gonna try and replace the battery in

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.480 
I'm gonna try and replace the battery in
my<00:00:14.790> helicopter<00:00:15.059> with<00:00:17.480> so<00:00:19.039> I've<00:00:20.039> got<00:00:20.189> something

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
my helicopter with so I've got something

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.820 
my helicopter with so I've got something
else<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.820> do<00:00:20.939> first<00:00:22.220> later<00:00:23.220> on<00:00:23.460> tonight<00:00:24.830> we'll

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
else to do first later on tonight we'll

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.209 
else to do first later on tonight we'll
see<00:00:26.070> if<00:00:26.160> we<00:00:26.279> can<00:00:26.430> do<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.609> swap<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:31.219> actually

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
see if we can do a swap I actually

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.340 
see if we can do a swap I actually
ordered<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:32.880> purely<00:00:33.329> on<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.690> basis<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.170> its

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
ordered this purely on the basis of its

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.139 
ordered this purely on the basis of its
size<00:00:34.739> because<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.280> measured<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.730> one<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.059> was

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
size because I measured the one that was

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.260 
size because I measured the one that was
in<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.360> helicopter<00:00:36.510> already<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:39.090> was

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
in the helicopter already and this was

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.000 
in the helicopter already and this was
the<00:00:39.420> one<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.750> came<00:00:39.989> closest<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.829> right

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
the one that came closest to the right

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.569 
the one that came closest to the right
dimensions<00:00:42.170> so<00:00:43.170> we'll<00:00:43.379> find<00:00:43.649> out<00:00:43.829> if<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.340> fits

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
dimensions so we'll find out if it fits

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.950 
dimensions so we'll find out if it fits
in<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.879> same<00:00:45.469> container<00:00:47.750> Erika<00:00:48.750> it's<00:00:48.870> gonna

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
in the same container Erika it's gonna

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.740 
in the same container Erika it's gonna
rain<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.500> few<00:00:49.530> seconds<00:00:50.250> but<00:00:51.180> we<00:00:51.300> might<00:00:51.510> just

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
rain in a few seconds but we might just

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.010 
rain in a few seconds but we might just
have<00:00:51.870> enough<00:00:52.170> time<00:00:53.149> to<00:00:54.149> try<00:00:54.449> out<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.989> new

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
have enough time to try out the new

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.670 
have enough time to try out the new
battery

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.390 

we<00:01:03.160> won't<00:01:03.280> do<00:01:03.430> anything<00:01:03.640> clever<00:01:05.190> just<00:01:06.190> see<00:01:06.340> if

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
we won't do anything clever just see if

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:37.609 
we won't do anything clever just see if
we<00:01:06.460> can<00:01:06.549> go<00:01:06.729> up<00:01:06.760> and<00:01:07.030> down<00:01:07.210> a<00:01:07.240> bit

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:51.200 

gently<00:01:38.460> does<00:01:38.609> it<00:01:44.990> more<00:01:45.990> spinning<00:01:46.530> there

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.030 

which<00:01:51.900> ones<00:01:52.230> have<00:01:52.380> spinning<00:01:52.860> right<00:01:54.830> just<00:01:55.830> to

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
which ones have spinning right just to

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.220 
which ones have spinning right just to
the<00:01:56.160> left

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:24.760 

try<00:02:01.230> again

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.990 

that<00:02:25.770> looks<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.100> lot<00:02:26.250> happy<00:02:26.490> with<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.820> new

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
that looks a lot happy with a new

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:38.520 
that looks a lot happy with a new
battery

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:03:05.730 

it<00:02:39.490> was<00:02:39.610> actually<00:02:40.000> starting<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.420> rain

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:22.300 

it's<00:03:06.740> not<00:03:06.920> gentle<00:03:07.370> enough

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:33.230 

that's<00:03:23.209> ringing<00:03:23.510> into<00:03:23.810> hardline

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.480 

one<00:03:34.240> very<00:03:34.570> basic<00:03:34.780> thing<00:03:35.290> I<00:03:35.380> forgot<00:03:35.560> to<00:03:35.740> do<00:03:36.010> when

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
one very basic thing I forgot to do when

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.460 
one very basic thing I forgot to do when
I<00:03:36.520> put<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.850> new<00:03:37.000> battery<00:03:37.450> in<00:03:37.480> was<00:03:37.840> check<00:03:38.290> the

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
I put the new battery in was check the

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:47.180 
I put the new battery in was check the
weight<00:03:39.240> this<00:03:40.240> is<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.510> old<00:03:40.630> battery<00:03:43.290> 62<00:03:44.290> grams

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.260 

this<00:03:48.190> is<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.490> new<00:03:48.670> battery<00:03:49.470> 56<00:03:50.470> grams<00:03:51.180> so<00:03:52.180> it's

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
this is the new battery 56 grams so it's

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.530 
this is the new battery 56 grams so it's
actually<00:03:52.420> 6<00:03:52.810> grams<00:03:53.140> lighter<00:03:54.120> so<00:03:55.120> that's<00:03:55.360> no

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
actually 6 grams lighter so that's no

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.560 
actually 6 grams lighter so that's no
effect<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:55.960> trim<00:03:56.700> and<00:03:57.700> I<00:03:57.820> didn't<00:03:58.090> notice<00:03:58.210> when

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
effect the trim and I didn't notice when

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.260 
effect the trim and I didn't notice when
I<00:03:58.630> was<00:03:58.750> trying<00:03:59.170> it<00:03:59.350> just<00:03:59.620> now<00:03:59.850> that<00:04:00.850> with<00:04:01.120> the

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
I was trying it just now that with the

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.460 
I was trying it just now that with the
new<00:04:01.420> battery<00:04:01.900> in<00:04:01.930> there

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
new battery in there

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.650 
new battery in there
it<00:04:02.620> was<00:04:02.770> drifting<00:04:03.280> forwards<00:04:03.850> even<00:04:04.450> when<00:04:04.570> I

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
it was drifting forwards even when I

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.650 
it was drifting forwards even when I
backed<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.470> trim<00:04:05.740> as<00:04:06.580> far<00:04:06.880> as<00:04:07.060> I<00:04:07.180> could

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
backed the trim as far as I could

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.740 
backed the trim as far as I could
backwards<00:04:08.490> so<00:04:09.490> I<00:04:09.910> don't<00:04:10.210> have<00:04:10.270> to<00:04:10.420> put<00:04:10.570> a<00:04:10.600> bit

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
backwards so I don't have to put a bit

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.010 
backwards so I don't have to put a bit
of<00:04:10.780> weight<00:04:10.990> on<00:04:11.230> this<00:04:11.410> to<00:04:12.480> get<00:04:13.480> the<00:04:13.570> trim<00:04:13.810> back

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
of weight on this to get the trim back

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:21.900 
of weight on this to get the trim back
in<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.290> right<00:04:14.440> place<00:04:20.250> no<00:04:21.250> doubt<00:04:21.459> I<00:04:21.609> could<00:04:21.670> use

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
in the right place no doubt I could use

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.050 
in the right place no doubt I could use
a<00:04:21.940> bit<00:04:22.150> of<00:04:23.130> blue<00:04:24.130> tack<00:04:24.430> or<00:04:24.670> something<00:04:24.970> like

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
a bit of blue tack or something like

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.800 
a bit of blue tack or something like
that<00:04:25.120> to<00:04:25.600> get<00:04:26.260> the<00:04:26.410> weight<00:04:26.560> right
