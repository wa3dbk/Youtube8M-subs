00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 the people of youtube I'm here with another 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.020
 video this video is about comments 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.300
 to your android version at 44.4 kitkat 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.480
 for your acatl one touch 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.460
 they are 140 15 to I am aware that also 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.699
 there is a new update that would be 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.619
 5.0 clear lollipop this I have not seen in 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.980
 no video on YouTube that is for 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.680
 This type of phone but I do not know you 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.800
 you get discouraged I found a rom the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.929
 5.0 to the step team alcatel has 140 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.710
 maybe I will try to suttles now the 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.270
 last version 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.800
 I recommend you see my life where 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.800
 explains how to land local now with 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.469
 a rom but it's worth it 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.270
 but before this is a rom 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.829
 aesthetically his memory settled in 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.750
 Roma and once is already installed 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.300
 rom dress so I suggest you 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.739
 explode that increased your ram memory for 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.079
 that you feel more fluid and do not 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.489
 no but out there so of all 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.309
 modes below video needed a link 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.680
 how your ram memory increases for you 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.490
 any device with android and 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.640
 now you carry the same to the one of honda 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:08.040
 It is that good at all there are rice 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.710
 there some flaws and of course it is logical 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.050
 no and good in this video still 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.540
 shown are an effect and the rest will be 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.650
 as healthy Kika-style staff 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.980
 to your liking and your way in my case I 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.780
 I'm going to twist it to the sweet and serious ethical 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.610
 well let's go into our settings 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.530
 of the phone once it has 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.460
 installed this rom we have in the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.619
 settings 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.690
 in the adjustments we're going to have in the 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.930
 words in English everything in English we go 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.850
 to have in setting all everything in English 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.350
 although we put it in Spanish you 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.320
 they vote in English is a small defect 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.299
 but this I know is outside the problem 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.840
 because it's transparent is when I had 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.130
 a little message like these 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.420
 because you are going to put everything in the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.549
 transparent screen so good 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.240
 you are warned 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.359
 another thing is that good would be just that 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.619
 here we have the phone information 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:03.479
 here they see that I have mold a number of 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.140
 model that will be one touch 40 15 to the 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.700
 Android version 4 points 4.4 more 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.629
 has pressed because they see that if it's the 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:16.569
 version and I have the android review with 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:19.689
 the 4.4 point 4 we keep pressed 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:24.810
 and we have the father if the wolf the 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:24.810
 little game that acts to me for me 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.010
 configure and go I said in my video 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.200
 previous this I like 5 not a 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.930
 little bit smaller so it was good 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.900
 more for the simile all the pickup and good 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.880
 this guy is very father saw everything 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.590
 included and I do not need to increase the 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.320
 RAM memory of only pessoa and more 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.620
 fluid not here nothing in multitasking 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.470
 then we see this clear a point of 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.900
 please and let's focus the 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.730
 configurations of the uier here asks us 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.830
 that we return in the 8 that we have 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.170
 us by default 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.290
 and eliminated and well once this is done 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.959
 we can configure to our liking 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.000
 you configure it in your own way something 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.590
 that as you want me 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.359
 configure the style that can be used here 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.090
 confirm the style and the ibi can 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:22.690
 set up hip hop style so 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.340
 well this is to your clear decision and other 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.050
 little thing more is that if you want to have 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.639
 virtual stubs to bacardÃ­ video takes 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.100
 describe a link to how to have the 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.350
 virtual buttons so he scans the 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.630
 three link of a videos of how you have to 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.630
 your version of android 5.0 lollipop for 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.940
 alcatel one touch foxe1 40 15 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.979
 and how does your ram memory increase for 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.530
 any device that has android 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.479
 it's like having the virtual buttons to 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.020
 any device that has android 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.669
 4.0 top so well this would be 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.440
 All of my part I hope that you have 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.960
 liked and a little message for my 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.910
 subscribers and for those who follow me not 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.770
 we were hack videos of plants 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.410
 against zombies 2 since that's what 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.349
 I tried my channel stop games and the 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.449
 way I wanted to change videos is 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:10.509
 because on youtube there are also hackers 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:12.039
 that make this game so I do not 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.840
 like to have a because a small 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:16.930
 problem out there 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.460
 good a problem that I made saying 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.830
 that I steal the Oscar that I copy 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.630
 this and good and none of that and I do not want 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.940
 that blocks me on my channel or I 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.550
 want to denounce so I've decided 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.979
 this does not do more than these games but 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.780
 if you want to have a call from other videos 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.639
 of other games sorry 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.430
 in the comments you can comment 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.139
 they can comment that they want a 40 4 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.330
 zombies want some specific believe 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:43.180
 have something different from this game or 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.900
 well anyway I'm going to upload more than 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:49.540
 modern combat games erich go out soda 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:52.950
 and other games and ap pro game houses 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.970
 powers games and well I wish that I 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.310
 I wish you liked it, you know 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.590
 subscribe a I like it's a lot to ask and 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:02.020
 Well let's talk like that but I dislike 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.180
 It's a lot with a like and a 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.070
 subscribe to my channel since having more 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.410
 variety is but it is not going to be treated 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.870
 of the entire hack but also something of 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.850
 your device for example of wifi in 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.970
 problems like it was a problem of 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:18.490
 phone and those things or roms that for me 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:22.050
 It seems they are highly recommended so 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:26.110
 out of all this 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:29.290
 the bottom of the links and larroque 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.970
 what would be the launcher pro so 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:33.670
 this would be all on behalf of the one that 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.950
 have liked and well this would be all of 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:38.650
 my clear part if you want to have the 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.900
 blur that we have here that would be 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.400
 also multitasking also down / 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.890
 the histrion link and how to have this 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.020
 little blur that creates us in the 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.090
 notification bar and in the 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.950
 multitasking so there's more to say 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:55.560
 I wish you liked the video 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:55.560
 subscribe and I like the video bye bye
