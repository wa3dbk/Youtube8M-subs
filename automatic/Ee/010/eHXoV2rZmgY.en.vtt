installing<00:01:55.710> flash<00:01:56.010> me<00:01:56.250> well<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.850> personally

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
installing flash me well I personally

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.160 
installing flash me well I personally
used<00:01:57.450> small<00:01:57.810> nail<00:01:58.170> head

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
used small nail head

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
and that was wrapped in scotch tape

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.560 
and that was wrapped in scotch tape
except<00:02:02.170> at<00:02:02.259> the<00:02:02.350> very<00:02:02.380> very<00:02:02.740> end<00:02:03.189> and<00:02:04.180> say<00:02:04.360> that

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
except at the very very end and say that

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.719 
except at the very very end and say that
that's<00:02:05.290> the<00:02:05.439> bit<00:02:05.590> that<00:02:05.619> I<00:02:05.799> used<00:02:05.979> to<00:02:06.100> bridge<00:02:06.549> the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
that's the bit that I used to bridge the

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.529 
that's the bit that I used to bridge the
connection<00:02:08.610> now<00:02:09.610> I've<00:02:09.789> also<00:02:09.940> heard<00:02:10.179> reports

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539

the toothpick wrapped in foil and then

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.910 
the toothpick wrapped in foil and then
insulated<00:02:13.390> with<00:02:13.510> tape<00:02:13.810> works<00:02:14.230> equally<00:02:14.830> well

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
insulated with tape works equally well

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.670 
insulated with tape works equally well
so<00:02:15.489> you<00:02:15.550> may<00:02:15.970> want<00:02:16.209> to<00:02:16.270> try<00:02:16.390> that<00:02:16.690> when

out<00:02:23.790> unless<00:02:24.790> you're<00:02:25.000> holding<00:02:25.300> on<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.540> it<00:02:25.660> so

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
out unless you're holding on to it so

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.680 
out unless you're holding on to it so
keep<00:02:26.650> that<00:02:26.680> in<00:02:26.830> mind<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:28.269> flashing<00:02:28.660> process

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
keep that in mind the flashing process

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.530

takes<00:02:29.290> only<00:02:29.500> about<00:02:29.590> 20<00:02:30.220> seconds<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:31.269> if<00:02:31.420> you

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
takes only about 20 seconds so if you

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.940 
takes only about 20 seconds so if you

lose connection with the sl1 and the
percentage<00:02:33.250> stops<00:02:33.810> don't<00:02:34.810> worry<00:02:35.019> just<00:02:35.680> wiggle

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
percentage stops don't worry just wiggle

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.949 
percentage stops don't worry just wiggle
