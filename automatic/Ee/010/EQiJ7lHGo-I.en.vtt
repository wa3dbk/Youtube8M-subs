howdy y'all today we're going to see if
the<00:00:04.470> retina<00:00:04.859> MacBook<00:00:05.250> Pro<00:00:05.490> with<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.759> iris

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
the retina MacBook Pro with the iris

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.650 
the retina MacBook Pro with the iris
graphics<00:00:07.189> can<00:00:08.189> handle<00:00:08.660> dying<00:00:09.660> light<00:00:10.190> okay<00:00:11.660> so

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
graphics can handle dying light okay so

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.499 
graphics can handle dying light okay so
the<00:00:12.870> graphics<00:00:13.259> settings<00:00:13.650> are<00:00:14.519> very<00:00:14.580> low<00:00:15.059> all

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
the graphics settings are very low all

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:24.310 
the graphics settings are very low all
of<00:00:15.750> them<00:00:21.920> because<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.070> came<00:00:23.340> with<00:00:23.369> this<00:00:23.820> a

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
of them because this came with this a

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.250 
of them because this came with this a
graphics<00:00:25.320> are<00:00:26.330> right<00:00:27.330> now<00:00:27.480> I'm<00:00:27.689> getting<00:00:28.109> a

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
graphics are right now I'm getting a

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.700 
graphics are right now I'm getting a
little<00:00:28.740> bit<00:00:28.890> over<00:00:29.310> 30<00:00:29.760> frames<00:00:30.150> per<00:00:30.269> second<00:00:33.710> and

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
little bit over 30 frames per second and

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.630 
little bit over 30 frames per second and
we<00:00:35.340> have<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> zombie<00:00:36.030> right<00:00:36.210> here<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.719> now<00:00:36.989> I'm

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
we have a zombie right here and now I'm

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.220 
we have a zombie right here and now I'm
25<00:00:38.640> frames<00:00:39.000> per<00:00:39.239> second<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:39.750> it's<00:00:39.780> definitely

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
25 frames per second so it's definitely

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:52.460 
25 frames per second so it's definitely
not<00:00:40.399> optimal

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.330 

though<00:00:52.980> even<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.460> graphics<00:00:54.090> are<00:00:54.300> very<00:00:54.960> low

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
though even the graphics are very low

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.360 
though even the graphics are very low
but<00:00:56.340> actually<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.820> looks<00:00:57.090> easy<00:00:58.100> under<00:00:59.100> retina

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
but actually it looks easy under retina

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:07.250 
but actually it looks easy under retina
MacBook<00:00:59.700> Pro<00:01:05.390> kind<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.479> surprised<00:01:06.840> but<00:01:07.110> it

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
MacBook Pro kind of surprised but it

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:23.030 
MacBook Pro kind of surprised but it
doesn't<00:01:07.890> look<00:01:08.840> totally<00:01:09.840> sucky

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.920 

and<00:01:24.040> I<00:01:24.220> ruined<00:01:24.580> my<00:01:24.640> weapon<00:01:27.480> that's<00:01:28.480> okay<00:01:28.780> we

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:58.060 
and I ruined my weapon that's okay we
can<00:01:29.050> repair<00:01:29.380> it

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.850 

and<00:01:58.700> we<00:01:58.820> have<00:01:58.940> a<00:01:58.970> fire<00:01:59.330> going<00:01:59.360> on<00:02:00.050> in<00:02:00.440> this<00:02:00.620> car

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
and we have a fire going on in this car

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.540 
and we have a fire going on in this car
over<00:02:01.100> here

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
over here

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.870 
over here
and<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.780> frame<00:02:03.110> rate<00:02:03.140> is<00:02:03.650> about<00:02:05.350> 28<00:02:06.700> right<00:02:07.700> now

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
and the frame rate is about 28 right now

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:20.830 
and the frame rate is about 28 right now
so<00:02:08.679> it's<00:02:09.679> actually<00:02:10.160> quite<00:02:10.369> decent<00:02:13.870> it

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.780

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
but it was very difficult to to play

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.320 
but it was very difficult to to play
