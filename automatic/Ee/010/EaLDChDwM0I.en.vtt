00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.720 
know about it but i still think it's
pretty<00:02:31.400> cool<00:02:31.610> ok<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:33.260> you<00:02:33.920> get<00:02:34.130> one<00:02:34.340> person<00:02:34.520> to

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
pretty cool ok so you get one person to

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.979 
pretty cool ok so you get one person to
get<00:02:34.940> a<00:02:35.000> job<00:02:35.209> field<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:37.120> then<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.390> get<00:02:38.600> the

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
get a job field and then you get the

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.010 
get a job field and then you get the
other<00:02:39.140> person<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:39.620> get<00:02:39.709> a<00:02:39.770> falcon<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:41.540> hop

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
other person to get a falcon and to hop

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.050 
other person to get a falcon and to hop
in<00:02:43.390> then<00:02:44.390> you<00:02:44.510> get<00:02:44.690> on<00:02:44.870> top<00:02:45.140> of<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.590> Falcon

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
in then you get on top of the Falcon

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.960 
in then you get on top of the Falcon
person<00:02:47.060> with<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.239> drop<00:02:47.420> field<00:02:47.660> does<00:02:47.890> and<00:02:48.970> you

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
person with the drop field does and you

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.260 
person with the drop field does and you
start<00:02:50.239> to<00:02:50.270> fly<00:02:53.050> then

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
start to fly then

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.700 
start to fly then
the<00:02:55.720> person<00:02:56.230> uses<00:02:56.890> their<00:02:57.040> drop<00:02:57.280> shields

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.470 

and<00:03:00.830> it<00:03:01.790> simply<00:03:02.360> floats<00:03:03.850> not<00:03:04.850> much<00:03:05.180> to<00:03:05.450> it

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
and it simply floats not much to it

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.330 
and it simply floats not much to it
pretty<00:03:05.750> simple<00:03:05.990> but<00:03:06.350> I<00:03:06.710> just<00:03:07.070> think<00:03:07.250> it's

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
pretty simple but I just think it's

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.880 
pretty simple but I just think it's
pretty<00:03:07.460> cool<00:03:08.380> okay<00:03:09.380> and<00:03:09.560> to<00:03:09.710> make<00:03:09.860> a

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
pretty cool okay and to make a

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.330 
pretty cool okay and to make a
flamethrower<00:03:11.350> which<00:03:12.350> i<00:03:12.740> think<00:03:12.890> is<00:03:13.130> pretty

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
flamethrower which i think is pretty

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.450 
flamethrower which i think is pretty
cool<00:03:14.230> it's<00:03:15.230> not<00:03:15.500> really<00:03:15.740> one<00:03:16.010> that<00:03:16.160> you<00:03:16.310> can

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
cool it's not really one that you can

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.730 
cool it's not really one that you can
use<00:03:16.760> as<00:03:17.360> a<00:03:17.630> person<00:03:18.380> but<00:03:18.590> you<00:03:18.890> can<00:03:19.100> pretty<00:03:19.310> much

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
use as a person but you can pretty much

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.710 
use as a person but you can pretty much
do<00:03:21.740> it<00:03:23.350> well<00:03:24.350> yeah<00:03:24.590> you<00:03:24.650> can<00:03:25.010> do<00:03:25.130> it<00:03:25.220> as<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.370> robot

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
do it well yeah you can do it as a robot

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.320 
do it well yeah you can do it as a robot
three<00:03:26.720> mo<00:03:26.870> Chou<00:03:27.050> goes<00:03:27.260> okay<00:03:27.950> so<00:03:28.010> you<00:03:28.670> go<00:03:28.940> to

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
three mo Chou goes okay so you go to

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.370 
three mo Chou goes okay so you go to
gadgets<00:03:29.900> then<00:03:30.860> you<00:03:31.010> go<00:03:31.160> to<00:03:31.220> explosives<00:03:32.150> and<00:03:32.510> to

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
gadgets then you go to explosives and to

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.860 
gadgets then you go to explosives and to
propane<00:03:33.830> tank<00:03:35.170> you<00:03:36.170> set<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:36.650> physics<00:03:37.240> to<00:03:38.240> fix

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
propane tank you set the physics to fix

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.240 
propane tank you set the physics to fix
then<00:03:39.680> you<00:03:39.890> let<00:03:40.100> it<00:03:40.130> go<00:03:40.220> and<00:03:40.580> you<00:03:40.910> come<00:03:41.120> down<00:03:41.360> and

spray fire you immediately turn into a

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:58.480 
spray fire you immediately turn into a
robot<00:03:52.700> and<00:03:53.000> grab<00:03:53.210> it<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:55.040> then<00:03:57.130> now<00:03:58.130> that<00:03:58.160> we
