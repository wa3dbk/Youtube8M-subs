actually they're super soft and this is

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.890 
actually they're super soft and this is
like<00:03:18.989> a<00:03:19.140> purpley<00:03:19.650> grayish<00:03:20.340> color<00:03:20.610> and<00:03:21.090> then<00:03:21.630> I

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
like a purpley grayish color and then I

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.449 
like a purpley grayish color and then I
knew<00:03:22.110> I<00:03:22.140> wanted<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.650> get<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.920> black<00:03:23.160> as<00:03:23.400> well

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
knew I wanted to get the black as well

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.040 
knew I wanted to get the black as well
because<00:03:23.970> in<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.120> ball<00:03:24.269> time<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:24.600> really<00:03:24.870> like

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
because in the ball time I really like

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.750 
because in the ball time I really like
to<00:03:25.200> wear<00:03:25.350> more<00:03:25.530> smokey<00:03:25.980> eyes<00:03:26.100> and<00:03:26.489> I<00:03:26.580> thought

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
to wear more smokey eyes and I thought

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.580 
to wear more smokey eyes and I thought
that<00:03:26.940> having<00:03:27.180> a<00:03:27.390> black<00:03:27.600> color<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:28.080> smudge<00:03:28.350> in

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
that having a black color to smudge in

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.500 
that having a black color to smudge in
sort<00:03:28.980> of<00:03:29.070> at<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.220> lash<00:03:29.459> line<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:29.940> also<00:03:30.239> smudge

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
sort of at the lash line and also smudge

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.330 
sort of at the lash line and also smudge
around<00:03:30.750> for<00:03:30.959> a<00:03:30.989> smokey<00:03:31.380> eye<00:03:31.410> I<00:03:31.739> thought<00:03:32.160> that

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
around for a smokey eye I thought that

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.699 
around for a smokey eye I thought that
would<00:03:32.459> be<00:03:32.610> really<00:03:32.760> nice<00:03:33.000> so<00:03:33.720> oh<00:03:34.140> yeah<00:03:34.440> that's

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709

would be really nice so oh yeah that's
super<00:03:34.890> nice<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.489> they're<00:03:36.269> super<00:03:36.720> soft<00:03:37.050> and

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
super nice and they're super soft and
