it<00:04:43.890> I<00:04:44.070> don't<00:04:44.310> know<00:04:44.490> so<00:04:45.000> this<00:04:45.600> is<00:04:45.810> pretty<00:04:46.020> much

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
it I don't know so this is pretty much

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.440 
it I don't know so this is pretty much
what<00:04:46.380> I<00:04:46.410> can<00:04:46.650> go<00:04:46.800> on<00:04:47.010> and<00:04:47.220> I've<00:04:47.880> kind<00:04:48.210> of<00:04:48.270> done

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
what I can go on and I've kind of done

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.000 
what I can go on and I've kind of done
the<00:04:48.510> math<00:04:48.780> as<00:04:49.020> I've<00:04:49.170> been<00:04:49.320> playing<00:04:49.530> online<00:04:49.800> I

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
the math as I've been playing online I

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.530 
the math as I've been playing online I
mean<00:04:50.310> I<00:04:50.370> don't<00:04:50.550> know<00:04:50.640> if<00:04:50.670> other<00:04:50.880> clan<00:04:51.210> members

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
it seems like it's kind of because you

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.080 
it seems like it's kind of because you
can<00:04:55.590> see<00:04:55.770> from<00:04:55.980> the<00:04:56.160> ecology<00:04:56.490> gap<00:04:56.670> it'll<00:04:56.940> tell
