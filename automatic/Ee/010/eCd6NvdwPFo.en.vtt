00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
don't use them simply because that can

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.830 
don't use them simply because that can

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
still down as a piston so I'd replace

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
happened but it was a failed lift up so

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
that point pulled it down the lifter

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.789 
that point pulled it down the lifter
head<00:02:52.310> caused<00:02:52.489> some<00:02:52.730> damage<00:02:52.849> to<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.269> bore<00:02:53.799> the

and<00:03:12.760> upgrading<00:03:13.270> the<00:03:13.300> camshaft<00:03:13.870> fuel<00:03:14.410> time<00:03:14.650> you

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
and upgrading the camshaft fuel time you

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.860 
and upgrading the camshaft fuel time you
change<00:03:15.040> your<00:03:15.340> Bell<00:03:15.550> Springs<00:03:15.940> will<00:03:16.480> actually

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
change your Bell Springs will actually

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.270 
change your Bell Springs will actually
already<00:03:17.080> on<00:03:17.200> there<00:03:17.380> from<00:03:17.590> on<00:03:17.890> a<00:03:17.950> break<00:03:18.160> the

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
already on there from on a break the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.710 
already on there from on a break the
valve<00:03:18.460> spring<00:03:18.670> before<00:03:18.790> we<00:03:19.060> change<00:03:19.330> to<00:03:19.510> jewel

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
valve spring before we change to jewel

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.440 
valve spring before we change to jewel
then<00:03:20.130> but<00:03:21.130> then<00:03:21.310> a<00:03:21.400> basicnet<00:03:21.880> entirely<00:03:22.210> built

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
then but then a basicnet entirely built

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.900 
then but then a basicnet entirely built
it's<00:03:23.080> not<00:03:23.320> studs<00:03:23.620> it<00:03:23.860> hasn't<00:03:24.130> done<00:03:24.190> girdles<00:03:24.670> it

tunnels<00:03:27.490> and<00:03:27.610> things<00:03:27.850> it<00:03:28.210> has<00:03:28.690> done<00:03:29.050> full<00:03:29.290> talk

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
tunnels and things it has done full talk

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.100 
tunnels and things it has done full talk
like<00:03:29.770> home<00:03:30.040> face<00:03:30.460> the<00:03:30.640> block<00:03:30.850> and<00:03:31.390> then<00:03:31.720> put<00:03:32.080> a

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
like home face the block and then put a

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.470 
like home face the block and then put a
roll<00:03:32.320> back<00:03:32.500> together<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:33.820> this<00:03:33.970> is<00:03:34.030> basically

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
roll back together and this is basically

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.610 
roll back together and this is basically
this<00:03:34.600> to<00:03:34.750> run<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.200> what<00:03:35.350> we're<00:03:35.470> really

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
this to run and what we're really

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.920 
this to run and what we're really
showing<00:03:35.950> is<00:03:36.370> with<00:03:36.820> a<00:03:36.850> retune<00:03:37.300> what<00:03:37.630> this<00:03:37.780> is

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
showing is with a retune what this is

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.660 
showing is with a retune what this is
sent<00:03:38.140> into<00:03:38.320> it's<00:03:39.040> going<00:03:39.190> to<00:03:39.250> be<00:03:39.310> really<00:03:39.430> nice

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
sent into it's going to be really nice

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.370 
sent into it's going to be really nice
talk<00:03:40.000> it's<00:03:40.270> been<00:03:40.390> a<00:03:40.420> great<00:03:40.630> engine<00:03:41.050> and<00:03:41.230> are

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
talk it's been a great engine and are

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.200 
talk it's been a great engine and are
pretty<00:03:41.560> sort<00:03:41.800> of<00:03:41.860> a<00:03:41.920> budget<00:03:42.250> way<00:03:42.580> to<00:03:42.640> get<00:03:43.030> a

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
pretty sort of a budget way to get a

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.160 
pretty sort of a budget way to get a
good<00:03:43.990> strong<00:03:44.230> engine<00:03:44.620> over<00:03:45.250> here<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.490> graph

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
good strong engine over here the graph

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.740 
good strong engine over here the graph
that's<00:03:47.170> the<00:03:47.950> two<00:03:48.100> runs<00:03:48.340> we<00:03:48.490> just<00:03:48.700> did<00:03:48.850> and

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
that's the two runs we just did and

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.920 
that's the two runs we just did and
we're<00:03:49.960> going<00:03:50.200> out<00:03:50.430> 6,800<00:03:51.430> ribs<00:03:51.610> so<00:03:52.120> it's<00:03:52.540> it's

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
we're going out 6,800 ribs so it's it's

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.840 
we're going out 6,800 ribs so it's it's
up<00:03:53.080> there<00:03:53.260> but<00:03:53.470> it's<00:03:53.560> not<00:03:53.710> too<00:03:53.860> far<00:03:53.890> and<00:03:54.730> we'll

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
up there but it's not too far and we'll

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.540 
up there but it's not too far and we'll
just<00:03:55.000> set<00:03:55.180> up<00:03:55.300> in<00:03:55.450> here<00:03:57.030> goes<00:03:58.030> up<00:03:58.240> there<00:03:59.550> what

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
just set up in here goes up there what

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.810 
just set up in here goes up there what
we've<00:04:00.670> actually<00:04:00.790> got<00:04:01.120> there<00:04:01.810> is<00:04:02.140> the<00:04:02.820> first

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
we've actually got there is the first

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.430 
we've actually got there is the first
run<00:04:04.000> which<00:04:04.420> is<00:04:04.570> essentially<00:04:04.960> when<00:04:05.230> it<00:04:05.320> was

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
run which is essentially when it was

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
can see the strophe that we've just done

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.170 
can see the strophe that we've just done
quite<00:04:44.500> a<00:04:44.530> bit<00:04:44.710> different<00:04:45.190> than<00:04:45.220> that<00:04:45.340> here<00:04:46.090> we

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
quite a bit different than that here we

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.900 
quite a bit different than that here we
go<00:04:46.330> up<00:04:46.390> to<00:04:46.540> 3,000<00:04:47.080> revs<00:04:47.290> we've<00:04:47.980> got<00:04:48.220> a<00:04:48.430> 50

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
go up to 3,000 revs we've got a 50

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:49.740 
go up to 3,000 revs we've got a 50
horsepower<00:04:49.180> increase

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
horsepower increase

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.260 
horsepower increase
even<00:04:50.170> at<00:04:50.230> 3,000<00:04:50.770> revs<00:04:50.950> it<00:04:51.760> holds<00:04:52.150> that

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
even at 3,000 revs it holds that

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.700 
even at 3,000 revs it holds that
increase<00:04:52.570> and<00:04:52.810> even<00:04:53.020> gains<00:04:53.230> a<00:04:53.380> little<00:04:53.470> bit

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
increase and even gains a little bit

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.620
