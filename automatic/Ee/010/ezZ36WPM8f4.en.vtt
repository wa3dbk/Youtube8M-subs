00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.520
 Being in a field for over 300 years 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.490
 made of paper 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.540
 it falls offers great 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:35.600
 training opportunities some of them 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:38.120
 constantly now before we ask jana la 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.500
 toya if you had any idea what was going on 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.649
 everything behind the professional image of 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.450
 paper technology hides absolutely 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.340
 not really honest 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.760
 thought that behind a paper 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.670
 Do so much development and work 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.320
 stick 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:58.130
 what are your usual tasks? 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.200
 in education everyday that different ever 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.100
 after where i divided into which 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:07.210
 Department on a machine or bor 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.750
 depending on the laboratory, it is for example the paper 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.490
 Examination of the finished papers and 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.479
 a machine that is that at all 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.189
 make 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.720
 the monitoring of machines 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:21.060
 how are the perspectives the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.530
 Man or woman has paper technologists 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.280
 are widely visited one can 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.110
 suppliers work as 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.789
 technological adviser or one can in the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.259
 Customers operated in printing shops or 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:37.049
 Goods receipt at quality control 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.270
 But first and foremost, you want to work 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.090
 of course helping out employees here 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.360
 then really good staff here too 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.360
 on site 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.760
 my name is off but she has to me 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:00.610
 I 'm doing now as in the first 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:02.020
 Year as an industrial mechanic and what 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.550
 one does among other things as 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.630
 industrial mechanic with specialization 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.820
 maintenance 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.369
 my job is now servicing 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.410
 of points then times if there is one 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.270
 pulp pump or a centrifugal pump 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.459
 broken is that you change it off 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:21.790
 or when it's time to stop 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:28.660
 that sounds like that right 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:31.840
 varied is not monotonous then 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:36.610
 Much today this morning what 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:41.950
 another let's say at the milled so 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.930
 it is a lot of variety that is 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.220
 is a scribe he is the scribe 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.440
 trainers of abt frame 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.940
 he knows what matters because he has 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.280
 even learned in this company 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:57.090
 and yes, the desire on the big machines 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.000
 to work so a certain positive 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.819
 basic setting 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.269
 these are the factors 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.489
 as a role play and also from 3 man 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.999
 is certainly a profession with a future too 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.670
 learn 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:13.639
 actually, this village has itself 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.319
 future free there you can actually do it 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.749
 must be synonymous if there are many machines 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:23.209
 there must still be someone who 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:25.819
 the machine repaired let's say that 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.629
 big after the papers belongs since 2008 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.629
 for stability 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:36.800
 I have the power of poland 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:39.470
 at that time dual study wanted 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.480
 thus on the subject of paper technology 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.540
 bremer became aware because of the 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.160
 company sappi has offered such a thing 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.030
 dual study what is that one 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.750
 dual studies are similar to one 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.970
 regular study at a university 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.970
 or something more compact 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.830
 the practice is oriented to study 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.480
 divides into two subareas too 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.980
 because once the theoretical part 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.380
 that's at the dual college in 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.000
 parks pure and the practical part on 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.940
 then always through one over one 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.230
 Training company in my case was that 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.200
 get it and what does a paper do? 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.610
 engineer so the facts has yes 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.540
 tips about 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.010
 I would say a third machine 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.959
 a third computer and a giant 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.570
 still for meetings of course 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.510
 with other departments across the board 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.850
 Technique with quality control with 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.040
 the production planning 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.040
 what then restrict such a title 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.210
 saab employs paper engineers and 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.520
 otherwise we are the prospects 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.260
 So in the reason are me as paper 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.060
 engineer all doors open 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.110
 then you will become an electronic engineer for 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.110
 operating technology off 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.750
 which tasks do you have in there? 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:00.200
 the tasks are manifold 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.410
 broken performance here 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.410
 gate 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.470
 peter measuring and control technology 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:12.330
 active drive technology 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:14.010
 and who all vocabulary our task 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.570
 sap but there are a lot of cables 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.300
 That's when you get around the company 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.920
 or which limits year of operation though 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.380
 different in operation 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.950
 department works every department 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.950
 know 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.199
 Everything sounds like you 're at sappi 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.199
 work quite well it can not now
