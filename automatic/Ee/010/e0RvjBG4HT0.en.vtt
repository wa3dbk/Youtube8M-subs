Hayes<00:00:02.220> I<00:00:02.600> didn't<00:00:03.600> really<00:00:03.870> like<00:00:04.130> that<00:00:05.130> was<00:00:05.609> felt

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
Hayes I didn't really like that was felt

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.480 
Hayes I didn't really like that was felt
our<00:00:06.089> engine<00:00:06.660> was<00:00:06.810> an<00:00:06.930> old<00:00:07.080> master<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:07.799> turbos

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
our engine was an old master and turbos

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.020 
our engine was an old master and turbos
were<00:00:08.730> modern<00:00:09.150> art<00:00:09.330> you<00:00:09.690> know<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.639> don't

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
were modern art you know and I I don't

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.640 
were modern art you know and I I don't
want<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.389> sound<00:00:12.540> like<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.809> fuddy-duddy<00:00:13.230> but<00:00:13.620> I

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
want to sound like a fuddy-duddy but I

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.129 
want to sound like a fuddy-duddy but I
think<00:00:13.860> it's<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.130> very<00:00:14.250> fair<00:00:14.880> description<00:00:15.780> of

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
where I fell the difference was the

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.580 
where I fell the difference was the

of the car that we had with a ground
effect<00:01:22.500> cars<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:22.950> it's<00:01:23.070> much<00:01:23.280> more<00:01:23.520> draggy

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
effect cars but it's much more draggy

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.760 
effect cars but it's much more draggy
it's<00:01:24.360> much<00:01:24.540> less<00:01:24.720> efficient<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.470> we've<00:01:25.619> lost

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
it's much less efficient so we've lost

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.859 
it's much less efficient so we've lost
efficiency<00:01:26.400> which<00:01:27.090> has<00:01:27.240> been<00:01:27.390> conversating

efficiency which has been conversating
for<00:01:28.140> with<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.380> performance<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.070> engines

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
for with the performance of the engines

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.510

the<00:01:47.790> rear<00:01:48.030> wing<00:01:48.210> we<00:01:48.659> can<00:01:48.810> get<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.350> more

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530
