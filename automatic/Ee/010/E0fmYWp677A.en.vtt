00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.630
 good morning what we are presenting 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.310
 one of the three new accessories 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.780
 trees that we have presented during 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.190
 this wench of world congress is the 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.110
 evolution of our bracelet that 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.600
 we presented last year in Barcelona 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.180
 Mobile World Congress 2014 such 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.549
 band b1 in this case we show the table 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.670
 bird 2 where we want to keep the essence 

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:49.400
 from his predecessor b1 the two 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.799
 fundamental characteristics one of 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.269
 it is the power to use it as hands 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:55.129
 free bluetoothÂ® where the only thing 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.140
 we need is to unfold the pinganillo 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.119
 hands-free and simply start 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.100
 use it with the identifier of 

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:03.199
 calls does not mean the call we take 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.670
 we take the hands free we do not put it in 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.440
 the earphone in the ear and we can 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.570
 start talking in this case we have 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.479
 added the functionality of a microphone 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.340
 double to be able to use the cancellation 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.320
 of noise and being able to get a better 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.460
 efficiency in both the audio and the 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.369
 voice 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.659
 and if we continue with the functionality 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.850
 what could we give the part of 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.560
 talk to the phone part other than 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.300
 what we find is power 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.310
 use the bracelet to find our 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.810
 phone in case of many losses 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.940
 Sometimes we find situations where 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.380
 we do not know where the equipment is inside 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.450
 of our house within our 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.590
 office or even in our vehicle and 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.720
 all we have to do is 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.090
 activate the functionality so that the 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.950
 smartphone starts to sound even before 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.869
 that the silent mode on the smartphone 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.610
 activated if we go to the other 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.630
 basic functionality that has the one 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:53.090
 has the bracelet is the rhythm control 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.039
 and of daily exercise in this case what 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.509
 that we find is a screen 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.060
 touch to access the 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.520
 information where thanks to the six 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.880
 sensors that has controls us the 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.860
 calories that we consume the steps on 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.030
 state of the dream and especially the quality 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.550
 the same 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.970
 physical activities as it could be 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.970
 run run like riding a bike 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.100
 ride in the mountains 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.010
 and we would go back to the notifications 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.080
 standard we find the product in 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.220
 three different versions one of them 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.840
 the one we are showing that is the 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.840

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.090
