hi I'm Karen for expert village we're
going<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:04.580> flip<00:00:05.580> under<00:00:07.670> about<00:00:09.769> three-eighths

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
going to flip under about three-eighths

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.600 
going to flip under about three-eighths
of<00:00:11.280> an<00:00:11.880> inch<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.450> fabric<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:13.230> press<00:00:13.950> that<00:00:14.280> so

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
of an inch of fabric and press that so

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.630 
of an inch of fabric and press that so
it's<00:00:15.139> it's<00:00:16.139> like<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.859> finishes<00:00:17.460> the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
it's it's like that that finishes the

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.810 
it's it's like that that finishes the
edge<00:00:17.850> so<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.750> won't<00:00:18.900> fray<00:00:19.520> so<00:00:20.520> if<00:00:20.640> you

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
edge so that it won't fray so if you

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.779

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
me show you that flip it under and put a

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.729 
me show you that flip it under and put a
pin<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:38.989> move<00:00:39.989> around<00:00:41.300> and<00:00:42.530> flip<00:00:43.530> that

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
pin in and move around and flip that

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.940 
pin in and move around and flip that
under<00:00:44.510> somewhere<00:00:45.510> between<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.930> quarter<00:00:46.530> inch

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
under somewhere between a quarter inch

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.819 
under somewhere between a quarter inch
to<00:00:47.370> three<00:00:48.120> eighths<00:00:48.360> inch<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.379> want<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.680> flip

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
to three eighths inch you want to flip

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.860 
to three eighths inch you want to flip
under<00:00:51.800> if<00:00:52.910> you<00:00:53.910> have<00:00:54.180> an<00:00:54.329> overlock<00:00:54.840> machine

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
under if you have an overlock machine

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.700 
under if you have an overlock machine
you<00:00:55.440> could<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:55.770> over<00:00:56.280> lock<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.760> edge<00:00:57.000> and

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
you could just over lock the edge and

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.049 
you could just over lock the edge and
that<00:00:58.710> will<00:00:58.890> finish<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.430> edge<00:00:59.550> so<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.879> won't

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
that will finish the edge so it won't

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.160 
that will finish the edge so it won't
fray<00:01:01.760> but<00:01:02.760> if<00:01:03.120> you're<00:01:03.449> using<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.870> straight

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
fray but if you're using a straight

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.550 
fray but if you're using a straight
stitch<00:01:04.199> machine<00:01:05.510> this<00:01:06.510> works<00:01:06.869> fine<00:01:07.170> just

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
stitch machine this works fine just

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.609 
stitch machine this works fine just
flipping<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.340> under<00:01:09.830> and<00:01:12.170> you<00:01:13.170> can<00:01:13.380> pin<00:01:13.590> it

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
flipping that under and you can pin it

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.840 
flipping that under and you can pin it
in<00:01:13.830> place<00:01:14.479> or<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.630> could<00:01:15.810> just<00:01:15.840> press<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:17.330> okay

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
in place or you could just press it okay

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.499 
in place or you could just press it okay
now<00:01:20.850> we're<00:01:21.600> going<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.869> press<00:01:23.119> that<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.330> makes

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
now we're going to press that it makes

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.149 
now we're going to press that it makes
it<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.720> lot<00:01:24.900> easier<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.650> do<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.490> sewing<00:01:27.119> if<00:01:28.159> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
it a lot easier to do the sewing if the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.120 
it a lot easier to do the sewing if the
fabric<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.729> all<00:01:29.820> pressed<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.720> place<00:01:32.090> and

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
fabric is all pressed and in place and

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.569 
fabric is all pressed and in place and
then<00:01:35.130> flip<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.610> over<00:01:35.930> out<00:01:38.150> if<00:01:39.150> ping<00:01:39.570> got<00:01:39.840> me

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
then flip it over out if ping got me

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.120 
then flip it over out if ping got me
take<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.759> one<00:01:41.909> out

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
take that one out

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.050 
take that one out
and<00:01:43.820> and<00:01:44.810> as<00:01:45.799> soon<00:01:46.009> as<00:01:46.159> it's<00:01:46.340> pressed<00:01:46.640> you<00:01:46.850> can

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
and and as soon as it's pressed you can

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.880 
and and as soon as it's pressed you can
remove<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.630> pins<00:01:47.869> be<00:01:48.170> careful<00:01:48.500> they<00:01:48.560> might<00:01:48.590> be

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
remove the pins be careful they might be

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.889 
remove the pins be careful they might be
hot<00:01:49.719> after<00:01:50.719> pressing<00:01:52.000> move<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:53.210> pins<00:01:53.450> and<00:01:53.750> now

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
hot after pressing move the pins and now

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.779 
hot after pressing move the pins and now
that<00:01:54.229> is<00:01:54.590> ready<00:01:54.979> to<00:01:55.789> be<00:01:55.970> either<00:01:56.299> hand<00:01:57.110> hemmed
