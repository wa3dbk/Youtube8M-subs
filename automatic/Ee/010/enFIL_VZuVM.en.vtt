00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.810
 our earth 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.590
 currently seven billion people live 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.900
 on 30 percent of the surface and all 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.550
 are dependent on the remaining 70 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.880
 percent the sea the sea is the largest 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.340
 food source of the world for 1 2 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.189
 billion people is fish of the 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.779
 main component of the vicinity 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:31.769
 but more and more fish are returning 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.649
 home with empty patron we turn the 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.780
 time back the stocks of the big ones 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.379
 fish species are in the last 60 years 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.489
 dropped by 90 percent 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.399
 Scientists warn of collapse 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.649
 a protected species in less than 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.280
 50 years 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:51.719
 the reason 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.719
 the overfishing of the seas 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:00.469
 the longline fishery is annual 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:03.469
 14 billion hackenheim 1.4 billion 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:07.729
 hooks on each of which still one piece 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:10.729
 fish as bait hangs at the far 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:14.659
 widespread trawling 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.490
 nets with a diameter of 23,000 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.080
 square meters used 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.100
 That's the area of ​​four 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:26.030
 football fields 13 jumbo jets will be in 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:29.720
 this network will fit or indeed 500 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.360
 tons of fishing company 500 tons 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.170
 fish is much applause 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.020
 The word by accident caught up with me 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.840
 caught sea animals like to buy 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.830
 to be taken for high catch quantities 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.380
 enable 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.920
 An average shrimp cutter 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:52.370
 Throws 80 to 90 percent of prisoners 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:56.310
 marine animals have been transferred again 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:59.520
 for a kilo shrimp so be up to 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.119
 enters nine kilos of other marine animals 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.600
 and thrown us back more freely 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:10.229
 to relieve living fish 47 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.039
 percent of our needs in aquaculture 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.130
 cultured 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.630
 but aquaculture is more gargling 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.470
 as a lifebelt 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.300
 Many of these farmed fish are predatory fish 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.860
 on your menu 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:28.830
 fish for a kilo of farmed salmon 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.090
 five kilos of wild caught fish know 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.269
 be fed 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.600
 So one transforms into aquaculture 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:41.280
 kind of fish into another but created 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.290
 By no means the majority of fish 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.220
 European fish stocks are 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.200
 overfished 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.920
 to have in the past 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.780
 eu fisheries ministers are catching up 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.360
 any scientific recommendation 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.860
 decided 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.510
 2008 were closed to the blues 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.040
 tuna defined in Europe catch quotas 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.650
 Scientists recommend a catch quantity 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.570
 of 10,000 tons for the exhausted 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.380
 rebuild population 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.850
 the eu and other fishing nations 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:16.380
 However, just decided volume of 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:18.780
 29 1500 tonnes once more than demanded 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.350
 despite these provisions for the 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.870
 bluefin industry 61,000 tons 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.680
 that's six times what 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.900
 would be reasonable 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.540
 billion in subsidies 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.520
 finance this overfishing 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:39.080
 if this continues, it will be soon 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:42.420
 no fish anymore 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.570
 how can we stop overfishing? 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.780
 our politicians have the responsibility 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:51.720
 in brussels to make decisions like 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.760
 we end the overfishing as 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.270
 Population have the obligation 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.800
 to encourage our politicians and them 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.630
 to support it 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.630
 to make that decision
