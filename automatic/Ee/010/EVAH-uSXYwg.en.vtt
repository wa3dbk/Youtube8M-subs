00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
wait for the past four days so I think

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.040 
wait for the past four days so I think
it<00:00:56.550> did<00:00:56.699> affect<00:00:57.090> me<00:00:57.180> at<00:00:57.360> least<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.629> didn't<00:00:57.870> gain

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.880 
three pounds at least that's what they
show<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:05.270> so<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.299> was<00:02:06.719> cool<00:02:06.990> and

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
I think our team is still ahead of the
