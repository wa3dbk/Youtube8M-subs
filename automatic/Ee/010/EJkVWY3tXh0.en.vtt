now starting from the ground the main
thing<00:00:56.080> for<00:00:56.260> me<00:00:56.500> was<00:00:56.710> to<00:00:56.979> get<00:00:57.189> amplifiers<00:00:57.970> that

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:58.299 
thing for me was to get amplifiers that

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:01.020 
thing for me was to get amplifiers that
were<00:00:58.420> equally<00:00:59.339> comfortable<00:01:00.339> to<00:01:00.670> use<00:01:00.820> in<00:01:00.939> the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
were equally comfortable to use in the

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.969 
were equally comfortable to use in the
studio<00:01:01.330> and<00:01:01.420> live<00:01:01.809> I've<00:01:02.199> had<00:01:02.409> the<00:01:02.530> experience

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:02.979 
studio and live I've had the experience

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:04.560 
studio and live I've had the experience
in<00:01:03.070> the<00:01:03.159> past<00:01:03.339> of<00:01:03.670> getting<00:01:03.970> great<00:01:04.210> vintage

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
in the past of getting great vintage

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.660 
in the past of getting great vintage
amplifiers<00:01:05.110> that<00:01:05.379> when<00:01:05.500> you<00:01:05.619> stand<00:01:05.890> three<00:01:06.580> or

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
amplifiers that when you stand three or

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.070 
amplifiers that when you stand three or
four<00:01:06.820> feet<00:01:06.939> away<00:01:07.090> from<00:01:07.450> them<00:01:07.570> or<00:01:07.689> five<00:01:07.900> feet

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
four feet away from them or five feet

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.480 
four feet away from them or five feet
away<00:01:08.170> from<00:01:08.259> that<00:01:08.500> they<00:01:08.590> sound<00:01:08.799> like<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.310> voice

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
away from that they sound like the voice

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.670 
away from that they sound like the voice
of<00:01:09.700> God<00:01:09.909> you<00:01:10.570> get<00:01:10.720> them<00:01:10.840> in<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:11.020> studio<00:01:11.320> and

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
of God you get them in the studio and

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.800 
of God you get them in the studio and
you<00:01:11.799> spend<00:01:12.100> an<00:01:12.340> hour<00:01:12.640> and<00:01:12.909> a<00:01:12.939> half<00:01:13.119> moving<00:01:13.780> the

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
you spend an hour and a half moving the

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.499 
you spend an hour and a half moving the
mic<00:01:14.049> to<00:01:14.080> try<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:14.560> get<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:15.340> weird<00:01:15.610> frequency

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
mic to try to get the weird frequency

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.100 
mic to try to get the weird frequency
out<00:01:16.689> or<00:01:17.049> whatever<00:01:17.500> so<00:01:17.830> I<00:01:18.820> think<00:01:19.420> that<00:01:19.810> when<00:01:20.020> you

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
out or whatever so I think that when you

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.450 
out or whatever so I think that when you
spend<00:01:20.320> this<00:01:20.439> kind<00:01:20.590> of<00:01:20.680> money<00:01:20.740> on<00:01:20.979> an<00:01:21.100> amp<00:01:21.280> you

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
spend this kind of money on an amp you

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.580 
spend this kind of money on an amp you
ought<00:01:21.579> to<00:01:21.700> be<00:01:21.759> able<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:22.140> throw<00:01:23.140> it<00:01:23.289> up<00:01:23.409> in<00:01:23.499> the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
ought to be able to throw it up in the

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.230 
ought to be able to throw it up in the
studio<00:01:23.740> but<00:01:24.189> a<00:01:24.219> 57<00:01:24.759> in<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:24.939> middle<00:01:25.119> of<00:01:25.149> the

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
studio but a 57 in the middle of the

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.080 
studio but a 57 in the middle of the
speaker<00:01:25.539> and<00:01:25.659> boom<00:01:25.960> you're<00:01:26.140> ready<00:01:26.350> to<00:01:26.469> go<00:01:26.619> but

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
speaker and boom you're ready to go but

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.340 
speaker and boom you're ready to go but
you<00:01:28.090> know<00:01:28.179> it's<00:01:28.390> just<00:01:28.479> may<00:01:28.780> we<00:01:28.929> worked<00:01:29.109> really

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
you know it's just may we worked really

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.169 
you know it's just may we worked really
really<00:01:29.829> hard<00:01:30.100> on<00:01:30.399> these<00:01:30.520> things<00:01:30.789> and<00:01:30.999> they

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
really hard on these things and they

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:32.849 
really hard on these things and they
were<00:01:31.240> there<00:01:31.630> you<00:01:31.869> know<00:01:31.899> road<00:01:32.229> and<00:01:32.530> studio

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:32.859 
were there you know road and studio

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:35.580 
were there you know road and studio
tested<00:01:33.310> so<00:01:33.520> I<00:01:34.420> can't<00:01:35.200> tell<00:01:35.350> you<00:01:35.439> how<00:01:35.530> many

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
tested so I can't tell you how many

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.950 
tested so I can't tell you how many
times<00:01:35.740> I've<00:01:36.249> got<00:01:36.759> an<00:01:36.939> amplifier<00:01:37.450> in<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.749> past

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
times I've got an amplifier in the past

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.709 
times I've got an amplifier in the past
that<00:01:38.469> seemed<00:01:39.249> like<00:01:39.399> it<00:01:39.640> was<00:01:39.759> incredible<00:01:40.600> in

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 
that seemed like it was incredible in

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.809 
that seemed like it was incredible in
the<00:01:40.810> studio<00:01:41.109> I<00:01:41.469> get<00:01:41.890> it<00:01:42.009> out<00:01:42.130> on<00:01:42.249> stage<00:01:42.460> way<00:01:42.759> too

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:42.819 
the studio I get it out on stage way too

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:53.200 
the studio I get it out on stage way too
much

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.770 

so<00:01:54.210> we're<00:01:54.480> gonna<00:01:54.660> try<00:01:54.900> to<00:01:55.020> make<00:01:55.800> it

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.840 

touch<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.740> tears

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.390 

to<00:02:05.689> set<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:05.960> amp<00:02:06.290> up<00:02:06.470> to<00:02:06.650> where<00:02:06.770> not<00:02:06.890> play<00:02:07.070> hard

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
to set the amp up to where not play hard

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.790 
to set the amp up to where not play hard
I'll<00:02:08.060> get<00:02:08.240> a<00:02:08.300> nice<00:02:08.509> really<00:02:09.200> good<00:02:09.410> crunch

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
I'll get a nice really good crunch

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.490 
I'll get a nice really good crunch
rhythm<00:02:10.729> if<00:02:11.030> I<00:02:11.180> lighten<00:02:11.540> my<00:02:11.660> touch<00:02:11.870> up<00:02:12.140> it'll

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
rhythm if I lighten my touch up it'll

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.220 
rhythm if I lighten my touch up it'll
clean<00:02:12.800> up<00:02:12.950> nicely
