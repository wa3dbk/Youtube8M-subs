00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.530 
I have learned to take advantage of this
fact<00:02:01.690> our<00:02:02.410> method<00:02:02.650> is<00:02:02.920> this<00:02:03.160> first<00:02:03.940> as<00:02:04.240> you<00:02:04.450> can

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
fact our method is this first as you can

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.810 
fact our method is this first as you can
see<00:02:04.780> here<00:02:05.050> this<00:02:05.590> is<00:02:05.650> done<00:02:06.010> after<00:02:06.280> purple<00:02:06.730> loop

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
see here this is done after purple loop

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.970 
see here this is done after purple loop
goes<00:02:07.000> back<00:02:07.060> this<00:02:07.990> is<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.200> couple<00:02:08.530> of<00:02:08.619> benefits

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:08.980 
goes back this is a couple of benefits

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.280 
goes back this is a couple of benefits
first<00:02:09.460> the<00:02:10.060> enemy<00:02:10.390> doesn't<00:02:10.750> know<00:02:11.020> where<00:02:11.170> he<00:02:11.260> is

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
first the enemy doesn't know where he is

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.040 
first the enemy doesn't know where he is
all<00:02:12.100> they<00:02:12.430> know<00:02:12.580> is<00:02:12.610> that<00:02:12.820> he<00:02:12.910> left<00:02:13.120> second

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
all they know is that he left second

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.420 
all they know is that he left second
they<00:02:14.320> don't<00:02:14.530> know<00:02:14.650> about<00:02:14.860> his<00:02:14.950> current<00:02:15.160> power

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
they don't know about his current power

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.090 
they don't know about his current power
the<00:02:16.240> last<00:02:16.450> they<00:02:16.660> sought<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:16.960> which<00:02:17.260> he<00:02:17.980> has

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
the last they sought to which he has

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.740 
the last they sought to which he has
fewer<00:02:18.400> items<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:18.940> therefore<00:02:19.240> less<00:02:19.390> damage

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
fewer items and therefore less damage
