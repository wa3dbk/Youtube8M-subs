as to maintain a high temperature this

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.900 
as to maintain a high temperature this
is<00:01:14.600> what<00:01:14.840> mr.<00:01:15.230> Evans<00:01:15.470> calls<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:15.860> J<00:01:16.130> tube<00:01:16.430> the

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
is what mr. Evans calls the J tube the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.480 
is what mr. Evans calls the J tube the
reason<00:01:17.270> there's<00:01:17.570> a<00:01:17.630> sharp<00:01:17.930> corner<00:01:18.290> here<00:01:18.830> is<00:01:18.980> so

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
reason there's a sharp corner here is so

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.430 
reason there's a sharp corner here is so
that<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:20.210> exhaust<00:01:20.570> gases<00:01:20.870> which<00:01:21.230> will<00:01:21.350> be

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
that the exhaust gases which will be

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.350 
that the exhaust gases which will be
streaming<00:01:21.800> off<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:22.250> logs<00:01:22.490> that<00:01:22.820> you've<00:01:23.030> stuck

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
streaming off the logs that you've stuck

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.600

into<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:23.720> feed<00:01:23.960> tube<00:01:24.230> will<00:01:24.920> suddenly<00:01:25.250> be

tumbled together then this insulated
heat<00:01:28.610> riser<00:01:28.910> and<00:01:29.300> that's<00:01:30.110> what<00:01:30.200> we<00:01:30.320> use<00:01:30.470> the

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
heat riser and that's what we use the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.350 
heat riser and that's what we use the
vermiculite<00:01:30.950> for<00:01:31.430> and<00:01:31.670> that's<00:01:31.910> why<00:01:32.060> we<00:01:32.210> use

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
vermiculite for and that's why we use

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.950 
vermiculite for and that's why we use

turbulence in that temperature at a high
level<00:01:38.660> you<00:01:39.440> have<00:01:39.620> a<00:01:39.730> fire<00:01:40.730> here<00:01:41.330> but<00:01:42.260> in<00:01:42.440> fact

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
level you have a fire here but in fact

level you have a fire here but in fact
the<00:01:43.220> gases<00:01:43.700> continue<00:01:44.210> burning<00:01:44.420> throughout

the gases continue burning throughout

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.910 
the gases continue burning throughout
the<00:01:45.770> system<00:01:45.980> until<00:01:46.750> you<00:01:47.750> hit<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.470> underside

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
the system until you hit the underside

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.100 
the system until you hit the underside
of<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.130> barrel<00:01:49.490> which<00:01:49.700> caps<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.450> rocket

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
of the barrel which caps the rocket

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.950 
of the barrel which caps the rocket
stove<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:51.650> at<00:01:52.310> this<00:01:52.550> point<00:01:52.850> you've<00:01:53.690> got<00:01:53.720> a

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
stove and at this point you've got a

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.470 
stove and at this point you've got a
pretty<00:01:54.530> major<00:01:54.770> heat<00:01:55.130> release<00:01:55.430> this<00:01:56.150> is<00:01:56.330> sort

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 
pretty major heat release this is sort

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.150 
pretty major heat release this is sort
of<00:01:56.510> like<00:01:56.600> a<00:01:56.660> blowtorch<00:01:57.170> on<00:01:57.410> the<00:01:57.530> inside<00:01:57.950> of<00:01:57.980> the

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
of like a blowtorch on the inside of the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.370 
of like a blowtorch on the inside of the
barrel<00:01:58.370> when<00:01:58.580> this<00:01:58.670> is<00:01:58.820> operating<00:01:59.420> and<00:01:59.540> so

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
barrel when this is operating and so

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.410 
barrel when this is operating and so
then<00:02:00.560> you<00:02:00.680> get<00:02:00.860> rapid<00:02:01.310> cooling<00:02:01.640> of<00:02:01.940> the<00:02:02.000> gases

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
then you get rapid cooling of the gases

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.460 
then you get rapid cooling of the gases
and<00:02:02.920> they<00:02:03.920> spill<00:02:04.310> over<00:02:04.640> like<00:02:05.450> a<00:02:05.480> waterfall<00:02:05.930> and

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
and they spill over like a waterfall and

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.130 
and they spill over like a waterfall and
so<00:02:07.010> you<00:02:07.100> get<00:02:07.340> a<00:02:07.580> lot<00:02:08.090> of<00:02:08.119> radiation<00:02:08.720> out<00:02:08.929> of<00:02:09.050> the

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
so you get a lot of radiation out of the

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.230 
so you get a lot of radiation out of the
sides<00:02:09.379> of<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.619> barrel<00:02:09.979> to<00:02:10.160> fully<00:02:10.700> use<00:02:11.000> your

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
sides of the barrel to fully use your

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.230 
sides of the barrel to fully use your
your<00:02:11.930> fuel<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.770> get<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.160> most<00:02:13.370> heat<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:13.970> the

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
your fuel to get the most heat and the

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.490 
your fuel to get the most heat and the
most<00:02:14.390> utility<00:02:14.960> out<00:02:15.110> of<00:02:15.260> the

most utility out of the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.740 
most utility out of the
that<00:02:15.740> you<00:02:15.830> put<00:02:16.010> into<00:02:16.160> your<00:02:16.280> rocket<00:02:16.670> stove<00:02:16.880> link

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
that you put into your rocket stove link

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.830 
that you put into your rocket stove link
the<00:02:17.840> combustion<00:02:18.320> unit<00:02:18.860> with<00:02:19.340> a<00:02:19.550> mass<00:02:20.090> which

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
the combustion unit with a mass which

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.230 
the combustion unit with a mass which
will<00:02:21.020> then<00:02:21.140> absorb<00:02:21.770> that<00:02:22.220> high<00:02:22.550> temperature

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
will then absorb that high temperature

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.390 
will then absorb that high temperature
heat<00:02:23.480> and<00:02:23.720> release<00:02:24.290> it<00:02:24.500> over<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:24.950> longer<00:02:25.250> period
