00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.600 
militants inside northern Pakistan 11
the<00:03:03.459> water<00:03:04.560> so<00:03:05.560> they<00:03:05.739> could<00:03:05.980> direct<00:03:06.310> drone

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
the water so they could direct drone

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.820 
the water so they could direct drone
attacks<00:03:07.060> against<00:03:07.480> them<00:03:07.720> they<00:03:08.260> were<00:03:08.319> up<00:03:08.590> there

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
attacks against them they were up there

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.810 

so<00:03:17.630> I<00:03:17.660> think<00:03:18.110> it's<00:03:18.320> a<00:03:18.530> particular<00:03:19.010> criticism

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
so I think it's a particular criticism

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.190 
so I think it's a particular criticism
on<00:03:20.540> his<00:03:21.190> supporters<00:03:22.190> military<00:03:22.960> operation<00:03:23.960> and

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
on his supporters military operation and

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.570 
on his supporters military operation and
not<00:03:24.740> on<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:24.980> primary<00:03:25.580> reason<00:03:25.940> that<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.990> CIA

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
not on the primary reason that the CIA

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.160 
not on the primary reason that the CIA
is<00:03:28.580> they're<00:03:29.950> concentrating<00:03:30.950> on<00:03:31.370> al-qaeda<00:03:32.170> how

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
is they're concentrating on al-qaeda how

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.340 
is they're concentrating on al-qaeda how
difficult<00:03:33.830> is<00:03:34.190> it<00:03:34.250> to<00:03:34.790> work<00:03:35.330> informants<00:03:36.200> and

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
difficult is it to work informants and

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.880 
difficult is it to work informants and
to<00:03:36.650> get<00:03:36.830> informants<00:03:37.580> in<00:03:37.840> that<00:03:38.840> region<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:39.710> in

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
to get informants in that region and in

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.820 
to get informants in that region and in
balcony<00:03:40.340> well<00:03:41.330> it's<00:03:41.450> very<00:03:41.660> difficult<00:03:41.900> to<00:03:42.260> in

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
balcony well it's very difficult to in

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.110 
balcony well it's very difficult to in
any<00:03:43.280> way<00:03:43.370> of<00:03:43.610> getting<00:03:44.530> access<00:03:45.530> agent<00:03:45.850> into<00:03:46.850> al

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.740 
any way of getting access agent into al
Qaeda<00:03:47.590> probably<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:49.130> most<00:03:49.340> difficult

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
Qaeda probably the most difficult

countering<00:03:53.810> terrorism<00:03:54.580> operation<00:03:55.580> I<00:03:56.209> think

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
countering terrorism operation I think

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.150 
countering terrorism operation I think
it<00:03:57.650> was<00:03:57.890> case<00:03:58.280> we<00:03:58.940> saw<00:03:59.150> an<00:03:59.209> example<00:03:59.390> of<00:03:59.930> of<00:04:00.830> CIA

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
it was case we saw an example of of CIA
