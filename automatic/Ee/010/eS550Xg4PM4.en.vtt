00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.039 

this<00:00:00.750> is<00:00:00.960> problem<00:00:01.410> number<00:00:01.439> 4<00:00:01.820> and<00:00:02.820> it<00:00:03.389> asks<00:00:03.899> us

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
this is problem number 4 and it asks us

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:11.150 
this is problem number 4 and it asks us
to<00:00:04.110> find<00:00:05.600> f<00:00:06.600> prime<00:00:06.660> of<00:00:07.620> 1<00:00:08.280> 4th<00:00:09.590> and<00:00:10.590> we're<00:00:10.800> given

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
to find f prime of 1 4th and we're given

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.390 
to find f prime of 1 4th and we're given
that<00:00:11.389> FX<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:13.700> equal<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:15.650> the<00:00:16.650> inverse<00:00:17.160> tangent

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
that FX is equal to the inverse tangent

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.269 
that FX is equal to the inverse tangent
of<00:00:18.980> 4x<00:00:20.930> so<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.289> another<00:00:22.529> formula<00:00:23.130> that

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
of 4x so this is another formula that

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.769 
of 4x so this is another formula that
you<00:00:23.400> need<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.760> remember<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.390> it's<00:00:24.510> the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
you need to remember and it's the

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.550 
you need to remember and it's the
inventor<00:00:25.590> inverse<00:00:26.160> tangent<00:00:26.519> formula<00:00:27.560> when

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
inventor inverse tangent formula when

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.240 
inventor inverse tangent formula when
you're<00:00:28.680> taking<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.039> derivative<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:31.250> that

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
you're taking the derivative so that

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.170 
you're taking the derivative so that
formula<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:33.530> that<00:00:34.790> the<00:00:35.790> /<00:00:36.239> DX<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:38.790> inverse

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
formula is that the / DX of the inverse

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.020 
formula is that the / DX of the inverse
tangent

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.569 

of<00:00:44.420> x

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
of x

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.329 
of x
is<00:00:46.820> equal<00:00:47.449> to<00:00:47.690> 1<00:00:48.350> over<00:00:48.710> 1<00:00:49.489> plus<00:00:49.909> x<00:00:50.300> squared<00:00:51.339> okay

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
is equal to 1 over 1 plus x squared okay

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:58.689 
is equal to 1 over 1 plus x squared okay
so<00:00:52.940> here<00:00:53.449> f<00:00:54.129> prime<00:00:55.129> of<00:00:55.429> x<00:00:56.019> will<00:00:57.019> be<00:00:57.229> equal<00:00:57.260> to<00:00:57.890> 1

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
so here f prime of x will be equal to 1

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:06.399 
so here f prime of x will be equal to 1
over<00:00:59.350> 1<00:01:00.350> plus<00:01:02.649> 4<00:01:03.649> X<00:01:04.129> quantity<00:01:04.939> squared<00:01:05.409> but

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
over 1 plus 4 X quantity squared but

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.050 
over 1 plus 4 X quantity squared but
remember<00:01:07.009> we<00:01:07.159> have<00:01:07.250> to<00:01:07.399> multiply<00:01:07.549> by<00:01:08.030> the

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
remember we have to multiply by the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.910 
remember we have to multiply by the
derivative<00:01:08.270> of<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:08.930> inside<00:01:09.110> which<00:01:09.350> is<00:01:09.710> going

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
derivative of the inside which is going

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.160 
derivative of the inside which is going
to<00:01:10.039> just<00:01:10.310> be<00:01:10.490> 4<00:01:11.229> so<00:01:12.229> that<00:01:12.560> gives<00:01:13.429> us<00:01:13.689> 14<00:01:14.689> excuse

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
to just be 4 so that gives us 14 excuse

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.309 
to just be 4 so that gives us 14 excuse
me<00:01:15.289> for<00:01:15.619> over<00:01:16.369> 1<00:01:16.939> plus<00:01:18.280> 16x<00:01:19.280> squared<00:01:20.049> and<00:01:21.049> again

00:01:21.309 --> 00:01:21.319 
me for over 1 plus 16x squared and again

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:25.570 
me for over 1 plus 16x squared and again
this<00:01:21.470> is<00:01:21.679> f<00:01:21.920> prime<00:01:22.520> of<00:01:22.850> X<00:01:23.619> and<00:01:24.619> remember<00:01:25.459> they

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
this is f prime of X and remember they

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.480 
this is f prime of X and remember they
wants<00:01:25.850> to<00:01:25.970> find<00:01:26.149> f<00:01:26.390> prime<00:01:26.420> of<00:01:26.780> 1<00:01:27.200> fourth<00:01:27.679> so

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
wants to find f prime of 1 fourth so

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.600 
wants to find f prime of 1 fourth so
we're<00:01:28.640> going<00:01:28.729> to<00:01:28.850> plug<00:01:29.090> it<00:01:29.240> 14<00:01:29.659> so<00:01:29.929> f<00:01:30.200> prime<00:01:30.679> of

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
we're going to plug it 14 so f prime of

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:38.740 
we're going to plug it 14 so f prime of
1<00:01:32.179> 4th<00:01:32.920> is<00:01:33.920> equal<00:01:34.310> to<00:01:34.490> 4<00:01:35.409> over<00:01:36.409> 1<00:01:36.619> plus<00:01:37.159> 16<00:01:37.940> times

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
1 4th is equal to 4 over 1 plus 16 times

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.520 
1 4th is equal to 4 over 1 plus 16 times
one<00:01:39.619> fourth<00:01:40.039> quantity<00:01:40.880> squared<00:01:41.500> which<00:01:42.500> is

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
one fourth quantity squared which is

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:50.410 
one fourth quantity squared which is
equal<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:43.220> 4<00:01:44.380> over<00:01:45.380> 1<00:01:46.149> plus<00:01:47.200> 16<00:01:48.220> times<00:01:49.220> 1<00:01:50.090> over

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
equal to 4 over 1 plus 16 times 1 over

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.610 
equal to 4 over 1 plus 16 times 1 over
16

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.960 

16<00:01:55.490> x<00:01:55.760> 116<00:01:56.600> is<00:01:56.840> just<00:01:57.050> one<00:01:57.320> so<00:01:57.650> that<00:01:57.770> gives<00:01:57.980> us<00:01:58.130> 4

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
16 x 116 is just one so that gives us 4

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.450 
16 x 116 is just one so that gives us 4
over<00:01:59.660> 1<00:01:59.930> plus<00:02:00.740> 1<00:02:01.070> which<00:02:01.760> is<00:02:01.790> equal<00:02:02.030> to<00:02:02.270> 4<00:02:03.200> over<00:02:03.680> 2

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
over 1 plus 1 which is equal to 4 over 2

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.140 
over 1 plus 1 which is equal to 4 over 2
which<00:02:05.360> is<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.660> same<00:02:05.840> thing<00:02:05.900> as<00:02:06.350> just<00:02:06.860> two<00:02:07.370> that

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:08.150 
which is the same thing as just two that

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.979 
which is the same thing as just two that
is<00:02:08.530> answer<00:02:09.530> d
