 barbie spices and of course barbecue 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.719
 sauce of scandal with good purposes 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.270
 then just sautÃ© but that 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:44.640
 The cool thing about it now 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.989
 that you are singing alike so look now 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.730
 First, the steak in the pan 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.250
 yes, I need a lot to say 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.579
 people like me at middle level 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.420
 roast eight minutes on each side 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:02.879
 ever held spot is wonderful 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.949
 also takes simply take leipzig 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.299
 now two pieces as I said the good 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:13.080
 piece is already on the tumble then still 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.450
 Iceberg lettuce has half a paprika here 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.119
 no matter which color than by half 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.479
 onion and now here the crisis of 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.180
 We make out on the rub that you see then 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.460
 That's 50 grams of sound insulation 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.659
 just cut into thin slices because 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.390
 you happen then the oven 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:35.490
 preheating by average was not now 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.799
 planned fuel now not to 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.409
 recipe connoisseurs maximum freestyle but 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.000
 it is almost empty and the next two 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.840
 not funny days meeting this is not 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.230
 much 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:02:10.780
 that's why 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:02:12.370
 I now need a for here 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:22.200
 nothing is thrown away 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:26.320
 that makes maybe 25.4 degrees 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.550
 Tailor now thin strip itself 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.550
 again corner 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.020
 here we already see two portions 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:57.510
 so now we have the rape 200 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.910
 I have not preheated 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.550
 I actually only do one of these 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:07.950
 minute then it fits in again 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:23.459
 Cheese says come in for a very short time 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:26.240
 that's why it's all the question 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.240
 salads 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.740
 I say the meat the thin slices 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.740
 sliced 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.480
 I hope you see everything 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:08.770
 so this had the one with the 1 there 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:13.130
 I will do the barbie church 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:27.919
 the others just did they go 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:33.320
 but think so briefly now 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:38.900
 So yes there must but it is there 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:43.540
 I'll know exactly when you get tired of it 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.540
 Chop and the extra hot spice 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.960
 there you have to save people with it 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.960
 really not to joke 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.110
 I've really forgotten in the 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:27.930
 a lettuce news of louder 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:38.050
 louder that means here comes now 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:40.590
 item on this package will be there 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.590
 really cool 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:15.770
 Of course the one opened again 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:17.580
 and iceberg lettuce is usually not sufficient continuing 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:21.390
