00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 Hi, I'm Daniel Hernandez, from training my 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.480
 dotcom dog in this video I'm going to 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.910
 reveal how to train your puppy 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.429
 so that not dead this is one of the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.920
 really important aspects in the 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.389
 basic training of your puppy that 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.310
 will avoid endangering our 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.180
 physical integrity and that of all 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.790
 people who enter our house 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.250
 It is essential that your puppy has a 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.770
 soft mouth I want to say that when 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.660
 play do not hurt this we will achieve 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.000
 with a very simple technique that you can 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.980
 put into practice immediately during 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.890
 the period of primary socialization 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.120
 that goes from 3 weeks to 4 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.770
 months of life 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.020
 the puppies learn to control the 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.680
 strength of your bite through a 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.610
 process called inhibition of the bite 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.470
 this education is acquired 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.720
 interacting with the mother and her 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.120
 little brothers when the bite of a 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.000
 puppy is too strong and the 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.250
 chilla bitten puppy comes the mother and 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.960
 corrects the aggressor 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.630
 this is one of the teachings that 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.089
 produces in the canine species by 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.650
 from the mother towards the puppies and between 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.350
 themselves through games of 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.000
 fight and hunt and that allows them 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.430
 learn that they must yield when the 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.560
 intensity of said bite goes beyond 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.500
 of tolerable limits for a game 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.810
 healthy this inhibition of the bite should 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.150
 control and reinforce in the puppy 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.580
 by the owner 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.800
 Your puppy must learn from when 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.560
 comes to your house that your teeth can 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.020
 hurt and that this is not good or accepted 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.580
 and that this will be a rule of coexistence 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.580
 which must strictly respect 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.520
 throughout his life you must learn to 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.310
 control or inhibit your bite 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.960
 the puppies are genetically 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.789
 conditioned to bite everything with 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.330
 what they come in contact with in order to 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:53.180
 investigate learn and have fun 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.670
 A dog that does not control his bite is 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.860
 potentially dangerous because at the time 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.470
 biting can cause injuries that go 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.600
 from bruises or scrapes to wounds 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.700
 series when during the game 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.010
 one dog bites another he causes pain 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.780
 the dog that feels measured has 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.390
 several ways to let the 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.790
 aggressor who has overreached and who 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.680
 that's not allowed the puppy 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.380
 attacked emits a sharp squeak 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.140
 indicating his pain immediately 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.000
 the aggressor dog stops biting because it 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.450
 he just realized that it caused pain to his 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.310
 partner 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.980
 so next time your puppy 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.739
 it bites you screams so pretty loud and 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.180
 sharp of pain that makes a moan like 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.849
 the one that produces you when something really 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.310
 it hurts you if you do it right you'll see how and 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.379
 will quickly stop biting you in that 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.790
 Exact moment you should congratulate him and 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.250
 continue playing 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.989
 if he bites you again he screams again and 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.209
 again congratulate you if you stop doing 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.340
 of course you often have to 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.870
 resort to an additional step and that 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.239
 It also has to do with behavior 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.430
 natural of dogs when a puppy 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.650
 is reached from the game of another half is given 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:03.069
 turn and it goes away immediately is to say 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.739
 end the game we remove 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.989
 If your puppy insists on biting you should 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.700
 imitate this behavior you have to 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.090
 immediately remove your toy or 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.590
 favorite entertainment your presence 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.099
 Finish the game for about 3 to 5 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.840
 minutes 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.269
 turn your back and ignore what 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.159
 you absolutely must not push it to me 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.469
 hit him you just have to get up 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.329
 leave the room the place where you 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:26.920
 find and close the door 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.560
 retire a room a place where 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.150
 your puppy can not enter after 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.969
 a few minutes of calm returns to play 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.859

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:37.900

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:41.049
