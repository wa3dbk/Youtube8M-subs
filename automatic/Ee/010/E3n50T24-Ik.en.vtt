00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hey people say here and fox and i have 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.620
 this morning a big surprise 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.620
 experience 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.070
 Welcome to this video and 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.840
 we barely use my new hangar today 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.369
 not when I got up tomorrow 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.320
 logged in I thought so yes 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.220
 maybe once again and suddenly 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.690
 there was an update 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.000
 I did not think anything big was not 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.470
 especially big update and then come 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.460
 I in here, and we grope new hangar 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.970
 this is the best so far on this deluxe 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.670
 ready 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.259
 and there were the two new ones 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.680
 ships leave the two ships of 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.509
 finalists of xamax quaid starship the 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.539
 we see the advance of my absolute 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.090
 favorite behind the sharp collect me 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.350
 go down for a moment 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.770
 I can not sprint I'm sorry I 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:00.690
 do not know if this is due 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:04.140
 my controller the ps3 controller 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.940
 keyboard mouse can not say 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:12.520
 and yes, that's my absolute favorite 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:14.200
 the ship of advance one generally 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.360
 this design looks at the engine 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.660
 then it worked out that looks easy 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.520
 so cool from that looks really wet 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.620
 the thing is somehow for me too 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.709
 sleeker has a more aggressive look 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.050
 and so I believe that both 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.959
 finalists 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.610
 but if i hope so i will for 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.690
 prediction means storm i hope so 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.840
 the profits to the ship that is one 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.060
 I think it's very nice 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.489
 Send the textures this time 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.000
 just everything cool and the interior 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.230
 I like it very much 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.069
 sometimes compare there 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.840
 that is it was wear and yes it looks 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.319
 also really great I will not do it 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.430
 sad if that wins i mean i 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.120
 have the other ship now quite nice 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.920
 But had it not look you in the 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.170
 cool finds no idea I know I 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.360
 also not very good job 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.180
 which made course I now 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.260
 but I have to say that would be mine 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.030
 been second choice 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.079
 the golden engines are simple 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:25.250
 really unique that's just awesome 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:27.410
 made cool and for a while 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.940
 right for this team just the others 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.510
 just have me with him in tyria and 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.069
 convinced the head is ahead and 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:39.470
 sharp collective is not bad either 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:40.519
 is actually also a megageil it is one 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.010
 Difficult Decision 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:48.920
 anyway i dont know i am a fan 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:52.370
 from the retina gunship and origin 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:56.870
 I think so that it is always also 114 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:59.889
 just indescribable so one 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.889
 they did a good job 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.870
 when the ships come out i will 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:09.520
 They buy me first 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:16.209
 Immediately well probably ingame 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:21.489
 money because real money difficult that in 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:23.500
 troja from origin 614 also really cool 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.110
 So the need to really to work at 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.630
 everything is still too dark for us but we will 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.470
 Today today sees the live stream takes place 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.420
 add about two hours instead 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:39.630
 and who will post again for little 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.630
 Now a little bit cool, I think 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.910
 difficult but the title is still 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.480
 not quite finished that we see 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:51.700
 Only today was that awesome if you 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:57.970
 now that you never see it 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:05:01.210
 not logically good and whole two 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.860
 really good finalists make me happy 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.560
 that for the in game have that these 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.600
 great teams have taken from 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.990
 chris roberts a super idea something in the 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.990
 to play and everything he does 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.520
 Everything he does is really cool 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:20.050
 I do not know I can do it like that 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.650
 Yes, thank you for that 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.510
 look at 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.960
 I hope I could give you a little bit 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:29.500
 bring closer what's going on with this 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.660
 macbeth bag and if you like the video 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.760
 still look today and have in between 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.280
 go quickly into your hangar you will 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.020
 the same as I have new hangar and 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.030
 help again but they are 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.370
 probably get away that's tomorrow 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.169
 now only for me to perform 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:49.720
 go if I can not do that could 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:52.320
