00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
weird also Morrison tends to have his

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.360 
weird also Morrison tends to have his
characters<00:05:51.300> just<00:05:51.330> kind<00:05:51.690> of<00:05:51.780> go<00:05:52.650> from<00:05:52.919> place<00:05:53.190> to

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
characters just kind of go from place to

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.860 
characters just kind of go from place to
place<00:05:53.400> to<00:05:53.669> carry<00:05:54.000> on<00:05:54.180> with<00:05:54.300> the<00:05:54.389> story<00:05:54.599> but

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
place to carry on with the story but

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.469 
place to carry on with the story but
there's<00:05:55.020> no<00:05:55.200> real<00:05:55.880> motivation<00:05:56.880> and<00:05:57.150> getting

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
there's no real motivation and getting

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:59.719 
there's no real motivation and getting
there<00:05:57.770> but<00:05:58.770> that's<00:05:59.010> kind<00:05:59.250> of<00:05:59.310> a<00:05:59.400> problem<00:05:59.490> he

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
there but that's kind of a problem he

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:02.420 
there but that's kind of a problem he
always<00:06:00.000> has<00:06:00.210> so<00:06:01.080> overall<00:06:01.380> I<00:06:01.770> really<00:06:01.800> did<00:06:02.400> enjoy

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
always has so overall I really did enjoy

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.700 
always has so overall I really did enjoy
the<00:06:03.180> book<00:06:03.360> but<00:06:03.780> I<00:06:03.810> will<00:06:03.960> say<00:06:04.139> it's<00:06:04.470> probably

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
the book but I will say it's probably

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.120 
the book but I will say it's probably
not<00:06:05.280> for<00:06:05.700> everyone<00:06:06.150> especially<00:06:06.510> if<00:06:07.289> you<00:06:07.620> don't

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
not for everyone especially if you don't

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.100 
not for everyone especially if you don't
like<00:06:08.370> seeing<00:06:08.700> anybody<00:06:09.090> else<00:06:09.360> but<00:06:09.570> Bruce<00:06:09.840> as

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
like seeing anybody else but Bruce as

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.110 
like seeing anybody else but Bruce as
being<00:06:10.530> Batman<00:06:11.070> because<00:06:11.430> they<00:06:11.639> don't<00:06:11.820> quite

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
being Batman because they don't quite

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.980 
being Batman because they don't quite
hold<00:06:12.570> the<00:06:12.780> same<00:06:13.020> air<00:06:13.740> that<00:06:13.970> first<00:06:14.970> does<00:06:15.270> so

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
hold the same air that first does so

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.200 
hold the same air that first does so
it's<00:06:16.229> a<00:06:16.320> completely<00:06:16.680> different<00:06:17.010> feel<00:06:17.400> for<00:06:17.849> a

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
it's a completely different feel for a

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.260 
it's a completely different feel for a
Batman<00:06:18.810> bub<00:06:19.050> but<00:06:19.470> I<00:06:19.860> think<00:06:20.729> you<00:06:20.940> should<00:06:21.120> pick

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
Batman bub but I think you should pick

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.620 
Batman bub but I think you should pick
it<00:06:21.330> up<00:06:21.510> if<00:06:21.780> you<00:06:22.229> are<00:06:22.560> willing<00:06:22.830> to<00:06:23.370> kind<00:06:23.700> of<00:06:23.940> look

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
it up if you are willing to kind of look

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.779

past<00:06:25.050> that<00:06:25.229> and<00:06:25.590> look<00:06:25.950> into<00:06:26.099> a<00:06:26.250> new<00:06:26.520> type<00:06:26.760> of

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:26.789 
past that and look into a new type of

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:29.719 
past that and look into a new type of
Batman<00:06:27.360> and<00:06:27.389> Robin<00:06:27.950> so<00:06:28.950> I<00:06:28.979> hope<00:06:29.220> you<00:06:29.430> all<00:06:29.580> are
