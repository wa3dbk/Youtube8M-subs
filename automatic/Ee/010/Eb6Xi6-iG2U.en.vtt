 I distract gameplay from the model by pigs 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.650
 to vary a little as you see 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.900
 we are here playing is out there to 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:13.410
 álex and just after this game was 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.780
 when he challenged me to that bet which 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.610
 you saw the video that is not going I'm a boss 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.710
 because in this game it was in which 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.330
 I bet with him if I'm good I guess 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.859
 you will have seen if I will not leave it here and 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.690
 Up and down he goes out there will be 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.840
 so good today I come to comment 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:30.180
 a pretty short thing and that is for 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.680
 Those who know do not follow on twitter anymore 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.590
 you will know but tomorrow I'm going with álex 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.300
 so in the morning to Barcelona we go 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.930
 just good to go see 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:44.050
 car is wet kinect simply to cross 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.730
 to do to go there we go back to see 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.170
 to see us since it's good people who are 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.600
 a lot of time talking and then 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.010
 it turns out that you do not see afterwards in person 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.440
 we had not thought about staying in 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.329
 summer although if you know how many good 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.620
 something that exist greater than if not 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.989
 can for the family can not carry 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.489
 by which eye shield which which 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.530
 wallraff kills me because you're with the 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.930
 gun and I said it can not be but good 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.960
 I signed this one he threw me now two hours 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.700
 looking for this guy and how do I tell you how 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.140
 we could not agree 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.210
 simply but we have decided to go for 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.550
 there to give and true power to whom 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.119
 out and now all this is what I want 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.759
 get there is not we cross let's say the 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.039
 good country of the center or I do not know 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.050
 how many hours just to see the and 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:29.110
 which I have seen nothing more than once 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.050
 then what do you get me oysters do not 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.330
 what the internet or youtube does in 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.860
 our case the fact that you can 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.800
 to meet someone let's not say for example 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.440
 me with aleks that I met him two or 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.360
 three years in other years specifically and 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.069
 suddenly we go to madrid or even 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.140
 to those who had known him for a long time 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:49.840
 less and we went to the angels and 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.720
 corals also then what I want 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.849
 to arrive is that it is crazy that 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.250
 to make videos and everything that you do not 

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:59.619
 It is not just fun 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.989
 there is a background behind that not doing 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.929
 the videos are good for you personally 

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:08.410
 because you can do now to be 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:10.780
 let's say in a class it helps you to know 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.569
 express yourself to know expose any 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.310
 thing all this has not been offered 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.140
 memories and good if you want my 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.930
 first videos remember that it was super 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.030
 super shy I still am but let's say 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.530
 that behind a microphone has already been 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.720
 removed from if you can express 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.150
 much better obviously after a thousand 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.069
 videos is like everything once you already 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.349
 have you said that it has taken away your fear or 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.770
 what you practice at the moment you practice 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:38.100
 anything we tell you it's like a 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:41.040
 of training and let's say you're 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.600
 much more much more loose so I do not know 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.900
 is what I find most curious and that 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.970
 many people do not realize and really 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.720
 I think a lot of people are going to hallucinate 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.900
 especially when you see good in the 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.760
 next months a couple of months remember 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.310
 of what I say because you really going 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.500
 you are going to flip for the next month and I 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.900
 I think a lot of people are not aware of 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.460
 everything I think that contributes youtube and 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.920
 with all the amount of people you can 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.650
 meet people who are obviously in 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.840
 youtube and share your same hobbies 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.700
 people of your same age including your 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.400
 same country or they are talking to 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.260
 people who obviously did not have us 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.180
 let you would not have known if if 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.770
 not for youtube in any way 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.680
 that I would not have been able to speak for 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.210
 conductive example contiguous or with people 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.860
 like many me for example with richard 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.620
 of asturias any of another person's 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.370
 another point or here in noses I'm going to 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.040
 go me I know how to know what they consume 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.410
 although as I was going to find then 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.840
 you realize that really 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.520
 has done a lot it has been to me that all 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.290
 you will have started to unknown to a 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.720
 lots of people who are staying well or to 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:54.340
 wrong all everything all all help and help 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.540
 the experience is to say I also have 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.190
 many more experiences those that 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.670
 mention them a long time ago 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.470
 you will know and all this we say that of a 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.500
 way or another comes good is not 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.640
 simply a world is what you're going to 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.950
 find what's out there to 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.140
 anything else and as I tell you, it comes 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.800
 well as training comes well in 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.100
 all the senses 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.220
 and above all that we say that it is our 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.290
 small a little world our little 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.020
 let's say navy wardrobe to escape 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.300
 and we got to do what we really 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.680
 like and especially to have a good time 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.540
 which is of course what you are 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.060
 every day to you to see the 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.480
 videos and I nevertheless get up for 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.790
 do them not then I think a lot 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.410
 people do not realize all this and 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.980
 I want to do it let's say that a kind 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:45.530
 of emphasis on everything that contributes 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.830
 youtube not so much for you as 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.810
 has direction like for me so much to 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.360
 level of experience at the level of a 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.790
 work at the level of all the senses 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.460
 that is an authentic madness so 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.320
 well I just wanted to say let's do 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.210
 a kind of reflection on it for 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.360
 that you see that it is not simply 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.660
 I do not know how to say it a children's game but 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.060
 in helped a lot to a lot of people 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.919
 so here you see my nuclear bomb the 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.199
 incredible feil so I said it's going 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.150
 to raise the game for this or spartans 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:20.009
 and I do not know how he failed in the and the shotgun 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.020
 because it starts to explode the bomb and 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:23.460
 fastest camera person and I said alex no 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.840
 I raise the game the failure is not 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.090
 completed very very easy to avenge not 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.979
 you're silly so I said a disc 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.949
 more times of all for making everything 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.810
 this is possible and I do not expect anything 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.419
 we follow the video that you vote, I like it 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.750
 favorites and greetings to everyone and to 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.470
 next 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.470
 goodbye
