long-lasting

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
long-lasting

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.020 
long-lasting
and<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:14.990> is<00:02:15.990> said<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:16.860> it's<00:02:17.100> 100%<00:02:17.610> gray

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.050 
and I is said that it's 100% gray
coverage<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.990> I<00:02:19.740> believe<00:02:20.070> on<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.610> thing<00:02:20.820> that

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
coverage and I believe on the thing that

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.380 
coverage and I believe on the thing that
the<00:02:21.270> instructions<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:22.020> said<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:24.000> way<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.270> we

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
the instructions it said the way that we

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.700 
the instructions it said the way that we
did<00:02:24.570> it<00:02:24.660> we<00:02:24.750> just<00:02:24.870> did<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.140> all-over<00:02:25.500> color

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
did it we just did the all-over color

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.340 
did it we just did the all-over color
thing<00:02:26.070> which<00:02:26.910> we<00:02:27.150> should<00:02:27.180> have<00:02:27.390> did<00:02:27.690> after<00:02:28.230> we

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
thing which we should have did after we

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.620 
thing which we should have did after we
were<00:02:28.590> done<00:02:28.770> we<00:02:29.100> should<00:02:29.160> have<00:02:30.980> done<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.630> root

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
were done we should have done the root

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.120 
were done we should have done the root
touch-up<00:02:33.870> first<00:02:34.320> and<00:02:34.650> then<00:02:34.740> did<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.010> all-over

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
touch-up first and then did the all-over

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.620 
touch-up first and then did the all-over
color<00:02:35.520> but<00:02:35.760> we<00:02:35.850> didn't<00:02:36.090> end<00:02:36.210> up<00:02:36.240> doing<00:02:36.300> that

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
color but we didn't end up doing that

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.420 
color but we didn't end up doing that
because<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:37.680> know<00:02:37.770> we<00:02:37.890> thought<00:02:38.070> since<00:02:38.250> we're

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
because you know we thought since we're

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.680 
because you know we thought since we're
doing<00:02:38.520> all<00:02:38.730> over<00:02:38.760> like<00:02:39.180> we<00:02:39.360> should<00:02:39.540> follow

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
doing all over like we should follow

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.840 
doing all over like we should follow
those<00:02:39.960> but<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:40.800> next<00:02:41.010> time<00:02:41.130> that<00:02:41.250> we<00:02:41.280> do<00:02:41.520> it<00:02:41.670> we

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
those but the next time that we do it we

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.360 
those but the next time that we do it we
want<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.480> do<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:44.840> roots<00:02:45.840> first<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.620> then<00:02:46.950> go

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
want to do the roots first and then go

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.110 
want to do the roots first and then go
in<00:02:47.520> with<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.820> color<00:02:48.030> because<00:02:49.820> that's<00:02:50.820> where

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
in with the color because that's where

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.210 
in with the color because that's where
my<00:02:51.270> mom's<00:02:51.780> graves<00:02:52.200> are<00:02:52.500> more<00:02:52.830> and<00:02:53.130> they

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
my mom's graves are more and they

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.580 
my mom's graves are more and they
weren't<00:02:53.550> really<00:02:53.640> covered<00:02:54.090> at<00:02:54.240> all<00:02:54.590> because

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
weren't really covered at all because

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.590 
weren't really covered at all because
you<00:02:55.680> can<00:02:55.830> still<00:02:56.070> see<00:02:56.400> them<00:02:56.580> so<00:02:57.000> it's<00:02:57.270> not<00:02:57.330> 100%

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
you can still see them so it's not 100%

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.930 
you can still see them so it's not 100%
yet<00:02:58.320> but<00:02:59.130> I<00:02:59.160> think<00:02:59.340> I'm<00:02:59.400> going<00:02:59.520> to<00:02:59.580> be<00:02:59.640> doing<00:02:59.850> an

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
yet but I think I'm going to be doing an

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.400 
yet but I think I'm going to be doing an
update<00:03:00.060> review<00:03:00.420> when<00:03:00.690> she<00:03:00.900> needs<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.230> color

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
update review when she needs to color

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.320 
update review when she needs to color
her<00:03:01.560> hair<00:03:01.770> again<00:03:01.910> which<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:03.000> think<00:03:03.180> will<00:03:03.300> be

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
her hair again which I think will be

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.060 
her hair again which I think will be
coming<00:03:03.720> up<00:03:03.840> pretty<00:03:03.870> soon<00:03:04.110> because<00:03:04.650> she<00:03:04.860> wants

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
coming up pretty soon because she wants

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.060 
coming up pretty soon because she wants
it<00:03:05.130> color<00:03:05.340> probably<00:03:05.610> for<00:03:06.710> holidays<00:03:07.710> so

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
it color probably for holidays so

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.400 
it color probably for holidays so
that'll<00:03:08.370> probably<00:03:08.400> be<00:03:08.670> coming<00:03:08.820> up<00:03:09.030> soon<00:03:09.410> when

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
that'll probably be coming up soon when

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.080 
that'll probably be coming up soon when
we<00:03:10.560> do<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:10.920> different<00:03:11.250> way<00:03:11.340> but<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:11.940> way

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
we do it the different way but the way

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.640 
we do it the different way but the way
that<00:03:12.240> we<00:03:12.330> applied<00:03:12.630> it<00:03:12.780> we<00:03:12.870> applied<00:03:13.140> it<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.410> her

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
that we applied it we applied it to her

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.220 
that we applied it we applied it to her
hair<00:03:14.010> all<00:03:14.820> over<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.510> for<00:03:15.900> that<00:03:16.020> you're

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
hair all over and for that you're

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.290 
hair all over and for that you're
supposed<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.740> wait<00:03:17.010> about<00:03:17.190> 30<00:03:17.670> minutes<00:03:18.030> and

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
supposed to wait about 30 minutes and

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.600 
supposed to wait about 30 minutes and
then<00:03:18.900> go<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.650> wash<00:03:19.860> it<00:03:20.040> out<00:03:20.130> like<00:03:20.370> a<00:03:20.400> normal

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
then go and wash it out like a normal

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.460 
then go and wash it out like a normal
hair<00:03:20.940> coloring<00:03:22.160> system<00:03:23.160> but<00:03:24.150> overall<00:03:24.750> her

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
hair coloring system but overall her

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.570 
hair coloring system but overall her
hair<00:03:25.680> color<00:03:26.000> is<00:03:27.920> literally<00:03:28.920> exactly<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.459> way

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
hair color is literally exactly the way

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.270 
hair color is literally exactly the way
that<00:03:29.730> she<00:03:29.940> had<00:03:30.120> it<00:03:30.590> before<00:03:31.590> so<00:03:31.920> it<00:03:32.070> matched

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
that she had it before so it matched

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.090 
that she had it before so it matched
perfect<00:03:33.180> I<00:03:33.750> mean<00:03:34.170> she<00:03:34.320> does<00:03:34.470> have<00:03:34.500> darker<00:03:34.890> hair

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
perfect I mean she does have darker hair

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.800 
perfect I mean she does have darker hair
but<00:03:35.610> when<00:03:35.940> she<00:03:36.090> would<00:03:36.209> get<00:03:36.270> it<00:03:36.390> colored<00:03:36.630> at<00:03:36.720> the

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
but when she would get it colored at the

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.350 
but when she would get it colored at the
salon<00:03:37.110> it<00:03:37.290> came<00:03:37.440> out<00:03:37.590> like<00:03:37.739> the<00:03:37.860> same<00:03:38.070> color<00:03:38.360> um

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
salon it came out like the same color um

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.070 
salon it came out like the same color um
so<00:03:40.290> that<00:03:40.440> was<00:03:40.470> good<00:03:41.420> it<00:03:42.420> wasn't<00:03:42.600> necessarily

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
so that was good it wasn't necessarily

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.170

lighter<00:03:43.410> which<00:03:43.620> is<00:03:43.739> what<00:03:43.860> she<00:03:44.010> wanted<00:03:44.370> because

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
lighter which is what she wanted because

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.640 
lighter which is what she wanted because
we<00:03:45.330> weren't<00:03:45.480> really<00:03:45.570> sure<00:03:45.690> so<00:03:45.840> that's<00:03:46.140> not<00:03:46.320> the

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
we weren't really sure so that's not the

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.220 
we weren't really sure so that's not the
boxes<00:03:47.010> fault<00:03:47.220> but<00:03:47.400> it<00:03:47.489> covered<00:03:47.790> well<00:03:48.230> with

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
boxes fault but it covered well with

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.690 
boxes fault but it covered well with
mostly<00:03:49.560> everything<00:03:51.709> except<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.770> grays<00:03:52.950> so

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
mostly everything except the grays so

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.890 
mostly everything except the grays so
the<00:03:53.910> shade<00:03:54.150> again<00:03:55.010> let<00:03:56.010> me<00:03:56.100> grab<00:03:56.220> it<00:03:56.430> is<00:03:56.900> 9.0

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
the shade again let me grab it is 9.0

light<00:03:58.230> blonde<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:59.550> I<00:04:00.209> think<00:04:00.420> she<00:04:00.480> wants<00:04:00.660> to<00:04:00.750> go

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870

light blonde and I think she wants to go
a<00:04:00.900> shade<00:04:01.260> lighter<00:04:01.560> which<00:04:02.810> I'm<00:04:03.810> not<00:04:04.230> I<00:04:04.440> don't

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
a shade lighter which I'm not I don't

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.080 
a shade lighter which I'm not I don't
remember<00:04:04.920> which<00:04:05.100> one<00:04:05.160> that<00:04:05.340> is<00:04:05.489> but<00:04:05.640> she<00:04:05.940> wants

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
remember which one that is but she wants

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.220 
remember which one that is but she wants
to<00:04:06.120> go<00:04:06.239> straight<00:04:06.420> lighter<00:04:06.630> the<00:04:06.840> next<00:04:07.080> time

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
to go straight lighter the next time

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.590 
to go straight lighter the next time
that<00:04:07.350> she<00:04:07.500> does<00:04:07.709> it<00:04:07.890> so<00:04:08.160> when<00:04:08.820> we<00:04:09.150> go<00:04:09.300> to<00:04:09.330> do<00:04:09.510> it

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
that she does it so when we go to do it

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
that she does it so when we go to do it
the<00:04:09.660> next<00:04:09.750> time<00:04:09.900> I'm<00:04:10.080> going<00:04:10.170> to<00:04:10.230> be<00:04:10.350> doing<00:04:10.470> an

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
the next time I'm going to be doing an

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.259 
the next time I'm going to be doing an
update<00:04:10.920> on<00:04:10.980> that<00:04:11.100> but<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:11.790> just<00:04:11.940> want<00:04:12.090> to<00:04:12.180> let

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
update on that but I just want to let

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.150 
update on that but I just want to let
you<00:04:12.360> guys<00:04:12.450> know<00:04:12.510> how<00:04:12.840> it<00:04:12.870> worked<00:04:13.140> the<00:04:13.920> gray

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
you guys know how it worked the gray

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.970 
you guys know how it worked the gray
coverage<00:04:14.519> wasn't<00:04:14.910> very<00:04:15.209> good<00:04:15.450> because<00:04:15.980> you

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
coverage wasn't very good because you

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.860 
coverage wasn't very good because you
left<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.730> product<00:04:18.090> on<00:04:18.209> for<00:04:18.239> a<00:04:18.450> whole<00:04:18.600> 30

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
left the product on for a whole 30

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.590 
left the product on for a whole 30
minutes<00:04:19.230> and<00:04:19.470> I<00:04:20.340> applied<00:04:20.850> to<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.120> roots<00:04:21.299> first

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
minutes and I applied to the roots first

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.990 
minutes and I applied to the roots first
though<00:04:21.930> and<00:04:22.229> then<00:04:22.710> did<00:04:23.010> it<00:04:23.100> all<00:04:23.190> over<00:04:23.460> so<00:04:23.669> that

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
though and then did it all over so that

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.100 
though and then did it all over so that
I<00:04:24.150> would<00:04:24.360> have<00:04:24.479> a<00:04:24.510> longer

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
I would have a longer

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.510 
I would have a longer
to<00:04:25.229> sit<00:04:25.439> but<00:04:25.590> it<00:04:25.740> still<00:04:26.039> didn't<00:04:26.250> really<00:04:26.400> cover

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
to sit but it still didn't really cover

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.939 
to sit but it still didn't really cover
the<00:04:26.639> grays<00:04:26.909> as<00:04:27.090> well<00:04:27.500> so<00:04:28.500> I<00:04:28.530> think<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.830> next

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
the grays as well so I think the next

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:29.959 
the grays as well so I think the next
time<00:04:29.159> we're<00:04:29.310> going<00:04:29.400> to<00:04:29.460> do<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.669> root<00:04:29.789> touch-up

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:29.969 
time we're going to do the root touch-up

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:31.820 
time we're going to do the root touch-up
for<00:04:30.150> like<00:04:30.389> the<00:04:30.479> 20<00:04:30.719> minutes<00:04:30.960> it<00:04:31.080> says<00:04:31.289> to<00:04:31.590> do<00:04:31.710> it

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
for like the 20 minutes it says to do it

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.409 
for like the 20 minutes it says to do it
and<00:04:32.009> then<00:04:32.129> we'll<00:04:32.340> go<00:04:32.460> in<00:04:32.610> with<00:04:32.639> the<00:04:33.000> all<00:04:33.150> of<00:04:33.180> our

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
and then we'll go in with the all of our

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.990 
and then we'll go in with the all of our
color<00:04:33.629> and<00:04:33.840> apply<00:04:34.080> it<00:04:34.139> like<00:04:34.379> so<00:04:34.620> so<00:04:35.310> yeah<00:04:35.490> so

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
color and apply it like so so yeah so

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.189 
color and apply it like so so yeah so
it'll<00:04:36.120> have<00:04:36.300> like<00:04:36.419> a<00:04:36.449> longer<00:04:36.780> time<00:04:36.930> to<00:04:36.960> sit<00:04:37.169> and

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
it'll have like a longer time to sit and

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.219 
it'll have like a longer time to sit and
the<00:04:37.379> roots<00:04:37.560> will<00:04:37.740> be<00:04:37.770> sitting<00:04:38.039> for<00:04:38.310> like<00:04:39.139> 40<00:04:40.139> to

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
the roots will be sitting for like 40 to

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.200 
the roots will be sitting for like 40 to
50<00:04:40.500> minutes<00:04:40.620> so<00:04:40.949> that's<00:04:41.729> what<00:04:41.969> we're<00:04:42.060> going<00:04:42.150> to

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
50 minutes so that's what we're going to

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.790 
50 minutes so that's what we're going to
do<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:42.449> next<00:04:42.599> time<00:04:42.840> but<00:04:43.289> I<00:04:43.349> will<00:04:43.500> update<00:04:43.650> you

then<00:04:44.009> when<00:04:44.219> we<00:04:44.340> do<00:04:44.490> it<00:04:44.719> by<00:04:45.719> Mel<00:04:46.199> or<00:04:46.919> Mel<00:04:47.460> Melissa

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
then when we do it by Mel or Mel Melissa

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.879 
then when we do it by Mel or Mel Melissa
said<00:04:48.539> that<00:04:48.689> for<00:04:48.990> hers<00:04:49.169> when<00:04:49.439> I<00:04:49.469> watched<00:04:49.680> her

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
said that for hers when I watched her

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:51.980 
said that for hers when I watched her
review<00:04:50.189> that<00:04:51.000> it<00:04:51.090> covered<00:04:51.360> her<00:04:51.479> grades<00:04:51.719> really

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
review that it covered her grades really

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.929 
review that it covered her grades really
well<00:04:52.110> with<00:04:52.319> her<00:04:52.439> darker<00:04:52.800> hair<00:04:52.949> color<00:04:53.159> so<00:04:53.789> maybe

00:04:53.929 --> 00:04:53.939 
well with her darker hair color so maybe

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:55.309 
well with her darker hair color so maybe
it<00:04:54.060> was<00:04:54.150> just<00:04:54.210> the<00:04:54.360> blonde<00:04:54.719> I'm<00:04:55.020> not<00:04:55.169> really

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:55.319 
it was just the blonde I'm not really

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:57.469 
it was just the blonde I'm not really
sure<00:04:55.650> but<00:04:56.610> other<00:04:56.789> people<00:04:57.030> said<00:04:57.150> that<00:04:57.240> it<00:04:57.330> works

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
sure but other people said that it works

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.159 
sure but other people said that it works
fine<00:04:57.659> so<00:04:57.900> it<00:04:58.110> could<00:04:58.289> be<00:04:58.439> my<00:04:58.620> fault<00:04:58.680> entirely<00:05:00.169> so

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
fine so it could be my fault entirely so

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.050 
fine so it could be my fault entirely so
like<00:05:01.800> most<00:05:01.949> of<00:05:02.159> her<00:05:02.310> grades<00:05:02.520> recover<00:05:02.849> but

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
like most of her grades recover but

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.700 
like most of her grades recover but
there<00:05:03.180> were<00:05:03.270> like<00:05:03.419> a<00:05:03.449> few<00:05:03.750> up<00:05:04.169> front<00:05:04.500> here<00:05:04.680> that
