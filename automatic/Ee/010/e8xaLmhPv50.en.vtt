thousand<00:00:40.149> resources<00:00:40.690> definitely<00:00:41.589> an<00:00:41.679> awesome

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
thousand resources definitely an awesome

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.770 
thousand resources definitely an awesome
base<00:00:42.159> to<00:00:42.309> attack<00:00:42.609> it<00:00:42.879> looks<00:00:43.179> like<00:00:43.329> his<00:00:43.539> air

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
base to attack it looks like his air

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.599 
base to attack it looks like his air
defense<00:00:44.079> is<00:00:44.260> pretty<00:00:44.469> weak<00:00:44.679> as<00:00:44.889> well<00:00:45.399> as<00:00:45.489> his

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:45.609 
defense is pretty weak as well as his

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:47.669 
defense is pretty weak as well as his
walls<00:00:45.850> are<00:00:46.030> really<00:00:46.329> weak<00:00:46.510> but<00:00:47.469> the<00:00:47.559> air

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679 
walls are really weak but the air

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:49.349 
walls are really weak but the air
defense<00:00:47.949> is<00:00:48.100> really<00:00:48.309> what<00:00:48.639> I'm<00:00:48.760> focused<00:00:49.209> on

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:49.359 
defense is really what I'm focused on

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:52.289 
defense is really what I'm focused on
because<00:00:49.929> of<00:00:50.199> his<00:00:50.319> air<00:00:50.499> defense<00:00:50.829> and<00:00:51.299> only

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:52.299 
because of his air defense and only

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:54.000 
because of his air defense and only
being<00:00:52.449> level<00:00:52.719> one<00:00:52.959> they're<00:00:53.739> going<00:00:53.829> to<00:00:53.920> be

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
being level one they're going to be

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.619 
being level one they're going to be
really<00:00:54.280> easy<00:00:54.309> to<00:00:54.609> take<00:00:54.760> care<00:00:55.059> of<00:00:55.089> and<00:00:55.359> because

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
really easy to take care of and because

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.119 
really easy to take care of and because
of<00:00:55.659> that<00:00:55.809> let<00:00:56.170> me<00:00:56.199> drop<00:00:56.409> my<00:00:56.469> dragons<00:00:57.010> on<00:00:57.100> the

amazing<00:03:13.930> rate<00:03:14.220> alright<00:03:15.220> let's<00:03:15.370> go<00:03:15.459> ahead<00:03:15.519> and

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
amazing rate alright let's go ahead and

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.830 
amazing rate alright let's go ahead and
wrap<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:15.879> up<00:03:15.940> with<00:03:16.060> rate<00:03:16.239> number<00:03:16.480> three<00:03:16.720> we

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
wrap it up with rate number three we

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.979 
wrap it up with rate number three we
have<00:03:16.870> destroyer<00:03:17.500> 36<00:03:18.489> and<00:03:18.790> it<00:03:19.569> doesn't<00:03:19.900> look

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
have destroyer 36 and it doesn't look

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.589 
have destroyer 36 and it doesn't look
like<00:03:20.169> this<00:03:20.379> base<00:03:20.680> is<00:03:21.160> going<00:03:21.549> to<00:03:21.609> be<00:03:21.760> too<00:03:21.940> bad<00:03:22.090> it

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
like this base is going to be too bad it

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:23.970 
like this base is going to be too bad it
looks<00:03:22.780> like<00:03:22.959> most<00:03:23.169> of<00:03:23.319> it<00:03:23.470> is<00:03:23.590> in<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.739> mines

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
looks like most of it is in the mines

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.220 
looks like most of it is in the mines
pumps<00:03:24.459> but<00:03:24.699> potentially<00:03:25.629> some<00:03:25.810> in<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:26.019> elixir

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
pumps but potentially some in the elixir

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.780 
pumps but potentially some in the elixir
storages<00:03:26.829> if<00:03:26.980> you<00:03:27.069> look<00:03:27.220> at<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.430> elixir

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
storages if you look at the elixir

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.000 
storages if you look at the elixir
storage<00:03:27.849> they<00:03:28.329> are<00:03:28.480> a<00:03:28.510> little<00:03:28.780> bit<00:03:28.989> full<00:03:29.260> so

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
storage they are a little bit full so

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.110 
storage they are a little bit full so
let's<00:03:30.160> go<00:03:30.250> ahead<00:03:30.370> and<00:03:30.459> break<00:03:30.579> through<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:30.819> giant

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
let's go ahead and break through a giant

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.430 
let's go ahead and break through a giant
some<00:03:31.389> wall<00:03:31.569> breakers<00:03:31.930> I'm<00:03:32.109> going<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.290> drop

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
some wall breakers I'm going to drop

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.080 
some wall breakers I'm going to drop
some<00:03:32.500> archers<00:03:33.040> I'm<00:03:33.280> going<00:03:33.669> to<00:03:33.760> drop<00:03:33.910> some

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
some archers I'm going to drop some

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.909 
some archers I'm going to drop some
goblins<00:03:34.359> and<00:03:34.870> let's<00:03:35.049> just<00:03:35.230> see<00:03:35.349> how<00:03:35.530> much<00:03:35.709> is

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:35.919 
goblins and let's just see how much is

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:38.610 
goblins and let's just see how much is
inside<00:03:36.340> of<00:03:36.639> these<00:03:36.970> elixir<00:03:37.629> collectors<00:03:38.019> if

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
inside of these elixir collectors if

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.229 
inside of these elixir collectors if
there's<00:03:38.859> only<00:03:39.040> like<00:03:39.220> 50,000<00:03:39.910> left<00:03:40.030> it's

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
there's only like 50,000 left it's

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.400 
there's only like 50,000 left it's
probably<00:03:40.480> not<00:03:40.569> worth<00:03:40.750> it<00:03:40.870> to<00:03:40.989> attack<00:03:41.230> the

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
probably not worth it to attack the

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.869 
probably not worth it to attack the
center<00:03:41.620> of<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:41.769> base<00:03:41.919> but<00:03:42.519> we'll<00:03:42.639> just<00:03:42.669> have

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
center of the base but we'll just have

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.159 
center of the base but we'll just have
to<00:03:42.910> see<00:03:43.090> much<00:03:43.269> how<00:03:43.540> much<00:03:43.629> is<00:03:43.780> left<00:03:43.900> in<00:03:44.079> the

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169 
to see much how much is left in the

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:45.839 
to see much how much is left in the
collectors<00:03:44.560> or<00:03:44.829> in<00:03:44.919> the<00:03:45.040> elixir<00:03:45.250> storage<00:03:45.730> as

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
collectors or in the elixir storage as

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.119 
collectors or in the elixir storage as
well<00:03:46.030> as<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.299> the<00:03:46.510> gold<00:03:46.690> storage<00:03:47.010> alright<00:03:48.010> so

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
well as the the gold storage alright so

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:49.409 
well as the the gold storage alright so
same<00:03:48.310> thing<00:03:48.340> on<00:03:48.549> the<00:03:48.639> top<00:03:48.790> let<00:03:48.970> me<00:03:49.060> take<00:03:49.239> care

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
same thing on the top let me take care

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:50.699 
same thing on the top let me take care
of<00:03:49.510> some<00:03:49.690> of<00:03:49.750> these<00:03:49.840> freebie<00:03:50.230> buildings<00:03:50.530> first

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
of some of these freebie buildings first

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:51.960 
of some of these freebie buildings first
I'm<00:03:50.919> going<00:03:51.040> to<00:03:51.129> drop<00:03:51.220> some<00:03:51.340> barbarians<00:03:51.879> I'm

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
I'm going to drop some barbarians I'm

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.610 
I'm going to drop some barbarians I'm
going<00:03:52.090> to<00:03:52.150> drop<00:03:52.269> some<00:03:52.449> archers<00:03:52.870> and<00:03:53.019> then<00:03:53.530> we

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
going to drop some archers and then we

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.289 
going to drop some archers and then we
can<00:03:53.739> make<00:03:53.889> our<00:03:54.040> way<00:03:54.190> into<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.790> other<00:03:54.940> side<00:03:55.209> of

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
can make our way into the other side of

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.879 
can make our way into the other side of
the<00:03:55.359> base<00:03:55.510> and<00:03:55.750> take<00:03:56.049> care<00:03:56.290> of<00:03:56.470> these<00:03:56.590> gold

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
the base and take care of these gold

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:58.649 
the base and take care of these gold
mines<00:03:57.099> so<00:03:57.940> after<00:03:58.180> I<00:03:58.209> take<00:03:58.389> care<00:03:58.510> of<00:03:58.599> that

00:03:58.649 --> 00:03:58.659 
mines so after I take care of that

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:59.849 
mines so after I take care of that
