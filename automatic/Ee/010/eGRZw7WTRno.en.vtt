tomorrow<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.730> i<00:00:12.950> thought<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.099> would<00:00:14.160> be

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
tomorrow and i thought it would be

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.919 
tomorrow and i thought it would be
trending<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.730> little<00:00:14.940> faster<00:00:15.330> but<00:00:15.570> i<00:00:15.599> didn't

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
realize it'd be trending this fast so I

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.090 
realize it'd be trending this fast so I
hear<00:00:20.210> 628<00:00:21.230> this<00:00:22.230> would<00:00:22.410> be<00:00:22.439> gutteridge

those who don't know this is
southwestern<00:00:30.779> Ontario<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:31.529> let's<00:00:31.710> have<00:00:31.830> a

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
southwestern Ontario so let's have a

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.400 
southwestern Ontario so let's have a
little<00:00:32.059> backup<00:00:33.059> browse<00:00:33.540> as<00:00:33.809> we<00:00:33.930> go<00:00:34.050> through

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
little backup browse as we go through

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.229 
little backup browse as we go through
here<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.370> 730<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:37.489> this<00:00:38.489> looks<00:00:38.760> like<00:00:38.940> a

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
here is 730 and this looks like a

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.979 
here is 730 and this looks like a
problem<00:00:40.700> this<00:00:41.700> does<00:00:41.879> not<00:00:41.910> look<00:00:42.120> very<00:00:42.420> happy

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
problem this does not look very happy

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.790 
problem this does not look very happy
for<00:00:44.809> southwestern<00:00:45.809> Ontario<00:00:47.870> 730<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:49.559> would

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
for southwestern Ontario 730 this would

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.720 
for southwestern Ontario 730 this would
be<00:00:49.829> 830<00:00:51.140> these<00:00:52.140> look<00:00:52.379> like<00:00:52.440> monster<00:00:53.370> super

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
be 830 these look like monster super

cells<00:00:53.969> moving<00:00:54.390> through<00:00:54.719> southwestern

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
cells moving through southwestern

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.069 
cells moving through southwestern
Ontario<00:00:55.850> with<00:00:56.850> some<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> strongest

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
Ontario with some of the strongest

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.330 
Ontario with some of the strongest
severe<00:00:58.440> potential<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:59.210> think<00:01:00.210> we've<00:01:00.329> ever<00:01:00.449> seen

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
severe potential I think we've ever seen

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.759 
severe potential I think we've ever seen
so<00:01:02.340> at<00:01:02.609> least<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:04.110> two<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> half<00:01:04.530> years

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
so at least in the two and a half years

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.539 
so at least in the two and a half years
we've<00:01:04.979> done<00:01:05.189> ontario<00:01:05.880> tornado<00:01:06.150> watch<00:01:07.549> let's

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
we've done ontario tornado watch let's

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.240 
we've done ontario tornado watch let's
keep<00:01:08.760> going<00:01:09.119> here<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:10.049> would<00:01:10.290> be<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.860> final

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
keep going here this would be the final
