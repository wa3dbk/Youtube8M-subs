00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.480
 second day of the bridge tournament for 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.520
 Spain and after the calm in the hotel of the 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.530
 tomorrow where ours disconnected 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.240
 with alternative sports and the latest 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.070
 Mondelo's instructions arrived on 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.310
 match against canada a friendly match 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.690
 long road the road but nothing that 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.690
 give sense one two three 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.980
 if the day before the Americans 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.750
 they put things to rest 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.510
 complicated to the French at 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.490
 Spaniards spent so much of the same few 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.050
 concessions in the first few minutes already 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.290
 ours was difficult to adjust the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.330
 defending 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.310
 but elisa aguilar appeared for 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.470
 take from the line of three the 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.480
 inclusions of her two companions 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.040
 triple of the toned Madrid base 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.470
 gave the first advantages to the 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.350
 samples so the truth is that good has 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.210
 come out today is right and then we 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.950
 we were a bit stuck and good 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.440
 we have been lucky that they have 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.060
 entered and I have not chosen there an income 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.550
 of points that we have known later 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.980
 keep until the end of the match 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.600
 however at rest I earned 1 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.790
 canada in a shock they were 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.020
 taking a lot to the physical terrain 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.270
 sponsored by the arbitration trio born 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.430
 a rocky party the truth is that no 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.870
 very showy but good she will be very 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.060
 Physics I think that we will come very 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.310
 well and in the end we are leaving them to 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.930
 the teams with few points and I think 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.940
 which is the most positive part of this 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.620
 match in the second half the inning 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.210
 from queralt houses unpublished until the 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.770
 moment was the extra point that 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.300
 I needed Spain in a defense that 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.920
 adjusted to perfection 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.990
 seven robberies of the Spanish overwhelmed 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.990
 canada that let Catalan play in 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.970
 If sauce is what I like to run no 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.890
 they will defend and steal balls and run 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.900
 and today I was able to steal some ball or 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.120
 Strap up with here I feel good 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.860
 more comfortable then take it from when from 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.390
 store and they stole in that also more like 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.470
 an attack then I will help the 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.690
 team 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.940
 also elisa that would end with five 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.520
 triples opened like a tin to the defense 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.130
 Canadian and finished with 17 points well 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.410
 seconded by alba torrens with 12 a 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.360
 victory 7 of 7 in the preseason in the 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.440
 that Monde continued to do infinity 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.440
 of tests and adjustments 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.470
 the tactical variations we are 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.520
 training then many defenses in 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.620
 attack 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.780
 systems with variations with small 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.760
 details and in the end this two tournaments 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.470
 they are good for that to train 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.240
 is the best training matches 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.010
 I think tomorrow against France 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.540
 it's really going to be a very tough match 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.400
 because for me they are the favorites for 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.709
 camping all over europe and good and go 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.239
 taking sensations step by step to 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.850
 arrive on the 15th against Russia in the 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.950
 best broadcasts this Sunday 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.720
 Spain and the all-powerful France are 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.319
 will play the bridge tournament from 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.319
 4 in the afternoon
