00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:07.600
 Year had held but it was enough have game day already told me that 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.739
 here 

00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:12.609
 my experience says a bit to the north while again 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:15.009
 various top APA 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.159
 and Abderhalden say goodbye 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:22.199
 also pull a distant Japan today is the second time questions 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.279
 Archiväre Vergleich takes out the bosses who acquired the city he revealed 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.649
 Magath too and how natural game 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:32.839
 eternally that he has organized everything and yes I have it I guess times 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.909
 yes, in addition 

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:38.620
 now have astronomers 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.840
 Pastor Hans-Georg at the top 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.160
 it was all over 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.090
 I have them one 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.400
 WM around 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.890
 yes she is yes it is true I found him Birgit Hamann I can give you one 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.710
 Opponents too 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.730
 They would rather take their costs from Hama 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.210
 here are next sunday is clearer my idea so the cleaner 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.540
 even if he confesses, he declared 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.650
 these ports 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.310
 This is in my legs 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.440
 that's why I'm here too 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.210
 Telstar from May with shadow 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.440
 around 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.340
 where I obviously do not exclude a casting of Prognos 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.080
 This is definitely in the boxing ring 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.579
 and here Henz or Tücher and 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.240
 yes, mirrors 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.080
 at the 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.410
 be prevented from kri 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.500
 and then betraying my hand got what i did is i still have it 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.450
 no last bolt at the army 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.370
 under it are the same players used 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.640
 and the costs alone are seniors like yourself and not quite true 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.150
 March their album now all these things "baa1" to friends and they have 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.530
 quite a strong increase in real Einar and die him 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.409
 Sheen is 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:09.929
 during 4 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.980
 So that's about it May be the drawer 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.709
 quite class that are around Dr 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:23.120
 Bundesliga cleaner also Conti has the costumes were 94 and I have percent 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.300
 It was a bit taken to handle and then I would have better handle it 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.500
 I could have made it jealous, too 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.930
 but well and Salzburg so for those who this is now somehow 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:39.209
 Meanwhile, it remains unclear 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.239
 is just awesome Henry is not feasible 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.479
 coming summer place modules or something 

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:49.259
 Meanwhile, have a whole industry again 

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:53.839
 and this is not a part of Ernst de Course 

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:57.169
 that cost me, I say 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.139
 4 99 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.779
 but unfortunately I have so many different fishermen and marches and 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:03.729
 move out of the way 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:05.229
 never before 

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:08.229
 There is nothing in the lower drawer 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:11.119
 per year will continue here 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:12.509
 Pagel 

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:16.669
 Now I have everything that is quasi daily. Huge chance 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:17.959
 various 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.969
 No standing stencils here then I have all my stickers around this time 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:26.149
 will remember just black money 

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:29.419
 just an excerpt from but I can not say exactly where and how they are 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:30.669
 that costs off 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.290
 around this time here 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.410

 «Renault will remain channel driven disadvantage will arise 

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:45.800
 the most diverse care stick can participate is clear to me no 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.669
 this shows as he is at the Becker 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.639
 Oppenheim also has 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.639
 4 99% 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.439
 dpa at the headquarters in a drawer with each other again mix this 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.189
 Approaches of the Kita 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:03.889
 and the program is still long and me here 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:07.859
 as a possible partner so Constien of the Alps we have indeed 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.689
 Not about the CEAG AG is their existence, yes I do not think so 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:14.299
 my foundation wants 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:15.900
 Limits due to glitches 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.620
 can be next to my bed 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.859
 I've also had a few rounds and was there 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.400
 because the packaging was just too big 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.050
 and that he's a good footballer right here so 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.969
 Consumption fits 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:32.479
 come now 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.379
 on an adjusted basis 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:37.860
 it is cool or that she does not care about her WLAN 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.659
 I appreciated that so much »Resolution Percent

 bp boss Hayward with what but that's an employer around 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.409
 yesterday moved 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:56.739
 Lovers certainly did not care about my bills let the manic ivory 

00:04:56.739 --> 00:04:57.270
 Etc 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.210
 to Nicholas and the first group 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.909
 is experts dare 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:04.960
 who ask me lipsticks 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.960
 Nick Clegg judged her victory b 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:11.569
 and then that's certainly not easier under 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.430
 that the degradation in the 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.430
 f but of course that's really nice and clear 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:22.349
 and in the drawer of the tour 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:27.309

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:31.309
 take me now percent put each still does not know the video the money earned 

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:32.460
 then again 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.650
 I think despite 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.439
 that's the motto to dress 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:40.309
 Deposits from the furniture store no longer make me work them very hard 

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:45.789
 Here I bought myself these 3 around for narrow money the poison mud 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.299
 brought Becker problematic because I do not know right now 

00:05:49.299 --> 00:05:51.330
 I always need Trier 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.600
 to make a play we also do not cost EUR 0 40 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.600
 and there I have the different ones right now 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.330
 necessary 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.330
 so in and this year, everything is clean 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:07.550
 Pölten Ballack succumbed to flames so they would stripes 

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:12.339
 without just one last game but that did not happen 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:14.219
 in it is 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:16.009
 all wines 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:18.639
 This trend is not necessarily every day 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:20.139
 useful 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:22.909
 and yes we have one percent up 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:27.130
 why soon it became clear what that is it is good that way 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.070
 Hamburg dapd-nrd 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.909

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:34.309
 yes and then to strike Stronachs 

00:06:34.869 --> 00:06:36.279
 that was good 

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:37.330
 the cash registers 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.219
 Brasch place and also there we have a little hide unclear 

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:44.379
 on the other hand normal 

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:45.569
 I 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:48.569
 can 

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:53.819
 after the confidence is out 

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:58.719
 there it is understandable because no question clarified the Bitkom exclusively 

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:01.210
 and around 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.599
