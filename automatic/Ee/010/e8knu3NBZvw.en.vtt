pretty easy for any sewing machine to

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.240 
pretty easy for any sewing machine to
soak<00:00:10.019> through<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.260> steady<00:00:10.559> thickness<00:00:11.070> of

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
soak through a steady thickness of

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.430 
soak through a steady thickness of
material<00:00:11.420> where<00:00:12.420> most<00:00:12.630> machines<00:00:12.840> encounter

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
material where most machines encounter

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.499 
material where most machines encounter
problems<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:14.160> thickness<00:00:14.730> changes<00:00:15.299> for

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
problems is thickness changes for

layers here and it goes back down to
three<00:00:33.860> machines<00:00:34.860> often<00:00:35.160> have<00:00:35.489> problems<00:00:36.030> going

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
three machines often have problems going

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.850 
three machines often have problems going
through<00:00:36.510> these<00:00:36.630> thickness<00:00:37.050> changes<00:00:37.530> or<00:00:37.710> you

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
through these thickness changes or you

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.069 
through these thickness changes or you
have<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.190> kind<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.760> assist<00:00:39.059> them<00:00:39.270> up<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:39.960> over

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
have to kind of assist them up and over

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.760 
have to kind of assist them up and over
the<00:00:40.739> blue<00:00:41.219> jean<00:00:41.460> scene<00:00:42.290> whenever<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.350> start<00:00:43.649> to

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
the blue jean scene whenever I start to

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.830 
the blue jean scene whenever I start to
sew<00:00:43.980> you'll<00:00:44.520> see<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:44.879> machine<00:00:45.270> goes<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
sew you'll see this machine goes to the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.330 
sew you'll see this machine goes to the
thickness<00:00:46.050> changes<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:46.890> fine

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
thickness changes just fine

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.920 
thickness changes just fine
and<00:00:47.430> it'll<00:00:47.850> go<00:00:48.000> right<00:00:48.210> up<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.480> over<00:00:48.629> that

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
and it'll go right up and over that

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.569 
and it'll go right up and over that
thick<00:00:49.200> blue<00:00:49.440> jean<00:00:49.680> scene<00:00:49.950> with<00:00:50.129> no<00:00:50.280> assistance

thick blue jean scene with no assistance

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.340 
thick blue jean scene with no assistance
I'm<00:00:51.000> just<00:00:51.180> letting<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.510> Machine<00:00:51.870> do<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.170> work

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
I'm just letting the Machine do the work

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.319 
I'm just letting the Machine do the work
and<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:53.039> goes<00:00:53.070> right<00:00:53.460> through<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.850> thickness

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
and it goes right through the thickness

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.270 
and it goes right through the thickness
of<00:00:54.600> material<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.350> you'll<00:00:55.800> see<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
of material and you'll see that the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.939 
of material and you'll see that the
stitching<00:00:56.789> remains<00:00:57.390> constant<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.199> there's

thickness changes we're going to double
this<00:01:40.560> over<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:42.000> now<00:01:42.210> we're<00:01:42.720> going<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.869> go<00:01:43.049> from

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
this over so now we're going to go from

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.510 
this over so now we're going to go from
three<00:01:43.619> layers<00:01:43.909> to<00:01:44.909> six<00:01:45.270> layers<00:01:46.159> to<00:01:47.159> twelve

layers back down to six and as you'll

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.520 
layers back down to six and as you'll
see<00:01:50.909> my<00:01:51.240> hands<00:01:51.630> aren't<00:01:51.780> forcing<00:01:52.290> anything

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
see my hands aren't forcing anything

see my hands aren't forcing anything
through<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.070> machine<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:54.060> just<00:01:54.390> goes<00:01:54.540> right

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
through the machine it just goes right

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.069 
through the machine it just goes right
up<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.049> over<00:01:55.290> from<00:01:55.470> three<00:01:55.770> layers<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.899> we<00:01:57.899> go

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
up and over from three layers and we go
