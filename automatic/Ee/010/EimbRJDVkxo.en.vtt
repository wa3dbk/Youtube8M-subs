00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.160
 Today we prepare a healthy ice cream 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.160
 mango 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.129
 we're going to need three handles and what 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.410
 fundamental for us to get a good 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.010
 ice cream is that the mangoes are ripe and 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.010
 tasty 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.610
 enrique is cutting the mangoes and 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.610
 putting them in a bowl 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.230
 we already have them 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.070
 we dump them in a blender 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.460
 we add an egg this is a trick for 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.129
 that does not crystallize and we left creamy 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.870
 we add the skim milk and some 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.010
 droplets of liquid stevia if you want it 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.250
 sweeten 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.120
 and we beat it all with a couple of minutes 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.120
 It will be enough 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.290
 look what it looks so wonderful has 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.799
 who said that you can not do a 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.799
 healthy ice cream 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.619
 we take this piece of the 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.450
 refrigerator is stored in a bag of 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.229
 plastic so that crystals do not form 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.229
 of ice 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.399
 we assemble the refrigerator 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.900
 and we connect it first we will make a 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.760
 ice cream with ice cream and then we will do 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.340
 another for you to do it without a machine 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.030
 to make ice cream I'm turning it over the milkshake 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.030
 in the refrigerator 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.780
 and the blades avoid with their movement that 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.010
 ice crystals are formed and so we 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.440
 it is more creamy 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.520
 between half an hour and an hour later and 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.619
 we have it open the refrigerator 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.570
 and we dump the ice cream in a container 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.570
 to store it in the freezer 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.530
 It is very creamy but it still lacks 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.690
 a little bit of cold we cover it with 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.970
 plastic in contact with the ice cream for 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.069
 that ice crystals are not formed and 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.250
 we store it in the freezer in two or 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.290
 three hours will be perfect we have done 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.390
 exactly the same other side to do 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.209
 without a machine we put it in a container 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.370
 better deep to comfortably stir 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.980
 we cover it and keep it in the 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.530
 freezer best to use milk and cold mango 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.510
 to help in the process every average 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.099
 you have to take it out and stir it up 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.120
 we have used this cook 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.120
 to warn us 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.200
 we open and stir 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.730
 it's about breaking the crystallites 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.730
 of ice that are forming 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.090
 especially the base and on the sides 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.590
 of the container the times that we have to 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.040
 Doing this depends on many factors 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.500
 but normal between 3 and 4 hours and what 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.080
 mix about 6 times about 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.329
 is already in the last one maybe it would have been 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.760
 better or used a deeper container 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:19.680
 to be able to stir better we are using 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.680
 a rod to mix everything well 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.490
 this is what we are testing the day 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.340
 next we have left the container 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:35.380
 out of the freezer 20 minutes and then 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.380
 we serve it first the machine 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.950
 ah 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.680
 ah 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.870
 and then what we have done by hand 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.270
 flavor is so equal but obviously the 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.340
 machine is a little bit creamier if 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.040
 you want you can serve it with bits of 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.560
 handle to decorate this is a way to 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.460
 that the ice creams are healthy and not a 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.800
 junk food 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.960
