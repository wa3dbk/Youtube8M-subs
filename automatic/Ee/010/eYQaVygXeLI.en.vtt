00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:10.290
 she has everyone these crystals we get 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.929
 found for a new video on 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.429
 this famous series gta 5 and so I 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.199
 still a lot of information to you 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.240
 pass and that's thanks to you 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.740
 since here you asked me to do 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.119
 an analysis make of the last 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.230
 screenshots that send star dresses on 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.090
 their official website 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.039
 here I was able to analyze some images 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.289
 not all the images that rockstar could 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.789
 send on their site since I also 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.890
 other things to do that is to say 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.840
 I have classes next door and it's hard enough 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.360
 to do big analyzes on not 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.370
 bad pictures serious analysis and 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.230
 Well, I have to admit that it's pretty 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.649
 hard to actually do both at the same 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.450
 time 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.760
 knowing that school is more important 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.129
 unfortunately what am I doing to 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.860
 side finally let's get on with this little 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.090
 school obstacle and let's start all of 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.280
 next by screenshots 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.960
 so here you see ben in fact everything 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.270
 just a person who is clutching 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.219
 on a vehicle a truck that goes all 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.570
 simply be able to tell us that in this 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.090
 again gta you and for you grab 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.510
 on vehicles be it car 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.770
 chip maybe from gap or trucks you 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.390
 go can you pay that's it 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.130
 a frankly but very cool thing 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.040
 that is to say you take your car 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.180
 take fire and then and then bah you you 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.310
 get out of the car you see a 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.570
 truck to pass and well you go 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.280
 jump on the opportunity and you for 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.689
 can you cling pass you are 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.030
 in chase this is the thing 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.530
 ideal to do some kind of down as 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.600
 in the action movies a super thing 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.070
 cool also knowing that in the iv gta 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.780
 you have a little this opportunity there 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.670
 then not at all jump on the caf 1 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.840
 on 1 km stop on a truck but 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.090
 you know you can attach to 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.820
 a door and training and often you 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.710
 do not want but it hurts a little 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.060
 characters and well this truck also can 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.220
 tell us another thing is that we 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.530
 can in this new gta carry it 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.080
 vehicles this truck carry it 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.120
 cars then ski 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.610
 who maybe for some people 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.170
 may sound weird but in gta iv 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.510
 but damn we can not even carry 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.890
 vehicles were enough 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.290
 painfully frank and I must confess 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.760
 he has on this new gta baÃ¯se have screwed up 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.440
 that and that makes it a lot of pleasure 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.610
 I do not know maybe you have it 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.960
 tried I think just about all the 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.300
 world to leave on iv gta in order to 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.310
 carry a motorcycle or anything 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.170
 on a truck and then in fact you 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.750
 can not or on the trailer and you 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.050
 can not just the vehicle 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.850
 do not want to get stuck a point c on 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.530
 will say posed on the trailer all those 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.760
 who love life is pretty pity 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.200
 in short it's still a small all that 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.959
 rockstar offers us power 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.790
 carry motorcycles then 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.860
 maybe a helicopter too that's that 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.840
 really cool it's really a good 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.060
 stuff that will also I think I'll strengthen the 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.010
 game in itself we can also see so 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.540
 at the top right of the lights screen 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.580
 so it's actually it's referring to a 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.830
 stage not just any of it is the 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.380
 stadium ash that I want to do 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.270
 so display on the screen so this is a 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.070
 big resemblance is so this actually 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.800
 who proves to us that this gta will do it 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.019
 much reference to the GTAA aisles 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.720
 older gta like it is 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.280
 short is a little more and I think 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.500
 that he will be enormously pleased 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.000
 old fans to old fans who are going 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.650
 to regain doing that game 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.410
 so that's how I meant 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.320
 gta5 it goes to los santos resumes 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.510
 find this game but we will say under 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.160
 much improved version and it was 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.230
 really really fun 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.060
 very little parenthesis on this image 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.260
 there is something weird about it if you 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.990
 are you can pause we re 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.980
 view 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.659
 the image ie the truck 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.090
 the wheels of the truck of the front wheel 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:32.879
 right not only it's up to my mouth 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.950
 but there is something weird bread I know 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.209
 not how how he rolls which 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.980
 how there to ride where there is 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.900
 maybe I do not know their way of having 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.640
 more screenshot of taking the picture 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.680
 is perhaps strange since we come back 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.480
 of the front wheel of the truck live watts 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.519
 yeah I have not even finished with 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.900
 this image ie these 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.489
 people there actually we also find 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.840
 in other pictures that it's about art 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.549
 I do not know if it's a ferrari porsche 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.769
 I do not know too much by car but 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.659
 my big killer expo but on this 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.430
 red car but in fact we find 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:02.190
 I think the same housing character 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.480
 on screen and so we zoom in on these two 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.099
 characters to it I think these are 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.480
 the same we may find you 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.790
 in fact in the story mode 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.349
 two images of the same character it's not 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.510
 finished because we find in fact only 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.459
 two more pictures with two others even 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.599
 character gold there I think because 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.070
 that I told you that I wished 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.570
 three screenshots that I analyze and in 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.090
 did not it was 4 but we look 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.250
 really three screenshots since the 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.440
 last bullet apparently no 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.600
 great thing to say also so here in 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.160
 done so we could recognize these two 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.039
 same characters years this is the first 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.750
 picture of the first picture so this is the 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:36.630
 no one who stands out who are in 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.880
 in this red plane that we find 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.440
 also in the trailer so have this the 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.020
 second screenshot makes it his person 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.479
 who wears this ak 47 assault rifles 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.880
 laser sight that we 're not sure I'll 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.740
 to tell you that right after that so it's 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.180
 this person only apparently has that 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.129
 should be the same people then 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.619
 why I 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:56.849
 not sure that deezer laser because in 

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:58.139
 did a lot of people have landed the 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:00.209
 question is what is it really him 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.619
 which has as a laser sight accessory or 

00:05:00.209 --> 00:05:03.989
 is it really really the 

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:06.330
 cops in the helicopter who are in 

00:05:03.989 --> 00:05:09.330
 actually aim for this person 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.289
 with a laser then that's it 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.699
 always this question there unless 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.069
 to be me I think the police 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:16.259
 who is aiming with a laser since if you 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:17.699
 have it the laser find themselves there in 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.169
 below the army I do not think that a 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:21.269
 accessory even a laser sight gets 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.039
 really find that place there that makes 

00:05:21.269 --> 00:05:25.769
 a bit low knowing that one but she 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.149
 she does not wear high enough that would surprise me 

00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:28.169
 whether it is a laser viewfinder at the act 

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:30.389
 history but he will have to have some 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:31.860
 accessories if the cops takes a laser 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.599
 do not worry we'll all be in 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:38.009
 laser veil before you leave everything 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:40.169
 tiny little last info actually 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.909
 simply that a lot of people 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:44.399
 also told me I think it's true 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:46.740
 that these screenshots were taken on a 

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:48.689
 computer in ultra mode so super 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.590
 good quality all that I tell you not from 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:52.230
 all that 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.210
 often he himself will be worse than 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.160
 that's not at all that in mind I 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.870
 said that no I did not say that at all but 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.670
 just that the quality nor evil will be in 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.800
 German just slightly worse 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.990
 flying which 109 in ultra if people 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.340
 play on pc that does not turn ultra 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.570
 should find anyway just a 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.490
 less good quality that is to do 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.660
 a very good impression of the game do you 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.640
 not worry the game itself will be 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.080
 just gorgeous but it's true that the 

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.650
 screenshots no way it's always 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.660
 the same 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.130
 the escem be here they missed so 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.440
 in ultra low that is the quality 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.620
 picture beautiful parents but we 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:25.350
 find year several months 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.419
 any bad quality we'll see but 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.919
 that 's not going to be a problem I think 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:30.630
 it is well cost thank you for having 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:32.130
 watched this video if you aimed 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.210
 so is it if you still look there 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.889
 it is that you have watched it 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.380
 entirely i wanted to thank you 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:39.360
 for your support and that's for the 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.550
 older for them also the name of 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.010
 comments that I get to have by 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.110
 day also to express what I like 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.699
 you're on youtube to misplace too 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.790
 to be able to express yourself 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:52.560
 come and feel about it
