to<00:02:00.899> go<00:02:01.680> along<00:02:01.920> for<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.130> second<00:02:02.520> just<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.210> i've

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
to go along for a second just so i've

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.350 
to go along for a second just so i've
actually<00:02:03.479> got<00:02:03.750> something<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.229> record

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
actually got something to record

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.660 
actually got something to record
that<00:02:07.360> will<00:02:07.479> do<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.979> you<00:02:09.190> just<00:02:09.340> want<00:02:09.520> to<00:02:09.550> click

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
that will do and you just want to click

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.150 
that will do and you just want to click
ctrl<00:02:10.420> C<00:02:10.690> and<00:02:10.899> then<00:02:11.319> that<00:02:11.650> will<00:02:11.770> completely

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
ctrl C and then that will completely

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.970 
ctrl C and then that will completely
pause<00:02:12.430> it<00:02:13.140> now<00:02:14.140> what<00:02:14.349> you<00:02:14.410> want<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.590> do<00:02:14.709> is<00:02:14.860> go

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
pause it now what you want to do is go

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.970 
pause it now what you want to do is go
into<00:02:15.630> computer<00:02:17.190> Nexus<00:02:18.190> 5<00:02:18.400> internal<00:02:19.270> storage

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
into computer Nexus 5 internal storage

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.440 
into computer Nexus 5 internal storage
then<00:02:20.980> you<00:02:21.069> want<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.250> scroll<00:02:21.459> down<00:02:21.519> to<00:02:22.060> whatever

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
then you want to scroll down to whatever

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.949 
then you want to scroll down to whatever
you<00:02:23.050> saved<00:02:23.650> as<00:02:23.920> I<00:02:24.280> saved<00:02:24.819> its<00:02:25.000> temper<00:02:25.300> into<00:02:25.720> and

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
you saved as I saved its temper into and

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.420 
you saved as I saved its temper into and
there<00:02:28.959> there<00:02:29.440> is<00:02:29.560> another<00:02:29.890> thing<00:02:30.099> you<00:02:30.190> can<00:02:30.280> do

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
there there is another thing you can do

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.190 
there there is another thing you can do
where<00:02:30.610> you<00:02:30.730> can<00:02:30.880> change<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.269> bit<00:02:31.480> rate<00:02:31.630> where

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
where you can change the bit rate where

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.890 
where you can change the bit rate where
it<00:02:32.650> makes<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.280> file<00:02:33.489> bigger<00:02:33.849> but<00:02:34.300> it<00:02:34.450> doesn't

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
it makes the file bigger but it doesn't

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.380 
it makes the file bigger but it doesn't
also<00:02:35.140> improve<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:35.800> to<00:02:36.489> do<00:02:36.610> that<00:02:36.790> just<00:02:37.030> type<00:02:37.209> in

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
also improve it to do that just type in

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.890 
also improve it to do that just type in
adb<00:02:37.900> shell<00:02:38.430> screen<00:02:39.430> record<00:02:41.790> space<00:02:42.790> dash<00:02:43.600> dash

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.090 
adb shell screen record space dash dash
bit<00:02:44.850> dash<00:02:45.850> rate<00:02:46.330> then<00:02:47.319> you<00:02:47.410> want<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.650> type<00:02:47.890> in

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
bit dash rate then you want to type in

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.000 
bit dash rate then you want to type in
whatever<00:02:48.340> your<00:02:48.640> bitrate<00:02:48.940> is<00:02:49.000> but<00:02:49.720> for<00:02:50.560> example

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
whatever your bitrate is but for example

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.630 
whatever your bitrate is but for example
normally<00:02:51.519> it's<00:02:51.640> for<00:02:52.980> megabits<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.130> think<00:02:54.400> it<00:02:54.489> is

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
normally it's for megabits I think it is

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.490 
normally it's for megabits I think it is
so<00:02:55.450> you're<00:02:55.600> just<00:02:55.660> going<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:55.959> type<00:02:56.110> in<00:02:56.230> 8

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
so you're just going to type in 8

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.580 
so you're just going to type in 8
million<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:57.420> then<00:02:58.420> fall<00:02:58.930> /<00:02:59.340> SD<00:03:00.340> card<00:03:01.200> food<00:03:02.200> /

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:11.490

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
10 / 12 2 x's second one mp4 should be

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.370 
10 / 12 2 x's second one mp4 should be
down<00:03:11.650> here<00:03:11.680> just<00:03:12.010> played<00:03:12.450> yep<00:03:13.450> there<00:03:13.810> it<00:03:13.930> is<00:03:14.079> it

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
down here just played yep there it is it

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.400 
down here just played yep there it is it
just<00:03:14.680> plays<00:03:14.890> nicely<00:03:15.280> for<00:03:15.640> you<00:03:15.790> so<00:03:16.630> actually

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
just plays nicely for you so actually

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.900 
just plays nicely for you so actually
it's<00:03:17.709> just<00:03:17.859> I'm<00:03:18.220> going<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:18.489> try<00:03:18.670> it<00:03:18.700> in<00:03:18.820> a

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
it's just I'm going to try it in a

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.770 
it's just I'm going to try it in a
different<00:03:19.090> game<00:03:19.359> actually<00:03:19.540> just<00:03:19.870> to<00:03:20.019> show<00:03:20.230> you

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
different game actually just to show you

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.470 
different game actually just to show you
how<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:23.440> landscape<00:03:23.709> works<00:03:24.340> so<00:03:25.150> this<00:03:25.329> time

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
how the landscape works so this time

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.970 
how the landscape works so this time
I'll<00:03:25.660> put<00:03:25.870> in<00:03:26.820> asphalt

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.710 

83<00:03:31.980> dot<00:03:32.780> mp4<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:35.060> before<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.090> click<00:03:36.360> enter

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
83 dot mp4 and before you click enter

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.940 
83 dot mp4 and before you click enter
again<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:36.960> just<00:03:37.020> want<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.290> go<00:03:37.410> into<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.680> video

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
again you just want to go into the video

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.810 
again you just want to go into the video
at<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.240> app<00:03:39.420> sorry<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:40.140> open<00:03:40.980> it<00:03:41.250> up<00:03:41.370> then<00:03:41.700> you

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
at the app sorry and open it up then you

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.460 
at the app sorry and open it up then you
ready<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.090> start<00:03:42.270> recording<00:03:42.570> the<00:03:43.230> same

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
ready to start recording the same

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.620 
ready to start recording the same
applies<00:03:43.770> ctrl-c<00:03:44.580> to<00:03:44.610> get<00:03:44.970> out<00:03:45.150> of<00:03:45.240> it<00:03:45.360> but<00:03:45.570> the

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
applies ctrl-c to get out of it but the

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.120 
applies ctrl-c to get out of it but the
bitrate<00:03:45.870> does<00:03:46.260> make<00:03:46.440> a<00:03:46.470> bit<00:03:46.680> of<00:03:46.710> a<00:03:46.800> difference

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
bitrate does make a bit of a difference

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.730 
bitrate does make a bit of a difference
with<00:03:47.250> quality<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:48.120> it<00:03:48.240> seems<00:03:48.510> to<00:03:48.720> run<00:03:49.500> better

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
with quality and it seems to run better

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.890 
with quality and it seems to run better
the<00:03:50.010> file<00:03:50.190> size<00:03:50.460> is<00:03:50.520> bigger<00:03:50.970> but<00:03:51.300> there's<00:03:51.660> a

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
the file size is bigger but there's a

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.720 
the file size is bigger but there's a
bit<00:03:52.170> of<00:03:52.200> a<00:03:52.320> difference<00:03:52.710> if<00:03:53.040> you're<00:03:53.400> trying<00:03:53.640> to

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
bit of a difference if you're trying to

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.520 
bit of a difference if you're trying to
pay<00:03:53.940> attention<00:03:54.290> we<00:03:55.290> don't<00:03:55.410> want<00:03:55.590> adverse<00:03:57.530> just

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
pay attention we don't want adverse just

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.800 
pay attention we don't want adverse just
going<00:03:58.710> to<00:03:58.800> any<00:03:58.920> old<00:03:59.100> one<00:04:00.620> and<00:04:02.270> the<00:04:03.270> issue<00:04:03.510> is<00:04:03.780> is

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
going to any old one and the issue is is

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.720 
going to any old one and the issue is is
with<00:04:04.080> the<00:04:04.200> audio<00:04:04.530> you<00:04:04.710> cannot<00:04:05.100> hear<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.430> audio

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
with the audio you cannot hear the audio

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.550 
with the audio you cannot hear the audio
within<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.150> video<00:04:06.480> I'm<00:04:06.780> just<00:04:06.990> I'm<00:04:07.260> still

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
within the video I'm just I'm still

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.200 
within the video I'm just I'm still
trying<00:04:07.770> to<00:04:07.800> work<00:04:07.950> out<00:04:08.220> if<00:04:08.400> there's<00:04:08.610> a<00:04:08.790> command

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
trying to work out if there's a command

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.770 
trying to work out if there's a command
to<00:04:09.530> record<00:04:10.530> audio<00:04:10.770> along<00:04:11.340> with<00:04:11.490> it<00:04:11.670> but<00:04:12.210> it's

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
to record audio along with it but it's

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.330 
to record audio along with it but it's
not<00:04:12.900> a<00:04:12.930> lot<00:04:13.140> to<00:04:13.380> be<00:04:13.620> honest<00:04:13.800> I<00:04:13.890> will<00:04:14.010> do<00:04:14.130> for
