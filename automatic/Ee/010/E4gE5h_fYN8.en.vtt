 Hi. I'm Karen Grete from Scandinavia Today. 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.380
 I'm going to show you how to make it 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:16.290
 the Norwegian egg coffee. I enjoy coffee every day, especially in the morning 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.800
 And this is an interesting way to make coffee so I thought a few of you might like 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.290
 to do this and here we go. 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:31.890
 What you need for coffee is three tablespoons of coarse ground coffee 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.270
 three cups of boiling water. I'm going to use a whole egg, and besides that, 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:46.760
 you would like a quarter cup of cold water and you also want to chew one cup 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.920
 water. And, of course, and I have my coffee cup here. 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.390
 So, the first step is to mix coffee and egg and a little water. 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:05.630
 So, here we have the coffee, so I take three tablespoons of coffee grounds 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:16.134
 freshly ground. Like that. Well, I mix in a quarter cup of cold water. 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:33.200
 In here and I adding the whole egg. Some people add the eggshells, 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:40.160
 too. I'm not going to do it, so it's up to you if you want to. 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:49.460
 Just mix it. So if you see the water boil and I'll throw the egg 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.410
 with the coffee in there and I stir it and I turn it off. And I'm going to leave it 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:04.780
 Cook for about three minutes at a very low flame. Want to make sure you get it 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:15.460
 everything in there. And I'm told this kind of coffee is very popular 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.650
 with American-Scandinavians in the West. So this, I think, is very interesting and 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:31.710
 the coffee will be very nice. So, I'm sure you can tell that coffee 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:38.670
 soils are at the top, sticks with the egg, and the longer you cook it, 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.330
 the stronger the coffee will be. But after three minutes, I turned off the heat and 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:52.920
 I pour into a cup of cold water. And now, I'm going to leave it as for 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:04.580
 about 10 minutes and the coffee is almost done. So, the coffee grounds went to the 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:12.620
 bottom of the pot and I'm going now ... actually, I want to throw it through a 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:24.215
 sift, so I'll just do that, and then I can taste my delicious coffee. 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:40.960
 And here we have all the coffee grounds and I only have about four cups of coffee 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:51.080
 now. So, I can throw my delicious Norwegian egg coffee and I'm going to enjoy it with 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:59.140
 a piece of my Tosca cake, and I think it is going to taste really good. 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:06.680
 Here it is. Very well, has absolutely no bitterness in this coffee, 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.460
 not at all. It's a nice way to have coffee. Very pretty. That's good. 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.310
 Enjoy, and you can write to our channel. Thank you very much. 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.108

00:04:19.108 --> 00:04:23.340
 Ingredients: 1 egg 1/4 cup cold water 3 cups boiling water 1 cup cold water 3 tblsp. coarse ground coffee 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.440

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.310
