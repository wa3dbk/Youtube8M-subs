commercial helicopter that normal people

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.010 
commercial helicopter that normal people
would<00:01:53.740> get<00:01:53.920> to<00:01:54.070> fly<00:01:54.280> on<00:01:54.310> and<00:01:54.760> this<00:01:55.479> looks<00:01:55.750> kind

of like an airport it could be for a
business<00:01:57.790> or<00:01:57.970> something<00:01:58.210> else<00:01:58.479> that<00:01:58.570> doesn't

business or something else that doesn't

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.540 
business or something else that doesn't
really<00:01:59.110> matter<00:01:59.320> what<00:01:59.590> I<00:01:59.650> wanted<00:01:59.920> to<00:02:00.040> get<00:02:00.159> at<00:02:00.369> is

really matter what I wanted to get at is
that<00:02:00.580> from<00:02:01.390> these<00:02:01.510> clips<00:02:01.840> they<00:02:02.020> all<00:02:02.200> seem<00:02:02.530> to

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
that from these clips they all seem to

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.560 
that from these clips they all seem to
be<00:02:02.770> from<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.070> single<00:02:03.340> player<00:02:03.430> but<00:02:03.820> some<00:02:04.450> of

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
be from the single player but some of

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.300 
be from the single player but some of
them<00:02:04.630> I<00:02:04.780> show<00:02:05.020> weapons<00:02:05.440> and<00:02:05.680> things<00:02:05.710> that

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
them I show weapons and things that

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.710 
them I show weapons and things that
might<00:02:06.460> be<00:02:06.580> in<00:02:06.640> multiplayer<00:02:07.060> and<00:02:07.270> this<00:02:07.420> is<00:02:07.570> one

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
might be in multiplayer and this is one

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.330 
might be in multiplayer and this is one
of<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:07.900> things<00:02:08.110> that<00:02:08.320> i<00:02:08.350> do<00:02:08.560> not<00:02:08.920> think<00:02:08.979> we'll

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
of the things that i do not think we'll

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.580 
of the things that i do not think we'll
be<00:02:09.369> in<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.670> multiplayer<00:02:10.149> now<00:02:10.840> feels<00:02:11.080> kind<00:02:11.560> of

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
be in the multiplayer now feels kind of

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.740 
be in the multiplayer now feels kind of
a<00:02:11.680> battlefield<00:02:12.010> type<00:02:12.370> of<00:02:12.550> trailer<00:02:12.760> I<00:02:12.910> could<00:02:13.420> go

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
a battlefield type of trailer I could go

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.720 
a battlefield type of trailer I could go
that<00:02:14.050> it<00:02:14.410> could<00:02:14.680> be<00:02:14.800> in<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:14.920> multiplayer<00:02:15.370> and

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
that it could be in the multiplayer and

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.030 
that it could be in the multiplayer and
single<00:02:16.060> player<00:02:16.240> but<00:02:16.959> we'll<00:02:17.590> probably<00:02:17.800> see

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
single player but we'll probably see

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.190 
single player but we'll probably see
other<00:02:18.250> flying<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:19.000> gadgets<00:02:19.510> type<00:02:19.660> things<00:02:19.959> in

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
other flying and gadgets type things in

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.479 
other flying and gadgets type things in
this<00:02:20.350> trailer<00:02:20.650> that<00:02:20.980> are<00:02:21.100> going<00:02:21.220> to<00:02:21.280> be<00:02:21.400> in

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
this trailer that are going to be in

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.030 
this trailer that are going to be in
multiplayer<00:02:21.910> too<00:02:22.270> but<00:02:22.989> this<00:02:23.230> one<00:02:23.470> in<00:02:23.680> my

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
multiplayer too but this one in my

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:31.630 
multiplayer too but this one in my
opinion<00:02:24.340> will<00:02:24.640> probably<00:02:25.390> not<00:02:25.570> be<00:02:26.670> strong

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.030 

weaker

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
weaker

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.140 
weaker
so<00:02:35.040> here<00:02:35.190> we<00:02:35.250> get<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.550> see<00:02:35.670> one<00:02:35.820> of<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:35.970> cool

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
so here we get to see one of the cool

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.910 
so here we get to see one of the cool
gadgets<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:37.140> is<00:02:37.350> one<00:02:37.530> that<00:02:37.680> I'm<00:02:37.800> going

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
gadgets and this is one that I'm going

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.080 
gadgets and this is one that I'm going
to<00:02:38.010> say<00:02:38.130> that's<00:02:38.250> going<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.490> be<00:02:38.580> in<00:02:38.670> multiplayer

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
to say that's going to be in multiplayer

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.690 
to say that's going to be in multiplayer
this<00:02:39.660> was<00:02:39.840> featured<00:02:40.200> in<00:02:40.410> one<00:02:40.500> of<00:02:40.740> FPS<00:02:41.250> Russia's

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
this was featured in one of FPS Russia's

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.230 
this was featured in one of FPS Russia's
more<00:02:42.300> recent<00:02:43.050> videos<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:44.490> a<00:02:44.700> quadrocopter

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
more recent videos it is a quadrocopter

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.330 
more recent videos it is a quadrocopter
with<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.840> machine<00:02:46.500> gun<00:02:46.560> on<00:02:46.830> it<00:02:46.980> that's<00:02:47.160> got

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
with a machine gun on it that's got

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.950 
with a machine gun on it that's got
video<00:02:47.850> surveillance<00:02:48.210> I'm<00:02:48.540> guessing<00:02:48.840> it's

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
video surveillance I'm guessing it's

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.240 
video surveillance I'm guessing it's
probably<00:02:49.140> going<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.710> be<00:02:49.800> a<00:02:49.860> killstreak

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
probably going to be a killstreak

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.250 
probably going to be a killstreak
otherwise<00:02:50.820> in<00:02:51.330> my<00:02:51.510> opinion<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:52.050> will<00:02:52.140> be

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
otherwise in my opinion it will be

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.290 
otherwise in my opinion it will be
overpowered<00:02:52.920> but<00:02:53.520> this<00:02:53.640> thing<00:02:53.910> looks<00:02:54.090> epic

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
overpowered but this thing looks epic

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.090 
overpowered but this thing looks epic
and<00:02:54.810> it's<00:02:55.080> going<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.230> be<00:02:55.380> used<00:02:55.590> in<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:55.890> lot<00:02:56.040> of

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
and it's going to be used in a lot of

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.290 
and it's going to be used in a lot of
tactical<00:02:56.640> situations

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:08.330 

computers<00:03:03.210> no<00:03:04.210> bats

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.990 

barneys<00:03:09.510> no<00:03:10.510> one<00:03:10.750> yeah<00:03:11.490> here<00:03:12.490> we<00:03:12.610> get<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.820> see<00:03:12.970> a

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
barneys no one yeah here we get to see a

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000 
barneys no one yeah here we get to see a
full<00:03:13.300> on<00:03:13.540> battle<00:03:13.750> taking<00:03:14.140> place<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:14.770> as<00:03:14.890> you

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
full on battle taking place and as you

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.470 
full on battle taking place and as you
can<00:03:15.130> see<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.400> quadric<00:03:15.760> captors<00:03:16.090> are<00:03:16.210> up<00:03:16.360> in

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
can see the quadric captors are up in

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.690 
can see the quadric captors are up in
the<00:03:16.570> sky<00:03:16.810> in<00:03:17.140> the<00:03:17.200> background<00:03:17.410> this<00:03:18.250> does<00:03:18.520> look

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
the sky in the background this does look

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.370 
the sky in the background this does look
like<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:18.970> multiplayer<00:03:19.540> clip<00:03:19.840> to<00:03:19.990> me<00:03:20.110> just

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
like a multiplayer clip to me just

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.810 
like a multiplayer clip to me just
because<00:03:20.530> of<00:03:20.830> how<00:03:20.950> many<00:03:21.010> were<00:03:21.280> there<00:03:21.310> are<00:03:21.610> and

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
because of how many were there are and

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.510 
because of how many were there are and
how<00:03:22.300> the<00:03:22.360> position<00:03:22.900> maybe<00:03:23.170> it's<00:03:23.890> not<00:03:24.100> maybe<00:03:24.280> it

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
how the position maybe it's not maybe it

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.830 
how the position maybe it's not maybe it
is<00:03:24.640> doesn't<00:03:25.030> really<00:03:25.150> matter<00:03:25.390> but<00:03:25.690> these

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
is doesn't really matter but these

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.330 
is doesn't really matter but these
little<00:03:25.960> tanks<00:03:26.440> in<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.740> front<00:03:27.010> these<00:03:27.130> little

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
little tanks in the front these little

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.160 
little tanks in the front these little
mini<00:03:27.580> turrent<00:03:28.030> tanks<00:03:28.480> are<00:03:28.660> probably<00:03:28.960> going<00:03:29.080> to

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
mini turrent tanks are probably going to

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.040 
mini turrent tanks are probably going to
be<00:03:29.260> able<00:03:29.320> to<00:03:29.470> drive<00:03:29.680> like<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.580> RC<00:03:30.940> car<00:03:31.050> but

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
be able to drive like the RC car but

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.350 
be able to drive like the RC car but
they've<00:03:32.620> got<00:03:32.650> huge<00:03:33.100> machine<00:03:33.610> guns<00:03:33.790> on<00:03:33.940> them<00:03:34.090> so

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
they've got huge machine guns on them so

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.000 
they've got huge machine guns on them so
this<00:03:34.690> is<00:03:34.840> going<00:03:34.990> to<00:03:35.050> be<00:03:35.140> really<00:03:35.380> fun<00:03:35.590> to<00:03:35.620> use<00:03:35.830> I

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
this is going to be really fun to use I

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.680 
this is going to be really fun to use I
think<00:03:36.280> and<00:03:36.550> it's<00:03:36.910> going<00:03:37.030> to<00:03:37.120> be<00:03:37.330> quite

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
think and it's going to be quite

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.970 
think and it's going to be quite
interesting<00:03:38.320> seeing<00:03:38.590> them<00:03:38.770> on<00:03:38.860> the

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
interesting seeing them on the

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.520 
interesting seeing them on the
battlefield<00:03:39.430> yes<00:03:40.110> alright<00:03:41.110> so<00:03:41.260> we've<00:03:41.410> seen

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
battlefield yes alright so we've seen

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.660 
battlefield yes alright so we've seen
this<00:03:41.650> a<00:03:41.709> couple<00:03:41.920> times<00:03:42.070> in<00:03:42.340> this<00:03:42.430> trailer

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
this a couple times in this trailer

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.580 
this a couple times in this trailer
already<00:03:43.090> but<00:03:43.330> this<00:03:43.480> looks<00:03:43.630> like<00:03:43.810> a<00:03:44.020> battle

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
already but this looks like a battle

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.710 
already but this looks like a battle
Walker<00:03:44.830> type<00:03:45.610> of<00:03:45.760> thing<00:03:46.000> and<00:03:46.270> I<00:03:46.480> say<00:03:46.690> that

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
Walker type of thing and I say that

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.170 
Walker type of thing and I say that
because<00:03:46.959> battlefield<00:03:47.680> 2142<00:03:48.070> is<00:03:48.760> just<00:03:49.000> kind<00:03:49.150> of

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
because battlefield 2142 is just kind of

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.460 
because battlefield 2142 is just kind of
a<00:03:49.300> reference<00:03:49.660> game<00:03:49.900> because<00:03:50.260> it<00:03:50.380> was

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
a reference game because it was

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.979 
a reference game because it was
futuristic<00:03:50.800> also<00:03:51.400> this<00:03:52.030> it<00:03:52.480> was<00:03:52.630> a<00:03:52.660> lot<00:03:52.840> bigger

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
futuristic also this it was a lot bigger

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.080 
futuristic also this it was a lot bigger
in<00:03:53.200> that<00:03:53.320> game<00:03:53.650> but<00:03:53.890> this<00:03:54.040> looks<00:03:54.400> similar<00:03:54.850> it's

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
in that game but this looks similar it's

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.300 
in that game but this looks similar it's
just<00:03:55.360> kind<00:03:55.870> of<00:03:55.900> a<00:03:56.020> walking<00:03:56.380> type<00:03:56.620> robot<00:03:57.100> with

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
just kind of a walking type robot with

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.250 
just kind of a walking type robot with
tons<00:03:57.610> of<00:03:57.700> guns<00:03:57.850> on<00:03:58.090> it<00:03:58.239> this<00:03:58.660> to<00:03:58.870> me<00:03:59.020> would<00:03:59.230> be

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
tons of guns on it this to me would be

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.900 
tons of guns on it this to me would be
best<00:03:59.560> suited<00:03:59.770> as<00:04:00.040> a<00:04:00.070> kill<00:04:00.340> streak<00:04:00.459> that<00:04:00.760> you

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
best suited as a kill streak that you

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.270 
best suited as a kill streak that you
would<00:04:01.030> deploy<00:04:01.390> in<00:04:01.600> and<00:04:01.840> either<00:04:02.530> it<00:04:02.890> would<00:04:03.100> be

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
would deploy in and either it would be

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.510 
would deploy in and either it would be
destroyed<00:04:04.000> by<00:04:04.570> users<00:04:05.110> or<00:04:05.380> just<00:04:05.770> roam<00:04:06.489> around

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
destroyed by users or just roam around

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.699 
destroyed by users or just roam around
for<00:04:07.180> a<00:04:07.209> certain<00:04:07.510> amount<00:04:07.570> of<00:04:07.810> time<00:04:07.989> like<00:04:08.260> a<00:04:08.290> pea

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
for a certain amount of time like a pea

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.740 
for a certain amount of time like a pea
or<00:04:08.890> chopper<00:04:09.370> gunner<00:04:09.610> type<00:04:09.820> of<00:04:09.970> thing<00:04:10.180> and<00:04:10.690> I

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
or chopper gunner type of thing and I

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.180 
or chopper gunner type of thing and I
think<00:04:11.020> it<00:04:11.140> would<00:04:11.440> be<00:04:11.530> really<00:04:11.680> cool<00:04:11.830> as<00:04:12.100> it

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
think it would be really cool as it

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.070 
think it would be really cool as it
kills<00:04:12.370> treat<00:04:12.640> but<00:04:12.910> it<00:04:13.120> might<00:04:13.420> be<00:04:13.570> overpowered

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
kills treat but it might be overpowered

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.660 
kills treat but it might be overpowered
but<00:04:14.739> they're<00:04:14.950> gonna<00:04:15.040> have<00:04:15.250> to<00:04:15.280> work<00:04:15.459> on<00:04:15.640> that

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
but they're gonna have to work on that

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:16.650 
but they're gonna have to work on that
and<00:04:15.910> they'll<00:04:16.030> probably<00:04:16.209> do<00:04:16.390> a<00:04:16.450> good<00:04:16.600> job

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
and they'll probably do a good job

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.509 
and they'll probably do a good job
Treyarch<00:04:17.290> has<00:04:17.350> done<00:04:17.739> that<00:04:17.919> well<00:04:18.130> in<00:04:18.430> the

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
Treyarch has done that well in the

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.060 
Treyarch has done that well in the
previous<00:04:19.000> black<00:04:19.359> ops<00:04:19.600> so<00:04:19.870> this<00:04:20.590> looks<00:04:20.769> really

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
previous black ops so this looks really

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.740 
previous black ops so this looks really
awesome<00:04:22.530> what<00:04:23.530> happens<00:04:24.210> when<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:25.390> enemy

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
awesome what happens when the enemy

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.210 
awesome what happens when the enemy
steals<00:04:26.110> the<00:04:26.290> keys

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.840 

things<00:04:32.820> they<00:04:33.150> built<00:04:33.510> keep<00:04:34.260> us<00:04:34.500> safer<00:04:35.010> all

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
things they built keep us safer all

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:36.800 
things they built keep us safer all
right<00:04:35.940> so<00:04:36.120> as<00:04:36.150> you<00:04:36.360> can<00:04:36.480> see<00:04:36.630> in<00:04:36.720> the

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
right so as you can see in the

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.660 
right so as you can see in the
screenshot<00:04:37.320> you<00:04:37.500> are<00:04:37.680> inside<00:04:38.160> of<00:04:38.220> the<00:04:38.460> cockpit

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
screenshot you are inside of the cockpit

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.880 
screenshot you are inside of the cockpit
of<00:04:39.000> a<00:04:39.270> one<00:04:39.510> of<00:04:39.630> these<00:04:39.720> fighter<00:04:39.990> jets<00:04:40.290> and<00:04:40.530> i

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
of a one of these fighter jets and i

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.830 
of a one of these fighter jets and i
know<00:04:41.160> i<00:04:41.250> said<00:04:41.370> before<00:04:41.580> it's<00:04:42.120> call<00:04:42.510> of<00:04:42.630> duty

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
know i said before it's call of duty

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.450 
know i said before it's call of duty
isn't<00:04:42.990> really<00:04:43.380> a<00:04:43.410> game<00:04:43.710> for<00:04:43.980> these<00:04:44.220> type<00:04:44.430> of

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
isn't really a game for these type of

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.220 
isn't really a game for these type of
things<00:04:44.610> but<00:04:44.940> this<00:04:45.450> could<00:04:45.660> be<00:04:45.750> single<00:04:46.050> player

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
things but this could be single player

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.830 
things but this could be single player
and<00:04:46.260> it<00:04:47.190> looks<00:04:47.400> fun<00:04:47.700> and<00:04:48.000> it's<00:04:48.150> probably<00:04:48.540> not

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
and it looks fun and it's probably not

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.870 
and it looks fun and it's probably not
going<00:04:48.990> to<00:04:49.050> be<00:04:49.140> full<00:04:49.620> free<00:04:49.980> range<00:04:50.220> flying

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
going to be full free range flying

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.390 
going to be full free range flying
around<00:04:51.150> but<00:04:51.540> either<00:04:51.750> way<00:04:52.020> it<00:04:52.050> looks<00:04:52.530> epic<00:04:52.770> with

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
around but either way it looks epic with

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.370 
around but either way it looks epic with
the<00:04:53.520> explosions<00:04:54.150> the<00:04:54.360> fast-paced<00:04:54.720> Jets<00:04:55.170> and
