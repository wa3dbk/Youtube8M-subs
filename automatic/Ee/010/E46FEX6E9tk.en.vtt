00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 we can count on that rebecca not us 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.250
 attack seriously because vampires are 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.769
 very reliable bus 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.070
 well you have a serious reason that it may be 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.560
 bothers with klaus but it's her brother who 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.490
 by the way cheated her killed her mom and 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.580
 your brothers 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.830
 ready the killed logos many things can 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.600
 go wrong with the plan too many 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.930
 people who can fail for that 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.359
 formulate a secret contingency plan 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.560
 cancer and peaks you say you no longer 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.560
 it would be true secret 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.780
 in this hand tie you have ties 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.130
 I'm 162 years old and I'm going to a dance 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.610
 school 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:47.910
 I need a better one do not go I should 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.629
 protect you and think about your story with 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.250
 the dances is very tragic with my luck 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.150
 I assure you that even the dance queen 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.150
 I would kill you 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.250
 I do not know how to do it to the full dimension if 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.659
 this exploits us above remember that 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.659
 Only I can heal fast 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.200
 please tell me you have better plans 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.960
 that grenade killers do not worry 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.140
 brother the less you know better then my 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.840
 freedom of klaus depends on you 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.530
 two run a perfect plan so 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.610
 excuse me if I'm somewhat cynical you are 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.610
 who should worry 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.210
 yes klaus asks you correctly the 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.119
 plan collapses 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.299
 I understand the concern but it is seen in 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.340
 the list of flaws in the epic plans 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.130
 they are usually because someone lets 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:49.119
 his humanity interfere and if you want 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:52.070
 bet on what's going to happen I do not think 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:56.740
 I'm going to be the one who collapses 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.740
 Then we'll see each other at the dance. I'll love it
