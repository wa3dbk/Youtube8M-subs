00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
a bunch of different hair shade so you

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.750 
a bunch of different hair shade so you
definitely<00:00:45.059> match<00:00:45.600> them<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.930> your<00:00:46.050> hair<00:00:46.260> and

definitely match them to your hair and
to<00:00:47.760> react<00:00:48.059> them<00:00:48.210> because<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:48.629> not<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:49.140> the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
to react them because it's not just the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.930 
to react them because it's not just the
bangs<00:00:49.469> my<00:00:49.860> hats<00:00:50.070> all<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.430> little<00:00:50.670> part<00:00:50.879> here

bangs my hats all the little part here

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.040 
bangs my hats all the little part here
so<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.239> looks<00:00:51.360> like<00:00:51.420> it'll<00:00:51.629> blend<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:51.960> with

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050
