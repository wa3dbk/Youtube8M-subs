our<00:00:07.550> other<00:00:07.880> Conrad<00:00:08.450> videos<00:00:08.900> have<00:00:09.260> had<00:00:09.410> tons

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
our other Conrad videos have had tons

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.290 
our other Conrad videos have had tons
and<00:00:09.920> tons<00:00:09.950> of<00:00:10.250> views<00:00:10.519> so<00:00:10.790> I<00:00:10.820> thought<00:00:11.090> at<00:00:11.269> that

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:11.300 
and tons of views so I thought at that

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.810 
and tons of views so I thought at that
time<00:00:11.450> that<00:00:11.930> we<00:00:12.019> updated<00:00:12.380> some<00:00:13.250> information

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
time that we updated some information

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.160 
time that we updated some information
that<00:00:13.970> we've<00:00:14.059> got<00:00:14.240> out<00:00:14.390> there<00:00:14.570> who<00:00:14.750> garden<00:00:15.080> to

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
that we've got out there who garden to

there<00:00:41.989> was<00:00:42.110> problems<00:00:42.500> so<00:00:43.040> they<00:00:43.160> addressed<00:00:43.520> it

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
there was problems so they addressed it

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.299 
there was problems so they addressed it
our<00:00:44.600> most<00:00:44.899> common<00:00:45.410> and<00:00:45.530> popular<00:00:45.620> con<00:00:46.040> rod<00:00:46.190> is

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
our most common and popular con rod is

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.790 
our most common and popular con rod is
the<00:00:46.460> Superleggera<00:00:46.930> this<00:00:47.930> is<00:00:48.110> a<00:00:48.140> rod<00:00:48.649> that

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
the Superleggera this is a rod that

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.799 
the Superleggera this is a rod that
there's<00:00:49.010> a<00:00:49.070> HBM<00:00:49.520> construction<00:00:50.180> it<00:00:50.600> weighs

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
there's a HBM construction it weighs

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:52.869 
there's a HBM construction it weighs
around<00:00:50.960> about<00:00:51.170> 620<00:00:51.920> grams<00:00:52.190> so<00:00:52.520> it's<00:00:52.550> quite<00:00:52.820> a

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
around about 620 grams so it's quite a

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.600 
around about 620 grams so it's quite a
light<00:00:53.120> right<00:00:53.360> hence<00:00:53.989> the<00:00:54.140> name<00:00:54.460> and<00:00:55.460> has

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
light right hence the name and has

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.100 
light right hence the name and has
pressurized<00:00:56.030> oil<00:00:56.210> feed<00:00:56.480> up<00:00:56.600> to<00:00:56.719> the<00:00:56.809> gudgeon

00:01:17.019 --> 00:01:17.029 
street talk of Conroy which is a rod

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:18.760 
street talk of Conroy which is a rod
that<00:01:17.179> we've<00:01:17.299> released<00:01:17.779> for<00:01:18.170> engines<00:01:18.499> up<00:01:18.649> to

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
that we've released for engines up to

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.459 
that we've released for engines up to
the<00:01:18.889> sort<00:01:19.159> of<00:01:19.219> 500<00:01:19.700> 550<00:01:20.270> kilowatt<00:01:20.779> range<00:01:21.020> it's

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
the sort of 500 550 kilowatt range it's

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:23.379 
the sort of 500 550 kilowatt range it's
a<00:01:21.590> cheaper<00:01:21.950> Conrad<00:01:22.279> to<00:01:22.429> manufacture<00:01:23.029> it's

00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:23.389 
a cheaper Conrad to manufacture it's

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:25.059 
a cheaper Conrad to manufacture it's
obviously<00:01:23.689> cheaper<00:01:24.079> to<00:01:24.170> sell<00:01:24.409> there<00:01:24.829> under

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:25.069 
obviously cheaper to sell there under

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:26.529 
obviously cheaper to sell there under

under nine hundred dollars a set

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:28.539 
under nine hundred dollars a set
including<00:01:27.139> ARP<00:01:27.529> bolts<00:01:27.889> so<00:01:28.249> they're<00:01:28.369> quite<00:01:28.520> a

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
including ARP bolts so they're quite a

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.580
