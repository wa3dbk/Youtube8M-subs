radiator<00:00:16.740> for<00:00:17.100> now<00:00:17.390> got<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.420> wiring<00:00:18.690> harness

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
radiator for now got a wiring harness

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.109 
radiator for now got a wiring harness
kind<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.380> hooked<00:00:19.529> up<00:00:19.710> here<00:00:20.779> micron<00:00:21.779> pipe<00:00:22.050> and

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
kind of hooked up here micron pipe and

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.670 
kind of hooked up here micron pipe and
let's<00:00:24.119> see<00:00:24.330> if<00:00:24.420> we<00:00:24.510> can<00:00:24.660> get<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.840> running<00:00:24.990> there

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
let's see if we can get it running there

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.009 
let's see if we can get it running there
we<00:00:25.830> go<00:00:25.980> he's<00:00:26.460> on<00:00:26.699> all<00:00:27.590> right<00:00:29.810> weird<00:00:30.810> blue

heads have been HRC ported I took the
heads<00:05:14.830> and<00:05:16.410> the<00:05:18.930> original<00:05:19.930> valves<00:05:20.410> in<00:05:20.590> it<00:05:20.740> were

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
heads and the original valves in it were

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.820 
heads and the original valves in it were
pretty<00:05:22.570> worn

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
pretty worn

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:31.830

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
valves with a different back cut angle

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.970 
valves with a different back cut angle
and<00:05:36.120> we<00:05:37.120> set<00:05:37.360> them<00:05:37.480> up<00:05:37.690> in<00:05:37.840> there<00:05:38.110> there's<00:05:38.560> been

00:05:59.530 --> 00:05:59.540 
let's see well but the Rings piston ring

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.410 
let's see well but the Rings piston ring
system<00:05:59.930> rings<00:06:00.140> mr.<00:06:00.830> ring<00:06:01.160> the<00:06:01.550> Pistons<00:06:02.180> and

system rings mr. ring the Pistons and

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.080 
system rings mr. ring the Pistons and
piston<00:06:02.810> rings<00:06:03.050> are<00:06:03.230> fresh<00:06:03.560> in<00:06:03.770> it<00:06:03.950> so<00:06:04.400> HRC

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
piston rings are fresh in it so HRC

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:11.380 
piston rings are fresh in it so HRC
there<00:06:05.330> you're<00:06:05.660> in<00:06:05.690> good<00:06:05.930> shape<00:06:05.990> yeah<00:06:10.270> and<00:06:11.270> what
