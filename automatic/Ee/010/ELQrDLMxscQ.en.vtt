different for each one let's say this
headrest<00:02:10.420> monitor<00:02:10.989> was<00:02:11.140> on<00:02:11.260> channel<00:02:11.770> a<00:02:11.890> for

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
headrest monitor was on channel a for

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.240 
headrest monitor was on channel a for
the<00:02:12.610> for<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.120> for<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.630> audio<00:02:13.989> the<00:02:14.739> headphones

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
the for the for the audio the headphones

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.910 
the for the for the audio the headphones
would<00:02:15.880> be<00:02:16.030> also<00:02:16.209> on<00:02:16.480> Channel<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:17.080> so<00:02:17.620> this

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
would be also on Channel a so this

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.640 
would be also on Channel a so this
headphone<00:02:18.280> would<00:02:18.489> only<00:02:18.730> hear<00:02:19.030> this<00:02:19.300> headrest

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
headphone would only hear this headrest

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.290 
headphone would only hear this headrest
this<00:02:20.650> unit<00:02:21.220> would<00:02:21.280> also<00:02:21.459> be<00:02:21.730> on<00:02:21.850> channel<00:02:22.180> would

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
this unit would also be on channel would

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.720 
this unit would also be on channel would
then<00:02:22.450> be<00:02:22.569> on<00:02:22.690> child<00:02:22.930> B<00:02:23.260> so<00:02:23.950> this<00:02:24.190> headphones

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
then be on child B so this headphones

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.850 
then be on child B so this headphones
would<00:02:25.060> listen<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.540> this<00:02:25.690> headrest<00:02:26.200> on<00:02:26.380> channel
