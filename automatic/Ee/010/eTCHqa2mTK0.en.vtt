00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
study efforts here we found three basic

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.240 
study efforts here we found three basic
conclusions<00:01:04.160> one<00:01:04.519> is<00:01:04.850> that<00:01:05.860> high-speed<00:01:06.860> rail

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
conclusions one is that high-speed rail

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.390 
conclusions one is that high-speed rail
in<00:01:07.580> the<00:01:07.670> Northeast<00:01:08.120> is<00:01:08.630> feasible<00:01:09.470> from<00:01:10.310> a

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
in the Northeast is feasible from a

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.520 
in the Northeast is feasible from a
technical<00:01:10.580> perspective<00:01:10.970> we<00:01:11.930> today<00:01:12.230> already

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
technical perspective we today already

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.860 
technical perspective we today already
have<00:01:12.830> high-speed<00:01:12.980> services<00:01:13.640> are<00:01:13.910> 150<00:01:14.570> ml<00:01:14.720> and

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
have high-speed services are 150 ml and

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.960 
have high-speed services are 150 ml and
our<00:01:14.990> cell<00:01:15.229> service<00:01:15.530> has<00:01:15.800> proved<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:16.580> basic

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
our cell service has proved the basic

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.410 
our cell service has proved the basic
concept<00:01:17.570> here<00:01:18.320> and<00:01:18.760> developing<00:01:19.760> new

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
concept here and developing new

dedicated alignment and expanding on
high-speed<00:01:22.790> service<00:01:23.119> is<00:01:23.510> something<00:01:23.869> that<00:01:24.020> we

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
high-speed service is something that we

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.850 
high-speed service is something that we

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
think is feasible and and that we can

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.940 
think is feasible and and that we can
