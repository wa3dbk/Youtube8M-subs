00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:06.160
 hello girls today I bring you this look that 

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:09.309
 I hope you like it and it's a bit like 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.809
 that red and good to me I liked it because in 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.849
 actually I'm almost never using 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:19.109
 this is red lip and good in my 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:22.000
 eyes use carry what I used and 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.400
 Well I hope you like this video that is 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.919
 a little flashy and leave your 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.550
 comments I will use this fill 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.550
 of relationship 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.050
 in the whole area of oil 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.949
 now I'm going to use this concealer 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.500
 mac in all the output of the dark circles is 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:45.420
 the 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.420
 in that 2013 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:56.140
 and now with the 688 broach 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.140
 we say here we go 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.840
 and very slow 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.320
 all these red areas also 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.140
 once it blends well let's put the 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:24.100
 base use the 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:24.100
 110,000 and clear with the 85 f 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.690
 Two types of powders or are the 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.630
 loose powder compact powders the 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:50.170
 simple loose powders are to seal 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.270
 in makeup and the compact ones is for 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.420
 retouch so do not go to 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:59.299
 confuse 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.299
 and let's put a little bit of this 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.880
 your skin news 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.460
 with the cndh 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.170
 between thirty and five tenths in all the 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.460
 part 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.440
 hole 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:19.570
 and we do not want to run all that 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.570
 If you do not get to notice 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:29.310
 once placed everything in the part 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.310
 of the proofreader we are going to place 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.860
 with the f 30 tenths for all 13 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:47.090
 this time I will use the color 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:49.150
 tattoo at number 30 is my great art 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.959
 grenet ciborium 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:56.349
 and what we have to do is put it in 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:59.590
 all the eyelid mobile so that this 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:02.799
 be fixed well and then with the yolk of the 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:06.220
 fingers we blur it so that it does not 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.379
 see that ugly line now let's put a 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.080
 darker color to give us a 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:13.690
 a little more depth 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.810
 I'm using the naked paddle 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.660
 original 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.660
 and like before we blur 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:28.810
 in this case I'm going to put on my eyelashes 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.290
 false are very large 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.790
 what are you like you have crossed is like this 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.180
 let's make them mix with 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.180
 our tabs and respond from this 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.060
 turn 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.620
 on burning 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:48.290
 number 110 did better by appearing another 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.380
 but for while it dries we're going to 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.590
 make the mouth and the base pose as they can 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.340
 watch 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.340
 we will see 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.590
 as you can see and this I do not think it's 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.590
 magnet 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:30.510
 you want it if you do not record 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.510
 you have to dare to use and then 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.970
 and that's the end I hope there's 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:41.250
 liked a lot and we are seeing ourselves in a 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.250
 next video chao
