like<00:04:45.020> your<00:04:45.139> hydration<00:04:45.530> bladder<00:04:45.800> tube<00:04:46.250> fit

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
like your hydration bladder tube fit

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.610 
like your hydration bladder tube fit
right<00:04:47.090> on<00:04:47.300> here<00:04:47.600> but<00:04:47.780> you<00:04:47.870> can<00:04:48.020> use<00:04:48.050> one<00:04:48.470> of<00:04:48.560> the

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
right on here but you can use one of the

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.219 
right on here but you can use one of the
large<00:04:48.889> water<00:04:49.610> bladders<00:04:50.240> that<00:04:50.270> has<00:04:50.600> a<00:04:50.630> tube<00:04:50.930> and

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
large water bladders that has a tube and

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:53.080 
large water bladders that has a tube and
connect<00:04:51.800> it<00:04:51.950> right<00:04:52.160> in<00:04:52.340> here<00:04:52.610> and<00:04:52.820> that'll

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
connect it right in here and that'll

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.480 
connect it right in here and that'll
allow<00:04:53.150> it<00:04:53.450> to<00:04:53.570> drip<00:04:53.810> out<00:04:54.020> so<00:04:54.680> there<00:04:55.190> are<00:04:55.250> just<00:04:55.370> a

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
allow it to drip out so there are just a

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.830 
allow it to drip out so there are just a
lot<00:04:55.520> of<00:04:55.880> different<00:04:56.150> features<00:04:56.330> this<00:04:56.630> was

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
lot of different features this was

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.650 
lot of different features this was
designed<00:04:57.320> to<00:04:57.500> me<00:04:57.740> very<00:04:58.160> well<00:04:58.460> and<00:04:58.820> really<00:04:59.180> in<00:04:59.599> a

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
designed to me very well and really in a

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.839 
designed to me very well and really in a
survival<00:05:00.050> situation<00:05:00.289> that<00:05:01.220> is<00:05:01.340> extremely

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
survival situation that is extremely

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.810 
survival situation that is extremely
important<00:05:02.479> to<00:05:02.539> be<00:05:02.570> very<00:05:02.870> adaptable<00:05:03.380> its<00:05:03.979> 7.1

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
important to be very adaptable its 7.1

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.810

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.540 
inches in length its 1.4 inches in
diameter<00:05:08.210> so<00:05:09.020> it's<00:05:09.169> really<00:05:09.410> compact<00:05:09.889> and<00:05:10.280> it

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
diameter so it's really compact and it

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.690

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.370 
can filter a thousand liters or 250
gallons<00:05:14.090> of<00:05:14.210> water<00:05:14.419> before<00:05:14.990> you<00:05:15.229> need<00:05:15.320> to

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
gallons of water before you need to

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.960

change the filter of course the

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.000 
change the filter of course the
pre-filter<00:05:17.570> is<00:05:17.750> gonna<00:05:17.990> get<00:05:18.110> dirty<00:05:18.320> and<00:05:18.740> you

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
pre-filter is gonna get dirty and you

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.190 
pre-filter is gonna get dirty and you
should<00:05:19.220> keep<00:05:19.370> this<00:05:19.580> clean<00:05:19.970> but<00:05:20.750> if<00:05:20.900> you<00:05:21.020> do

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
should keep this clean but if you do

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.170 
should keep this clean but if you do
need<00:05:21.380> another<00:05:21.530> one<00:05:21.889> they<00:05:22.460> also<00:05:22.789> come<00:05:23.150> with

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
was an ace HTF situation or let's just

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.040 
was an ace HTF situation or let's just
say<00:06:16.009> it's<00:06:16.159> a<00:06:16.250> hurricane<00:06:16.699> because<00:06:17.360> of<00:06:17.659> all<00:06:17.870> the

00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:20.689 
pesticides all the fuels and gasolines

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:22.209 
pesticides all the fuels and gasolines
and<00:06:20.870> chemicals<00:06:21.379> and<00:06:21.530> everything<00:06:21.830> else<00:06:21.979> that

are<00:06:22.310> going<00:06:22.400> to<00:06:22.490> be<00:06:23.379> contaminating<00:06:24.379> all<00:06:24.530> areas

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 
are going to be contaminating all areas

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.070 
are going to be contaminating all areas
you<00:06:26.060> know<00:06:26.150> with<00:06:26.300> things<00:06:26.509> being<00:06:26.689> blown<00:06:26.930> around

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
you know with things being blown around

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.019 
you know with things being blown around
so<00:06:27.530> that<00:06:27.560> is<00:06:27.860> one<00:06:28.159> thing<00:06:28.370> to<00:06:28.400> really<00:06:28.729> consider

00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:29.029 
so that is one thing to really consider

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:31.240 
so that is one thing to really consider
especially<00:06:29.300> in<00:06:29.659> an<00:06:29.750> urban<00:06:30.020> environment<00:06:30.379> is

things about the Berkey sport which I
like<00:06:37.430> the<00:06:37.580> Berkey<00:06:37.849> sport<00:06:38.150> and<00:06:38.240> I<00:06:38.270> have<00:06:38.360> a

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:38.389 
like the Berkey sport and I have a

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:40.179 
like the Berkey sport and I have a
number<00:06:38.629> of<00:06:38.750> them<00:06:38.960> they<00:06:39.259> are<00:06:39.289> really

00:06:40.179 --> 00:06:40.189 
number of them they are really

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:41.830 
number of them they are really
exceptional<00:06:40.639> and<00:06:41.060> they<00:06:41.150> take<00:06:41.389> care<00:06:41.419> of

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 
exceptional and they take care of

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.869 
exceptional and they take care of
anything<00:06:42.830> you<00:06:42.919> can<00:06:43.069> imagine<00:06:43.159> but<00:06:43.699> the<00:06:43.759> one

00:06:43.869 --> 00:06:43.879 
anything you can imagine but the one

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:45.399 
anything you can imagine but the one
thing<00:06:44.000> about<00:06:44.029> their<00:06:44.330> a<00:06:44.360> no-vote<00:06:44.509> Rio<00:06:44.900> is<00:06:45.169> that

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:45.409 
thing about their a no-vote Rio is that

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:47.800 
thing about their a no-vote Rio is that
it<00:06:45.500> does<00:06:45.680> last<00:06:46.009> quite<00:06:46.250> a<00:06:46.490> bit<00:06:46.669> longer<00:06:46.909> so

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 
it does last quite a bit longer so

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.420 
it does last quite a bit longer so
you're<00:06:48.080> going<00:06:48.199> to<00:06:48.229> be<00:06:48.349> able<00:06:48.439> to<00:06:48.560> use<00:06:48.740> this<00:06:48.919> way

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
you're going to be able to use this way

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.909 
you're going to be able to use this way
longer<00:06:50.060> than<00:06:50.449> you<00:06:50.870> would<00:06:51.080> be<00:06:51.229> even<00:06:51.529> the<00:06:51.620> Berkey

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 
longer than you would be even the Berkey

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:53.649 
longer than you would be even the Berkey
sport<00:06:52.279> one<00:06:52.550> thing<00:06:52.729> I<00:06:52.819> do<00:06:52.879> like<00:06:53.240> about<00:06:53.300> the

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:53.659 
sport one thing I do like about the

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:55.059 
sport one thing I do like about the
Berkey<00:06:53.990> though<00:06:54.139> is<00:06:54.289> it<00:06:54.379> does<00:06:54.560> have<00:06:54.740> the<00:06:54.830> water

00:06:55.059 --> 00:06:55.069 
Berkey though is it does have the water

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:57.670 
Berkey though is it does have the water
bottle<00:06:55.460> connected<00:06:56.330> to<00:06:56.509> it<00:06:56.659> so<00:06:57.259> once<00:06:57.560> you

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 
bottle connected to it so once you

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.869 
bottle connected to it so once you
filter<00:06:58.009> through<00:06:58.189> the<00:06:58.279> water<00:06:58.490> you<00:06:58.669> can<00:06:58.819> always
