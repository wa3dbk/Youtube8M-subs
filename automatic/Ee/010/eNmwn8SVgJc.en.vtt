00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960 

a<00:00:00.589> lot<00:00:01.589> of<00:00:01.620> the<00:00:01.829> examples<00:00:02.340> we've<00:00:02.520> shown<00:00:02.550> of

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
a lot of the examples we've shown of

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.030 
a lot of the examples we've shown of
rigging<00:00:03.270> with<00:00:03.389> art<00:00:03.600> have<00:00:04.170> been<00:00:04.350> very<00:00:04.650> sort<00:00:05.009> of

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
rigging with art have been very sort of

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.800 
rigging with art have been very sort of
cartoony<00:00:05.580> and<00:00:05.609> stretchy<00:00:06.029> and<00:00:06.359> it's<00:00:06.569> true<00:00:06.779> that

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
cartoony and stretchy and it's true that

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.910 
cartoony and stretchy and it's true that
art<00:00:07.230> is<00:00:07.410> very<00:00:07.589> good<00:00:07.799> at<00:00:08.040> those<00:00:08.220> kinds<00:00:08.730> of<00:00:08.820> rigs

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 
art is very good at those kinds of rigs

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.259 
art is very good at those kinds of rigs
but<00:00:10.920> you<00:00:11.040> can<00:00:11.190> also<00:00:11.309> use<00:00:11.639> it<00:00:11.790> for<00:00:11.820> very

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
but you can also use it for very

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.539 
but you can also use it for very
realistic<00:00:12.870> rigging<00:00:13.139> here<00:00:13.679> for<00:00:13.920> example<00:00:14.340> I

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
realistic rigging here for example I

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.670 
realistic rigging here for example I
have<00:00:14.700> rigged<00:00:14.969> up<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.330> shoulder<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.020> arm<00:00:16.260> to

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
have rigged up a shoulder and arm to

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.320 
have rigged up a shoulder and arm to
have<00:00:16.859> some<00:00:17.130> very<00:00:17.250> nice<00:00:17.520> sort<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.910> pseudo

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
have some very nice sort of pseudo

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.120 
have some very nice sort of pseudo
muscle<00:00:18.690> deformation<00:00:19.320> going<00:00:19.590> on<00:00:19.710> in<00:00:19.830> here<00:00:20.010> and

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
muscle deformation going on in here and

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.410 
muscle deformation going on in here and
so<00:00:20.310> people<00:00:20.490> go<00:00:20.730> around<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.270> back

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
so people go around to this in the back

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.240 
so people go around to this in the back
and<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.289> can<00:00:22.320> see<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:22.980> can<00:00:23.100> actually

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
and you can see that you can actually

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.050 
and you can see that you can actually
see<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:24.350> musculature<00:00:25.350> reacting<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.160> bit<00:00:26.340> to

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
see the musculature reacting a bit to

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.089 
see the musculature reacting a bit to
how<00:00:27.240> I'm<00:00:27.420> moving<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.960> shoulder<00:00:28.560> around<00:00:28.680> you

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
how I'm moving the shoulder around you

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.679 
how I'm moving the shoulder around you
know<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.460> know<00:00:29.550> sort<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.789> semi<00:00:30.000> realistic<00:00:30.570> way

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
know you know sort of semi realistic way

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.840 
know you know sort of semi realistic way
not<00:00:30.960> as<00:00:31.080> realistic<00:00:31.380> as<00:00:31.710> true<00:00:32.189> simulation<00:00:32.790> of

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
not as realistic as true simulation of

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.270 
not as realistic as true simulation of
course<00:00:33.090> but<00:00:33.300> much<00:00:33.540> easier<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:34.079> set<00:00:34.260> up<00:00:34.290> what's

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
course but much easier to set up what's

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.000 
course but much easier to set up what's
actually<00:00:35.460> going<00:00:35.760> on<00:00:36.030> here<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.770> have<00:00:37.860> a

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
actually going on here is that I have a

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.340 
actually going on here is that I have a
whole<00:00:38.250> bunch<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.610> art<00:00:38.820> chains<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.960> are<00:00:40.170> being

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
whole bunch of art chains that are being

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.850 
whole bunch of art chains that are being
anchored<00:00:40.710> with<00:00:41.309> our<00:00:41.610> arch<00:00:41.850> constraint<00:00:42.480> and

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
anchored with our arch constraint and

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.920 
anchored with our arch constraint and
this<00:00:43.860> gives<00:00:44.129> us<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.550> lot<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:45.030> flexibility<00:00:45.719> and

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
this gives us a lot of flexibility and

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.630 
this gives us a lot of flexibility and
also<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.170> lot<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.440> ease<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.770> setup<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.399> can

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
also a lot of ease of setup so you can

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.160 
also a lot of ease of setup so you can
sort<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.879> see<00:00:48.059> how<00:00:48.090> they<00:00:48.300> are<00:00:48.420> stretching<00:00:48.930> too

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
sort of see how they are stretching too

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.290 
sort of see how they are stretching too
attached<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.559> specific<00:00:49.860> anchor<00:00:50.460> points<00:00:50.760> these

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
attached to specific anchor points these

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.119 
attached to specific anchor points these
anchor<00:00:51.690> points<00:00:52.050> because<00:00:52.379> they<00:00:52.530> are<00:00:52.620> not<00:00:52.800> set

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
anchor points because they are not set

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.340 
anchor points because they are not set
by<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.399> mesh<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:54.180> by<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.420> arch<00:00:54.870> constraint

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
by the mesh but by the arch constraint

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.529 
by the mesh but by the arch constraint
are<00:00:55.530> both<00:00:56.219> very<00:00:56.610> easy<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.000> set<00:00:57.149> up<00:00:57.180> all<00:00:57.480> I

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
are both very easy to set up all I

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.119 
are both very easy to set up all I
really<00:00:57.780> had<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.079> do<00:00:58.199> was<00:00:58.379> sort<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.590> draw<00:00:58.890> these

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
really had to do was sort of draw these

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.569 
really had to do was sort of draw these
bones<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.570> sort<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.590> constrain<00:01:02.070> up<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
bones in and sort of constrain up the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.920 
bones in and sort of constrain up the
you<00:01:03.390> know<00:01:03.510> beginnings<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:03.989> ends<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.290> them<00:01:04.820> and

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
you know beginnings and ends of them and

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.950 
you know beginnings and ends of them and
also<00:01:06.930> very<00:01:07.830> useful<00:01:08.130> for<00:01:09.000> getting<00:01:09.270> sort<00:01:09.930> of

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
also very useful for getting sort of

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.660 
also very useful for getting sort of
nice<00:01:10.200> proper<00:01:11.100> sort<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.369> spread<00:01:11.640> of

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
nice proper sort of spread of

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.760 
nice proper sort of spread of
deformation<00:01:12.240> for<00:01:12.420> instance<00:01:12.689> if<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.900> rotate<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
deformation for instance if I rotate the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.770 
deformation for instance if I rotate the
shoulder<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.310> both<00:01:14.460> get<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.820> nice<00:01:15.030> volume

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
shoulder you both get the nice volume

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.240 
shoulder you both get the nice volume
preservation<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.680> always<00:01:16.830> get<00:01:17.009> out<00:01:17.130> of

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
preservation that you always get out of

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.359 
preservation that you always get out of
art<00:01:17.400> but<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.939> can<00:01:18.090> also<00:01:18.299> see<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:19.680> because

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
art but you can also see that because

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.950 
art but you can also see that because
the<00:01:20.840> points<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:22.880> attachment<00:01:23.880> because<00:01:24.810> they

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
the points of attachment because they

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.660 
the points of attachment because they
are<00:01:25.080> using<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.560> art<00:01:25.710> constraint<00:01:26.189> are<00:01:26.430> being

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
are using the art constraint are being

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.520 
are using the art constraint are being
moved<00:01:26.880> around<00:01:27.060> with<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.659> deform<00:01:28.049> er<00:01:28.170> it

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
moved around with the deform er it

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.620 
moved around with the deform er it
responds<00:01:29.250> quite<00:01:29.400> appropriately<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.329> arm

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
responds quite appropriately to the arm

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.109 
responds quite appropriately to the arm
you<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.680> see<00:01:31.950> how<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.670> pectorals

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
you can see how the the pectorals

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.140 
you can see how the the pectorals
respond<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:34.369> didn't<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.670> think<00:01:35.880> about

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
respond I didn't have to think about

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.999 
respond I didn't have to think about
which<00:01:36.420> bone<00:01:36.659> or<00:01:36.900> what<00:01:37.020> part<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.500> surface<00:01:37.860> I

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
which bone or what part of the surface I

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.649 
which bone or what part of the surface I
was<00:01:38.130> attaching<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.909> get<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.210> behavior

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
was attaching it to to get that behavior

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.870 
was attaching it to to get that behavior
that<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:40.500> sort<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.740> fell<00:01:40.920> nicely<00:01:41.340> out<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
that just sort of fell nicely out of the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.490 
that just sort of fell nicely out of the
art<00:01:42.030> constraint<00:01:43.759> we<00:01:44.759> even<00:01:44.939> have<00:01:45.299> some<00:01:45.990> bone

we're<00:02:51.370> just<00:02:51.400> going<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.910> use<00:02:52.030> this<00:02:52.660> art<00:02:52.900> joint

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
we're just going to use this art joint

we're just going to use this art joint
and<00:02:53.410> what<00:02:53.530> that<00:02:53.680> actually<00:02:53.709> means<00:02:54.220> is<00:02:54.489> we're

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
and what that actually means is we're

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.479 
and what that actually means is we're
using<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.390> tangent<00:02:55.959> at<00:02:56.140> this<00:02:56.650> point<00:02:57.129> point

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
using the tangent at this point point

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.460 
using the tangent at this point point
along<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.120> art<00:02:58.299> curve<00:02:58.629> to<00:02:58.930> drive<00:02:59.170> the

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
along the art curve to drive the

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.530 
along the art curve to drive the
deformation<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:03.340> starts<00:03:03.790> by<00:03:03.940> making<00:03:04.090> a<00:03:04.359> base

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
deformation it starts by making a base

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.059 
deformation it starts by making a base
pose<00:03:04.810> which<00:03:05.109> is<00:03:05.230> just<00:03:05.410> a<00:03:05.500> duplicate<00:03:05.890> of<00:03:05.920> the

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
pose which is just a duplicate of the

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.370 
pose which is just a duplicate of the
mesh<00:03:06.280> if<00:03:06.849> we<00:03:07.060> wanted<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.510> we<00:03:07.660> could<00:03:07.930> edit<00:03:08.079> this

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
mesh if we wanted to we could edit this

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.069 
mesh if we wanted to we could edit this
but<00:03:08.799> that<00:03:08.950> would<00:03:09.160> edit<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.940> mesh<00:03:10.150> in<00:03:10.389> its<00:03:10.690> base

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
but that would edit the mesh in its base

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:12.629 
but that would edit the mesh in its base
position<00:03:11.560> which<00:03:11.709> isn't<00:03:11.859> what<00:03:12.099> we<00:03:12.220> want<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.489> do

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:12.639 
position which isn't what we want to do

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.370 
position which isn't what we want to do
so<00:03:13.120> we're<00:03:13.269> just<00:03:13.299> going<00:03:13.599> to<00:03:13.690> go<00:03:13.780> ahead<00:03:13.900> and<00:03:14.170> hide

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
so we're just going to go ahead and hide

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:26.930 
so we're just going to go ahead and hide
it<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:15.269> then<00:03:16.269> create<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.260> new<00:03:17.530> pose

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.320 

all<00:03:27.750> right<00:03:27.900> let's<00:03:28.140> create<00:03:28.380> a<00:03:28.470> pose<00:03:29.090> we'll<00:03:30.090> call

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
all right let's create a pose we'll call

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:39.680 
all right let's create a pose we'll call
it<00:03:34.760> left<00:03:35.760> arm<00:03:35.940> bent<00:03:36.890> and<00:03:37.890> this<00:03:38.520> will<00:03:38.820> push<00:03:39.180> give

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
it left arm bent and this will push give

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.480 
it left arm bent and this will push give
us<00:03:39.810> a<00:03:39.870> copy<00:03:40.080> of<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.410> mesh<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.800> the<00:03:40.830> side<00:03:41.100> you

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
us a copy of the mesh to the side you

us a copy of the mesh to the side you
know<00:03:41.610> much<00:03:41.790> as<00:03:41.940> one<00:03:42.150> would<00:03:42.330> do<00:03:42.420> with<00:03:42.540> a<00:03:42.570> blunt

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.060 
shape now one thing to note here is we
have<00:03:45.000> one<00:03:45.630> mesh<00:03:45.870> under<00:03:46.350> here<00:03:46.590> that<00:03:46.830> can<00:03:46.980> be

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.570 
mesh pulling and sculpting tools and
then<00:03:52.290> we<00:03:52.440> also<00:03:52.680> have<00:03:53.190> a<00:03:53.580> pose<00:03:54.210> base<00:03:55.460> what<00:03:56.460> we

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
then we also have a pose base what we

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.850 
then we also have a pose base what we
are<00:03:56.670> actually<00:03:56.900> deforming<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.050> deformation

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
are actually deforming the deformation

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.470 
are actually deforming the deformation
we're<00:03:58.980> actually<00:03:59.100> going<00:03:59.370> to<00:03:59.580> apply<00:03:59.910> to<00:04:00.360> the

mesh when that arm is bent is the

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.440 
mesh when that arm is bent is the

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.760 
pose target and that lets us very
precisely<00:04:09.150> see<00:04:09.540> exactly<00:04:10.170> what<00:04:10.500> we're<00:04:10.650> doing

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
precisely see exactly what we're doing

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.860 
precisely see exactly what we're doing
to<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.100> mesh<00:04:11.250> so<00:04:11.910> I'm<00:04:12.060> just<00:04:12.180> gonna<00:04:12.270> go<00:04:12.510> in<00:04:12.660> here

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
to the mesh so I'm just gonna go in here

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.170 
to the mesh so I'm just gonna go in here
really<00:04:13.350> quickly<00:04:13.650> and<00:04:13.890> you<00:04:14.430> know<00:04:14.760> model<00:04:15.060> this

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
really quickly and you know model this

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.820 
really quickly and you know model this
mesh<00:04:15.360> around<00:04:15.630> a<00:04:15.720> little<00:04:15.810> bit<00:04:15.990> I'll<00:04:16.260> speed<00:04:16.680> this

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
mesh around a little bit I'll speed this

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:55.640 
mesh around a little bit I'll speed this
part<00:04:17.070> up

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:02.930 

so<00:04:56.370> here's<00:04:56.610> our<00:04:56.729> sculpted<00:04:57.210> pose<00:04:59.630> and<00:05:01.729> if<00:05:02.729> we

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
so here's our sculpted pose and if we

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.900 
so here's our sculpted pose and if we
switch<00:05:03.300> to<00:05:03.900> x-ray<00:05:04.740> mode<00:05:04.979> we<00:05:05.460> can<00:05:05.490> see

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
switch to x-ray mode we can see

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.700 
switch to x-ray mode we can see
precisely<00:05:06.360> how<00:05:06.780> it<00:05:06.810> differs<00:05:07.320> from<00:05:07.350> the

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
precisely how it differs from the

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:15.920 
precisely how it differs from the
original<00:05:08.190> mesh

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.300 

and<00:05:16.860> if<00:05:17.310> we<00:05:17.430> go<00:05:17.639> take<00:05:17.940> a<00:05:17.970> look<00:05:18.360> at<00:05:18.600> our<00:05:19.110> rig<00:05:19.889> you

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
and if we go take a look at our rig you

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.530 
and if we go take a look at our rig you
can<00:05:20.460> see<00:05:20.639> that<00:05:20.759> this<00:05:20.850> is<00:05:21.000> already<00:05:21.210> being

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
can see that this is already being

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.710 
can see that this is already being
applied<00:05:21.960> and<00:05:22.310> as<00:05:23.310> we<00:05:23.490> rotate<00:05:23.850> this<00:05:24.030> back<00:05:24.360> to

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
applied and as we rotate this back to

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.350 
applied and as we rotate this back to
its<00:05:24.900> original<00:05:24.990> position<00:05:26.000> now<00:05:27.000> one<00:05:27.180> thing

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
its original position now one thing

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.730 
its original position now one thing
that's<00:05:27.419> worth<00:05:27.720> noting<00:05:28.080> here<00:05:28.199> is<00:05:28.320> that<00:05:28.410> this<00:05:28.530> is

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
that's worth noting here is that this is

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.580 
that's worth noting here is that this is
at<00:05:28.949> the<00:05:29.070> moment<00:05:29.100> a<00:05:29.430> little<00:05:29.639> slow<00:05:29.850> um<00:05:30.500> you<00:05:31.500> know

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
at the moment a little slow um you know

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.310 
at the moment a little slow um you know
we're<00:05:31.740> still<00:05:31.860> working<00:05:31.919> on<00:05:32.220> optimizing<00:05:32.400> the

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
we're still working on optimizing the

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.810 
we're still working on optimizing the
post<00:05:34.320> based<00:05:34.560> áformer<00:05:34.949> and<00:05:35.220> it's<00:05:35.460> going<00:05:35.610> to<00:05:35.699> be

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
post based áformer and it's going to be

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.430 
post based áformer and it's going to be
a<00:05:35.850> lot<00:05:36.030> faster<00:05:36.240> in<00:05:36.600> the<00:05:36.690> release<00:05:36.930> version<00:05:37.110> um

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
a lot faster in the release version um

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.300 
a lot faster in the release version um
also<00:05:38.400> because<00:05:38.960> this<00:05:39.960> is<00:05:40.169> using<00:05:40.560> unlike<00:05:41.100> many

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
also because this is using unlike many

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.090 
also because this is using unlike many
post<00:05:41.580> based<00:05:41.820> deformers<00:05:42.240> not<00:05:42.930> the<00:05:43.259> rotation<00:05:43.979> of

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
post based deformers not the rotation of

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.490 
post based deformers not the rotation of
this<00:05:44.220> joint<00:05:44.520> but<00:05:45.270> the<00:05:45.389> tangent<00:05:45.930> at<00:05:46.050> this<00:05:46.080> point

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
this joint but the tangent at this point

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.980 
this joint but the tangent at this point
along<00:05:46.740> the<00:05:46.979> curve<00:05:47.009> to<00:05:48.000> drive<00:05:48.240> the<00:05:48.539> post<00:05:48.690> space

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
along the curve to drive the post space

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.350 
along the curve to drive the post space
we<00:05:49.830> can<00:05:49.979> go<00:05:50.100> ahead<00:05:50.250> and<00:05:50.400> add<00:05:50.699> bone<00:05:50.940> Seavey's

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
we can go ahead and add bone Seavey's

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.529 
we can go ahead and add bone Seavey's
and<00:05:51.620> you<00:05:52.620> can<00:05:52.770> see<00:05:52.919> that<00:05:53.070> the<00:05:53.400> pose<00:05:54.060> will<00:05:54.360> still

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
and you can see that the pose will still

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:56.510 
and you can see that the pose will still
be<00:05:54.630> applied<00:05:54.900> correctly<00:05:55.199> as<00:05:55.530> the<00:05:56.010> angle

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
be applied correctly as the angle

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.580 
be applied correctly as the angle
between<00:05:57.000> coming<00:05:57.660> into<00:05:57.810> and<00:05:58.139> out<00:05:58.260> of<00:05:58.470> this

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
between coming into and out of this

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.770 
between coming into and out of this
joint<00:05:58.800> changes<00:05:59.130> the<00:05:59.820> pose<00:06:00.000> will<00:06:00.240> become<00:06:00.510> more

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
joint changes the pose will become more

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:07.430 
joint changes the pose will become more
or<00:06:00.990> less<00:06:01.050> applied<00:06:04.220> and<00:06:06.080> the<00:06:07.080> same<00:06:07.289> is

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
or less applied and the same is

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.620 
or less applied and the same is
incidentally<00:06:08.039> true<00:06:08.280> of<00:06:08.460> the<00:06:09.030> constraints

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
incidentally true of the constraints

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.719 
incidentally true of the constraints
that<00:06:09.660> we're<00:06:10.020> seeing<00:06:10.260> here<00:06:10.500> if<00:06:10.680> I<00:06:11.099> go<00:06:11.280> ahead<00:06:11.550> and

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:11.729 
that we're seeing here if I go ahead and

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:18.980 
that we're seeing here if I go ahead and
rotate<00:06:11.910> this<00:06:13.430> and<00:06:15.139> add<00:06:16.139> a<00:06:16.169> bone<00:06:16.710> CV<00:06:17.810> you<00:06:18.810> can

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
rotate this and add a bone CV you can

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.409 
rotate this and add a bone CV you can
see<00:06:19.289> that<00:06:19.770> these<00:06:20.160> constraints<00:06:20.820> will<00:06:20.970> continue

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
see that these constraints will continue

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:23.270 
see that these constraints will continue
to<00:06:21.570> behave<00:06:21.690> properly<00:06:22.080> as<00:06:22.530> if<00:06:23.070> they're

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
to behave properly as if they're

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.870 
to behave properly as if they're
