off<00:00:10.620> with<00:00:10.889> lidocaine<00:00:11.250> I'm<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.059> little

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
off with lidocaine I'm a little

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.640 
off with lidocaine I'm a little
surprised<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.690> see<00:00:12.780> lidocaine<00:00:13.259> here<00:00:13.500> because

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
surprised to see lidocaine here because

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.359 
surprised to see lidocaine here because
it's<00:00:13.799> not<00:00:13.910> really<00:00:14.910> in<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.330> ACLS<00:00:15.839> ones<00:00:16.199> but<00:00:17.100> we

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
it's not really in the ACLS ones but we

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.910 
it's not really in the ACLS ones but we
because<00:00:17.880> it's<00:00:18.420> not<00:00:18.630> as<00:00:18.869> good<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.320> in

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
because it's not as good and in

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.220 
because it's not as good and in
antiarrhythmic<00:00:20.640> as<00:00:20.789> amiodarone<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.720> but

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
antiarrhythmic as amiodarone is but

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
the hospital but it sure makes us look

the hospital but it sure makes us look
feel<00:00:48.059> better<00:00:48.360> when<00:00:48.840> we<00:00:48.870> see<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.969> v-tach<00:00:50.969> or

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
feel better when we see that v-tach or

feel better when we see that v-tach or
whatever<00:00:51.570> go<00:00:52.170> back<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> sinus<00:00:52.980> rhythm<00:00:54.590> next

whatever go back to a sinus rhythm next
is<00:00:55.800> magnesium<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.480> here's<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.350> dose<00:00:59.629> 25<00:01:00.629> to

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
is magnesium and here's the dose 25 to

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.229 
is magnesium and here's the dose 25 to
50<00:01:01.079> milligrams<00:01:01.469> per<00:01:01.620> kg<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:02.550> give<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.820> slowly

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
50 milligrams per kg you give it slowly

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.539 
50 milligrams per kg you give it slowly
because<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.750> can<00:01:03.870> cause<00:01:04.049> hypotension<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
because it can cause hypotension and the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.700 
because it can cause hypotension and the
max<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.880> want<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.090> give<00:01:06.210> us<00:01:06.299> two<00:01:06.570> grams<00:01:06.990> and

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
max you want to give us two grams and

max you want to give us two grams and
the<00:01:07.799> only<00:01:07.979> time<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.220> really<00:01:08.250> are<00:01:08.460> going<00:01:08.549> to

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
the only time you really are going to

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.370 
the only time you really are going to
give<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:08.909> for<00:01:09.510> documented<00:01:10.020> cases<00:01:10.229> of

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
give this for documented cases of

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.760 
give this for documented cases of
hypomagnesemia<00:01:11.010> or<00:01:11.880> tor<00:01:12.540> Assad<00:01:12.840> which<00:01:13.380> could

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
hypomagnesemia or tor Assad which could

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.950 
hypomagnesemia or tor Assad which could
be<00:01:13.920> caused<00:01:14.130> by<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.460> hypomagnesemia<00:01:14.960> and

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
be caused by the hypomagnesemia and

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.830 
be caused by the hypomagnesemia and
you'll<00:01:16.470> remember<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.860> tor<00:01:17.189> Saad<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.729> a

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
you'll remember that tor Saad is a

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.560 
you'll remember that tor Saad is a
polymorphic<00:01:18.840> ventricular<00:01:19.310> tachycardia<00:01:20.570> that

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.870 
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that
occurs<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.380> patients<00:01:22.619> who<00:01:23.009> have<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> prolonged

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
occurs in patients who have a prolonged

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.289 
occurs in patients who have a prolonged
QT<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:26.100> cause<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.700> can<00:01:27.150> be

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
QT and the cause of this can be

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.929 
QT and the cause of this can be
hypomagnesemia<00:01:28.159> hypocalcemia<00:01:29.159> hypokalemia

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
hypomagnesemia hypocalcemia hypokalemia

hypomagnesemia hypocalcemia hypokalemia
lots<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.750> other<00:01:30.900> things<00:01:30.960> certain<00:01:31.619> drugs

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
lots of other things certain drugs

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.640 
lots of other things certain drugs
congenital<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.450> if<00:01:33.869> you're<00:01:34.049> suspecting

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
congenital and so if you're suspecting

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.350 
congenital and so if you're suspecting
or<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.280> see<00:01:35.460> on<00:01:35.549> an<00:01:35.610> old<00:01:35.759> EKG<00:01:36.030> they<00:01:36.119> had<00:01:36.329> a

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
or you see on an old EKG they had a

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.270 
or you see on an old EKG they had a
prolonged<00:01:36.720> QT<00:01:37.110> there<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.740> polymorphic

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
prolonged QT there in a polymorphic

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.640 
prolonged QT there in a polymorphic
v-tach<00:01:38.540> go<00:01:39.540> ahead<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.810> try<00:01:39.960> some<00:01:39.990> magnesium

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
v-tach go ahead and try some magnesium

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.560 
v-tach go ahead and try some magnesium
but<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.250> not<00:01:41.430> recommended<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.030> be<00:01:42.090> routinely

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
but it's not recommended to be routinely

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.109 
but it's not recommended to be routinely
given<00:01:43.909> so<00:01:44.909> procainamide<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:46.049> back<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.439> style

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
given so procainamide is back in style

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.550 
given so procainamide is back in style
procainamide<00:01:48.119> you're<00:01:48.540> gonna<00:01:48.659> give<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.409> is

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
procainamide you're gonna give this is

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.710 
procainamide you're gonna give this is
the<00:01:49.680> adult<00:01:49.950> IV<00:01:50.369> dose<00:01:50.670> you're<00:01:51.090> gonna<00:01:51.270> give<00:01:51.390> 20

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
the adult IV dose you're gonna give 20

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.870 
the adult IV dose you're gonna give 20
MiG's<00:01:51.960> per<00:01:52.170> minute<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.950> how<00:01:53.340> much<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.700> give

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
MiG's per minute and how much to give

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.870 
MiG's per minute and how much to give
well<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.600> give<00:01:54.810> up<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.799> max<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.460> 15

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
well you give up to a max of 15

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.440 
well you give up to a max of 15
milligrams<00:01:57.420> per<00:01:57.780> kilogram<00:01:58.909> so<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.000> do<00:02:00.270> want

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
milligrams per kilogram so you do want

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.800 
milligrams per kilogram so you do want
to<00:02:00.509> give<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.869> slowly<00:02:02.000> until<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.240> arrhythmia

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
to give it slowly until the arrhythmia

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:11.029 
to give it slowly until the arrhythmia
stops<00:02:04.320> or<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:06.420> if<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.170> QT<00:02:07.710> widens<00:02:08.550> or<00:02:09.349> the<00:02:10.349> QRS

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
stops or the if the QT widens or the QRS

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.750 
stops or the if the QT widens or the QRS
slows<00:02:11.670> down<00:02:12.060> or

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
slows down or

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.100 
slows down or
expands<00:02:13.239> it<00:02:13.540> it<00:02:13.989> grows<00:02:14.620> 50%<00:02:15.840> or<00:02:16.840> if<00:02:16.989> the

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
expands it it grows 50% or if the

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.990 
expands it it grows 50% or if the
patient<00:02:17.440> develops<00:02:17.769> heart<00:02:18.010> block<00:02:18.280> or

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
patient develops heart block or

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.960 
patient develops heart block or
hypotension<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:21.730> way<00:02:21.819> that

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
hypotension and the way that

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.140 
hypotension and the way that
procainamide<00:02:22.299> works<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:23.019> it<00:02:23.610> depresses<00:02:24.610> are

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
procainamide works is it depresses are

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.420 
procainamide works is it depresses are
actually<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.540> prolongs<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.739> refractory

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
actually a prolongs the refractory

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.289 
actually a prolongs the refractory
period<00:02:27.580> of<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.599> heart<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:30.970> slows<00:02:31.269> down

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
period of the heart and it slows down

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:36.330 
period of the heart and it slows down
conduction<00:02:34.080> so<00:02:35.080> this<00:02:35.440> explains<00:02:35.769> some<00:02:36.220> of

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
conduction so this explains some of

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.589 
conduction so this explains some of
these<00:02:36.400> symptoms<00:02:36.730> that<00:02:37.060> you're<00:02:37.239> really<00:02:37.390> gonna

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
these symptoms that you're really gonna

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.210 
these symptoms that you're really gonna
see<00:02:37.690> here<00:02:38.200> right<00:02:38.620> because<00:02:38.739> there's<00:02:38.980> a

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
see here right because there's a

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.809 
see here right because there's a
refractory<00:02:39.730> period<00:02:40.620> expansive<00:02:41.620> QT<00:02:42.010> is<00:02:42.459> going

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
refractory period expansive QT is going

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.509 
refractory period expansive QT is going
to<00:02:43.000> get<00:02:43.180> longer<00:02:43.540> as<00:02:44.319> conduction<00:02:44.890> slows<00:02:45.220> you

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
to get longer as conduction slows you

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.670 
to get longer as conduction slows you
can<00:02:45.730> develop<00:02:46.090> a<00:02:46.180> heart<00:02:46.450> block<00:02:46.780> as<00:02:47.049> as<00:02:47.440> this

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
can develop a heart block as as this

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.440 
can develop a heart block as as this
gets<00:02:47.950> in<00:02:48.069> very<00:02:48.220> very<00:02:48.459> it<00:02:48.730> gets<00:02:49.000> completely

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
gets in very very it gets completely

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.869 
gets in very very it gets completely
blocked<00:02:49.720> actually<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.680> as<00:02:50.829> the<00:02:50.950> QRS<00:02:51.430> widens

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
blocked actually and as the QRS widens

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.599 
blocked actually and as the QRS widens
conduction<00:02:52.329> through<00:02:52.569> here<00:02:53.410> is<00:02:53.829> going<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.400> slow

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
conduction through here is going to slow

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.220 
conduction through here is going to slow
down<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.900> that's<00:02:56.170> what<00:02:56.349> makes<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.650> QRS<00:02:57.069> widen

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
down and that's what makes the QRS widen

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.699 
down and that's what makes the QRS widen
and<00:03:00.180> another<00:03:01.180> note<00:03:01.390> of<00:03:01.540> caution<00:03:01.780> another<00:03:02.379> drug

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
and another note of caution another drug

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.630 
and another note of caution another drug
that's<00:03:03.010> going<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.370> increase<00:03:03.760> your<00:03:04.540> QT<00:03:05.640> is

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
that's going to increase your QT is

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.059 
that's going to increase your QT is
amiodarone<00:03:07.269> right<00:03:07.599> and<00:03:07.780> so<00:03:08.290> if<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:08.620> give<00:03:08.799> both

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
amiodarone right and so if you give both

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.880 
amiodarone right and so if you give both
of<00:03:09.430> these<00:03:09.579> drugs<00:03:10.379> then<00:03:11.379> you're<00:03:11.560> probably

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
of these drugs then you're probably

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.220 
of these drugs then you're probably
gonna<00:03:12.310> push<00:03:12.579> your<00:03:12.730> patient<00:03:13.150> into<00:03:13.390> torsades<00:03:13.900> so

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
gonna push your patient into torsades so

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.199 
gonna push your patient into torsades so
if<00:03:14.769> for<00:03:15.010> some<00:03:15.040> reason<00:03:15.430> you<00:03:15.489> have<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.760> get

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
if for some reason you have to get

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.180 
if for some reason you have to get
procainamide<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:17.079> amiodarone<00:03:17.530> i<00:03:17.859> would<00:03:18.010> do

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
procainamide and amiodarone i would do

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.729 
procainamide and amiodarone i would do
that<00:03:18.220> in<00:03:18.549> consultation<00:03:19.389> with<00:03:19.419> a<00:03:20.019> pediatric

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
that in consultation with a pediatric

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.569 
that in consultation with a pediatric
cardiologist<00:03:22.650> heck<00:03:23.650> any<00:03:24.010> time<00:03:24.340> that<00:03:24.489> I'm

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
cardiologist heck any time that I'm

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.280 
cardiologist heck any time that I'm
giving<00:03:24.849> procainamide<00:03:25.269> I<00:03:25.660> probably<00:03:25.959> would<00:03:26.200> be

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
giving procainamide I probably would be

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.050 
giving procainamide I probably would be
talking<00:03:26.500> to<00:03:26.739> the<00:03:26.829> pediatric<00:03:27.370> cardiologist

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
talking to the pediatric cardiologist

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.870 
talking to the pediatric cardiologist
anyway<00:03:29.760> they<00:03:30.760> also<00:03:31.120> mentioned<00:03:31.599> sodium<00:03:32.139> Barkai

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
anyway they also mentioned sodium Barkai

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.300 
anyway they also mentioned sodium Barkai
bicarbonate<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.150> here's<00:03:34.569> the<00:03:35.099> dosage<00:03:36.099> one

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
bicarbonate and here's the dosage one

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.780 
bicarbonate and here's the dosage one
millicoulombs<00:03:36.700> per<00:03:37.060> kg<00:03:37.269> per<00:03:37.690> dose<00:03:38.130> but<00:03:39.130> in<00:03:39.609> a

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
millicoulombs per kg per dose but in a

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.300 
millicoulombs per kg per dose but in a
codes<00:03:40.180> scenario<00:03:41.169> this<00:03:41.470> really<00:03:41.919> doesn't<00:03:42.190> have

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
codes scenario this really doesn't have

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.190 
codes scenario this really doesn't have
a<00:03:42.340> role<00:03:42.579> it's<00:03:42.819> good<00:03:43.090> for<00:03:43.419> certain<00:03:43.780> things<00:03:44.019> like

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
a role it's good for certain things like

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.740 
a role it's good for certain things like
if<00:03:44.470> you<00:03:44.560> have<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:44.769> toxic<00:03:45.099> illogic<00:03:45.760> ingestion

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
if you have a toxic illogic ingestion

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.599 
if you have a toxic illogic ingestion
then<00:03:47.079> maybe<00:03:47.260> you<00:03:47.410> need<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:47.590> give<00:03:47.919> sodium

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
then maybe you need to give sodium

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.059 
then maybe you need to give sodium
bicarbonate<00:03:49.359> but<00:03:49.780> it<00:03:49.870> does<00:03:50.049> not<00:03:50.260> really<00:03:50.709> have

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
bicarbonate but it does not really have

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:52.650 
bicarbonate but it does not really have
a<00:03:51.340> role<00:03:51.519> even<00:03:51.730> if<00:03:51.970> you<00:03:52.030> got<00:03:52.150> a<00:03:52.180> patient<00:03:52.389> who's

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
a role even if you got a patient who's

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.050 
a role even if you got a patient who's
profoundly<00:03:53.079> acidotic<00:03:53.829> fix<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.609> acidosis

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
profoundly acidotic fix the acidosis

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.240 
profoundly acidotic fix the acidosis
this<00:03:55.989> is<00:03:56.139> gonna<00:03:56.319> only<00:03:56.530> give<00:03:56.739> you<00:03:56.859> temporary

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
this is gonna only give you temporary

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.319 
this is gonna only give you temporary
fixing<00:04:00.250> of<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.489> numbers<00:04:00.849> but<00:04:01.030> not<00:04:01.150> really

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
fixing of the numbers but not really

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.330 
fixing of the numbers but not really
doing<00:04:01.569> much<00:04:01.720> for<00:04:01.959> your<00:04:02.019> patients<00:04:02.530> so<00:04:02.709> no<00:04:03.129> real

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
doing much for your patients so no real

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.629 
doing much for your patients so no real
rule<00:04:04.739> similarly<00:04:05.739> they<00:04:05.859> also<00:04:06.010> mentioned

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639 
rule similarly they also mentioned

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.569 
rule similarly they also mentioned
vasopressin<00:04:07.799> which<00:04:08.799> is<00:04:08.949> a<00:04:08.980> drug<00:04:09.280> that<00:04:09.310> we'll

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
vasopressin which is a drug that we'll

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:14.520 
vasopressin which is a drug that we'll
use<00:04:09.609> in<00:04:10.180> adult<00:04:11.430> arrest<00:04:12.780> but<00:04:13.780> in<00:04:13.930> pediatric

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
use in adult arrest but in pediatric

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.370 
use in adult arrest but in pediatric
arrest<00:04:14.829> it's<00:04:15.069> not<00:04:15.310> been<00:04:15.669> shown<00:04:15.910> to<00:04:16.120> be<00:04:16.209> helpful

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
arrest it's not been shown to be helpful

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.689 
arrest it's not been shown to be helpful
so<00:04:17.380> you<00:04:17.799> don't<00:04:17.949> have<00:04:18.070> to<00:04:18.160> worry<00:04:18.340> about<00:04:18.400> that

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:18.699 
so you don't have to worry about that

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.260 
so you don't have to worry about that
one<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:20.739> so<00:04:21.010> this<00:04:21.400> gets<00:04:21.579> us<00:04:21.789> through<00:04:21.940> the

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270
