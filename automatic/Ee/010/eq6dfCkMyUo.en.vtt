but it is worth alive in fact you can

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.219 
but it is worth alive in fact you can
see<00:01:58.640> like<00:01:58.850> there's<00:01:59.119> a<00:01:59.360> collision<00:01:59.899> on<00:02:00.049> the

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
see like there's a collision on the

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:04.270 
being the fall on the throw triple axel
as<00:04:02.120> you<00:04:02.359> mentioned<00:04:02.780> it<00:04:02.840> does<00:04:03.019> get<00:04:03.260> 7.5<00:04:03.980> points

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
as you mentioned it does get 7.5 points

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.459 
as you mentioned it does get 7.5 points
and<00:04:04.549> in<00:04:04.639> these<00:04:04.790> points<00:04:05.030> for<00:04:05.269> the<00:04:05.359> fall<00:04:05.599> but

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:06.469 
and in these points for the fall but

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:09.640 
and in these points for the fall but
then<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.769> spin<00:04:07.040> sloppy<00:04:07.670> so<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:09.109> speed<00:04:09.379> wasn't

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
then the spin sloppy so the speed wasn't

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.479 
then the spin sloppy so the speed wasn't
up<00:04:10.219> to<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:10.760> level<00:04:11.150> that<00:04:11.299> they<00:04:11.540> can<00:04:11.569> skate

complicated<00:04:13.489> footwork<00:04:13.879> I<00:04:14.090> will<00:04:14.299> say<00:04:14.569> that<00:04:15.260> is

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:15.409 
complicated footwork I will say that is

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:17.650 
complicated footwork I will say that is
the<00:04:15.530> step<00:04:15.769> sequence<00:04:16.190> but<00:04:16.430> it<00:04:17.090> just<00:04:17.449> didn't

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
the step sequence but it just didn't

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.259 
the step sequence but it just didn't

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
trying to make an Olympic team so we'll

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:37.440 
trying to make an Olympic team so we'll
have<00:04:28.009> to<00:04:28.190> see<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:28.520> way<00:04:28.669> this<00:04:28.880> is<00:04:29.030> scored<00:04:29.449> but

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.770 

the<00:04:38.140> hardest<00:04:38.500> throw<00:04:38.800> to<00:04:38.860> do<00:04:39.480> before<00:04:40.480> you<00:04:40.630> get

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
the hardest throw to do before you get

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.600 
the hardest throw to do before you get
into<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.140> throw<00:04:41.380> quads<00:04:41.710> right<00:04:42.070> here<00:04:42.430> this<00:04:42.550> is

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
into the throw quads right here this is

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.790 
into the throw quads right here this is
the<00:04:42.730> throw<00:04:43.030> triple<00:04:43.240> axel<00:04:43.810> and<00:04:43.960> what<00:04:44.530> to<00:04:44.650> look

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
the throw triple axel and what to look

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.640 
the throw triple axel and what to look
for<00:04:45.100> is<00:04:45.360> she<00:04:46.360> just<00:04:46.510> gets<00:04:46.750> too<00:04:46.960> far<00:04:47.200> to<00:04:47.350> the<00:04:47.380> back

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
for is she just gets too far to the back

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.860 
for is she just gets too far to the back
of<00:04:47.830> her<00:04:47.980> skate<00:04:48.280> leans<00:04:48.610> in<00:04:48.880> the<00:04:48.970> air<00:04:49.120> and<00:04:49.510> and

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
of her skate leans in the air and and

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.670 
of her skate leans in the air and and
falls<00:04:50.590> backwards<00:04:51.240> not<00:04:52.240> completing<00:04:52.930> that<00:04:53.080> this

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
falls backwards not completing that this

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.340 
falls backwards not completing that this
is<00:04:54.000> not<00:04:55.000> good<00:04:55.240> I<00:04:55.270> either<00:04:55.540> see<00:04:55.870> this<00:04:56.020> crash

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
is not good I either see this crash

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.840 
is not good I either see this crash
right<00:04:56.680> there<00:04:56.890> the<00:04:57.010> two<00:04:57.160> of<00:04:57.280> them<00:04:57.430> have<00:04:57.640> so

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
right there the two of them have so

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.420 
right there the two of them have so
they'll<00:04:58.000> lose<00:04:58.180> points<00:04:58.540> on<00:04:58.660> that<00:04:58.980> these<00:04:59.980> little

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
they'll lose points on that these little

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.450 
they'll lose points on that these little
mistakes<00:05:01.030> or<00:05:01.440> little<00:05:02.440> sloppy<00:05:02.740> moments<00:05:03.310> can

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
mistakes or little sloppy moments can

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.280 
mistakes or little sloppy moments can
really<00:05:03.760> add<00:05:03.910> up<00:05:03.940> now<00:05:04.390> watch<00:05:04.600> right<00:05:04.870> here<00:05:04.930> he

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
really add up now watch right here he

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.290 
really add up now watch right here he
slips<00:05:05.620> completely<00:05:06.250> and<00:05:06.790> he<00:05:06.970> just<00:05:07.150> can't

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
slips completely and he just can't

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.330 
slips completely and he just can't

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
believe it are you kidding me I want to

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.700 
believe it are you kidding me I want to
rewind<00:05:09.640> and<00:05:09.850> do<00:05:09.970> that<00:05:10.120> again<00:05:10.530> that<00:05:11.530> was<00:05:11.680> a

rewind and do that again that was a

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.070

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
pretty big error on that side by side
