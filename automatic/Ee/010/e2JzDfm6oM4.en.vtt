00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
a little different if I fail a jump I

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.880 
a little different if I fail a jump I
skip<00:00:42.340> it<00:00:42.520> but<00:00:42.760> here's<00:00:42.969> the<00:00:43.030> catch<00:00:43.270> um<00:00:43.829> I've<00:00:44.829> got

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
skip it but here's the catch um I've got

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.560 
skip it but here's the catch um I've got
a<00:00:45.129> hundred<00:00:45.339> points<00:00:45.640> and<00:00:45.969> every<00:00:46.120> time<00:00:46.239> a<00:00:46.300> fail

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
a hundred points and every time a fail

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.599 
a hundred points and every time a fail
jump<00:00:46.929> I<00:00:47.079> lose<00:00:47.230> points<00:00:47.559> of<00:00:48.070> course<00:00:48.280> I<00:00:48.370> can't

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:48.609 
jump I lose points of course I can't

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:50.369 
jump I lose points of course I can't
keep<00:00:48.789> track<00:00:48.969> of<00:00:49.030> it<00:00:49.210> in<00:00:49.359> game<00:00:49.600> but<00:00:50.140> it<00:00:50.260> would

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
keep track of it in game but it would

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.500 
keep track of it in game but it would
put<00:00:50.559> up<00:00:50.679> a<00:00:50.769> counter<00:00:51.160> how<00:00:51.760> many<00:00:51.969> points<00:00:52.149> a<00:00:52.329> half

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
put up a counter how many points a half

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.180 
put up a counter how many points a half
and<00:00:52.780> see<00:00:53.079> if<00:00:53.140> you<00:00:53.199> guys<00:00:53.350> can<00:00:53.410> beat<00:00:53.829> how<00:00:54.010> many

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
and see if you guys can beat how many

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.419 
and see if you guys can beat how many
points<00:00:54.429> I<00:00:54.640> have<00:00:54.820> at<00:00:55.089> the<00:00:55.359> end<00:00:55.390> I<00:00:56.429> actually

00:00:57.419 --> 00:00:57.429 
points I have at the end I actually

00:00:57.429 --> 00:00:58.979 
points I have at the end I actually
wouldn't<00:00:57.699> be<00:00:57.850> surprised<00:00:58.210> if<00:00:58.359> I<00:00:58.510> came<00:00:58.809> up<00:00:58.960> with

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
wouldn't be surprised if I came up with

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:00.810 
wouldn't be surprised if I came up with
negative<00:00:59.320> numbers<00:00:59.620> even<00:01:00.190> if<00:01:00.399> that's<00:01:00.579> possible

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
negative numbers even if that's possible

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.840 
negative numbers even if that's possible
i<00:01:01.179> don't<00:01:01.329> know<00:01:01.420> if<00:01:01.480> there's<00:01:01.659> 100<00:01:01.989> jobs<00:01:02.850> anyway

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
i don't know if there's 100 jobs anyway

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.270 
i don't know if there's 100 jobs anyway
i'll<00:01:04.210> switch<00:01:04.839> to<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:06.220> so<00:01:07.440> switch<00:01:08.440> to<00:01:08.770> that<00:01:08.950> so

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
i'll switch to that so switch to that so

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:23.210 
i'll switch to that so switch to that so
you<00:01:09.370> can<00:01:09.490> see<00:01:09.700> better<00:01:09.820> and<00:01:10.590> here<00:01:11.590> we<00:01:11.620> go<00:01:15.030> fail

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.910 

okay<00:01:23.910> got<00:01:24.120> that<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.810> one's<00:01:25.020> tricky<00:01:25.410> can<00:01:25.800> be

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
okay got that this one's tricky can be

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.040 
okay got that this one's tricky can be
careful<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.550> when<00:01:27.180> i<00:01:27.210> record<00:01:27.780> there<00:01:28.020> is

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
careful and when i record there is

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.040 
careful and when i record there is
slight<00:01:28.650> lag<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.310> it's<00:01:29.850> not<00:01:29.970> as<00:01:30.120> easy<00:01:30.300> I'm<00:01:30.870> not

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
slight lag so it's not as easy I'm not

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.510 
slight lag so it's not as easy I'm not
going<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.290> use<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.410> as<00:01:31.740> an<00:01:31.890> excuse<00:01:32.310> though

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
going to use that as an excuse though

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.000 
going to use that as an excuse though
because<00:01:33.180> that's<00:01:33.690> just<00:01:33.990> unfair<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.740> use<00:01:34.830> that

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
because that's just unfair to use that

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:50.810 
because that's just unfair to use that
excuse<00:01:36.830> okay<00:01:46.460> okay<00:01:47.930> that<00:01:49.070> this<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.280> tricky

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
excuse okay okay that this is a tricky

00:01:50.820 --> 00:02:06.710 
excuse okay okay that this is a tricky
another<00:01:51.060> tricky<00:01:51.420> one<00:01:51.570> here<00:01:55.970> yes<00:02:00.320> got<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:05.720> see

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
another tricky one here yes got that see

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.639 
another tricky one here yes got that see
if<00:02:06.810> i<00:02:06.869> can<00:02:06.990> get<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.170> here<00:02:08.270> got<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.420> okay<00:02:10.320> so<00:02:10.380> i

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
if i can get this here got it okay so i

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.190 
if i can get this here got it okay so i
think<00:02:10.890> that's<00:02:11.160> one<00:02:11.430> fail<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:12.030> far<00:02:12.270> i'm<00:02:12.930> not
