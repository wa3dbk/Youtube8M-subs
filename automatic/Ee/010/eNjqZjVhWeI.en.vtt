just<00:02:28.900> it<00:02:29.050> is<00:02:29.200> not<00:02:29.440> really<00:02:29.830> set<00:02:30.520> and<00:02:31.210> also<00:02:31.720> the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
just it is not really set and also the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.220 
just it is not really set and also the
relationship<00:02:32.560> between<00:02:32.710> Russia<00:02:33.160> and

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
NATO is also one problem so I think of

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.440 
NATO is also one problem so I think of
us<00:02:38.040> as<00:02:38.069> a<00:02:38.690> strategy<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.720> today<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:41.069> major

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
us as a strategy to today that the major

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.420 
us as a strategy to today that the major
direction<00:02:42.450> of<00:02:42.629> a<00:02:42.659> 30<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.530> certainly<00:02:44.099> is

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
direction of a 30 and certainly is

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.809 
direction of a 30 and certainly is
immersed<00:02:45.140> in<00:02:46.140> at<00:02:46.319> least<00:02:46.470> as<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:46.890> doctor<00:02:47.430> charges
