00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
magnetic catch but apparently doesn't

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.270 
magnetic catch but apparently doesn't
like<00:05:19.260> convert<00:05:19.530> its<00:05:19.650> light<00:05:19.800> too<00:05:19.920> much<00:05:20.070> let's<00:05:20.250> go

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
like convert its light too much let's go

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.380 
like convert its light too much let's go
ahead<00:05:20.370> and<00:05:20.520> put<00:05:20.610> it<00:05:20.670> down<00:05:20.790> go<00:05:20.970> ahead<00:05:21.000> and<00:05:21.270> arrow

ahead and put it down go ahead and arrow
down<00:05:21.570> arrow<00:05:21.870> speeds

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
down arrow speeds

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.840 
down arrow speeds
scoot<00:05:22.680> back<00:05:22.710> little<00:05:23.130> different<00:05:23.430> at<00:05:23.550> she's<00:05:23.700> not

all<00:05:37.530> right<00:05:37.710> well<00:05:38.190> guys<00:05:38.400> I<00:05:38.730> got<00:05:39.120> a<00:05:39.150> safe<00:05:39.480> besides

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
all right well guys I got a safe besides

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.360 
all right well guys I got a safe besides
losing<00:05:40.080> the<00:05:40.260> hatch<00:05:40.440> it's<00:05:40.680> a<00:05:40.740> very<00:05:40.950> very<00:05:41.190> nice

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
losing the hatch it's a very very nice

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.520 
losing the hatch it's a very very nice
line<00:05:41.640> that<00:05:41.940> I<00:05:42.180> want<00:05:42.810> to<00:05:42.930> say<00:05:43.020> playing<00:05:43.290> but<00:05:43.440> it's

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
line that I want to say playing but it's

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.260 
line that I want to say playing but it's
actually<00:05:43.800> a<00:05:43.830> jet<00:05:44.130> it's<00:05:44.430> a<00:05:44.490> very<00:05:44.670> nice<00:05:44.790> fine<00:05:45.030> jet

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
actually a jet it's a very nice fine jet

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.210 
actually a jet it's a very nice fine jet
it's<00:05:45.420> fast<00:05:45.720> but<00:05:46.080> it's<00:05:46.230> agile<00:05:46.470> it's<00:05:46.830> easy<00:05:47.040> to

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
it's fast but it's agile it's easy to

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.810 
it's fast but it's agile it's easy to
control

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
control

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.820 
control
I<00:05:47.850> love<00:05:48.420> the<00:05:48.540> takeoff<00:05:48.870> the<00:05:49.020> way<00:05:49.140> handles<00:05:49.470> it's

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
I love the takeoff the way handles it's

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:50.870 
I love the takeoff the way handles it's
actually<00:05:50.070> towed<00:05:50.220> out<00:05:50.370> a<00:05:50.400> little<00:05:50.580> bit<00:05:50.760> so<00:05:50.790> I

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
actually towed out a little bit so I

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.650 
actually towed out a little bit so I
think<00:05:50.940> it<00:05:51.120> gives<00:05:51.210> a<00:05:51.300> little<00:05:51.450> bit<00:05:51.540> more

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
think it gives a little bit more

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.150 
think it gives a little bit more
stability<00:05:51.780> on<00:05:52.080> the<00:05:52.230> ground<00:05:52.470> okay<00:05:52.920> because

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
stability on the ground okay because

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.230 
stability on the ground okay because
landings<00:05:53.520> and<00:05:53.580> takeoffs<00:05:53.640> are<00:05:54.030> very

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
landings and takeoffs are very

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.560 
landings and takeoffs are very
uneventful<00:05:54.510> and<00:05:55.020> I<00:05:55.860> like<00:05:56.490> it<00:05:56.700> as<00:05:57.240> far<00:05:57.420> as<00:05:57.450> the

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
uneventful and I like it as far as the

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:58.730 
uneventful and I like it as far as the
hatch<00:05:57.690> goes<00:05:57.900> I<00:05:57.990> think<00:05:58.170> I<00:05:58.260> know<00:05:58.320> why<00:05:58.530> I<00:05:58.560> did<00:05:58.680> it

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
hatch goes I think I know why I did it

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.590 
hatch goes I think I know why I did it
when<00:05:59.130> I<00:05:59.160> put<00:05:59.340> the<00:05:59.430> battery<00:05:59.730> in<00:05:59.880> I<00:06:00.030> had<00:06:00.240> the<00:06:00.390> part

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
when I put the battery in I had the part

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.700 
when I put the battery in I had the part
where<00:06:00.690> the<00:06:00.750> battery<00:06:01.050> lead<00:06:01.290> was<00:06:01.440> coming<00:06:01.650> out

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
where the battery lead was coming out

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:02.930 
where the battery lead was coming out
the<00:06:01.770> battery<00:06:02.040> sticking<00:06:02.280> straight<00:06:02.460> up<00:06:02.550> is

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
the battery sticking straight up is

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.250 
the battery sticking straight up is
pushing<00:06:03.330> against<00:06:03.510> the<00:06:03.570> hatch<00:06:03.780> I<00:06:03.930> just<00:06:04.080> kind<00:06:04.230> of

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
pushing against the hatch I just kind of

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.450 
pushing against the hatch I just kind of
pushed<00:06:04.500> it<00:06:04.620> down<00:06:04.740> real<00:06:04.950> hard<00:06:04.980> thinking<00:06:05.400> it

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
pushed it down real hard thinking it

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.640 
pushed it down real hard thinking it
would<00:06:05.550> be<00:06:05.580> enough<00:06:05.850> so<00:06:06.690> it's<00:06:06.810> your<00:06:06.960> fault<00:06:07.110> yeah

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
would be enough so it's your fault yeah

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.080 
would be enough so it's your fault yeah
I'm<00:06:07.890> going<00:06:08.100> to<00:06:08.130> actually<00:06:08.280> clean<00:06:08.640> this<00:06:08.820> one<00:06:09.030> a

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
I'm going to actually clean this one a

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.760 
I'm going to actually clean this one a
little<00:06:09.240> bit<00:06:09.390> when<00:06:10.080> I<00:06:10.140> roll<00:06:10.320> it<00:06:10.470> upside<00:06:10.740> down

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
little bit when I roll it upside down

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.260 
little bit when I roll it upside down
and<00:06:10.890> pull<00:06:11.220> a<00:06:11.250> little<00:06:11.430> bit<00:06:11.520> of<00:06:11.670> negative<00:06:11.760> Jesus

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
and pull a little bit of negative Jesus

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.160 
and pull a little bit of negative Jesus
probably<00:06:12.450> it's<00:06:12.660> enough<00:06:12.810> to<00:06:12.900> make<00:06:13.020> that

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.170 
probably it's enough to make that

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.990 
probably it's enough to make that
battery<00:06:13.470> push<00:06:13.680> on<00:06:13.830> that<00:06:13.920> hatch<00:06:14.130> so<00:06:14.400> well<00:06:14.970> I

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
battery push on that hatch so well I

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.640 
battery push on that hatch so well I

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
battery most big four cell battery packs

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.830 
battery most big four cell battery packs
have<00:06:20.430> leads<00:06:20.670> going<00:06:20.850> on<00:06:20.940> the<00:06:21.000> side<00:06:21.180> don't<00:06:21.660> point
