00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.160 
they should fit without any adhesive I'm
thinking<00:02:35.519> because<00:02:35.700> we<00:02:36.150> did<00:02:36.629> it<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.810> month<00:02:36.840> ago

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
thinking because we did it a month ago

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.170 
thinking because we did it a month ago
and<00:02:37.379> I<00:02:37.440> don't<00:02:37.500> think<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:38.010> my<00:02:38.129> gums<00:02:38.370> would

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
and I don't think that my gums would

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.210 
and I don't think that my gums would
have<00:02:39.269> changed<00:02:39.599> that<00:02:39.780> much<00:02:39.989> in<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.290> month<00:02:40.470> I<00:02:40.799> just

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
have changed that much in a month I just

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.380 
have changed that much in a month I just
say<00:02:41.280> they<00:02:41.430> don't<00:02:41.489> change<00:02:41.849> a<00:02:42.060> lot<00:02:42.180> in<00:02:42.239> the

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
say they don't change a lot in the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.270 
say they don't change a lot in the
months<00:02:42.690> it's<00:02:42.840> rewind<00:02:43.379> back<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:43.769> when<00:02:44.069> I<00:02:44.099> had

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
months it's rewind back to when I had

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.449 
months it's rewind back to when I had
this<00:02:44.430> done<00:02:44.700> in<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.660> end<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:45.870> October<00:02:46.459> last
