based and I thought that I was going to
have<00:01:31.050> a<00:01:31.080> big<00:01:31.260> problem<00:01:31.560> with<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.130> but<00:01:32.910> when<00:01:33.720> i

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
have a big problem with that but when i

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.810

found out that I'd received more in
scholarships<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.240> thought<00:01:39.480> I<00:01:39.510> was<00:01:39.780> going

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930
