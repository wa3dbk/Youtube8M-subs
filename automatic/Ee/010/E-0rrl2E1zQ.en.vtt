unsuitable gear spawn point we'll go

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.140 
unsuitable gear spawn point we'll go
back<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.980> where<00:02:20.159> it<00:02:20.189> first<00:02:20.549> was<00:02:20.819> so<00:02:21.090> you

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
back to where it first was so you

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.429 
back to where it first was so you
probably<00:02:21.540> don't<00:02:21.750> want<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:21.930> be<00:02:22.019> messing<00:02:22.200> around

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:22.439 
probably don't want to be messing around

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.890 
probably don't want to be messing around
with<00:02:22.680> this<00:02:22.829> now<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:23.790> tried<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:24.209> over<00:02:24.420> here<00:02:24.689> it

with this now I tried it over here it

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.509 
with this now I tried it over here it
didn't<00:02:25.170> work<00:02:25.379> probably<00:02:25.769> because<00:02:26.159> there<00:02:26.370> was<00:02:26.489> a

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
didn't work probably because there was a

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.420 
didn't work probably because there was a
