00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
it's a good method for the tank is you

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.340 
it's a good method for the tank is you
try<00:04:17.549> to<00:04:17.730> get<00:04:17.970> them<00:04:18.120> on<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.600> shot<00:04:18.840> you<00:04:19.049> try<00:04:19.290> to

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
bounce them up and then hopefully you

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.970 
bounce them up and then hopefully you
can<00:04:21.060> tank<00:04:21.630> smash<00:04:21.989> and<00:04:22.260> right<00:04:22.500> before<00:04:22.680> they

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
can tank smash and right before they

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:33.270
