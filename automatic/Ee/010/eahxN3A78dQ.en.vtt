00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 and now I greet ingo niebel analyst 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.549
 international that accompanies us from the 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.080
 German city of colony to board 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.019
 precisely this issue the crisis 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.550
 politics in ukraine welcome and good to 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.920
 What are these tensions? 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.960
 enormous tension over ukraine among the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.789
 Western powers and Russia we know of 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.710
 background that there is also this subject 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.699
 related of course with the control 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.699
 of natural resources 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:30.600
 well here we see first of all a shock of 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:33.900
 two different geostrategic projects 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.430
 USA declared with the 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.280
 dissolution of the Soviet Union that 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.290
 I never wanted to have a Russian 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.440
 strong as 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.840
 in the middle of the last century and until 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.180
 a certain point then he got up to here the 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.450
 president putin take the triplets of 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:56.560
 moscow putin for his part defends the 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:01:00.489
 idea of ​​a Eurasian union in the 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:03.970
 which incidentally played us the most 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:06.160
 important and this idea is also shocked 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.740
 with the idea of the European Union of 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.950
 expand to the east that's why 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.710
 negotiations were in between 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.590
 so that ukraine enter the union 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.990
 European in this case both the union 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:25.300
 European Union as NATO controlled by 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:27.790
 USA are facing Russia and in this case 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.150
 the meeting point the point 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:35.270
 conflictive is ukraine that previously 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.770
 It has been Syrian but now it is Ukraine 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.119
 and he thinks there will be an intervention 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.859
 Russian military and as a result let's say 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.469
 be the prelude to a possible new 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:50.390
 cold war 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:52.520
 good the current situation is high 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.619
 tension the minister of affairs 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.140
 German exteriors this morning just 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.890
 say right now no press conference that 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:04.189
 any incident with the most stupid 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.670
 because it could be could trigger 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:09.950
 a series of events that nobody 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.980
 wants therefore it is to be expected that 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.140
 find an international forum where 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.890
 all the parties involved in this 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.620
 conflict can sit down and negotiate a 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.069
 exit from this situation regarding the 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.500
 Cold War in fact we are already 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:31.340
 in a new cold war towards russia 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.470
 because the rejection by the union 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.540
 European in general is from the NATO and 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.830
 also from germany in particular by 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.850
 example 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:46.160
 is notorious towards the president 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:49.520
 putin or towards russia and therefore already 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.620
 there is a new cold war 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.210
 the question is whether it is now cold war 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.220
 it becomes a hot war 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.200
 what do Ukrainians want to those 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.160
 heights what do they want or what do they 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.100
 it is better for the people of Ukraine 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.490
 well I think that from here we are going to 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.390
 ukraine very divided one part are 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.370
 those who currently rule in Kiev 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:18.780
 those three factors the neo-Nazis of 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.810
 then there is the timochenko group and 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.660
 then the boxer klichkó very close to 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.360
 German government that have their agenda is 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.240
 an agenda to bring Ukraine to the 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.690
 European Union to NATO therefore and 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:37.590
 Russia distance of waiting or 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:41.340
 selling this model as an improvement of 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:44.220
 economic daily life and such that is 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.770
 to doubt that there we see just as 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.470
 we are currently in the Balkans and other 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.230
 part is the population in the east 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.760
 Ukrainian woman who is suddenly threatened 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.610
 by a series of decrees that have been 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.620
 taken in Kiev for example by prohibiting 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.950
 the use of the Russian language 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:06.790
 in the eastern areas of the country and that 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:09.730
 by the way they see if attacked by these 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:15.459
 measures that this government has decreed 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:16.660
 of dubious political legitimacy 59 the 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.989
 analyst and thanks for this 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.989
 participation
