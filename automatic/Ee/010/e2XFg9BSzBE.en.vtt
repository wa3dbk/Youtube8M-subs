00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello people today there is even a little 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.270
 other video than usual and that is true 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.429
 yes that I have been back for some time 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.960
 am back from australia and me 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.240
 lately have really many people 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.070
 asked how that was really what 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.299
 i made and experienced this way in australia 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.369
 I have and how I do it all 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.990
 and I already have 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.640
 always something like a dream he live 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.570
 I wanted to do that 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.980
 Just do it for this occasion 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.029
 over and now you have to be very short 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.689
 wait does not want to sign 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.930
 after a dream come a beer and 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.450
 That's why we start with it 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.070
 It all started in October 2013 as 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.050
 I started a little bit of iodine and 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.879
 actually pretty happy with it 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.170
 because people do not want and it has 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.899
 I actually enjoyed it 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.579
 then , however, is a friend of 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.620
 I know me from school 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.850
 Australia flew and I wanted that 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.050
 actually always do 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.670
 I started over it again 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.039
 to think and often stood before me 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.030
 my window and thought so 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.219
 actually you should now in too 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.020
 be australia 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.070
 I often sat down from the computer and got stuck 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.989
 me videos about work and travel 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.210
 looked at or on the website 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.189
 my organization on the way and everything 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.710
 What I asked myself, what should I do 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.970
 really do that and change everything 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.310
 In any case, I have in the end 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.900
 made and I remember exactly like me 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.119
 at that time on this login button 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.659
 clicked and thus for seven 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.119
 months should change everything 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.679
 as of 4 december 2013, things went well 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.600
 Go ahead and I'm on the plane 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:27.950
 flew over dubai to sydney 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.329
 of course my parents have 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.490
 airport pretty stupid from the laundry 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.899
 looked but I was actually pretty 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.280
 good things and got me on that 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.380
 happy what came 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.670
 is then when I was sitting in the plane 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.619
 I first became so conscious 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.850
 what I'm doing here and where I am 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.440
 care and that is actually 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.850
 not at all know how to go on 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.560
 to when I'm only times a sidney 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.370
 everything I thought of what 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.510
 Are you actually here? 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.430
 on the sixth of december i will be in 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.830
 Sidney landed and I remember that 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.840
 it has been 14 degrees outside and that 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.580
 in midsummer than me but then 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.230
 I saw the first palm trees 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.540
 get back in a good mood because 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.180
 I somehow get in a good mood if 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.890
 I would not be the same 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.930
 on the first day we had such an info 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.700
 We were told how best we are 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.010
 find jobs and where we are best 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.540
 should go and I have nothing of it 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.240
 I realized because of the jet lag 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.950
 The first one fell asleep all the time 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.840
 week in sidney was really cool us 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.540
 have seen the blue mountains 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.209
 the opera house looked at us or the 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.190
 harbor bridge admired and yes that for 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.500
 a week and then let it be now 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.150
 it is serious then I first on the 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.650
 looked at calendar and I am aware 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.450
 It has only been a few days 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.730
 until Christmas and were over 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.459
 Christmas is fully booked 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.930
 yes and then I realized that too 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.610
 I still had no job and myself 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.230
 had to take care of slower but what 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.150
 was pretty difficult 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.830
 I was pretty frustrated and have me 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.830
 Therefore, then a looping bought high 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.659
 and I after a long search finally 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.580
 found the shop that sold me 1 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.989
 then I was finally back 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.390
 happy because i hope again 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.340
 I still had to draw 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.049
 that in a week from the hostel 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.360
 No need to go out yet 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.010
 has a clue where it should go than me 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.750
 then with my friends from the hostel 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.250
 I was on the beach or in the city 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.959
 the only one with a bad mood because 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.489
 I thought all the time 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.200
 I only had one more week and then 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.569
 I'm probably sitting in the street 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.980
 I have the complete book afterwards 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:26.450
 scoured and raised everywhere 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.450
 where I could have called 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.099
 But perhaps the pretty 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.340
 frustrating because the only thing I have 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:35.370
 got from the people were to cancel and 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.170
 I did not hear more than no 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.640
 Two days before I get out of the hoster 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.680
 I had but then a call 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.900
 and I was told yes you 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.440
 Can you come and I was something 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.440
 by happy 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.010
 I immediately got my train ticket 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.990
 bought for the train with nine hours 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.370
 long moved to the pampa has been 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.780
 but I really did not care then because I knew 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.850
 I come with somewhere 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.410
 as then, however , always sat in the train 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.120
 realized that I am at all 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.340
 I do not know where I can go 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.660
 because how are people so I 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.050
 I wondered again what I am here so 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.050
 do 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.130
 when I got off the train 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.380
 I have three really nice ones right now 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.730
 German greeted my lord welcome 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.650
 in Berlin 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.930
 and here I had them pretty nice too 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.000
 and that's why I am 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.510
 sincerely followed and thought 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.310
 now everything can be okay 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.930
 they had their own little one with us 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.669
 beginning of which we should live 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.539
 and standing on stilts to be 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:38.240
 thought it was pretty cool and thought so 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:40.699
 I'm so cool man have your own 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.710
 Take a hut with a partner and do that 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:45.030
 Hotel really funky he 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.400
 I'm certainly not behind with 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.890
 draw our own hut stands there 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.090
 if you can not read ours 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.130
 hut he was pretty sparse 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.210
 furnished and more than one mattress 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.050
 and I had the chair in my room 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.850
 not standing 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.410
 now comes a part of something 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.820
 was unpleasant because it came to a 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.530
 misunderstanding as I mean with mine 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.420
 Parents had telephoned and meant 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.130
 Incidentally, the one of the 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.810
 Threes a bit thicker what I'm in 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.220
 the moment absolutely not meant evil 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.480
 I had just thought 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.760
 maybe my parents want a 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.320
 make picture of the three and yes the 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.580
 three Germans have that completely 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.200
 got in the wrong neck and 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.270
 I thought I wanted to discriminate against them 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.710
 And what about fat people but what 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.270
 It's completely nonsense because I used to be 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.220
 itself was not so slim 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.440
 the Germans had that, of course 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.660
 immediately the little daughter of the family 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.870
 petted and then said something to her 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.360
 like yes he said we will all fit 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.650
 and can not stand it at all 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.969
 Of course, the daughter then has 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.280
 immediately cleaned the mother and on 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:40.080
 The next day I had a conversation and 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.090
 I was asked why I was such a bad one 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.460
 things would say and I was totally 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.259
 horrified I first thought bright who 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.490
 thinks so much in any case 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:49.259
 I try to explain that it 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.699
 did not vote at all and am 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:52.610
 then immediately to the German 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.810
 gone to clarify that 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.280
 Unfortunately, they have them at all 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.810
 not to be talked with and were 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.219
 just mad at me what i did 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.719
 I did not understand at all 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:02.370
 actually nothing bad wanted 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:03.990
 I then tried it too 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.120
 explain and meant that it at all 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.250
 I did not mean that I did 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.229
 do not even find anything against 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.979
 fat people have that it really 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:12.479
 completely nonsense 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:14.099
 the german farmers and mine 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:15.599
 Sorry not so enthusiastic and 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:16.080
 have me pretty much left then 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:17.879
 to let 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.469
 After a few days at which the three 

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:21.210
 had not talked to me at all 

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:23.550
 Then they suddenly arrived and 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.259
 meant that suddenly the rainwater 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.250
 all who we deal with all the time 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:28.229
 had showered 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.150
 Of course I was a bit confused 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:31.780
 and asked yes and where should we go 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:35.050
 then wash us now 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:37.360
 and what was said in the back plus 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.160
 done but the only thing the three 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.120
 had always been done when 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.669
 I was what he wanted 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.560
 to go under the house and the pump 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:46.510
 Exhibit and we pretend therefore 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.980
 that we had no water I 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.500
 have the whole month later 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.120
 found out but still I have 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.280
 I thought at this moment how can 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.050
 a human being just so mean 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.120
 After two weeks, the family is in 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.650
 the holidays drove and I had to me 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.480
 luckily, have another search 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.910
 one found in the same red 

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.860
 then I wanted to let out and me 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:07.930
 sat on a park bench in front of one 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.180
 Supermarket with all my luggage and 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.650
 was more than frustrated i thought so 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.110
 I just have to try it again 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:16.120
 but I really did not feel like it 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.200
 then i sat in front of this supermarket and 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.120
 all people have me pretty much 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.880
 funny looked at as suddenly 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:24.100
 Car came by and got away from this 

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.500
 time has changed everything because 

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.800
 then i have my real host family 

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.800
