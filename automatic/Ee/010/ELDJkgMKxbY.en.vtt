Harvey<00:03:21.600> beaks<00:03:21.930> it's<00:03:22.230> something<00:03:22.620> wrong<00:03:22.830> even

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
Harvey beaks it's something wrong even

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.640 
Harvey beaks it's something wrong even
though<00:03:23.430> he<00:03:23.910> has<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.959> writing<00:03:25.380> was<00:03:25.560> very

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
though he has it the writing was very

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.100 
though he has it the writing was very
well<00:03:26.070> done<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.880> episode<00:03:27.299> as<00:03:27.570> a<00:03:27.600> whole<00:03:27.930> is

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
well done the episode as a whole is

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.740 
well done the episode as a whole is
variable<00:03:28.590> executed<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:29.820> I<00:03:30.239> thought<00:03:30.480> it<00:03:30.600> was

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
variable executed and I thought it was

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.780 
variable executed and I thought it was
just<00:03:30.930> really<00:03:31.049> creative<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:32.010> I<00:03:32.130> do<00:03:32.190> think<00:03:32.640> the

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
just really creative and I do think the

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.660 
just really creative and I do think the
characters<00:03:33.540> for<00:03:34.260> how<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:34.470> see<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.250> this<00:03:35.340> part

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
characters for how I see and this part

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.180 
characters for how I see and this part
up<00:03:35.820> is<00:03:36.000> so<00:03:36.209> they<00:03:36.450> have<00:03:36.660> a<00:03:36.690> nice<00:03:37.170> wide<00:03:37.739> spread<00:03:38.160> of

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
up is so they have a nice wide spread of

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.370 
up is so they have a nice wide spread of
personalities<00:03:39.120> to<00:03:39.329> them<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:39.750> that's

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
personalities to them and that's

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.830 
personalities to them and that's

and the rest of the crew for the only

and the rest of the crew for the only
flaws<00:03:45.299> I<00:03:45.570> would<00:03:45.810> say<00:03:46.110> I<00:03:46.140> have<00:03:46.500> with<00:03:46.860> this

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
flaws I would say I have with this

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.090 
flaws I would say I have with this
pairing<00:03:47.850> is<00:03:48.090> just<00:03:48.420> that<00:03:48.660> Harvey<00:03:49.230> bigs<00:03:49.650> going

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
pairing is just that Harvey bigs going

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.600 
pairing is just that Harvey bigs going
crazy<00:03:50.610> near<00:03:51.269> the<00:03:51.390> end<00:03:51.630> I<00:03:52.019> thought<00:03:52.680> it<00:03:52.829> got<00:03:53.100> way

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
crazy near the end I thought it got way

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.640 
crazy near the end I thought it got way
too<00:03:53.640> over-the-top<00:03:54.239> but<00:03:54.989> I<00:03:55.110> really<00:03:55.380> didn't

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
too over-the-top but I really didn't

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.350 
too over-the-top but I really didn't
like<00:03:55.829> that<00:03:56.070> I<00:03:56.130> found<00:03:56.549> it<00:03:56.700> rather<00:03:56.850> unnecessary

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
like that I found it rather unnecessary

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.110 
like that I found it rather unnecessary
and<00:03:58.290> I<00:03:58.410> do<00:03:58.470> think<00:03:59.100> it<00:03:59.250> was<00:03:59.400> a<00:03:59.459> little<00:03:59.790> stupid

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
and I do think it was a little stupid

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.810 
and I do think it was a little stupid
that<00:04:00.630> Harvey<00:04:01.230> had<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.650> go<00:04:01.890> through<00:04:02.250> this<00:04:02.459> much

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
that Harvey had to go through this much

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.789 
that Harvey had to go through this much
trouble<00:04:03.500> just<00:04:04.500> so<00:04:04.680> he<00:04:05.040> can<00:04:05.310> get<00:04:05.489> banned<00:04:06.060> and

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
trouble just so he can get banned and

from<00:04:59.320> kachou<00:04:59.950> I<00:05:00.250> really<00:05:00.910> don't<00:05:01.150> think<00:05:01.240> this

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
from kachou I really don't think this

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.650 
from kachou I really don't think this
was<00:05:01.780> as<00:05:01.930> good<00:05:02.200> as<00:05:02.320> pachoo<00:05:02.890> it<00:05:03.340> was<00:05:03.670> a<00:05:03.700> pretty

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
was as good as pachoo it was a pretty

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.340 
was as good as pachoo it was a pretty
lacking<00:05:05.470> episode<00:05:06.220> overall<00:05:07.210> it's<00:05:07.540> not<00:05:07.750> too<00:05:07.930> bad

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
lacking episode overall it's not too bad

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.490 
lacking episode overall it's not too bad
it's<00:05:08.740> a<00:05:08.890> watchable<00:05:09.580> episode<00:05:10.330> it<00:05:10.540> really<00:05:10.810> is<00:05:11.110> I

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
it's a watchable episode it really is I

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.670 
it's a watchable episode it really is I
think<00:05:11.950> it<00:05:12.100> is<00:05:12.250> a<00:05:12.330> well-made<00:05:13.330> episode<00:05:14.200> but

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
think it is a well-made episode but

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.740 
think it is a well-made episode but
there<00:05:15.190> was<00:05:15.310> just<00:05:15.490> something<00:05:15.730> very<00:05:16.150> lacking

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
there was just something very lacking

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.050 
there was just something very lacking
about<00:05:17.140> the<00:05:17.350> spanning<00:05:17.800> tree<00:05:17.830> one<00:05:18.669> thing<00:05:18.880> for

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
about the spanning tree one thing for

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.390 
about the spanning tree one thing for
sure<00:05:19.120> the<00:05:19.750> whole<00:05:19.960> spinning<00:05:20.740> in<00:05:20.830> the<00:05:20.950> beginning

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
sure the whole spinning in the beginning

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.450 
sure the whole spinning in the beginning
of<00:05:21.610> this<00:05:21.730> episode<00:05:22.169> yeah<00:05:23.169> it<00:05:23.650> was<00:05:23.830> really<00:05:24.010> gross

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
of this episode yeah it was really gross

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.950 
of this episode yeah it was really gross
I'm<00:05:24.790> just<00:05:24.970> thought<00:05:25.090> it<00:05:25.180> wasn't<00:05:25.480> the<00:05:25.570> entire

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
I'm just thought it wasn't the entire

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.110 
I'm just thought it wasn't the entire
episode<00:05:26.560> otherwise<00:05:27.070> I<00:05:27.460> probably<00:05:27.790> would<00:05:28.000> have

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
episode otherwise I probably would have

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.780 
episode otherwise I probably would have
joined<00:05:28.330> this<00:05:28.570> episode<00:05:29.169> a<00:05:29.350> lot<00:05:29.740> less<00:05:30.190> the

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
joined this episode a lot less the

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.230 
joined this episode a lot less the

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
episode two was very lacking and humor a

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.719 
episode two was very lacking and humor a
lot<00:05:34.540> of<00:05:34.630> jokes<00:05:34.930> in<00:05:35.110> the<00:05:35.320> episode<00:05:35.890> pachoo<00:05:36.370> it

feel<00:06:04.810> like<00:06:04.990> this<00:06:05.169> episode<00:06:05.560> does<00:06:06.130> get<00:06:06.490> a<00:06:06.520> little

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
feel like this episode does get a little

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.270 
feel like this episode does get a little
boring<00:06:07.330> but<00:06:07.780> when<00:06:08.320> it<00:06:08.500> don't<00:06:08.830> get<00:06:08.979> to<00:06:09.160> the

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 
boring but when it don't get to the

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.850 
boring but when it don't get to the
ending<00:06:09.790> the<00:06:09.940> episode<00:06:10.300> is<00:06:10.810> very<00:06:11.260> heartwarming

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:16.510 
it is very cute I say the ending would

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.969
