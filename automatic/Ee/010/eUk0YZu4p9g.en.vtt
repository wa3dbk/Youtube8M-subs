00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.469 
that's a good fish my guess is the waste
fight<00:05:46.960> it's<00:05:47.169> gonna<00:05:47.259> be<00:05:47.440> a<00:05:47.470> male<00:05:47.770> steelhead

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
fight it's gonna be a male steelhead

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:51.480 
fight it's gonna be a male steelhead
just<00:05:49.479> because<00:05:49.810> he's<00:05:49.990> he's<00:05:50.949> really<00:05:51.280> fighting

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
just because he's he's really fighting

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.430 
just because he's he's really fighting
hard<00:05:51.880> tonight<00:05:52.509> I'd<00:05:52.720> say<00:05:52.930> about<00:05:53.020> an<00:05:53.259> eight

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
hard tonight I'd say about an eight

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.040 
hard tonight I'd say about an eight
pounder<00:05:53.860> that'd<00:05:54.789> be<00:05:54.909> my<00:05:55.030> guess<00:05:55.060> if<00:05:55.780> it's<00:05:55.990> a

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
pounder that'd be my guess if it's a

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.510 
pounder that'd be my guess if it's a
brown<00:05:56.260> that's<00:05:56.620> definitely<00:05:57.039> gonna<00:05:57.130> be<00:05:57.220> bigger

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
brown that's definitely gonna be bigger

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.290 
brown that's definitely gonna be bigger
