00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.849
 a greeting to all friends immunity 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.609
 nor nexus lab 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:25.130
 welcome back to this un one box of mi one 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:28.220
 east and the second terminal built by 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.949
 xiaomi after last year's me 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.739
 one 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:36.650
 this year the terminal this version 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.930
 we say mi one has not been sent to us 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.800
 directly from xiaomi as it happened 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.629
 for his predecessor but we are due 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.989
 use an online store and 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:50.480
 buy it privately and in brackets 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:55.670
 we have not found either well 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.410
 with this Chinese store but this one 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.120
 maybe we'll talk about it later in 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:04.460
 italy we will also see some tips for 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:06.500
 avoid less reliable online shop 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.850
 but let's see what then 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.060
 It contains 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.380
 the package that has arrived to us 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.020
 as you can see the box is 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.660
 very simple behind we have the label 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.390
 with all the features mentioned 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.340
 we will discuss in our video 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.619
 review 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.420
 now I give you a little preview 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.890
 here it is one of xiaomi 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.170
 fortunately the phone is original 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.190
 we verified 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:40.369
 here is then the box the box is 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.880
 identical to the one we saw on 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:47.270
 juan 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:53.750
 so here we have the phone then 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:57.229
 we go to open we find data cable 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:04.340
 usb micro usb 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:07.640
 this is a usb adapter for the socket 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.770
 on the wall however this clearly uses 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.620
 the system 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:16.660
 Chinese and therefore we will need a 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:23.450
 adapter also this with the login or 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:30.800
 then we follow the classic little package 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:33.260
 with the manuals we see here all the 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.200
 the various installation instructions 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.450
 of the battery etc and we find in 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.680
 added in this version these 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:47.140
 librettos of a Chinese operator 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:51.140
 in fact our east newman is 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.450
 customized customized by one by one 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.630
 Chinese operator 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:00.920
 we will see in fact then he had animation 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:02.620
 and some features of the of the 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.830
 roms that have been customized 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.280
 operator 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:13.090
 this is the 1930 milian battery for 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:16.970
 now always the classic orange color 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:20.950
 so we live quickly and not there 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:24.080
 should be another ok perfect then 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.440
 let's take a look at our sia or mini 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.440
 one es 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:37.910
 here is everything identical form the le 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.709
 features features 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.300
 hardware as we have seen are 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.650
 slightly different though as far as 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.780
 it's about aesthetics 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.700
 as we can see by putting a 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.390
 comparison 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:54.210
 here it is with our Milan are the 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:58.050
 they are the only thing we can see 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:59.280
 a slight difference in gradation for 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.420
 regarding the rear bodywork 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.600
 always in lightly rubberized material 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:09.240
 here it is slightly more tending to 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:15.660
 gray while for new art in the version 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:17.370
 standard was completely black we find 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.790
 we also see small differences 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.220
 as for the speakers 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.810
 back but we'll analyze everything in 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.960
 detail then in ours 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:32.180
 videorecensione Now we open it 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:38.180
 second to make a first boot is found 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:38.180
 here we insert the battery 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:50.220
 we refuse our cover and start 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:53.190
 as you can see the initial logo 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:56.490
 so we remove the tissue 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:05:00.840
 here is their initial as I said and the 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:06.720
 butta animation are personalized by 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:11.460
 Chinese operator of which I do not dare to 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:15.450
 pronounce the name because he has no idea 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:18.630
 of how to pronounce and then 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:21.930
 coming to the screen 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:26.990
 here we are here we are as you can see 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:31.590
 then the rest of miui's rom is 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:35.700
 always the same is always what 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:41.600
 we see that normally on our own 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:43.670
 versions here 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.100
 we will go as already mentioned to analyze 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:49.340
 all in detail in the next 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.500
 video review for the moment vi 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.990
