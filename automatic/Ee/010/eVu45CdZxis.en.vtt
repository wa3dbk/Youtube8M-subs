00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
am I supposed to follow these arrows

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.970 
am I supposed to follow these arrows
they<00:03:34.220> just<00:03:34.400> keep<00:03:34.550> like<00:03:34.610> changing<00:03:35.480> I<00:03:35.770> guess<00:03:36.770> I'm

off me gravity anomaly gravitation sorry
gravitational<00:04:12.410> anomalies<00:04:13.300> look<00:04:14.300> like

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
gravitational anomalies look like

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.229 
gravitational anomalies look like

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
that and the thing about anomaly so

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.060 
that and the thing about anomaly so
fucking<00:05:01.130> know<00:05:01.280> it<00:05:01.310> was<00:05:01.610> starting<00:05:01.940> to<00:05:02.030> rough

really know yet i'll do a few of these

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.500 
really know yet i'll do a few of these
videos<00:05:29.390> pretty<00:05:29.900> quick<00:05:30.320> and<00:05:31.060> it<00:05:32.060> seems<00:05:32.300> pretty

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
videos pretty quick and it seems pretty

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.480 
videos pretty quick and it seems pretty
