00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
Cintiq HD so here we can see the two

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.609 
Cintiq HD so here we can see the two
slots<00:02:01.170> here<00:02:01.649> where<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.460> stand<00:02:03.350> will<00:02:04.350> mate

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
slots here where the stand will mate

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.819 
slots here where the stand will mate
with<00:02:04.860> me<00:02:05.100> with<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.790> tablet<00:02:06.240> here<00:02:06.530> so<00:02:07.530> let's<00:02:07.680> go

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
with me with the tablet here so let's go

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.889 
with me with the tablet here so let's go
ahead<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.429> continue<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.209> unboxing<00:02:09.720> here

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
ahead and continue the unboxing here

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.850 
ahead and continue the unboxing here
we're<00:02:10.020> going<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.200> lift<00:02:10.289> up<00:02:10.440> this<00:02:10.560> flap<00:02:10.830> here

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
we're going to lift up this flap here

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.730 
we're going to lift up this flap here
and<00:02:11.420> underneath<00:02:12.420> this<00:02:12.660> flap

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
and underneath this flap

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.600 
and underneath this flap
I'm<00:02:14.220> gonna<00:02:14.340> just<00:02:14.520> bend<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.910> back<00:02:15.120> here<00:02:16.520> what<00:02:17.520> we

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
I'm gonna just bend it back here what we

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.000 
I'm gonna just bend it back here what we
have<00:02:17.760> here<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.540> back<00:02:18.900> for<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.530> tablet

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
have here is the back for the tablet

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.280 
have here is the back for the tablet
essentially<00:02:20.550> it's<00:02:21.330> aluminum<00:02:21.810> with

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
essentially it's aluminum with

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.110 
essentially it's aluminum with
rubberized<00:02:22.740> edges<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.280> in<00:02:23.700> here<00:02:23.910> has<00:02:24.090> a

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
rubberized edges and in here has a

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.910 
rubberized edges and in here has a
various<00:02:24.750> different<00:02:25.080> tilt<00:02:25.530> setting<00:02:25.830> so

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
various different tilt setting so

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.590 
various different tilt setting so
obviously<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.400> can<00:02:26.430> set<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.790> down<00:02:26.820> flat<00:02:27.270> so<00:02:27.300> a

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
obviously you can set it down flat so a

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.050 
obviously you can set it down flat so a
zero<00:02:27.900> degree<00:02:28.260> but<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.220> can<00:02:29.400> also<00:02:29.520> set<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:29.940> up

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
zero degree but you can also set it up

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.810 
zero degree but you can also set it up
so<00:02:30.300> it'll<00:02:30.810> have<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.050> 22<00:02:31.470> degree<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:32.010> 35<00:02:32.580> degree

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
so it'll have a 22 degree a 35 degree

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.650 
so it'll have a 22 degree a 35 degree
and<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.390> 50<00:02:33.690> degree<00:02:33.830> tilt<00:02:35.090> so<00:02:36.090> let's<00:02:36.450> take<00:02:36.630> a

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
and a 50 degree tilt so let's take a

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.480 
and a 50 degree tilt so let's take a
look<00:02:36.870> at<00:02:37.020> now<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.200> accessories<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:37.980> come

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
look at now the accessories that come

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.440 
look at now the accessories that come
