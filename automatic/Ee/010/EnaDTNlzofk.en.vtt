they're just tired of it and now they
need<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.440> declawed<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.010> cats<00:02:14.280> at<00:02:15.270> an<00:02:15.480> older

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
need to declawed the cats at an older

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.729 
need to declawed the cats at an older
age<00:02:16.099> which<00:02:17.300> you<00:02:18.300> know<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.569> frustrating<00:02:19.260> for<00:02:19.560> me

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
age which you know is frustrating for me

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:20.990 
age which you know is frustrating for me
because<00:02:19.770> then<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.340> Kandice<00:02:20.640> going<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.849> have<00:02:20.970> a

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
because then the Kandice going to have a

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.449 
because then the Kandice going to have a
much<00:02:21.270> longer<00:02:21.510> recovery<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:22.860> think<00:02:23.040> we<00:02:23.310> need

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
much longer recovery so I think we need

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.220 
much longer recovery so I think we need
to<00:02:23.550> recognize<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:24.030> most<00:02:24.569> cats<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:25.200> a

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
to recognize that most cats it is a

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.030 
to recognize that most cats it is a
natural<00:02:25.770> behavior<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:27.060> claw<00:02:27.780> things<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.709> if<00:02:28.860> we

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
natural behavior to claw things so if we

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.860 
natural behavior to claw things so if we
take<00:02:29.520> care<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.819> that<00:02:29.910> early<00:02:30.239> just<00:02:30.510> like<00:02:30.630> we<00:02:30.750> do

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
take care of that early just like we do
