00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
dream and I feel so blessed that I found

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.560 
dream and I feel so blessed that I found
it<00:01:53.560> I<00:01:54.560> think<00:01:55.189> a<00:01:55.280> combination<00:01:55.969> of<00:01:56.090> willing<00:01:56.420> to

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
it I think a combination of willing to

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.870 
it I think a combination of willing to
work<00:01:56.749> hard<00:01:57.079> and<00:01:57.469> getting<00:01:58.070> some<00:01:58.399> good<00:01:58.640> breaks

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
work hard and getting some good breaks

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.620 
work hard and getting some good breaks
and<00:02:00.579> remembering<00:02:01.579> to<00:02:01.789> be<00:02:01.909> kind<00:02:02.469> along<00:02:03.469> the<00:02:03.619> way

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
and remembering to be kind along the way

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.760 
and remembering to be kind along the way
which<00:02:05.630> i<00:02:05.810> think<00:02:05.869> is<00:02:06.229> one<00:02:06.409> of<00:02:06.439> the<00:02:06.560> most

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
which i think is one of the most

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.080 
which i think is one of the most

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
me about bringing the miniseries from

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.229 
me about bringing the miniseries from
the<00:02:32.030> small<00:02:32.329> screen<00:02:32.359> to<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.079> big<00:02:33.260> screen<00:02:34.239> this

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
the small screen to the big screen this

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.629 
the small screen to the big screen this
is<00:02:35.389> this<00:02:35.840> is<00:02:36.049> a<00:02:36.079> journey<00:02:36.439> I<00:02:36.560> think<00:02:36.859> the<00:02:37.069> big

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:37.639 
is this is a journey I think the big

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:39.069 
is this is a journey I think the big
difference<00:02:37.670> would<00:02:38.060> be<00:02:38.120> probably<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.659> the

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
difference would be probably the the

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.009 
difference would be probably the the
Bible<00:02:39.409> it's<00:02:39.560> more<00:02:39.889> of<00:02:40.040> a<00:02:40.540> documentary<00:02:41.540> thing

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
Bible it's more of a documentary thing

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.009 
Bible it's more of a documentary thing
as<00:02:42.379> epic<00:02:43.069> story<00:02:43.400> of<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:43.969> whole<00:02:44.090> Bible<00:02:44.150> but

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
as epic story of the whole Bible but

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.399 
as epic story of the whole Bible but
this<00:02:45.230> is<00:02:45.409> a<00:02:45.439> more<00:02:45.769> personal<00:02:46.519> journey<00:02:47.150> of<00:02:47.780> the

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409 
this is a more personal journey of the

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:50.830 
this is a more personal journey of the
life<00:02:48.560> of<00:02:48.739> Jesus<00:02:49.129> and<00:02:49.419> bringing<00:02:50.419> the<00:02:50.689> audience

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
life of Jesus and bringing the audience

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.729 
life of Jesus and bringing the audience
closer<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:51.799> him<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.189> his<00:02:52.669> story<00:02:52.879> and<00:02:53.150> I<00:02:53.450> think

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
closer to him and his story and I think

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.740
