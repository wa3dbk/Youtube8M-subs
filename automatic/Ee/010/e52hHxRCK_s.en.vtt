the flag game mode now this is something

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.630 
the flag game mode now this is something
that<00:01:13.020> has<00:01:13.229> been<00:01:13.500> requested<00:01:13.830> for<00:01:14.189> quite<00:01:14.610> a

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
that has been requested for quite a

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.850 
that has been requested for quite a
while<00:01:14.909> from<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.570> battlefield<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.710> has

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
while from the battlefield is and it has

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.380 
while from the battlefield is and it has
been<00:01:17.070> something<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.490> has<00:01:17.640> been<00:01:17.970> used<00:01:18.180> in

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
been something that has been used in

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.170 
been something that has been used in
previous<00:01:18.570> titles<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.380> think<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.220> well<00:01:20.880> time

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
previous titles I think it is well time

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.120 
previous titles I think it is well time
I'm<00:01:21.570> pretty<00:01:21.990> surprised<00:01:22.409> actually<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.860> it

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
I'm pretty surprised actually that it

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.770 
I'm pretty surprised actually that it
wasn't<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.700> original<00:01:23.820> game<00:01:24.180> itself

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
wasn't in the original game itself

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.469 
wasn't in the original game itself
because<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.560> think<00:01:25.799> capture<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.280> flag<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.820> one

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
because I think capture the flag is one

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.330 
because I think capture the flag is one
of<00:01:27.600> them<00:01:27.720> game<00:01:28.080> types<00:01:28.409> they're<00:01:28.710> just<00:01:28.920> really<00:01:29.189> i

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
of them game types they're just really i

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.520 
of them game types they're just really i
think<00:01:29.520> would<00:01:29.850> really<00:01:29.909> suits<00:01:30.780> battlefield<00:01:31.320> and

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
think would really suits battlefield and

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.770 
think would really suits battlefield and
I'd<00:01:32.340> love<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.790> see<00:01:32.970> in<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.299> realms<00:01:33.689> of

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
are going to be jungle based maps so

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.730 
are going to be jungle based maps so
that<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.149> really<00:01:48.180> interesting<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.110> there's

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
that is really interesting and there's

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.289 
that is really interesting and there's
something<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.220> definitely<00:01:50.579> wanted<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.030> do

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299
