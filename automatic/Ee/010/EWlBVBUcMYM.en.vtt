head is on a ball-joint
showed<00:02:02.020> us<00:02:02.200> a<00:02:02.290> ball<00:02:02.470> hinge<00:02:02.710> how<00:02:03.610> was<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:03.909> ball

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
showed us a ball hinge how was the ball

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.920 
showed us a ball hinge how was the ball
hinge<00:02:04.920> then<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.100> hips<00:02:06.340> are<00:02:06.610> swivel<00:02:07.000> ball

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930

hinge then the hips are swivel ball
hinge<00:02:08.229> knees<00:02:08.850> and<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:10.360> tail<00:02:10.660> could<00:02:11.380> rotate

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
hinge knees and the tail could rotate

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.660 
hinge knees and the tail could rotate
it's<00:02:13.300> a<00:02:13.420> swivel<00:02:13.840> joint<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.380> that's<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.340> for

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
it's a swivel joint and that's it for

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
it's a swivel joint and that's it for
articulation<00:02:18.150> kind<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.239> weak

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
articulation kind of weak

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.979 
articulation kind of weak
the<00:02:19.989> articulation<00:02:20.560> department<00:02:21.190> but

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
the articulation department but

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.259 
the articulation department but
sculpting<00:02:22.989> on<00:02:23.110> this<00:02:23.430> creature<00:02:24.430> is<00:02:24.790> actually

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
sculpting on this creature is actually

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.100 
sculpting on this creature is actually
pretty<00:02:25.780> nice<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:28.180> really<00:02:28.660> good<00:02:28.810> thing<00:02:28.989> about

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
pretty nice and really good thing about

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.440 
pretty nice and really good thing about
this<00:02:29.380> figure<00:02:29.980> it's<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.640> fact<00:02:30.880> that<00:02:31.000> you<00:02:31.300> could

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
this figure it's the fact that you could

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.620 
this figure it's the fact that you could
use<00:02:31.630> his<00:02:31.840> tail<00:02:32.230> to<00:02:32.769> balance<00:02:36.030> see<00:02:37.030> in<00:02:37.180> this<00:02:37.330> pose

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
use his tail to balance see in this pose

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.160 
use his tail to balance see in this pose
he's<00:02:38.050> somewhat<00:02:38.860> leaning<00:02:39.190> forward<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.630> he's

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
he's somewhat leaning forward and he's

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.310 
he's somewhat leaning forward and he's
still<00:02:41.410> stapled<00:02:41.860> because<00:02:42.550> I<00:02:42.880> rotate<00:02:43.690> his<00:02:43.870> tail

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
still stapled because I rotate his tail

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.509 
still stapled because I rotate his tail
to<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:44.980> side<00:02:45.660> so<00:02:46.660> now<00:02:47.250> take<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.280> balance

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
to the side so now take the balance

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:55.680 
to the side so now take the balance
without<00:02:49.269> using<00:02:49.840> a<00:02:49.930> base<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:55.060> this<00:02:55.360> figure

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
without using a base and this figure

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.199 
without using a base and this figure
stands<00:02:56.200> about<00:02:56.410> four<00:02:56.739> inches<00:02:57.070> tall<00:02:57.370> same<00:02:58.000> as

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
stands about four inches tall same as

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.020 
stands about four inches tall same as
spider-man<00:02:58.890> which<00:02:59.890> is<00:03:00.130> kind<00:03:00.430> of<00:03:00.519> pointing

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
spider-man which is kind of pointing

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.440 
spider-man which is kind of pointing
because<00:03:01.269> in<00:03:01.840> trailer<00:03:02.730> lizard<00:03:03.730> supposed<00:03:04.269> to<00:03:04.390> be

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
because in trailer lizard supposed to be

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.170 
because in trailer lizard supposed to be
way<00:03:04.780> bigger<00:03:04.989> I<00:03:05.410> would<00:03:06.370> say<00:03:06.549> at<00:03:06.730> least<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:07.030> good

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
way bigger I would say at least a good

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
spider-man if you're coming figure size

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.360 
spider-man if you're coming figure size
should<00:03:13.930> be<00:03:14.019> at<00:03:14.200> least<00:03:14.470> five<00:03:15.010> inches<00:03:15.370> tall<00:03:15.900> but

kind of pointing that he's the same size
as<00:03:20.549> spider-man<00:03:21.549> here<00:03:24.540> there's<00:03:25.540> a<00:03:25.630> closer<00:03:26.049> look

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
as spider-man here there's a closer look

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.890 
as spider-man here there's a closer look
at<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:26.560> hand<00:03:26.829> and<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:27.790> veins<00:03:28.150> need<00:03:28.630> to<00:03:28.720> see

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
at the hand and the veins need to see

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:39.860 
at the hand and the veins need to see
the<00:03:28.959> veins<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:31.480> little<00:03:31.989> detail<00:03:32.380> they<00:03:32.560> put<00:03:32.590> in

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.940 

more<00:03:40.709> veins<00:03:41.040> on<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.120> other<00:03:42.239> hand<00:03:42.920> how<00:03:43.920> the

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
more veins on the other hand how the

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:52.040 
more veins on the other hand how the
reptile<00:03:44.760> scales<00:03:49.730> good<00:03:50.730> good<00:03:50.880> job<00:03:51.150> no<00:03:51.630> this<00:03:51.840> is

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
reptile scales good good job no this is

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.880 
reptile scales good good job no this is
not<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.290> bendable<00:03:52.800> tail<00:03:53.280> it's<00:03:53.760> just<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.209> piece<00:03:54.450> of

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
not a bendable tail it's just a piece of

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.380 
not a bendable tail it's just a piece of
plastic<00:03:56.420> softer<00:03:57.420> plastic<00:03:58.459> but<00:03:59.459> it<00:04:00.060> doesn't

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
plastic softer plastic but it doesn't

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.300 
plastic softer plastic but it doesn't
have<00:04:00.480> a<00:04:00.540> wire<00:04:00.780> inside<00:04:01.290> so<00:04:01.620> it's<00:04:01.920> not<00:04:02.250> a

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
have a wire inside so it's not a

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.880 
have a wire inside so it's not a
bendable<00:04:03.080> tail<00:04:06.410> did<00:04:07.410> a<00:04:07.440> good<00:04:07.590> job

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
bendable tail did a good job

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.780 
bendable tail did a good job
I<00:04:08.190> think<00:04:09.230> but<00:04:10.230> again<00:04:10.590> this<00:04:10.800> figure<00:04:11.340> is<00:04:11.489> ten

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
I think but again this figure is ten

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.080 
I think but again this figure is ten
bucks<00:04:12.030> so<00:04:12.690> that's<00:04:12.900> a<00:04:13.080> bit<00:04:13.260> expensive<00:04:14.060> for<00:04:15.060> a

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
bucks so that's a bit expensive for a

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.729 
bucks so that's a bit expensive for a
four-inch<00:04:15.810> figure<00:04:17.120> purchases<00:04:18.120> a<00:04:18.560> target

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
four-inch figure purchases a target

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.740 
four-inch figure purchases a target
I've<00:04:20.519> noticed<00:04:21.150> that<00:04:22.430> toys<00:04:23.430> are<00:04:23.970> selling<00:04:24.479> a
