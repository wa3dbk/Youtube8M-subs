00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 except 3 is the most 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.850
 common research method 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.830
 external breathing for 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.719
 spirometry can be used dry 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.849
 air spirometers and water 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.870
 you see a portable air dry 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.210
 spirometer 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.859
 and spirometer another we will 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.210
 use portable air dry 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.890
 speedometer for the study 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:34.260
 tightly sings a mouthpiece on a group with 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:37.070
 pyrometer and wipe it with a cotton swab 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.070
 wetted with alcohol 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.090
 then rotate the pyro prefix and 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.570
 set the scale of the device to 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.560
 the arrow fell with a zero scale 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.870
 for determining 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.940
 lung capacity tested in 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:24.890
 standing position makes two three deep 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:28.670
 inhale and exhale on then maximize 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.890
 deep breath and taking the mouth of the mouthpiece 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.420
 spirometer 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.610
 I draw your attention that during 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.350
 research subject holds a spirometer 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.630
 the law is gustav so as not to hinder 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.500
 free air outlet and take off and 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.759
 make the deepest exhalation 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.789
 exhaling as much as possible 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:50.210
 air expiration duration should 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:52.759
 make from 4 to 8 seconds cat oles 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.720
 pyrometer determine the value of life 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.940
 lung capacity 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.850
 first dimension shows 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.490
 magnitude 2 has become a prominent buckets hold 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:08.119
 second dimension but for that 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:10.510
 set the instrument scale to 0 please 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.620
 and gossip to breathe in as deeply as possible 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.620
 take a deep breath 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:27.090
 estimate the next value it 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.850
 makes 3.5 buckets 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:34.170
 we carry out the third measurement again 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:37.510
 I set the scale devices 20 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:46.900
 deepest debt and maximum 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:50.890
 deep exhale write 3 magnitude in 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.020
 our experience at is 3.4 liters of 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.570
 the obtained values calculate the average 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.680
 arithmetic value 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.670
 write the data and 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.690
 we compare them with normal size 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.910
 value of proper vital capacity 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:08.070
 lungs is calculated by the formula 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.070
 two and a half times Russian meters
