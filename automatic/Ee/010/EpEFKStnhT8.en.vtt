huh and then I saw them announced the
iPhone<00:00:13.200> 6<00:00:13.710> I<00:00:13.830> was<00:00:13.950> like<00:00:14.070> oh<00:00:14.309> it's<00:00:14.610> bigger<00:00:14.849> now

that's<00:00:15.900> interesting<00:00:16.259> and<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:16.920> found<00:00:17.130> that<00:00:17.220> I

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
that's interesting and I found that I

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.220 
that's interesting and I found that I
didn't<00:00:17.429> have<00:00:17.519> widgets<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.060> was<00:00:18.150> like<00:00:18.300> then

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
didn't have widgets and I was like then

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.899 
didn't have widgets and I was like then
I<00:00:19.319> thought<00:00:19.499> that<00:00:19.679> I<00:00:19.710> had<00:00:19.890> NFC<00:00:20.339> payments<00:00:20.789> which

00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:20.909 
I thought that I had NFC payments which

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:22.189 
I thought that I had NFC payments which
is<00:00:21.060> something<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.509> already<00:00:21.689> used<00:00:21.899> on<00:00:22.109> my

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
is something I already used on my

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.469 
is something I already used on my
Android<00:00:22.560> phones<00:00:22.829> so<00:00:23.460> basically<00:00:23.849> it<00:00:24.239> was

00:00:24.469 --> 00:00:24.479 
Android phones so basically it was

00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:26.450 
Android phones so basically it was
getting<00:00:24.839> all<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.259> things<00:00:25.499> that<00:00:25.739> Android<00:00:26.220> had

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
getting all the things that Android had

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.089 
getting all the things that Android had
any<00:00:27.029> more<00:00:27.210> like<00:00:27.419> you<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.869> big<00:00:28.259> copied<00:00:28.710> Android

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.819 
well that's how the iPhone I started
weighing<00:00:33.120> up<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.510> benefits<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:34.199> switching<00:00:34.440> I

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
weighing up the benefits of switching I

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.790 
weighing up the benefits of switching I
like<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.429> basic<00:00:36.050> functionality<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.320> going<00:00:37.739> to

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
like the basic functionality is going to

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.560 
like the basic functionality is going to
be<00:00:37.890> pretty<00:00:38.160> much<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.609> same<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:39.269> gonna<00:00:39.390> be
