00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.290
 and homemade cider vinegar and then for the decoration of places or 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.290
 sprigs of rosemary and even sichuan pepper 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.050
 in fact the duck so we will feed him 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.760
 it will be used to put the sweet grass 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.730
 we do not insist 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.730
 who may be stuck now we go for misfortune 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.690
 so be a little fat see 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.520
 I put the duck breast 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.830
 a little near five ten minutes 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.890
 that's what the skin is also is slightly golden I will not you 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.080
 obviously and then it was the greece falls slightly then it's the side 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.430
 yes because after will be made aware 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.689
 during this time I will cut the slices of fresh foie gras 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:15.560
 who will serve me 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.190
 feed the duck 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.909
 now I find it believe him richard is saying so that jean 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.829
 francois we passed the oranje now have it reduce the juice 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.970
 with the corner and the Shias at quetta 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.960
 I will add a parish 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.360
 vinegar 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.780
 his house 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.730
 and a tip 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.730
 of bellange cure black pepper turmeric 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.890
 we will reduce for about fifteen minutes it is necessary that 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.310
 the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.880
 orange juice reduced strait because pretty much we will poÃªlez them 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.580
 very quickly it's almost in turn to their customers to access 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.590
 finally in greece 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.010
 that's what I get rid of 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.350
 now I season 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.730
 with a bit of false alarms 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.980
 I also put a black pepper turmeric mixer so the games themselves 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.139
 adjoining this foie gras season 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:17.379
 duck breast 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.109
 and then I will attach myself 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:20.099
 with 1 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.619
 an arm in the lower rhine 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:23.659
 we will put the 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.019
 the oven breast 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.759
 during the minute 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:29.759
 in a 180 oven 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:33.590
 the reduction is over the game becomes so high 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.769
 and vegetables 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.149
 they are entrusted 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:38.799
 Greece and duck breast 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.799
