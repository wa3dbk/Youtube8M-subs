you<00:01:11.369> can<00:01:11.580> see<00:01:11.790> another<00:01:11.970> instance<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
you can see another instance of the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.469 
you can see another instance of the
buffering<00:01:13.790> which<00:01:14.790> again<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.090> know<00:01:15.270> I'm

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
buffering which again I know I'm

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.899 
buffering which again I know I'm
probably<00:01:15.659> harping<00:01:16.200> on<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:16.680> if<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.759> are

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
probably harping on it but if you are

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.410 
probably harping on it but if you are
watching<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:19.130> long-form<00:01:20.130> content<00:01:20.430> it's<00:01:20.970> not

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
watching a long-form content it's not

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.240 
watching a long-form content it's not
going<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:22.020> think<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.590> really<00:01:22.619> affect<00:01:23.159> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
going to I think it really affect the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.190 
going to I think it really affect the
user<00:01:23.460> experience<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.360> too<00:01:25.110> badly<00:01:26.930> but<00:01:27.930> if

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
user experience to too badly but if

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.149 
user experience to too badly but if
you're<00:01:28.380> switching<00:01:28.740> back<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:28.920> forth

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
you're switching back and forth

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.510 
you're switching back and forth
obviously<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.509> seems<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.770> really<00:01:31.950> take<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> long

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
obviously it seems to really take a long

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.200 
obviously it seems to really take a long
time<00:01:33.829> or<00:01:34.829> maybe<00:01:35.100> I'm<00:01:35.280> just<00:01:35.310> really<00:01:35.729> impatient

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
time or maybe I'm just really impatient

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.969 
time or maybe I'm just really impatient
I<00:01:36.299> don't<00:01:36.479> know<00:01:36.570> I'm<00:01:36.780> just<00:01:36.840> too<00:01:37.409> used<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.740> using

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
I don't know I'm just too used to using

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.249 
I don't know I'm just too used to using
my<00:01:40.979> media<00:01:41.310> center<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.909> change<00:01:42.450> channels<00:01:43.020> very

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
my media center to change channels very

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:51.010 
my media center to change channels very
quickly<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.740> guess

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.359 

so<00:01:52.020> let's<00:01:52.560> take<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.100> look<00:01:53.399> at<00:01:54.680> sea<00:01:55.680> there's<00:01:55.860> news

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
so let's take a look at sea there's news

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.370 
so let's take a look at sea there's news
so<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.909> lot<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.180> people<00:01:57.509> are<00:01:57.719> interested<00:01:58.350> you

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.859 
so a lot of people are interested you
know<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.920> cutting<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.369> cord<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.299> don't

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
know and cutting the cord and I don't

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.249 
know and cutting the cord and I don't
know<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.200> me<00:02:01.229> news<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.979> one<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.280> those<00:02:02.399> critical

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
know to me news is one of those critical

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.819 
know to me news is one of those critical
services<00:02:05.509> personally<00:02:06.509> I'm<00:02:06.659> not<00:02:06.840> really<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.200> end

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
services personally I'm not really a end

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.390 
services personally I'm not really a end
of<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.069> cord<00:02:08.459> cutting<00:02:08.789> movement<00:02:09.060> but<00:02:10.400> you

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
of the cord cutting movement but you

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.880 
of the cord cutting movement but you
know<00:02:11.519> they're<00:02:11.760> there<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.410> content<00:02:13.410> available

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
know they're there is content available

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.100 
know they're there is content available
I<00:02:14.160> think<00:02:14.190> this<00:02:14.489> is<00:02:14.550> probably<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:15.060> same<00:02:15.480> type

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
I think this is probably the same type

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.350 
I think this is probably the same type
of<00:02:16.140> thing<00:02:16.319> you'd<00:02:16.769> see<00:02:17.040> say<00:02:17.670> for<00:02:17.940> instance<00:02:17.970> if

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
of thing you'd see say for instance if

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.870
