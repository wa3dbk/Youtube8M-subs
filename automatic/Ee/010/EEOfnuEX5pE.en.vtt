00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
what drew me to buy this model kit was

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.310 
what drew me to buy this model kit was
the<00:01:08.130> fact<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.939> almost<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.750> entire<00:01:10.080> and

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
the fact that the almost the entire and

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.020 
the fact that the almost the entire and
her<00:01:10.380> frame<00:01:10.650> lights<00:01:10.950> up<00:01:12.110> and<00:01:13.729> yeah<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.939> just

but<00:02:34.590> don't<00:02:34.920> worry<00:02:35.010> there's<00:02:35.310> no<00:02:35.490> soldering

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
but don't worry there's no soldering

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.080 
but don't worry there's no soldering
involved<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.830> it's<00:02:37.830> just<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.250> bunch<00:02:38.400> of<00:02:38.550> big

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
involved and it's just a bunch of big

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.460 
involved and it's just a bunch of big
metal<00:02:39.480> plates<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:40.350> wires<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.740> things<00:02:41.010> that

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
metal plates and wires and things that

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.870 
metal plates and wires and things that
not<00:02:43.470> too<00:02:43.680> hard<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:43.950> put<00:02:44.100> together<00:02:44.190> most<00:02:44.640> of<00:02:44.760> us

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
not too hard to put together most of us

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.700 
not too hard to put together most of us
put<00:02:45.090> together<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.420> screws<00:02:46.070> so<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:48.710> metal

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
put together the screws so the metal

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.820 
put together the screws so the metal
parts<00:02:50.010> run<00:02:50.310> up<00:02:50.520> through<00:02:50.760> here<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.560> attach<00:02:52.560> to

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
parts run up through here and attach to

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.650 
parts run up through here and attach to
the<00:02:52.980> wiring<00:02:53.220> system<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:54.000> strike<00:02:54.240> freedom's

the wiring system and strike freedom's
body<00:02:55.520> up<00:02:56.520> in<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.760> crotch<00:02:57.030> here<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:58.220> then<00:02:59.220> he's

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
body up in the crotch here and then he's

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.930 
body up in the crotch here and then he's
got<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.390> switch<00:03:01.290> on<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.740> back<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:02.070> his<00:03:02.310> base<00:03:02.580> and

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
got a switch on the back of his base and

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.880 
got a switch on the back of his base and
when<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:03.870> turn<00:03:04.080> it<00:03:04.200> on<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:06.510> frame<00:03:06.840> lights<00:03:07.530> up

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
when you turn it on the frame lights up

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.850 
when you turn it on the frame lights up
just<00:03:08.640> like<00:03:08.820> that

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
just like that

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.430 
just like that
now<00:03:10.860> unfortunately<00:03:11.630> they<00:03:12.630> didn't<00:03:12.990> route<00:03:13.230> the

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
now unfortunately they didn't route the

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.100 
now unfortunately they didn't route the
wires<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:14.070> his<00:03:14.220> head<00:03:14.550> he<00:03:15.390> has<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.540> separate

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
wires to his head he has a separate

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.260 
wires to his head he has a separate
battery<00:03:16.560> inside<00:03:17.070> his<00:03:17.280> head<00:03:17.520> that<00:03:17.820> lets<00:03:18.030> his

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
battery inside his head that lets his

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.130 
battery inside his head that lets his
eyes<00:03:18.510> light<00:03:18.840> up<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.740> unfortunately<00:03:20.780> I<00:03:21.780> don't

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
eyes light up and unfortunately I don't

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.020 
eyes light up and unfortunately I don't
have<00:03:22.320> any<00:03:22.470> spares<00:03:24.320> the<00:03:25.340> batteries<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.370> had<00:03:26.850> in

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
have any spares the batteries I had in

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.210 
have any spares the batteries I had in
my<00:03:27.230> there<00:03:28.230> are<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.350> same<00:03:28.560> batteries<00:03:28.980> that<00:03:29.130> you

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
my there are the same batteries that you

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.610 
my there are the same batteries that you
use<00:03:29.400> for<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:30.030> double-o<00:03:30.510> Gundam<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.290> GN

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
use for the double-o Gundam and the GN

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.430 
use for the double-o Gundam and the GN
drives<00:03:31.950> but<00:03:32.880> might<00:03:33.180> have<00:03:33.390> since<00:03:33.660> going<00:03:34.170> dead

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
drives but might have since going dead

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.680 
drives but might have since going dead
so<00:03:34.950> I<00:03:35.190> don't<00:03:35.370> unfortunately<00:03:36.330> I<00:03:36.390> don't<00:03:36.450> have

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
so I don't unfortunately I don't have

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.729 
so I don't unfortunately I don't have
any<00:03:36.810> way<00:03:37.140> to<00:03:37.200> show<00:03:37.590> off<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.550> eyes<00:03:38.760> but

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
any way to show off the eyes but

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.500 
any way to show off the eyes but
hopefully<00:03:40.739> that<00:03:40.920> won't<00:03:41.100> take<00:03:41.280> away<00:03:41.520> from<00:03:41.970> how

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
hopefully that won't take away from how

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.000 
hopefully that won't take away from how
impressive<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.670> frame<00:03:44.670> looks<00:03:45.709> actually<00:03:46.709> uh

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
impressive the frame looks actually uh

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.190 
impressive the frame looks actually uh
if<00:03:47.790> you're<00:03:48.060> into<00:03:48.270> transformers<00:03:48.959> that<00:03:49.080> all

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
if you're into transformers that all

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.440 
if you're into transformers that all
this<00:03:49.410> model<00:03:50.130> kit<00:03:50.280> really<00:03:50.640> reminds<00:03:51.090> me<00:03:51.150> of<00:03:51.270> the

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
this model kit really reminds me of the

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.830 
this model kit really reminds me of the
Fallen<00:03:52.010> from<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.489> war<00:03:53.700> within<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:54.480> the

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
you can see there's let's say I think

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.910 
you can see there's let's say I think
there's<00:04:07.860> five<00:04:08.300> giant<00:04:09.300> LEDs<00:04:09.900> inside<00:04:10.440> this<00:04:10.620> kit

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
there's five giant LEDs inside this kit

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.640 
there's five giant LEDs inside this kit
one<00:04:11.850> in<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.120> chest<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:12.750> illuminates<00:04:13.350> the

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
one in the chest and illuminates the

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.210 
one in the chest and illuminates the
chest<00:04:14.250> events<00:04:14.730> up<00:04:15.510> in<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:15.870> neck<00:04:16.080> there

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
chest events up in the neck there

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.880 
chest events up in the neck there
the<00:04:17.580> little<00:04:17.730> thingy<00:04:17.940> on<00:04:18.060> his<00:04:18.410> stomach<00:04:19.410> and

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
the little thingy on his stomach and

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.470 
the little thingy on his stomach and
it's<00:04:20.070> even<00:04:20.280> got<00:04:20.310> like<00:04:20.610> little<00:04:20.880> holes<00:04:21.060> on<00:04:21.360> the

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
it's even got like little holes on the

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.020 
it's even got like little holes on the
armor<00:04:21.840> just<00:04:21.870> to<00:04:22.740> let<00:04:22.950> some<00:04:23.220> additional<00:04:23.790> light

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
armor just to let some additional light

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.100 
armor just to let some additional light
peek<00:04:24.660> through<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.710> if<00:04:26.250> you<00:04:26.370> open<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.790> cockpit

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
peek through and if you open the cockpit

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.080 
peek through and if you open the cockpit
the<00:04:28.110> entire<00:04:28.620> inside<00:04:29.190> of<00:04:29.220> the<00:04:29.370> cockpit<00:04:29.670> is

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
the entire inside of the cockpit is

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.430 
the entire inside of the cockpit is
illuminated<00:04:30.750> I<00:04:30.810> thought<00:04:31.020> that<00:04:31.170> was<00:04:31.290> pretty

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
illuminated I thought that was pretty

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.030 
illuminated I thought that was pretty
cool<00:04:31.650> as<00:04:31.830> well<00:04:32.010> and<00:04:33.470> some<00:04:34.470> of<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.650> light<00:04:34.830> even

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
cool as well and some of the light even

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.970 
cool as well and some of the light even
goes<00:04:35.640> into<00:04:35.670> his<00:04:36.090> shoulders<00:04:36.570> he's<00:04:37.020> got<00:04:37.200> LEDs<00:04:37.710> in

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
goes into his shoulders he's got LEDs in

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.470 
goes into his shoulders he's got LEDs in
his<00:04:38.100> forearms<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:40.610> it<00:04:41.610> pretty<00:04:41.820> much<00:04:41.910> lights

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
his forearms and it pretty much lights

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.990 
his forearms and it pretty much lights
up<00:04:42.690> most<00:04:42.990> of<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.230> arm<00:04:43.640> now<00:04:44.640> there's<00:04:44.910> a

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
up most of the arm now there's a

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.500 
up most of the arm now there's a
standard<00:04:45.540> poly<00:04:45.930> cap<00:04:46.520> right<00:04:47.520> there<00:04:47.850> for<00:04:48.390> the

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
standard poly cap right there for the

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:49.400 
standard poly cap right there for the
wrist<00:04:48.750> joint

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
wrist joint

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.850 
wrist joint
and<00:04:50.240> since<00:04:51.240> poly<00:04:51.480> caps<00:04:51.750> are<00:04:51.900> solid<00:04:52.260> gray<00:04:52.500> they

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
and since poly caps are solid gray they

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.430 
and since poly caps are solid gray they
don't<00:04:53.120> you<00:04:54.120> know<00:04:54.210> light<00:04:54.690> can't<00:04:55.020> pass<00:04:55.230> through

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
don't you know light can't pass through

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.410 
don't you know light can't pass through
them<00:04:55.710> so<00:04:56.100> what<00:04:56.280> I<00:04:56.310> did<00:04:56.430> was<00:04:56.730> I<00:04:56.850> cut<00:04:57.030> a<00:04:57.090> small

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
them so what I did was I cut a small

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.940 
them so what I did was I cut a small
hole<00:04:57.450> in<00:04:58.080> the<00:04:58.790> bottom<00:04:59.790> of<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.420> poly<00:05:00.630> cap<00:05:00.960> so

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
hole in the bottom of the poly cap so

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.470 
hole in the bottom of the poly cap so
hopefully<00:05:02.400> some<00:05:02.610> light<00:05:02.850> would<00:05:03.090> go<00:05:03.240> through

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
hopefully some light would go through

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.140 
hopefully some light would go through
and<00:05:03.660> light<00:05:03.810> up<00:05:03.930> the<00:05:04.050> hand<00:05:04.320> and<00:05:04.770> I<00:05:05.730> think<00:05:06.060> it

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
and light up the hand and I think it

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.590 
and light up the hand and I think it
worked<00:05:06.420> somewhat<00:05:07.050> I<00:05:07.940> mean<00:05:08.940> definitely<00:05:09.150> the

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
worked somewhat I mean definitely the

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.900 
worked somewhat I mean definitely the
palm<00:05:09.900> of<00:05:10.140> the<00:05:10.200> hand<00:05:10.440> has<00:05:10.590> got<00:05:10.770> some<00:05:11.250> glow<00:05:11.490> to<00:05:11.550> it

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
palm of the hand has got some glow to it

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.180 
palm of the hand has got some glow to it
but<00:05:12.120> the<00:05:12.870> light<00:05:13.080> doesn't<00:05:13.470> quite<00:05:13.680> reach<00:05:13.980> all

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
but the light doesn't quite reach all

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.490 
but the light doesn't quite reach all
the<00:05:14.310> way<00:05:14.340> to<00:05:14.460> the<00:05:14.610> finger<00:05:15.000> so<00:05:15.330> but<00:05:16.050> it<00:05:16.290> does

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
the way to the finger so but it does

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.320 
the way to the finger so but it does
look<00:05:16.650> better<00:05:16.830> than<00:05:17.160> they<00:05:17.310> did<00:05:17.370> before<00:05:17.670> I<00:05:17.880> cut

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
look better than they did before I cut

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.790 
look better than they did before I cut
the<00:05:18.420> whole<00:05:18.570> poly<00:05:18.960> cap<00:05:19.400> and<00:05:20.510> then<00:05:21.560> there's<00:05:22.560> not

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
the whole poly cap and then there's not

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.970 
the whole poly cap and then there's not
really<00:05:22.950> any<00:05:23.220> lighting<00:05:23.760> in<00:05:24.000> the<00:05:24.090> waist<00:05:24.300> area

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
really any lighting in the waist area

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.420 
really any lighting in the waist area
but<00:05:25.980> the<00:05:26.250> the<00:05:27.350> lights<00:05:28.350> and<00:05:28.590> the<00:05:28.650> legs<00:05:28.890> are<00:05:29.250> down

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
but the the lights and the legs are down

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.110 
but the the lights and the legs are down
here<00:05:29.850> behind<00:05:30.840> the<00:05:30.990> knees<00:05:31.200> and<00:05:32.070> the<00:05:32.640> lower<00:05:32.820> leg

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
here behind the knees and the lower leg

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.510 
here behind the knees and the lower leg
and<00:05:33.450> if<00:05:34.440> you<00:05:34.590> lift<00:05:34.890> up<00:05:35.100> the<00:05:36.980> knee<00:05:37.980> armor<00:05:38.400> you

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
and if you lift up the knee armor you

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.160 
and if you lift up the knee armor you
can<00:05:38.550> see<00:05:38.880> it's<00:05:39.030> really<00:05:39.300> groped<00:05:39.780> and<00:05:39.960> glowing

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
can see it's really groped and glowing

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.580 
can see it's really groped and glowing
quite<00:05:40.590> brightly<00:05:41.070> in<00:05:41.190> there<00:05:41.420> and<00:05:42.420> just<00:05:43.110> lots<00:05:43.380> of

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
quite brightly in there and just lots of

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.140 
quite brightly in there and just lots of
light<00:05:43.830> coming<00:05:44.190> out<00:05:44.400> coming<00:05:44.730> out<00:05:44.970> of<00:05:45.060> these

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
light coming out coming out of these

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.870 
light coming out coming out of these
vents<00:05:45.810> on<00:05:45.930> the<00:05:45.960> side<00:05:46.050> and<00:05:46.710> through<00:05:47.580> the<00:05:47.730> knee

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
vents on the side and through the knee

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.240 
vents on the side and through the knee
joints<00:05:48.420> and<00:05:48.660> all<00:05:49.290> sorts<00:05:49.740> of<00:05:49.800> different<00:05:49.860> places

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
joints and all sorts of different places

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.200 
joints and all sorts of different places
it<00:05:50.610> just<00:05:50.790> looks<00:05:51.090> really<00:05:51.450> nice<00:05:52.700> as<00:05:53.700> you<00:05:53.880> can<00:05:53.940> see

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
it just looks really nice as you can see

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.810 
it just looks really nice as you can see
there's<00:05:54.450> some<00:05:54.660> additional<00:05:55.550> stuff<00:05:56.550> on<00:05:56.730> the

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
there's some additional stuff on the

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.780 
there's some additional stuff on the
back<00:05:57.260> these<00:05:58.260> little<00:05:58.880> vents<00:05:59.880> on<00:06:00.870> the<00:06:00.980> back<00:06:01.980> of

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
back these little vents on the back of

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.060 
back these little vents on the back of
the<00:06:02.910> legs<00:06:03.150> can<00:06:03.510> open<00:06:03.840> up<00:06:03.960> and<00:06:04.620> you<00:06:04.710> can<00:06:04.860> see<00:06:05.040> a

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
the legs can open up and you can see a

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:10.490 
the legs can open up and you can see a
nice<00:06:05.310> orange<00:06:05.790> glow<00:06:06.180> through<00:06:06.540> there<00:06:07.910> and<00:06:09.500> yeah

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
nice orange glow through there and yeah

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.930 
nice orange glow through there and yeah
that's<00:06:10.740> about<00:06:10.890> it<00:06:11.040> for<00:06:11.370> the<00:06:12.110> lighting<00:06:13.110> feature

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
that's about it for the lighting feature

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.940 
that's about it for the lighting feature
you<00:06:14.940> get<00:06:15.090> these<00:06:15.330> things<00:06:15.660> on<00:06:16.110> the<00:06:16.260> side<00:06:16.500> of<00:06:16.560> the

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
you get these things on the side of the

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:22.700 
you get these things on the side of the
arms<00:06:17.370> and<00:06:17.760> a<00:06:18.950> fuel

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.850 

let<00:06:23.710> me<00:06:23.950> do<00:06:24.670> this<00:06:24.880> real<00:06:25.120> quick<00:06:25.420> we<00:06:26.290> can<00:06:26.320> put<00:06:26.740> on

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
let me do this real quick we can put on

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:32.310 
let me do this real quick we can put on
his<00:06:28.890> beam<00:06:29.890> shield<00:06:30.370> I<00:06:30.870> actually<00:06:31.870> haven't

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 
his beam shield I actually haven't

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.320 
his beam shield I actually haven't
tested<00:06:32.680> this<00:06:33.010> yet<00:06:33.280> to<00:06:33.430> see<00:06:33.610> if<00:06:34.110> the<00:06:36.330> shield

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 
tested this yet to see if the shield

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.230 
tested this yet to see if the shield
will<00:06:37.600> actually<00:06:38.110> light<00:06:39.040> up<00:06:39.280> I<00:06:39.550> seriously<00:06:39.850> doubt

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
will actually light up I seriously doubt

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.980 
will actually light up I seriously doubt
it<00:06:40.480> will

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
it will

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.780 
it will
but<00:06:41.640> that's<00:06:42.640> worth<00:06:42.820> the<00:06:42.970> try<00:06:43.240> right<00:06:44.550> just<00:06:45.550> put

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:45.790 
but that's worth the try right just put

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:53.130 
but that's worth the try right just put
that<00:06:45.910> on<00:06:45.970> there<00:06:46.360> and<00:06:48.210> stick<00:06:49.830> this<00:06:50.830> in<00:06:52.140> that

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.140 
that on there and stick this in that

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.450 
that on there and stick this in that
little<00:06:53.500> slot<00:06:53.730> there<00:06:55.950> it's<00:06:56.950> not<00:06:57.130> really

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:57.460 
little slot there it's not really

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:03.260 
little slot there it's not really
wanting<00:06:57.670> to<00:06:57.760> go<00:06:57.880> in<00:07:00.600> there<00:07:01.600> we<00:07:01.780> go

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.270 
wanting to go in there we go

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.990 
wanting to go in there we go
and<00:07:04.270> there<00:07:04.660> we<00:07:04.750> go<00:07:04.870> with<00:07:05.020> us<00:07:05.170> beam<00:07:05.350> shield<00:07:06.000> now

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000 
and there we go with us beam shield now

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.760 
and there we go with us beam shield now
the<00:07:07.060> light<00:07:07.390> does<00:07:07.660> travel<00:07:08.170> up<00:07:08.350> that<00:07:08.590> little

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:08.770 
the light does travel up that little

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.040 
the light does travel up that little
clear<00:07:09.520> yellow<00:07:09.940> piece<00:07:10.210> that's<00:07:10.600> holding<00:07:10.930> the

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.050 
clear yellow piece that's holding the

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.620 
clear yellow piece that's holding the
shield<00:07:11.260> on<00:07:11.500> but<00:07:11.850> doesn't<00:07:12.850> really<00:07:12.970> go<00:07:13.180> into<00:07:13.450> the

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:13.630 
shield on but doesn't really go into the

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.070 
shield on but doesn't really go into the
clear<00:07:13.870> plastic<00:07:14.050> of<00:07:14.470> the<00:07:14.500> shield<00:07:14.770> itself<00:07:16.080> but

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:17.080 
clear plastic of the shield itself but

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.260 
clear plastic of the shield itself but
then<00:07:17.410> again<00:07:17.530> I<00:07:17.920> didn't<00:07:18.400> really<00:07:18.610> expect<00:07:18.910> it<00:07:19.090> to

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:19.270 
then again I didn't really expect it to

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.820 
then again I didn't really expect it to
so<00:07:19.540> that's<00:07:20.170> not<00:07:20.320> too<00:07:20.500> disappointing<00:07:21.360> but<00:07:22.830> yeah

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:23.830 
so that's not too disappointing but yeah

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.600 
so that's not too disappointing but yeah
that's<00:07:24.100> about<00:07:24.250> it<00:07:24.400> for<00:07:24.970> the<00:07:25.330> lighting<00:07:25.930> feature

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:26.610 
that's about it for the lighting feature

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.010 
that's about it for the lighting feature
light<00:07:27.610> doesn't<00:07:27.970> quite<00:07:28.210> go<00:07:28.450> all<00:07:28.480> the<00:07:28.750> way<00:07:28.840> down

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:29.020 
light doesn't quite go all the way down

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.290 
light doesn't quite go all the way down
all<00:07:29.110> those<00:07:29.230> angles<00:07:29.650> just<00:07:29.830> a<00:07:30.070> very<00:07:30.310> dim<00:07:30.940> glow

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:31.300 
all those angles just a very dim glow

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.320 
all those angles just a very dim glow
down<00:07:31.600> there<00:07:32.010> so<00:07:33.010> I<00:07:33.040> guess<00:07:33.490> this<00:07:33.700> will<00:07:33.940> be<00:07:34.000> the

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:34.330 
down there so I guess this will be the

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.590 
down there so I guess this will be the
first<00:07:34.660> part<00:07:34.960> of<00:07:35.080> the<00:07:35.200> review<00:07:35.530> and<00:07:35.770> then<00:07:36.600> we'll
