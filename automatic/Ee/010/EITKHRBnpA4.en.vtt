taught his muscular system through the
brain<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:12.740> the<00:02:12.800> nervous<00:02:12.830> system<00:02:13.100> how<00:02:13.730> to

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
brain and the nervous system how to

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.670 
brain and the nervous system how to
perform<00:02:14.240> a<00:02:14.330> particular<00:02:14.450> computer<00:02:15.260> program

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
perform a particular computer program

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.120 
perform a particular computer program
and<00:02:16.250> he<00:02:16.520> does<00:02:16.760> it<00:02:17.000> for<00:02:17.990> thousands<00:02:18.800> of<00:02:18.890> reps

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
and he does it for thousands of reps

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.010 
and he does it for thousands of reps
several<00:02:19.730> times<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.180> week<00:02:20.360> every<00:02:20.540> time<00:02:20.870> he's

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
several times a week every time he's

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.380 
several times a week every time he's
pushing<00:02:21.380> off<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:22.280> what<00:02:22.790> happens<00:02:23.210> is<00:02:23.360> that

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
pushing off so what happens is that

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.840 
pushing off so what happens is that
becomes<00:02:24.070> facilitated<00:02:25.070> it's<00:02:25.220> an<00:02:25.370> ingrained

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
becomes facilitated it's an ingrained

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.180 
becomes facilitated it's an ingrained
pattern<00:02:26.540> when<00:02:27.080> he<00:02:27.200> goes<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:27.710> tries<00:02:27.800> to<00:02:28.070> do

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
pattern when he goes and tries to do

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.520 
pattern when he goes and tries to do
other<00:02:28.430> things<00:02:28.850> that<00:02:29.060> aren't<00:02:29.480> associated<00:02:30.380> with

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
other things that aren't associated with

other things that aren't associated with
that<00:02:30.650> computer<00:02:30.950> program<00:02:31.430> because<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.850> brain

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
that computer program because the brain

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.480 
that computer program because the brain
hasn't<00:02:32.330> been<00:02:32.660> taught<00:02:33.280> multiple<00:02:34.280> other

hasn't been taught multiple other

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.310 
hasn't been taught multiple other
programs<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.360> this<00:02:35.480> is<00:02:35.660> why<00:02:35.780> I<00:02:35.810> think<00:02:36.020> it's

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
programs and this is why I think it's

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.199 
programs and this is why I think it's
good<00:02:36.380> that<00:02:36.560> athletes<00:02:37.490> especially<00:02:37.790> young

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
good that athletes especially young

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.850 
good that athletes especially young
athletes<00:02:38.570> play<00:02:38.780> a<00:02:38.990> lot<00:02:39.260> of<00:02:39.380> different<00:02:39.650> sports

athletes play a lot of different sports

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.740 
athletes play a lot of different sports
instead<00:02:40.160> of<00:02:40.310> specializing<00:02:40.910> but<00:02:41.390> because<00:02:41.660> he

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
instead of specializing but because he

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.020 
instead of specializing but because he
hasn't<00:02:41.900> been<00:02:42.140> it's<00:02:42.350> been<00:02:42.980> exposed<00:02:43.430> to<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:43.790> lot

system just falls back on the old

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.290 
system just falls back on the old
programming<00:02:51.890> that<00:02:52.160> it<00:02:52.280> has<00:02:52.490> or<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.910> only

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
programming that it has or the only

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.270 
programming that it has or the only
program<00:02:53.660> that<00:02:53.840> it<00:02:53.930> has<00:02:54.110> and<00:02:54.440> he<00:02:54.680> gets<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.100> bar

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
program that it has and he gets the bar

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.730 
program that it has and he gets the bar
on<00:02:55.430> his<00:02:55.550> back<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:56.090> his<00:02:56.870> knees<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:57.530> feet

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
on his back and his knees and feet

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.090 
on his back and his knees and feet
looked<00:02:58.040> like<00:02:58.130> he's<00:02:58.459> going<00:02:58.820> to<00:02:59.530> push<00:03:00.530> off<00:03:00.770> and

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
looked like he's going to push off and

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.100 
looked like he's going to push off and
skate<00:03:01.670> forward<00:03:02.150> what<00:03:02.330> she's<00:03:02.480> not<00:03:02.630> doing

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
skate forward what she's not doing

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.570 
skate forward what she's not doing
so<00:03:03.590> what<00:03:03.709> we've<00:03:03.800> got<00:03:03.920> to<00:03:04.010> do<00:03:04.100> is<00:03:04.220> we've<00:03:04.340> got<00:03:04.400> to

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
so what we've got to do is we've got to

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.110 
so what we've got to do is we've got to
teach<00:03:04.910> him<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.660> brand<00:03:06.019> new<00:03:06.310> motor<00:03:07.310> pattern<00:03:07.940> a

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
teach him a brand new motor pattern a

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.960 
teach him a brand new motor pattern a
new<00:03:08.330> computer<00:03:09.019> program<00:03:09.250> so<00:03:10.250> that<00:03:10.430> he<00:03:10.580> can<00:03:10.760> get

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
new computer program so that he can get

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.270 
new computer program so that he can get
his<00:03:11.209> nervous<00:03:11.660> system<00:03:11.690> recruit<00:03:12.410> other<00:03:12.650> muscles

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
his nervous system recruit other muscles

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.390 
his nervous system recruit other muscles
that<00:03:14.060> aren't<00:03:14.269> associated<00:03:15.019> with<00:03:15.260> doing<00:03:16.190> the

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
that aren't associated with doing the

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.900 
that aren't associated with doing the
the<00:03:16.880> push<00:03:17.090> off<00:03:17.300> thing<00:03:17.630> on<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:18.050> ice<00:03:18.310> so<00:03:19.310> the

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
the push off thing on the ice so the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.340 
the push off thing on the ice so the
very<00:03:20.090> first<00:03:20.269> thing<00:03:20.450> that<00:03:20.630> I<00:03:20.810> teach<00:03:21.110> my<00:03:21.290> clients

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
very first thing that I teach my clients

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.440 
very first thing that I teach my clients
to<00:03:21.739> do<00:03:21.920> is<00:03:22.100> to<00:03:22.280> stretch<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.970> muscles<00:03:23.330> that

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
to do is to stretch the muscles that

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.540 
to do is to stretch the muscles that
have<00:03:23.600> become<00:03:23.750> tonic<00:03:24.530> because<00:03:24.650> of<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.010> pattern

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
have become tonic because of the pattern

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.430 
have become tonic because of the pattern
overload<00:03:26.060> so<00:03:26.570> if<00:03:26.690> you're<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.870> baseball<00:03:27.050> player

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
overload so if you're a baseball player

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.500 
overload so if you're a baseball player
it's<00:03:27.769> gonna<00:03:27.890> be<00:03:28.100> your<00:03:28.280> your<00:03:28.760> shoulders<00:03:29.330> or<00:03:29.480> the

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
it's gonna be your your shoulders or the

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.380 
it's gonna be your your shoulders or the
anterior<00:03:29.870> delt<00:03:30.970> depending<00:03:31.970> on<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.150> sport

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
anterior delt depending on the sport

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.970 
anterior delt depending on the sport
you're<00:03:32.570> gonna<00:03:32.690> have<00:03:32.870> certain<00:03:33.230> common

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
you're gonna have certain common

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.860 
you're gonna have certain common
muscular<00:03:34.400> imbalances<00:03:34.910> for<00:03:35.330> hockey<00:03:35.660> players

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
muscular imbalances for hockey players

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.050 
muscular imbalances for hockey players
it's<00:03:36.170> gonna<00:03:36.290> be<00:03:36.470> tight<00:03:36.769> adductors<00:03:37.459> so<00:03:37.940> the

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
it's gonna be tight adductors so the

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.550 
it's gonna be tight adductors so the
first<00:03:38.269> thing<00:03:38.450> he's<00:03:38.630> gonna<00:03:38.780> need<00:03:38.989> to<00:03:39.170> do<00:03:39.350> is

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
first thing he's gonna need to do is

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.310 
first thing he's gonna need to do is
stretch<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.880> adductors<00:03:41.600> this<00:03:41.810> is<00:03:41.959> really

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
stretch the adductors this is really

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.050 
stretch the adductors this is really
important<00:03:42.860> because<00:03:42.890> they're<00:03:43.220> overdeveloped

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
important because they're overdeveloped

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.390 
important because they're overdeveloped
from<00:03:44.299> pushing<00:03:44.570> off<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.140> way<00:03:45.260> he<00:03:45.410> does<00:03:45.590> the

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
from pushing off the way he does the

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.670 
from pushing off the way he does the
other<00:03:46.549> thing<00:03:46.760> he's<00:03:46.940> gonna<00:03:47.060> need<00:03:47.540> to<00:03:47.660> do<00:03:47.810> is<00:03:48.140> to

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
other thing he's gonna need to do is to

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.400 
other thing he's gonna need to do is to
foam<00:03:49.100> roll<00:03:49.420> his<00:03:50.420> /<00:03:50.750> O'Neill's<00:03:51.200> on<00:03:51.350> the

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
foam roll his / O'Neill's on the

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.300 
foam roll his / O'Neill's on the

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
outsides of his calves the reason why

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.680 
outsides of his calves the reason why
again<00:03:55.549> is<00:03:55.730> because<00:03:56.090> those<00:03:56.239> muscles<00:03:56.630> have

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
again is because those muscles have

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:57.600 
again is because those muscles have
become<00:03:57.110> or<00:03:57.350> that

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
become or that

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.570 
become or that
asha<00:03:57.760> has<00:03:58.420> become<00:03:58.750> really<00:03:58.990> tight<00:03:59.380> short<00:03:59.920> tonic

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
asha has become really tight short tonic
