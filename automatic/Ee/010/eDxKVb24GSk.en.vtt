hackintosh<00:00:35.720> so<00:00:36.720> I<00:00:37.309> bought<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.340> bunch<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.640> parts

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
hackintosh so I bought a bunch of parts

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.640 
hackintosh so I bought a bunch of parts
and<00:00:39.030> as<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.780> saw<00:00:39.930> my<00:00:40.080> previous<00:00:40.410> video<00:00:40.590> that

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
and as you saw my previous video that

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.680 
and as you saw my previous video that
was<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.949> graphics<00:00:41.340> card<00:00:41.580> and<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:42.180> video<00:00:42.510> is

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
was the graphics card and this video is

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.220 
was the graphics card and this video is
going<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.960> be<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.440> processor<00:00:44.629> my<00:00:45.629> hands<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.170> a

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
going to be the processor my hands is a

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.969 
going to be the processor my hands is a
intel<00:00:46.980> core<00:00:47.250> i7<00:00:47.400> 930<00:00:48.330> it's<00:00:48.900> clocked<00:00:49.230> at<00:00:49.440> 2.8

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:49.979 
intel core i7 930 it's clocked at 2.8

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:54.439 
intel core i7 930 it's clocked at 2.8
gigahertz<00:00:51.199> it's<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.440> quad<00:00:52.830> core<00:00:53.100> with<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:54.330> has

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
gigahertz it's a quad core with it has

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.840 
gigahertz it's a quad core with it has
hyperthreading<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.890> has<00:00:56.040> 8<00:00:56.280> threads<00:00:56.580> so

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
hyperthreading so it has 8 threads so

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.729 
hyperthreading so it has 8 threads so
four<00:00:57.239> cores<00:00:57.479> eight<00:00:57.629> threads<00:00:57.900> the<00:00:58.409> computer

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
four cores eight threads the computer

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.990 
four cores eight threads the computer
will<00:00:58.830> see<00:00:58.979> has<00:00:59.190> eight<00:00:59.369> dreads<00:00:59.699> there's<00:00:59.970> a

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
will see has eight dreads there's a

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.930 
will see has eight dreads there's a
bunch<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.269> technical<00:01:00.780> stuff<00:01:01.019> so<00:01:01.820> I'm<00:01:02.820> not

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
bunch of technical stuff so I'm not

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.219 
bunch of technical stuff so I'm not
really<00:01:03.089> going<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.330> get<00:01:03.449> into<00:01:03.720> it<00:01:03.750> I'm<00:01:04.049> not<00:01:04.170> even

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
really going to get into it I'm not even

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.719 
really going to get into it I'm not even
sure<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.470> could<00:01:04.680> do<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.860> understand<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.460> but

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
sure I could do the understand it but

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.240 
sure I could do the understand it but
basically<00:01:06.090> it's<00:01:06.479> very<00:01:06.659> good<00:01:07.100> this<00:01:08.100> is

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
basically it's very good this is

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.760 
basically it's very good this is
probably<00:01:08.490> one<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.970> better<00:01:09.619> chipsets<00:01:10.619> I

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
probably one of the better chipsets I

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.560 
probably one of the better chipsets I
think<00:01:11.010> my<00:01:11.250> chips<00:01:11.520> if<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.760> processor<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
think my chips if a processor on the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.200 
think my chips if a processor on the
market<00:01:13.020> at<00:01:13.890> least<00:01:14.130> at<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.400> time<00:01:14.670> I'm<00:01:14.909> sure<00:01:14.939> by

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
market at least at this time I'm sure by

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.700 
market at least at this time I'm sure by
tomorrow<00:01:15.240> they'll<00:01:15.780> probably<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.350> giving<00:01:16.619> this

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
tomorrow they'll probably be giving this

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.990 
tomorrow they'll probably be giving this
out<00:01:16.830> for<00:01:16.890> free<00:01:17.040> because<00:01:17.340> they<00:01:17.430> suck<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:17.939> much

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
out for free because they suck so much

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.330 
out for free because they suck so much
but<00:01:18.900> for<00:01:19.140> now<00:01:19.260> I<00:01:19.290> didn't<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.010> this<00:01:20.130> video

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
but for now I didn't I in this video

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.450 
but for now I didn't I in this video
it's<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.580> pretty<00:01:20.760> pretty<00:01:21.299> decent<00:01:21.689> processor

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
it's a pretty pretty decent processor

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.160 
it's a pretty pretty decent processor
they<00:01:23.460> they<00:01:23.939> recently<00:01:24.329> released<00:01:24.659> like<00:01:25.020> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
they they recently released like the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.499 
they they recently released like the
core<00:01:25.439> i7<00:01:25.859> 980x<00:01:26.039> and<00:01:26.640> that's<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:26.880> six<00:01:27.270> core

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
core i7 980x and that's like six core

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.080 
core i7 980x and that's like six core
and<00:01:27.719> it's<00:01:28.049> just<00:01:28.439> ridiculous<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.609> got<00:01:29.969> this

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
and it's just ridiculous so I got this

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.669 
and it's just ridiculous so I got this
from<00:01:30.240> me<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.509> four<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.990> think<00:01:31.229> like<00:01:31.380> three

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:31.679 
from me like four I think like three

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:33.919 
from me like four I think like three
hundred<00:01:31.829> twenty<00:01:32.310> dollars<00:01:32.659> show<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.749> one<00:01:33.899> more

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
hundred twenty dollars show you one more

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.340 
hundred twenty dollars show you one more
time<00:01:34.320> on<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.100> box<00:01:35.509> so<00:01:36.509> I'm<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.929> drawing<00:01:37.140> my

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
time on the box so I'm the drawing my

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.560 
time on the box so I'm the drawing my
bata<00:01:37.560> p<00:01:37.859> i'm<00:01:38.159> going<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.369> go<00:01:38.460> ahead<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.759> open

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
bata p i'm going to go ahead and open

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.899 
bata p i'm going to go ahead and open
the<00:01:40.409> box<00:01:40.439> up<00:01:40.859> and<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.219> see<00:01:41.429> like<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.670> nice

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
the box up and you see like a nice

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.730 
the box up and you see like a nice
little<00:01:42.179> plastic<00:01:42.990> much<00:01:43.200> like<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.499> graphics

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
little plastic much like the graphics

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.649 
little plastic much like the graphics
card<00:01:44.130> i<00:01:44.249> guess<00:01:44.460> that's<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.789> cool<00:01:45.210> thing<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.450> do

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.090 
your case though that'll be going on my
case<00:02:04.200> when<00:02:04.439> i<00:02:04.469> get<00:02:06.289> this<00:02:07.289> looks<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.649> be<00:02:07.679> the

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
case when i get this looks to be the

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.620 
case when i get this looks to be the
processor<00:02:08.759> itself<00:02:10.970> fairly<00:02:11.970> heavy<00:02:12.180> for<00:02:12.510> load

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
processor itself fairly heavy for load

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.490 
processor itself fairly heavy for load
of<00:02:12.750> this<00:02:12.840> very<00:02:13.470> expensive<00:02:14.069> for<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.370> bigot<00:02:14.670> is

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
of this very expensive for a bigot is

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.800 
of this very expensive for a bigot is
yeah<00:02:16.500> it's<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.069> little<00:02:17.190> classic<00:02:17.790> in<00:02:17.970> there<00:02:18.120> and

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
yeah it's a little classic in there and

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.570 
yeah it's a little classic in there and
this<00:02:18.990> is<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.230> main<00:02:19.380> part<00:02:19.650> of<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.770> package<00:02:19.920> not

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
this is the main part of the package not

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.250 
this is the main part of the package not
the<00:02:20.730> main<00:02:20.880> of<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.240> biggest<00:02:21.540> part<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:22.020> the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
the main of the biggest part is the

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.470 
the main of the biggest part is the
heatsink<00:02:22.709> I've<00:02:23.610> heard<00:02:23.790> this<00:02:23.940> actually<00:02:24.330> isn't

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
heatsink I've heard this actually isn't

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.180 
heatsink I've heard this actually isn't
all<00:02:24.660> that<00:02:24.690> great<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:25.290> guess<00:02:25.560> first<00:02:25.830> stock

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
all that great I guess first stock

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.120 
all that great I guess first stock
speeds<00:02:27.060> like<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.300> 2.8<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:28.110> probably<00:02:28.680> do<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:28.920> good

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
speeds like a 2.8 it probably do a good

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.660 
speeds like a 2.8 it probably do a good
job

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
job

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.290 
job
so<00:02:30.819> i<00:02:30.880> have<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.090> arctic<00:02:31.750> silver<00:02:31.959> five<00:02:33.300> thermal

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
so i have a arctic silver five thermal

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.270 
so i have a arctic silver five thermal
paste<00:02:34.540> so<00:02:35.520> yeah<00:02:36.599> just<00:02:37.599> for<00:02:37.780> stock<00:02:38.110> 2.8<00:02:38.920> Cougars

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
paste so yeah just for stock 2.8 Cougars

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.100 
paste so yeah just for stock 2.8 Cougars
it<00:02:39.430> should<00:02:39.550> do<00:02:39.640> fine<00:02:39.880> but<00:02:40.480> probably<00:02:40.870> will

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
it should do fine but probably will

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.370 
it should do fine but probably will
overclock<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.650> 3.5<00:02:42.550> before<00:02:43.000> so<00:02:43.390> because<00:02:44.230> it's

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
overclock to 3.5 before so because it's

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.350 
overclock to 3.5 before so because it's
a<00:02:44.440> great<00:02:44.709> overclocking<00:02:45.280> chip<00:02:45.670> so<00:02:46.000> i<00:02:46.030> might

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
a great overclocking chip so i might

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.820 
a great overclocking chip so i might
i'll<00:02:46.630> probably<00:02:46.870> do<00:02:47.050> that<00:02:47.170> but<00:02:47.350> I<00:02:47.440> have<00:02:47.590> another

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
i'll probably do that but I have another

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.740 
i'll probably do that but I have another
heatsink<00:02:48.310> coming<00:02:48.610> when<00:02:48.940> I<00:02:48.970> order<00:02:49.330> my<00:02:49.450> other

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
heatsink coming when I order my other

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.570 
heatsink coming when I order my other
stuff<00:02:49.870> so<00:02:50.380> that<00:02:51.100> I<00:02:51.130> should<00:02:51.370> be<00:02:51.400> all<00:02:51.550> right

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
stuff so that I should be all right

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.540 
stuff so that I should be all right
there<00:02:51.880> at<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.030> great<00:02:52.300> reviews<00:02:52.630> on<00:02:52.810> it<00:02:52.840> so<00:02:53.550> yes

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
there at the great reviews on it so yes

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.880 
there at the great reviews on it so yes
base<00:02:54.880> with<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.270> pinnacle<00:02:56.080> dr<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.410> heatsink

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
base with the pinnacle dr the heatsink

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.530 
base with the pinnacle dr the heatsink
and<00:02:57.100> one<00:02:57.640> thing<00:02:57.819> i<00:02:57.880> noticed<00:02:58.180> how<00:02:58.239> these<00:02:58.390> are

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
and one thing i noticed how these are

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.449 
and one thing i noticed how these are
plastic<00:02:58.780> so<00:02:59.170> hopefully<00:02:59.530> those<00:02:59.709> don't<00:03:00.010> break

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
plastic so hopefully those don't break

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.490 
plastic so hopefully those don't break
too<00:03:00.489> easy<00:03:00.880> when<00:03:01.150> you're<00:03:01.330> put<00:03:01.959> it<00:03:02.080> on<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.319> board

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
too easy when you're put it on the board

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.710 
too easy when you're put it on the board
