and<00:00:53.420> then<00:00:53.540> you<00:00:53.630> gotta<00:00:53.810> let<00:00:53.930> the<00:00:54.050> line<00:00:54.230> out<00:00:54.410> get

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
and then you gotta let the line out get

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.660 
and then you gotta let the line out get
your<00:00:54.650> dip<00:00:55.270> and<00:00:56.270> then<00:00:56.420> you<00:00:56.540> crank<00:00:57.200> it<00:00:57.610> now<00:00:58.610> you

your dip and then you crank it now you

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.790 
your dip and then you crank it now you
find<00:00:59.000> you<00:00:59.600> find<00:00:59.630> two<00:00:59.990> percent<00:01:00.380> works<00:01:00.560> better

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
find you find two percent works better

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.080 
find you find two percent works better
than<00:01:00.950> one<00:01:01.130> person

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
than one person

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.509 
than one person

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.670 
but sometimes the fish you're lactose
intolerant<00:01:05.910> and<00:01:06.300> then<00:01:06.480> see<00:01:06.960> how<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.260> slow<00:01:07.470> down

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
intolerant and then see how it slow down

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.560 
intolerant and then see how it slow down
yeah<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.160> see<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.490> speed<00:01:08.730> change<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.420> got

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
yeah you see that speed change you got

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.060 
yeah you see that speed change you got
to<00:01:09.690> let<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:10.050> gotta<00:01:10.230> let<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.440> fish<00:01:10.620> catch<00:01:10.830> up
