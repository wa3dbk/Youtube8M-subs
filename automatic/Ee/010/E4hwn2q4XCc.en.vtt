00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.630
 electric vehicle that is marketed 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.340
 in Mexico zero emissions as such that no 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.980
 has an exhaust pipe and that surely 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.010
 will be part of many other markets 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.129
 that are following us what happened in this 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.370
 time that nissan mexicana announces this 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.440
 auto and until June 2014 we have to 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.620
 what happened while Jorge us 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.850
 we negotiate incentives we negotiate with 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.460
 government we not only 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.600
 we market a unit that's another 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.430
 audience surely must 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.439
 understand we are generating a 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.450
 new a new infrastructure of 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.100
 public mobility 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.380
 what does it mean load centers 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.180
 certified incentive distributors 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.950
 of government for obviously after 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.259
 have the feasibility that our 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.640
 program walk reiter not only 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.009
 we market units not only 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.170
 we arrived and we say I'm selling you a vehicle 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.149
 as such we work in incentives that the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.979
 vehicle the cost goes down and that once you 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.409
 be part of the good urban landscape 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.060
 circulate and circulate positively and 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.399
 that also gives rise to all 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.960
 companies and all the public say 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.250
 well I can really buy a 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.770
 vehicle that also has all the 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.959
 sales support financing 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.670
 leasing of a communist brand and that 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:44.250
 obviously it will allow me to be part of 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.770
 this reality that process goes the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.009
 incentive not to pay and it goes for him this 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.390
 auto if you look we have good good support 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.380
 support good governance in some 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.670
 state 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.979
 Great support from Governor Carlos 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.360
 Lozano sent him and told him I send a 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.909
 I greet a big hug also to the 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.409
 graco governor that I hope this one has 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.450
 opportunity to replicate this interview 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.929
 very really and clarified and in fact 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.429
 we are launching with the first runner 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.200
 electrical in Latin America that is going to be 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.180
 from Mexico to Mexico to 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.250
 Cuernavaca is really a great support 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.450
 they are also realizing the 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.469
 benefits that the industry brings 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.469
 good automotive you know that 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:22.180
 aguascalientes is that nissan state like 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:24.099
 but it is a green state in which 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.480
 really has done many things what 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.599
 benefits we obviously have to 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.639
 launch it and with its support we do not pay and 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.590
 sant we do not pay tenure obviously not 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:34.569
 We pay for verification in some states 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.400
 we circulate of course every day 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.109
 without this concept that becomes you can 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.969
 return a bureaucratic issue that we are 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.709
 pushing and with your support also of 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:43.330
 the governments that we are pushing that 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:48.070
 we do not pay and it goes 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:49.990
 16% less of the cost is already 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.870
 we are talking about something very powerful 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.940
 for the final consumer whether company 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.710
 strawberry company also with 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.210
 commitment and social responsibility but 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.000
 the general public will receive and she will not 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.740
 paid a 16 to see already I already bring a 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.050
 benefit not only to the environment 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.670
 as such but I also bring a 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.230
 direct benefit to my pocket now 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.030
 you also have to remember that a vehicle 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.270
 like this one has if we compare it 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.850
 vis-à-vis consumption cost consumption of 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.650
 fuel against energy cost 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.540
 we are talking 40 percent of 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.400
 benefit for energy cost that you 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.340
 delivery will have a range of 160 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.110
 kilometers I give you obviously a 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.320
 status also because good to have a 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.030
 vehicle like this does not allow us to 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.740
 really anyone wants to have 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.780
 a vehicle like this delivered in addition to 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.130
 through these programs that I mentioned 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.480
 of leasing I give you three years of 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.610
 maintenance that you do not have to pay 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.350
 as such I give you obviously too 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.700
 the concierge service gave you 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.400
 also the fact that if the vehicle 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.320
 for any reason you have a fault that 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.910
 good that has been tested with more than 115 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.170
 thousand units but if you have a fault you 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.940
 I deliver a nissan vehicle 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.270
 also in exchange for it I give you 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.560
 insurance included as we said also 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.500
 André this comes with a case 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.709
 as such to take care of it that it is a 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.300
 part of a plus and I give you something 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.830

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.020
 that does not have any other vehicle in 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.209
 mexico also gave you a leadership 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.100
 the fact that a 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.540
 purchaser of a vehicle as such goes to 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.640
 feel more committed to the 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.200
 social awareness today that we have and 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.669
 I also give you the commitment of the 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.100
