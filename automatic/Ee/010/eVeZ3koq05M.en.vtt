maybe<00:03:00.560> that's<00:03:00.739> true<00:03:00.919> that's<00:03:01.699> and<00:03:02.209> I<00:03:02.269> think

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:02.419 
maybe that's true that's and I think

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:04.059 
maybe that's true that's and I think
that's<00:03:02.569> the<00:03:02.719> core<00:03:02.959> of<00:03:02.989> any<00:03:03.109> storyteller<00:03:03.680> which

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
that's the core of any storyteller which

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.339 
that's the core of any storyteller which
is<00:03:04.189> definitely<00:03:04.510> why<00:03:05.510> I<00:03:05.540> became<00:03:05.750> a<00:03:05.900> singer<00:03:06.260> in

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349
