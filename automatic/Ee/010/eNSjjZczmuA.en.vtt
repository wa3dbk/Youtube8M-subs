00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.670
 I want to specify through 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.590
 tell how to make 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.590
 over the bullet 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.650
 for these 1 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:24.440
 bridges for this we need cargo 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:26.440
 Olive mass such 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.730
 which is sharing in half it would be you 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.870
 suitable 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:37.430
 In this case it is a chick then cut 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.980
 it's already eight and in a vise clamped 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.480
 little bucket 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:46.870
 so the tools are vice and hacksaw 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.870
 to metal 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:59.730
 we have a newspaper to not litter we Lemke 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.590
 clamping disks so that her 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:07.800
 the middle 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:08.490
 slightly protruded from the grip is visible line 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.700
 connector 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:17.220
 line guy called being formed 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.930
 casting is a little bit sponge 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.970
 vice 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:27.410
 clamped tightly securely so that when 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:30.360
 sawing she did not play at the same time 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:33.380
 you can not press hard there and not 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.380
 deformed and no 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:45.229
 our films order and I canvass to lips 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.929
 vise take gently to strongly 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:52.780
 watering can not loosen a little 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:56.209
 tighten but it is impossible and I 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:08.530
 deform otherwise will be aesthetically 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:08.530
 to spoil your life ugly 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.269
 it is possible to cut two sides like this 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:26.989
 more or less exactly 4 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:38.120
 how many will see olive a bit 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:43.269
 leans towards the end she will just 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.269
 break off what remains in the middle 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.840
 well there let out a little talk 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.840
 pull up 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.610
 Of course it is painted on the sands 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:22.750
 on a stool on the table music that we where 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:26.620
 anywhere but now there is no settlement at hand 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:31.599
 such fixed pieces therefore 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.599
 defending myself as best I can 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.790
 here 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.599
 we cut off 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.769
 the bullet now only needs to process 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:44.430
 completely clean 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:50.689
 knife edge equalize all know about the blog 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.689
 we can be taught we two bullets 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:08.390
 this way you can make rock how many 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:11.150
 please evidence and carry with them let them 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.840
 ask a snap and she does not hook on the hooks and 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.140
 precipices still occur periodically 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.140
 i know 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.090
 we have to take off 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.539
 in heart 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:37.419
 insert edges and pierce a hole inside 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:37.419
 middle and can use bullet 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:52.169
 bullets full of course it does not call 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:57.710
 Texas is the so-called Russian version 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:57.710
 Russian Texas Russian tegos 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:34.810
 Here is a ready-made bullet of programs with a needle 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.810
 200 here you can still catch 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:44.470
 imbalance bumps on some 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:51.680
 Olives with a thin drill 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:51.680
 turn the hole
