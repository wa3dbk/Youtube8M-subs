00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.230
 well today i received a toy 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.809
 from india and i want to share with i 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.059
 my friends that happiness when me 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.160
 I open the box of a new toy 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.090
 well here in there was my new one 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.949
 toy that is a dedication seems to me 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.680
 a box containing a rifle of 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.199
 precision in reality there was in here 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.699
 nothing but my steady cam made 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.700
 in india flycam the room that flies to ea 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.880
 what is this toy for me? 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.910
 well bought this game peeking out 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.829
 I need to keep the camera I do n't know if 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.840
 you remember the rocky for the first time 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.870
 yes and you are television from the cinema e 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.670
 when he went up the stairs and stairs 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.920
 there is a beautiful camera true that 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.800
 even or then it turned them all around up 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.629
 to which the dedication had not been invented 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.430
 this thing looked like this thing 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.469
 really impossible because only with the 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.870
 cart you could make shots 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.039
 movements in this way the rhyme 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.580
 in Horizon 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:09.630
 so I can hold with one hand 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.310
 the gummer to lower myself and walk while holding 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.580
 the room before I can even 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.460
 also healthy jump and the room remains 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.290
 first of all, absolutely firm 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.840
 balance it as soon as the box is opened 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.659
 I thought it was an Indian touch 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.670
 it is something done by giving up 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.950
 quality certainly give up the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.730
 quality does not compromise on quality 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.159
 these Indians who did this 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:39.479
 if you cam for 70 euros while normally 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.220
 around st 2 3 4 5 6 7 800 1000 euros 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.960
 another venue that ever have the concept 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.020
 base is quite simple you need to have 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.790
 here a comparison with something is called 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.110
 an extremely mobile hook in 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.780
 this way is the weight that balances 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.900
 that balances the camera to one side 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.000
 the attacks are rather cheap yes 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.670
 but they do owe it to you 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.970
 that is, the camera is a solid figure 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.310
 above clearly beyond the camera 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.360
 this is what we could say today 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:17.730
 also put other other rooms too 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:22.050
 heavier from the complete control of the 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.060
 weights and then you can move them there 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.430
 then increase and decrease see here there 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.070
 are various types of weights you can change the 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.870
 position of the same weight move it 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.180
 forward and euro than under this 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.940
 small piece based on what you want 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.549
 let's get to see how it balances yes 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.739
 in this way unbalances the center of gravity e 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.420
 so if I want you to delegate me yes 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.120
 move a little forward a bit back enough 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.220
 that once a balanced this 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.620
 answered a little forward or backward in 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.360
 generally just put it below that 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.680
 we get the camera stopped in 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.440
 horizontal position 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.350
 now let's go for a test with it 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:03.090
 room stabilizer while I go up 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:05.070
 stairs and then if you like them go to 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.450
 search for keywords were 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.410
 changes are all of them 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.360
 as many as you 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:15.160
 what you say is a little used toy but 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.520
 I knew him and I wanted him and 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:23.970
 finally make it found found on 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.970
 ebay bought it we look 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.650
 the thumb
