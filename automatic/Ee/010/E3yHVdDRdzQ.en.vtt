the<00:06:36.310> sofa<00:06:36.640> no<00:06:36.820> I<00:06:37.180> really<00:06:37.900> think<00:06:38.320> that<00:06:38.410> David

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:38.980 
the sofa no I really think that David

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.340 
the sofa no I really think that David
Haye<00:06:39.190> has<00:06:39.790> the<00:06:40.060> heart<00:06:40.300> has<00:06:40.660> the<00:06:40.870> power<00:06:41.080> and

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:41.350 
Haye has the heart has the power and

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.680 
Haye has the heart has the power and
more<00:06:41.560> importantly<00:06:42.040> has<00:06:42.580> the<00:06:42.820> brains<00:06:43.120> to

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:43.690 
more importantly has the brains to

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.260 
more importantly has the brains to
overcome<00:06:44.230> big<00:06:44.830> Vladimirovich<00:06:45.790> I<00:06:45.850> think<00:06:46.180> is

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270 
overcome big Vladimirovich I think is

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.790 
overcome big Vladimirovich I think is
going<00:06:46.480> to<00:06:46.540> be<00:06:46.600> unbelievably<00:06:47.380> hard<00:06:47.590> I<00:06:47.710> think

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800 
going to be unbelievably hard I think

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.500 
going to be unbelievably hard I think
it's<00:06:47.950> going<00:06:48.070> to<00:06:48.100> be<00:06:48.220> controversial<00:06:48.820> I<00:06:49.240> think

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:49.510 
it's going to be controversial I think

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.000 
it's going to be controversial I think
there's<00:06:49.660> going<00:06:49.750> to<00:06:49.810> be<00:06:49.930> cuts<00:06:50.200> involved<00:06:50.680> but<00:06:50.950> I

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.010 
there's going to be cuts involved but I

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.710 
there's going to be cuts involved but I
just<00:06:51.370> think<00:06:51.670> that<00:06:51.820> David<00:06:52.210> Haye<00:06:52.330> can<00:06:52.570> win

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 
just think that David Haye can win

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.690 
just think that David Haye can win
sometime<00:06:53.200> between<00:06:53.350> about<00:06:53.710> six<00:06:53.980> and<00:06:54.220> ten

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:54.700 
sometime between about six and ten

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.190 
sometime between about six and ten
rounds<00:06:55.060> it's<00:06:55.180> going<00:06:55.540> against<00:06:55.870> what<00:06:56.110> the

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:56.200 
rounds it's going against what the

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.200 
rounds it's going against what the
bookmakers<00:06:56.800> say<00:06:56.980> which<00:06:57.430> is<00:06:57.460> why<00:06:57.760> I'm<00:06:57.910> not<00:06:58.090> a

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.210

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.770 
bookmakers say which is why I'm not a
rich<00:06:58.390> man<00:06:58.420> but<00:06:58.840> I<00:06:58.930> just<00:06:58.960> fancied<00:06:59.560> a<00:06:59.680> we<00:06:59.830> make<00:06:59.980> a
