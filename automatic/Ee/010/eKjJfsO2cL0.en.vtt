00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.279
 Hello my name is Sergey and fogs 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.460
 this is a car audio school project 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.650
 you are probably used to that i usually here on 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.799
 such a background of his banner is written there 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.680
 car audio schools are all beautiful partners and 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.910
 so on actually i'm now in 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.130
 I am on vacation right now 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.840
 city ​​of gelendzhik why gelendzhik 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.529
 Well, in general, of course I prefer to rest 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.890
 abroad but i have two children one 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.290
 small I somehow fear while flying 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.030
 on a plane with a small child 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.850
 my children plus like gelendzhik 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.680
 so I came here what can I say 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.059
 I have so little slippers Richie 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.559
 retreat I'll start to relax in shock 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.140
 Gelendzhik costs about the same 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:54.120
 how much in thailand in high season there 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:57.750
 somewhere in February it's cool here 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.969
 so if you have a lot of money then 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.430
 you can afford gelendzhik if 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.290
 you have a little less money you need 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.130
 go somewhere easier to Thailand 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.140
 Turkey to Egypt is actually speaking 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.060
 why am i shooting this video today i 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.860
 I want to tell you a little bit from the trainings 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.460
 which starts us probably in 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.229
 September 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.939
 internal probably exactly in September 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.780
 the third stream of training is fast and 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.040
 autosound 30 new stream new version 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.619
 something we changed 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.259
 today will tell you about what you will 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.780
 engage on the first module that is our 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.829
 training as I probably already know if not 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.259
 know tell now 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.479
 it consists of three modules first module 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.310
 we take beginners teach them to do 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.170
 subwoofers 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.299
 learn how to make some money 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.100
 first money is fast money it is exactly 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.610
 what's called fast money in 2 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.799
 module we are with the same people with some kind 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.789
 by others 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.530
 that is, we work with those who want 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.299
 build on this already your business who 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.490
 wants to leave her miserable job 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.640
 which turns out 15 20 thousand rubles 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.920
 stick like a dog we give the opportunity 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.780
 make your business set up earning 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.810
 as much as you think you are 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:10.549
 worthy and the third module we take those from 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.110
 who already have a business and we derive it 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.720
 to some particular level like 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.900
 minimum double double your profit at 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.459
 during this training and the second stage 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.430
 module we will talk in the following videos 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.140
 today talk about what we will 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.370
 do on the first module that is 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.530
 imagine you are completely new 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.890
 for sure it is when we also 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.120
 invitation only newbies 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.160
 if you think that in order to 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.670
 make a good sounding cool 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.560
 subwoofer need to have such 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.769
 huge head which does not fit 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.980
 screen sizes that are being removed 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:50.230
 video is necessary here some knowledge is necessary 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:53.540
 being a physics professor is all nonsense 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.880
 you just need technology 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.310
 can be completely new and can 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.680
 don't know which side to take the jigsaw 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.590
 which side to go to the computer for 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.750
 calculating let's say acoustic 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.639
 subwoofer box design nevertheless 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.030
 you need to come you really need and 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:16.040
 critically important to come to us and drink we 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.750
 let's give you the technology actually here 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:23.239
 everything is very very very simple you take 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.819
 that so what we give you do that 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.730
 what we tell you and get results 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:33.200
 all very easy do two two three and 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.730
 At the exit you have the result why am I 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.829
 I speak confidently at the con because already 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.920
 passed two streams can look at 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.830
 Vkontakte group on our website 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.300
 huge 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.920
 100 reviews of people who were 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.120
 Really on midi newcomers such 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.360
 what lemmings are called here even 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.450
 this stream 2 which is still in progress 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.890
 one of the participants he is direct to himself no 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.470
 took 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.500
 lemming because why because us 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:05.010
 really knew nothing and now he 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.220
 already making money well 1g a little bit 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.950
 later so here again if you don't even 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.930
 know how to do what to do never 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.530
 I did not do this I invite you we we 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.560
 will teach 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.190
 at the exit with the training you will do 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.780
 subwoofers 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.940
 as professionals do 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.920
 believe in your city is not very much 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.930
 people at least not very many people 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.540
 who is really able to 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.690
 make you be different indigenous 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.430
 99 percent will be different 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.540
 installers who earn it 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.400
 money that they consider themselves 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:40.860
 by professionals and if you even now 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.470
 know how ever you did subwoofers but 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:48.630
 you are not very happy with the result you are not 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:51.330
 know here are some subtleties you have 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.280
 what is there for you in this any 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.850
 secret incomprehensible things also 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.560
 come we will teach you really 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.750
 everything is very very simple just 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.760
 know how to do this you know there is such 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.240
 anecdote when a man in the Zaporozhets near 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.610
 stuck and driving through 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:14.190
 the jeep stopped next to him a man like 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:17.390
 glass drops you what's already stuck stupid 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.870
 miracle than do as I already on fagot and left 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.360
 do as i do 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.130
 technology is all just technology is 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.290
 it seems when you look at it it seems 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.150
 that this is something prohibitive in reality 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.540
 this is all technology this technology we you 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.000
 will give 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.130
 the next step you will do 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.740
 in this training with these subwoofers 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.750
 you need to do something and you do for 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.689
 make yourself a friend then you will understand what 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.499
 you have a salary 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:41.860
 from thousands of rubles or 30 which is also a bit 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:44.769
 agree 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:49.149
 And what do you say to the fact that if I say 

00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:51.429
 you what can you do another 30 a month 

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:53.860
 just work on weekends well that's just 

00:05:51.429 --> 00:05:55.569
 add to your 30 what else do you have 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.119
 rings even if you have a weaving 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:06:01.019
 add another thirty scale 

00:05:58.119 --> 00:06:03.999
 add more weave it nice it 

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:05.469
 really it is possible even to those who live 

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:07.419
 in small towns we also give 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:08.619
 technology how to make money 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:12.509
 doing car audio 

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:15.639
 on the first module we are doing what 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:18.489
 teach you with both build teach you 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:22.389
 there u to make fast money on self 

00:06:18.489 --> 00:06:24.309
 structure we will teach you how to find 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:26.079
 customers as with these customers 

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:27.729
 talk so they want to buy 

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:29.789
 how to make them such an offer 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:32.169
 it would be just silly not to buy from you 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:34.389
 let us give you a model which 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:37.539
 called the model of inevitable sales then 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:39.099
 have you make a client like that 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:41.889
 an offer from which he just doesn't 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:46.599
 can give up and get your own 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:50.529
 money in the last two flows with us 

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:55.139
 probably 80 percent of the people paid off 

00:06:50.529 --> 00:07:00.300
 investment training cost percent 50 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:07:02.019
 two or three times paid off and 20 percent 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:06.909
 made a delta 

00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:09.069
 that is, earned money for training in 

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:12.939
 during the course of the training they bought an instrument 

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:15.459
 bought materials removed boxing 

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:19.989
 somehow found customers typed 

00:07:15.459 --> 00:07:25.389
 business cards earned there thirty on 

00:07:19.989 --> 00:07:28.929
 leave for example and all this for 

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:29.790
 training from scratch, they can do that 

00:07:28.929 --> 00:07:32.970
 make and you 

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:34.950
 we will teach you and at the end of the training you 

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.750
 if you work well and can go 

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.550
 can go to thailand if straight 

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.650
 very good 

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.810
 On Gelendzhik all this was Sergei Mists 

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:44.810
 sign up for training 

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:47.820
 training a little bit lower this video 

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:50.900
 there will be a link come waiting for you we 

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.900
 let's start in September bye
