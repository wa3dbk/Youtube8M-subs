00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
and it comes with its own case which is

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:44.820 
and it comes with its own case which is
actually<00:01:36.790> really<00:01:37.300> really<00:01:37.450> good<00:01:43.380> set<00:01:44.380> up<00:01:44.470> Jeff

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
actually really really good set up Jeff

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.920 
actually really really good set up Jeff
of<00:01:45.400> course<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.860> the<00:01:47.979> case<00:01:48.280> is<00:01:48.340> a<00:01:48.610> it<00:01:49.570> seems

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
of course so the case is a it seems

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.109 
of course so the case is a it seems
pretty<00:01:50.200> good<00:01:50.320> it's<00:01:51.190> not<00:01:51.460> like<00:01:51.670> a<00:01:51.700> classic

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
pretty good it's not like a classic

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.450 
pretty good it's not like a classic
piece<00:01:52.619> type<00:01:53.619> of<00:01:53.740> case<00:01:53.920> which<00:01:54.160> I've<00:01:54.250> have

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
piece type of case which I've have

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.740 
piece type of case which I've have
another<00:01:54.880> tripod<00:01:56.640> has<00:01:57.640> an<00:01:57.820> arm<00:01:57.970> strap<00:01:58.300> to<00:01:58.540> it

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
another tripod has an arm strap to it

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.600 
another tripod has an arm strap to it
which<00:01:59.440> is<00:01:59.590> expendable<00:02:02.700> doubt<00:02:03.700> cup<00:02:04.000> and<00:02:04.350> be<00:02:05.350> a

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
which is expendable doubt cup and be a

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.060 
which is expendable doubt cup and be a
nice<00:02:06.610> little<00:02:06.910> difference<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:11.470> as<00:02:11.590> we<00:02:11.680> take<00:02:11.950> it

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
nice little difference so as we take it

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:26.380 
nice little difference so as we take it
out<00:02:13.350> nothing<00:02:14.350> on<00:02:14.470> some<00:02:14.650> case<00:02:14.920> really

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.080 

so<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.450> has<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.600> pretty<00:02:28.170> beefy<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.770> grip<00:02:29.670> up<00:02:29.850> here

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
so it has a pretty beefy a grip up here

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.780 
so it has a pretty beefy a grip up here
wasn't<00:02:30.590> our<00:02:31.590> didn't<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:32.010> should<00:02:32.250> say<00:02:32.370> expect

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
wasn't our didn't I should say expect

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:41.060 
wasn't our didn't I should say expect
that<00:02:36.050> nice<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.260> solid<00:02:38.870> on<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.930> loom<00:02:40.260> seems

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
that nice and solid on the loom seems

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.320 
that nice and solid on the loom seems

that you probably can take it off and I

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.449 
that you probably can take it off and I
don't<00:03:30.690> worry<00:03:30.810> about<00:03:30.870> that<00:03:31.170> right<00:03:31.290> now<00:03:31.459> does

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
don't worry about that right now does

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.880 
don't worry about that right now does
have<00:03:32.700> this<00:03:32.970> so<00:03:33.480> we<00:03:33.600> are<00:03:33.810> carrying<00:03:34.170> it<00:03:34.440> put<00:03:34.739> your

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
have this so we are carrying it put your

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.520 
have this so we are carrying it put your
hand<00:03:35.070> in<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:36.090> hold<00:03:36.330> it<00:03:36.420> like<00:03:36.540> that<00:03:36.750> so<00:03:37.410> it

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
hand in and hold it like that so it

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:44.300 
hand in and hold it like that so it
never<00:03:37.880> falls<00:03:38.880> anywhere<00:03:40.610> this<00:03:41.610> is<00:03:41.760> simple<00:03:43.310> so

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
never falls anywhere this is simple so

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.020 
never falls anywhere this is simple so
let's<00:03:44.459> see<00:03:44.750> how<00:03:45.750> long<00:03:45.810> we<00:03:46.200> get<00:03:47.040> it<00:03:47.190> all<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:47.880> way

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
let's see how long we get it all the way

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.430 
let's see how long we get it all the way
it<00:03:48.510> seems<00:03:48.750> really<00:03:48.870> really<00:03:49.470> sturdy<00:03:49.950> so<00:03:50.280> far

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
it seems really really sturdy so far
