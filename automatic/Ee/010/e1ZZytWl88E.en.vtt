what<00:00:09.059> does<00:00:09.210> it<00:00:09.269> do<00:00:09.540> I<00:00:09.780> thought<00:00:10.170> well<00:00:10.380> we've

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
what does it do I thought well we've

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.169 
what does it do I thought well we've
developed<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.219> machine<00:00:11.370> that<00:00:11.730> we<00:00:11.790> believe<00:00:12.059> is

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
developed a machine that we believe is

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.490 
developed a machine that we believe is

a couple hours later and the machine

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.830 
a couple hours later and the machine
makes<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.340> 3d<00:00:32.640> object<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.390> what<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.600> can<00:00:33.719> see

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
makes a 3d object of what you can see

this<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.520> another<00:01:20.909> scanned<00:01:21.299> device<00:01:21.780> yeah

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
this is this another scanned device yeah

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.570 
this is this another scanned device yeah
well<00:01:22.470> that's<00:01:22.560> taken<00:01:22.920> from<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.130> cat<00:01:23.310> scan<00:01:23.520> and

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
well that's taken from a cat scan and

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.999 
well that's taken from a cat scan and
actually<00:01:24.180> from<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.659> guy's<00:01:25.049> Hospital<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.680> UK

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
actually from a guy's Hospital in the UK

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.120 
actually from a guy's Hospital in the UK
so<00:01:26.670> like<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.509> area<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.170> orthodontics<00:01:28.920> and

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
so like in the area of orthodontics and

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.819 
so like in the area of orthodontics and
then<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.520> cleft<00:01:29.880> palate<00:01:30.240> palace<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:31.619> know<00:01:31.710> if

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
then the cleft palate palace you know if

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.100 
then the cleft palate palace you know if
you<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.070> get<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> scan<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:33.240> know<00:01:33.390> this

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
you can get a scan of it you know this

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.690 
you can get a scan of it you know this
machine<00:01:34.409> can<00:01:34.530> print<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.860> out<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.310> suppose<00:01:35.549> you

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
machine can print it out so suppose you

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.289 
machine can print it out so suppose you
had<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> scan<00:01:36.229> and<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.530> showed<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:38.040> bone<00:01:38.970> tumor

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
had a scan and it showed a bone tumor

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.630 
had a scan and it showed a bone tumor
you<00:01:39.659> go<00:01:39.930> yeah<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.590> could<00:01:40.770> actually<00:01:40.950> reproduce

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
you go yeah you could actually reproduce

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.999 
you go yeah you could actually reproduce
that<00:01:41.850> physically<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.659> block<00:01:42.810> yes<00:01:43.140> one

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
that physically in a block yes one

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.100 
that physically in a block yes one
application<00:01:44.579> also<00:01:44.790> be<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.299> skulls<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.899> have

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
application also be and skulls that have

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.230 
application also be and skulls that have
defects<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.770> can<00:01:47.520> actually<00:01:47.670> disorders

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
defects you can actually disorders

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.240 
defects you can actually disorders
complain<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.840> surgery<00:01:49.200> beforehand<00:01:49.680> the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
complain the surgery beforehand the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.399 
complain the surgery beforehand the
greatest<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> skull<00:01:51.600> they<00:01:52.170> can<00:01:52.290> get

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
greatest is that the skull they can get

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.740 
greatest is that the skull they can get
the<00:01:52.530> plates<00:01:52.770> molded<00:01:53.729> up<00:01:53.850> on<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.270> actual<00:01:54.540> model

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
the plates molded up on the actual model

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.060 
the plates molded up on the actual model
and<00:01:55.079> then<00:01:55.200> it's<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.500> lot<00:01:55.649> less<00:01:55.890> invasive

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
and then it's a lot less invasive

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.249 
and then it's a lot less invasive
explain<00:01:56.939> exactly<00:01:57.240> what<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.719> happening<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.229> mean

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
explain exactly what is happening I mean

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.319 
explain exactly what is happening I mean
this<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.649> all<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:59.219> one<00:01:59.460> piece<00:01:59.490> you<00:02:00.000> do<00:02:00.119> have<00:02:00.240> to

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
this is all of one piece you do have to

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.569 
this is all of one piece you do have to
glue<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.659> together<00:02:00.869> no<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.159> Machine<00:02:02.430> did

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
glue this together no it the Machine did

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.600 
glue this together no it the Machine did
everything<00:02:03.320> it<00:02:04.320> takes<00:02:04.740> with<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.219> software

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
everything it takes with the software

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.819 
everything it takes with the software
that<00:02:05.729> we've<00:02:05.820> developed<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.450> we've<00:02:07.439> patented

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
that we've developed and we've patented

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.369 
that we've developed and we've patented
this<00:02:08.129> machine<00:02:08.489> so<00:02:08.729> away<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.690> takes<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.110> design

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
this machine so away it takes the design

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.110 
this machine so away it takes the design
that<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.649> have<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:11.099> breaks<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.700> up<00:02:11.760> into<00:02:11.879> a

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
that you have it breaks it up into a

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.990 
that you have it breaks it up into a
number<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.420> layers

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
number of layers

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.550 
number of layers
and<00:02:13.090> then<00:02:13.750> each<00:02:13.960> layer<00:02:14.200> is<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.380> same

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
and then each layer is the same

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.680 
and then each layer is the same
thickness<00:02:14.800> of<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.160> sheet<00:02:15.310> of<00:02:15.430> paper<00:02:15.460> so<00:02:16.420> every

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
thickness of the sheet of paper so every

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.660 
thickness of the sheet of paper so every
share<00:02:16.900> every<00:02:17.320> layer<00:02:17.530> is<00:02:17.710> pulled<00:02:17.950> in<00:02:18.100> it's<00:02:18.370> cut

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
share every layer is pulled in it's cut

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.940 
share every layer is pulled in it's cut
so<00:02:18.910> it<00:02:19.270> makes<00:02:19.720> what<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.050> scan<00:02:20.350> say<00:02:20.710> a<00:02:20.740> cat

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
so it makes what the scan say a cat

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.380 
so it makes what the scan say a cat
scanner<00:02:21.220> would<00:02:21.340> just<00:02:21.520> a<00:02:21.610> slice<00:02:22.030> after<00:02:22.240> slice

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
scanner would just a slice after slice

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.030 
scanner would just a slice after slice
of<00:02:22.810> your<00:02:22.930> brain<00:02:23.170> or<00:02:23.350> whatever<00:02:23.590> organ<00:02:23.920> in<00:02:24.010> your

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
of your brain or whatever organ in your

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.740 
of your brain or whatever organ in your
body<00:02:24.160> but<00:02:24.820> you're<00:02:24.970> doing<00:02:25.150> it<00:02:25.300> and<00:02:25.450> putting<00:02:25.480> on

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
body but you're doing it and putting on

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.660 
body but you're doing it and putting on
paper<00:02:25.960> yeah<00:02:26.170> like<00:02:26.410> if<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.590> looked<00:02:26.770> at<00:02:26.860> this<00:02:27.220> to

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
paper yeah like if you looked at this to

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.860 
paper yeah like if you looked at this to
software<00:02:27.970> here<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.300> you<00:02:28.360> can<00:02:28.510> actually<00:02:28.630> look

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
software here and you can actually look

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.240 
software here and you can actually look
through<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.170> scan<00:02:29.410> you<00:02:29.560> can<00:02:29.650> see<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:29.980> scans

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
through the scan you can see the scans

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.460 
through the scan you can see the scans
going<00:02:30.520> up<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:30.790> down<00:02:30.910> on<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.150> mouse<00:02:31.330> and<00:02:31.690> I<00:02:32.140> see

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
going up and down on the mouse and I see

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.660 
going up and down on the mouse and I see
here<00:02:32.650> you've<00:02:32.770> got<00:02:32.890> a<00:02:32.920> little<00:02:33.130> architectural

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
here you've got a little architectural

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.600 
here you've got a little architectural
model<00:02:33.940> yeah<00:02:34.150> looks<00:02:34.930> like<00:02:35.020> a<00:02:35.140> nice<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:36.190> nice

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
draw the attention to and that's this

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.550 
draw the attention to and that's this
little<00:02:54.160> fella<00:02:54.610> here<00:02:54.730> yeah<00:02:55.330> is<00:02:56.140> that<00:02:56.380> so

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
little fella here yeah is that so

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.620 
little fella here yeah is that so
special<00:02:57.040> well<00:02:57.490> this<00:02:58.000> is<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.180> only<00:02:58.209> machine<00:02:58.480> in

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
special well this is the only machine in

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.150 
special well this is the only machine in
the<00:02:58.720> world<00:02:58.870> that<00:02:59.080> can<00:02:59.170> make<00:02:59.350> a<00:02:59.410> device<00:02:59.920> like

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
the world that can make a device like

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.100 
the world that can make a device like
that<00:03:00.220> that's<00:03:00.490> printed<00:03:00.880> in<00:03:00.970> one<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.600> one<00:03:01.750> print

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
that that's printed in one and one print

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.530 
that that's printed in one and one print
but<00:03:02.650> it<00:03:02.740> has<00:03:02.860> a<00:03:02.890> variable<00:03:03.280> stiffness<00:03:03.760> so

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
but it has a variable stiffness so

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.660 
but it has a variable stiffness so
effectively<00:03:04.990> you<00:03:05.320> have<00:03:05.470> a<00:03:05.500> living<00:03:05.800> hinge<00:03:06.040> as<00:03:06.610> a

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
effectively you have a living hinge as a

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.170 
effectively you have a living hinge as a
living<00:03:06.940> language<00:03:07.660> on<00:03:07.990> in<00:03:08.230> one<00:03:08.730> process<00:03:09.730> in

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
living language on in one process in

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.480 
living language on in one process in
that<00:03:10.240> machine<00:03:10.690> this<00:03:10.990> is<00:03:11.050> what<00:03:11.920> you<00:03:12.040> hit<00:03:12.190> print

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
that machine this is what you hit print

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.190 
that machine this is what you hit print
the<00:03:13.000> machine<00:03:13.270> does<00:03:13.510> it<00:03:13.630> itself<00:03:13.870> you<00:03:14.020> don't

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
the machine does it itself you don't

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
the machine does it itself you don't
have<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.380> do<00:03:14.470> anything<00:03:14.650> you<00:03:14.740> just<00:03:14.800> come<00:03:15.070> back

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
have to do anything you just come back

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.910 
have to do anything you just come back
and<00:03:15.430> take<00:03:15.490> the<00:03:15.640> part<00:03:15.850> out<00:03:16.000> and<00:03:16.209> like<00:03:16.540> we've<00:03:16.720> had

as quickly as possible this is really

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.250 
as quickly as possible this is really
the<00:03:34.209> type<00:03:34.360> of<00:03:34.390> machine<00:03:34.720> that<00:03:34.840> they<00:03:34.930> need<00:03:35.080> to

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
the type of machine that they need to

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.900 
the type of machine that they need to
get<00:03:35.380> that<00:03:35.530> somebody<00:03:36.040> complex<00:03:36.430> like<00:03:36.550> the<00:03:36.700> skull

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
get that somebody complex like the skull

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.130 
get that somebody complex like the skull
how<00:03:37.090> long<00:03:37.239> would<00:03:37.330> it<00:03:37.390> take<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.660> do<00:03:37.930> that

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
how long would it take to do that

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.530 
how long would it take to do that
yeah<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.739> skull<00:03:38.980> took<00:03:39.220> about<00:03:39.430> 27<00:03:40.239> hours<00:03:40.330> to

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
yeah the skull took about 27 hours to

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.180 
yeah the skull took about 27 hours to
make<00:03:40.690> but<00:03:40.930> there's<00:03:41.080> probably<00:03:41.170> like<00:03:41.470> 700

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
make but there's probably like 700

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.970 
make but there's probably like 700
layers<00:03:42.370> of<00:03:42.810> wood<00:03:43.810> you<00:03:43.930> just<00:03:44.140> put<00:03:44.560> it<00:03:44.680> in<00:03:44.769> there

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
layers of wood you just put it in there

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.890 
layers of wood you just put it in there
and<00:03:45.190> then<00:03:45.430> switch<00:03:45.820> out<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.090> Machine<00:03:46.299> and<00:03:46.480> walk

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
and then switch out the Machine and walk

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.220 
and then switch out the Machine and walk
away<00:03:47.080> yeah<00:03:47.410> yeah<00:03:48.120> it's<00:03:49.120> an<00:03:49.239> overnight<00:03:49.510> type<00:03:50.080> of

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230

thing or like product designers for
example<00:03:52.420> if<00:03:52.870> I<00:03:52.989> had<00:03:53.140> four<00:03:53.350> or<00:03:53.470> five<00:03:53.620> different

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
example if I had four or five different

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.800 
example if I had four or five different
designs<00:03:54.340> they<00:03:55.120> could<00:03:55.269> put<00:03:55.390> the<00:03:55.480> four<00:03:55.630> or<00:03:55.690> five

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
designs they could put the four or five

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.330 
designs they could put the four or five
different<00:03:55.989> designs<00:03:56.410> into<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.830> machine<00:03:57.100> and

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
different designs into the machine and

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.949 
different designs into the machine and
they<00:03:57.790> come<00:03:57.940> back<00:03:58.060> the<00:03:58.209> next<00:03:58.269> morning<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:58.840> they

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
they come back the next morning and they

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.810 
they come back the next morning and they
actually<00:03:59.260> they<00:03:59.470> can<00:03:59.530> pick<00:04:00.100> up<00:04:00.280> for<00:04:00.430> example

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
actually they can pick up for example

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.750 
actually they can pick up for example
the<00:04:00.970> camera<00:04:01.320> because<00:04:02.320> there<00:04:03.280> I'm<00:04:03.549> looking

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
here at the the dental application that

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.000 
here at the the dental application that
this<00:04:07.090> is<00:04:07.239> a<00:04:07.269> mold<00:04:07.720> and<00:04:08.049> a<00:04:08.290> dentist<00:04:08.650> instead<00:04:08.890> of

this is a mold and a dentist instead of

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.890 
this is a mold and a dentist instead of
standing<00:04:09.250> it<00:04:09.370> off<00:04:09.519> can<00:04:10.030> actually<00:04:10.120> do<00:04:10.390> it<00:04:10.510> yeah

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
standing it off can actually do it yeah

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
yeah well that's like this this is a

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.159 
yeah well that's like this this is a
look<00:04:27.040> at<00:04:27.220> it's<00:04:27.639> made<00:04:27.850> in<00:04:27.970> two<00:04:28.120> parts<00:04:28.479> so<00:04:29.139> that

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
look at it's made in two parts so that

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:30.540 
look at it's made in two parts so that
was<00:04:29.380> just<00:04:29.470> printed<00:04:29.860> in<00:04:29.949> one<00:04:30.070> go<00:04:30.250> so<00:04:30.520> just

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
was just printed in one go so just

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.129 
was just printed in one go so just
printed<00:04:31.000> like<00:04:31.090> that<00:04:31.240> in<00:04:31.389> the<00:04:31.479> machine<00:04:31.750> and

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
printed like that in the machine and

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.719 
printed like that in the machine and
then<00:04:32.530> you<00:04:32.620> take<00:04:32.800> a<00:04:32.830> back<00:04:33.039> but<00:04:33.430> it's<00:04:33.580> very

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
then you take a back but it's very

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.189 
then you take a back but it's very
accurate<00:04:33.970> you<00:04:34.240> could<00:04:34.389> see<00:04:34.509> the<00:04:34.600> two<00:04:34.720> parts<00:04:35.020> pen

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
accurate you could see the two parts pen

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:36.300 
accurate you could see the two parts pen
you<00:04:35.289> can<00:04:35.350> see<00:04:35.590> whether<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:35.949> whole<00:04:36.070> thing<00:04:36.220> is

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
you can see whether the whole thing is

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.650 
you can see whether the whole thing is
going<00:04:36.460> to<00:04:36.520> work<00:04:36.639> yeah<00:04:36.880> and<00:04:37.090> you<00:04:37.210> can<00:04:37.389> you<00:04:37.509> can

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
going to work yeah and you can you can

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.240 
going to work yeah and you can you can
actually<00:04:37.780> touch<00:04:38.139> the<00:04:38.410> design<00:04:38.710> and<00:04:38.919> field<00:04:39.100> I

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
actually touch the design and field I

you'd<00:04:51.220> think<00:04:51.520> of<00:04:51.639> like<00:04:51.820> a<00:04:51.850> HP<00:04:52.419> or<00:04:52.630> a<00:04:52.660> Xerox<00:04:53.110> it's

eco-friendly 3d printer in the world so

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.520 
eco-friendly 3d printer in the world so
assume<00:05:13.449> you<00:05:13.600> could<00:05:13.750> scale<00:05:13.960> up<00:05:13.990> and<00:05:14.349> have

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
assume you could scale up and have

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.290 
assume you could scale up and have
bigger<00:05:14.770> paper<00:05:15.039> and<00:05:15.460> therefore<00:05:15.760> bigger<00:05:15.940> models

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
bigger paper and therefore bigger models

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.230 
bigger paper and therefore bigger models
yes<00:05:16.660> we<00:05:16.840> very<00:05:17.050> easy<00:05:17.229> just<00:05:17.410> to<00:05:17.500> go<00:05:17.680> to<00:05:17.710> a<00:05:18.400> three

yes we very easy just to go to a three

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.279 
yes we very easy just to go to a three
or<00:05:19.270> a<00:05:19.419> one<00:05:19.780> paper<00:05:21.120> last<00:05:22.120> thing<00:05:22.360> for<00:05:22.690> the<00:05:22.810> for
