00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.080
 3 reasons is the first reason 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.400
 lack of time 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.809
 and that is really just because of the 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.740
 school turmoil more good want to go 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.000
 milking 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.270
 The second reason is that they have more time 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.740
 want to get private and third 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.750
 reason is actually the most heard 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.820
 again due to the additional problem that they have 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.470
 the companies also have them now 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.910
 again more time to put the dots on the i 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.349
 are going to put 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.760
 but I have been working a lot in recent years 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.740
 that the cost very much more 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.270
 plays costs technically it is 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.280
 just a really competitive at 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.570
 compared to eden mechanization 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.670
 as you can use it in time 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.170
 save for the dairy farmer 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.149
 soon interesting to the lining out 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.430
 to spend and you can see because 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.870
 I was the fourth contractor ten years ago 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.300
 started now there are a lot 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.219
 or forty in the Netherlands not already 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.660
 offer the wage for it 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.129
 small interest I call you work it over 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.820
 the machines so I'm at a point of it 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.740
 The I go my chill 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.380
 flowers 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.460
 yet a third so yes this is disappointing 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.180
 investment to and 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.440
 that would be the moment layover week 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.960
 keep it yourself 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.299
 tonight will 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.130
 definitely consider watching from against 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.020
 reflect against my costs 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.400
 the alternation are closed in the future 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.650
 also to the 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.460
 innovative when we can preview 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.930
 make it consider 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.670
 I think about being in doubt 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.920
 mainly try it for a week 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.260
 or two weeks 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.500
 then you can do it yourself 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.720
 benefits of 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.030
 bascule 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.630
 the words that are always just as concrete 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.220
 steps taken 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.240
 but if we look at the rise here 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.160
 then I know for sure that there is 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.400
 future operating only hear 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.810
 bigger it's actually about it 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.790
 entrepreneurs who 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.520
 or need to be replaced 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.670
 their own recruitment or that in 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.350
 timetrouble float to hear more there 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.630
 still gives only 24 hours 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.490
 so the wood starts getting now the 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.160
 impression that cow farmers are only just starting 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.800
 to count what it costs me 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.000
 a certain product and it falls into it 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.539
 ration 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.539
 what comes out 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.270
 I work per minute so it is whole 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.760
 depending on the company what the costs 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.300
 his costs are roughly between 28 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.250
 and 40 cents per cow per day that is a whole 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.780
 wide spread, but that is mainly due to it 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.820
 in the logistics on the companies of the 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.950
 number of cows and the number of products and 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.140
 the number of mixtures that you have to make 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.850
 limburg some companies mainly in 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.800
 lawn mowers have the logistics perfect 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.930
 OK, the first already in lawson 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.920
 away ' other companies need two three 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.989
 make mixtures and 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.549
 measure with multiple products and then goes 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.720
 spend more time on it so fall to it 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.620
 at the end of the story 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:50.240
 have to pay more is the biggest benefit 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.920
 very precise because we have one here 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.310
 Have a bathroom scale that is already sharp 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.870
 city ​​instead of one and so full I have 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.640
 consciously opted for this at the time 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.020
 machine has this triolite machine 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.180
 so no system and the place of one 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.920
 fresh stay in the mold working itself 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.210
 breeders always with the trioliet cutter 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.550
 was then three lessons with the 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.930
 cream and with a cut 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.850
 system that has again 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.140
 major convicts first 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.180
 fuel consumption it was for the 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.160
 contractor very interesting 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.170
 in addition, the structure story a cow 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.970
 is a continued ruminating the structure and 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.770
 puncture in the feed must say otherwise 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.930
 functions i could and cut 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.270
 retains the structure that is in the feed 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.220
 sits and comes that for feeding 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.690
 of course you can be power oh you 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.410
 adding that is all none 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.760
 issue 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.650
 but the cool don't milk it 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.870
 and then only costs money and 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.750
 you shouldn't want that, well me 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.230
 got that shit shit wo passion new 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.460
 walk along when the oil starts to orientate 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.810
 on it 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.090
 irmato 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.400
 also vertically 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.319
 and i know with cost comparison with 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.950
 approximately with the costs per test 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:58.400
 sacrifice only one 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.750
 but myself doing is time yes I had 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.750
 moment when I do 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:09.410
 Who can again xp again carry squla 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:11.390
 structural raw chocolate words it is 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.190
 sometimes a bit unknown but if you 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.630
 she tries a few months herself 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.549
 it can be very interesting the cups 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.109
 see for yourself if it is something for yourself if 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.680
 farmer or 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.680
 for the company
