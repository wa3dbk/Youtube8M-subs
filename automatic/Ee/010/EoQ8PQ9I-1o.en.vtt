00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.349
 now my youtube people welcome to 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.199
 I was erased 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.760
 how 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:35.739
 the good shirt welcome to this new 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.170
 episode of our program that is 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.239
 call making of in this segment we are going to 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.920
 be learning what lenses are and 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.260
 I know he has promised to talk about plans and 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.930
 we are going to take it in the next episode 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.390
 since it made me a bit long and there 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.830
 a lot of things to learn many 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.720
 techniques that have to do with 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.760
 lenses and it's important to know if you're 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.220
 so interested in all this of the 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:02.250
 cinematography so let's see from 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.250
 what is this about and we are going to see lenses 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.460
 and it just starts on this issue of the 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.830
 cinematography maybe the five lenses 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.260
 that you know are a zoom lens or the 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.330
 approach will not allow them the 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.220
 flexibility to take broad shots and 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.010
 approaches quickly and continuously 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.110
 without the need to change the type of 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.700
 lens that you have on your camera so 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.070
 to start talking about lenses we are going to 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.360
 have to talk about focal length the 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.250
 focal length has to do with the 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.680
 angle of view and the distance that 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.330
 the lens can focus on this graph 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.360
 for example we can see distances 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.550
 focal lengths of 14 millimeters up to 400 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.710
 millimeters and you can also observe 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.560
 how much the angle of vision varies with 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.750
 regarding the focal length in this 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.000
 another example we can also see how 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.890
 different focal lengths affect your 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.570
 picture these pictures as you can see 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.420
 they were taken from the same point but 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.850
 at different focal distances this is 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.250
 can do with different fixed lenses or 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.380
 with a zoom lens the lenses are going to 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.730
 vary in its focal length which 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.820
 it can be high 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.400
 or low as for example excellent that is 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.260
 the toquin to 11 to 16 millimeters 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.710
 this lens varies in its focal length 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.950
 of 11 millimeters which is the widest to 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:21.210
 16 millimeters and although its approach 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.830
 it is perhaps a little not very broad 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.480
 focal substance gives the name of a 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.600
 zoom lens or we also have the 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.430
 telephoto lenses these are also lenses 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.960
 zoom but its focal length is more 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:37.180
 wide and usually goes between 70 to 300 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:41.530
 millimeters now maybe you have seen 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:45.580
 when your camera says it has a lens 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.160
 of 13 x 4 x 5 x what all this means 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.380
 this basically refers to your 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.620
 camera can zoom up to two three or 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.970
 more times its minimum focal length per 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.980
 example if your camera says 33 millimeters 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.040
 78 x like this one for nations that are 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.720
 seeing right now that means that this 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.490
 camera can make an optical zoom 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.640
 two thousand five hundred seventy-four 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.740
 millimeter the user of youtube marco 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.690
 Antonio 2 has taken this video as 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.810
 example to show the capabilities of 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.390
 this camera panasonic the approach 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.640
 Now that you run now and buy a 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.400
 camera with this amount of approach 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.350
 maybe it's not my recommendation to not 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.720
 he feels he wants to make a paparazzi if 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.280
 that 's what you want because it's a camera 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.350
 with this team approach is 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.590
 perfect for you this also applies 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.660
 for the lenses of the dslr cameras by 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.380
 example some lenses from 24 to 70 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.459
 millimeters would have a 3x zoom 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.500
 approximately but this is not 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.280
 commonly illustrated well in lenses 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.140
 this the use of 12 x 13 x etcetera is 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.540
 most commonly used in cameras with 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.880
 lenses included like this panasonic that 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.220
 we just watched now take into account 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.140
 which is an optical is very different from zoom 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.660
 digital you never want to use your zoom 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.660
 digital your digital zoom is going to make you 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.640
 that the image looks pixel and is also 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.530
 a digital you can do 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.660
 an editing program on the computer 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.560
 if you want the other type of lens they are 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.209
 live lenses 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.010
 these lenses can not do 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.609
 approaches since its focal length 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.870
 is already an example would be excellent called 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.730
 a normal lens 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.490
 we started with excellent because its 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.470
 focal length is 50 millimeters what 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.180
 which approximates it to the normal view of 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.190
 humans now takes into account that the 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.410
 focal length of your lens can look 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.060
 different depending on what camera what 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.950
 place this has to do with the 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.480
 size of the sensor that your camera uses in 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.280
 comparison with the plane sensor 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.100
 full of 35 millimeters 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:48.210
 for example in your camera is a canon of 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:50.880
 slr as the 60 of the 7 of the t2 follows 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.830
 canon these have a smaller sensor 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.370
 so you have to multiply the 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.410
 focal length of your lens by 1.6 is 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.180
 equivalent of 50 millimeters is 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.700
 converts to an 80-millimeter lens 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.650
 when you use it in these cameras 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.320
 other types of lenses are the great 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.150
 angles ranging from 28 millimeters to 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.920
 40 millimeters 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.330
 these are called like that since they have a 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.550
 wider view than the eye 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.680
 human is able to see more lenses 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.900
 broad as the 12 millimeter or 16 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.900
 millimeters among others are called 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.990
 super-angular fisheye and his vision 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.790
 is as wide as 180 degrees or more in 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.370
 my latest documentary called Marse 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:32.010
 maker use three types of lenses 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.370
 different according to the witness that is the 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:38.340
 50 mm lens of the normal entity and 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:43.380
 use the teacher his excellent his was 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:44.010
 the toquÃ­n to 11 16 and the canon from 24 to 70 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.840
 millimeters 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:50.160
 these two lenses are have an opening 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:52.410
 continuous of f 2.8 which is convenient 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.600
 if you want to record while you approach without 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.640
 that your image begins to darken that 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.970
 it's a good opening opening a 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:02.190
 lens are measured efe stoxx or the number efe 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:05.100
 the number f is basically the opening 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:07.569
 minimum and maximum diaphragm of a 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.270
 lens that looks something like this 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:12.759
 the smallest number f more open 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.159
 is the diaphragm letting in more light 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:18.069
 to the lenses for example an opening of 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:20.169
 1.4 will allow more light to enter the sensor 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:22.869
 of your camera giving you a better image in 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:25.300
 low light shots otherwise a 

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:27.309
 opening of f-22 means that the 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.889
 diaphragm is more closed thus 

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:31.629
 enter less light to the sensor finally 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.399
 well something that is very important not 

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:36.490
 we can talk about lens without talking about 

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:38.259
 this is the depth of field and the 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.749
 depth of field we will see in 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:43.209
 the next episode and we 'll see it 

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:45.249
 along with the planes so you do not get 

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:47.060
 miss this next episode of making 

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:51.130
 of 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.130
 I do not know what to say changed my shirt 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:54.469
 I do not see
