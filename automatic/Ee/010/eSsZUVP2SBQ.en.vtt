00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.140
 video tutorial I will explain how 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:42.140
 install minecraft upgradeable number 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.290
 the game files will not be downloaded 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.730
 is that they have been downloaded from 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.370
 appear like this to extract it 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.350
 they will need a program called winrar 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.400
 If you do not have it, I'll leave you 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.670

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.390
 option to be here 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.810
 now we wait for him to determine the 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.810
 extraction 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.750
 it is not that the extraction has finished 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.840
 I will leave you 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.369
 a folder like this we enter it 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.790
 and within it there will be other two 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:24.610
 folders we copy this one 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.730
 and we say to the next route home 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.880

 been varying on the computer not 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.130
 we went there 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.030
 and then we 're going to 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.250
 the app data folder 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.720

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.720
 and here we stick it 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.880
 all right 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.880
 and we can close this 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:06.000
 we go back to the folder and 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.000
 we copy this folder 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.600
 and we go to the beginning route 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.620
 kind 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.620
 is to stand 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.250
 Parents program or program files 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.620
 and look for microsoft protection options 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.210
 games if you do not have this folder 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.000
 it does not matter they can create 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.480
 we right click on a space 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.050
 empty 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.560
 divestment new folder and just lex 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:45.150
 in name you put microsoft in one time 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:49.220
 they have it we enter and here we paste it 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.730
 you say goodbye, we'll continue 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.730
 yes 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.420
 we enter 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.050
 and here I understand in the folder 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.480
 depending on your operating system in 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.050
 my case is windows 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.050
 sorry 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.730
 and we will create in a shortcut of this 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:17.489
 archive 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.489
 send desktop direct access 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.970
 we closed this 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.310
 and here as you can see, 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.790
 and now we go in to see if 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.790
 work 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.990
 against 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.519
 we wait for a moment what opens up in 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:42.620
 the game 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:45.140
 As you can see, it has already been opened and if it works 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.430
 this game unlike the other does not ask 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.709
 password 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.280
 Well, just ask them to write the 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.660
 name of anyone 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.660
 I would put him Alexander 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.460
 check this box this box serves 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.830
 to update the game so it's not 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.900
 necessary that the brand in each enters into 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.790
 the game is only marked when they want 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.730
 that the game is updated to a 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.550
 latest version 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.700
 well now we click on / gay 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:20.840
 and start to upgrade to fire 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.840
 we wait for an account moment 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:30.810
 this process is not very delayed 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.810
 rubÃ©n to 8 fast 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.880
 good 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.200
 and as you see, you have already started 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.660
 the default game is in English but 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.220
 it does not matter we can not change we're going to 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.000
 options 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:55.900
 by sovereign language or language 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.780
 good english 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:03.220
 and they choose their language in my case is Spanish 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.950
 mexico and we are in finished 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:09.920
 because again in finished and as you see 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:11.560
 Spanish has already been translated 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.950
 life 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.560
 and create the world just to see how 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:19.050
 they are in that game 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.800
 create new world write in the name 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.800
 that you want 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:28.750
 Minecraft 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.449
 to survival mode 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:36.200
 create new world 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:38.540
 and start generating the world 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.110
 this will take longer to me than you 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.420
 because I'm recording 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.670
 so 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:48.630
 do not think that they will take a whole 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.630
 eternity as well as me 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:54.420
 and you have to be a 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:57.860
 we wait a moment 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.860
 Know that I love you 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:05.449
 to use the video a bit in what 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:08.330
 finish this process now I go back 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:10.569
 good that as you see has already started the 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.569
 game 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.460
 more or less the game is something like that 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.629
 maybe you see the other side as I mentioned 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:27.370
 previously it is because it is recording 

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:27.370
 you will draw back a little better 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.129
 ah 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.000
 good 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:39.289
 basically this has been all the 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.639
 tutorial I hope you liked it and 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:42.300
 more than anything because they have 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:47.550
 operated 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:49.740
