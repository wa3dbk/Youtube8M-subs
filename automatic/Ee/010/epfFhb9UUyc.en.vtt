 for those who do not know and who 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:52.170
 think I'm just a big troll 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:53.640

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.480
 access to a service that the watch of 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.180
 taken between an online service that's 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.549
 a site makes it a website and there is 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.140
 access only pre-order and well 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.180
 obviously with their traders and their 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.900
 twitter phrases ubisoft just announced 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.540
 on the fact that if we do not have 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.850
 watch on is not a real killer 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.310
 rid of his devoted will have access 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.540
 at 0 h 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.700
 that's why I'm pissed off it's 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.070
 because I'm sorry but we're not 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.750
 not obliged to buy a game 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.670
 to say is a fan 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.200
 especially since I have pre-ordered because 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.939
 that a nice collector's edition 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.390
 with personally the game 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.640

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.790
 take off a treasure map what are we going 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.860
 decode live we knew too hard then 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.630
 So here is a kind of laughter 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.170
 sincerely the customer principle of 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.210
 Easter 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.100
 I like I find these six tests 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.800
 I like 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.350
 on the other hand 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.630
 the problem is stylish when it's a 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.770
 little kind surprise so I held back for 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.510
 reward those who enter and 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.100
 Andalusian full of russian the announced 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.750
 if you pre-order ouzou it is at the 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.640
 condition sent these defendants before one 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.910
 do not know what the works has been announced 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:18.220
 so suddenly used royal marines itunes 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:20.680

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.850

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.510
 special they took jacks is normal 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.100
 of dvd and they put her in there 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.170
 by the way tore up advanced 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.550
 normally they put her in here 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.790
 it's genuinely great what includes a 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.280
 Gold card and digital content 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.620
 so digital content there actually 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.120
 it's the code ok hang on because 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.430
 that you can own says has given in 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.530
 then the digital content these two codes 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.120
 which will be hidden has described and limits I 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.370
 phoned him my online code which 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.540
 echo there is a barcode on it 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:05.320

 Is what I paid owen card 1-inch 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.920
 code I say my code will not forget 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.140
 first an alert then is that they in 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.670
 France and go on the doubled for 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.170
 assassin's creed points like that jail

 pipped well that vip 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.570

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.959
 and so we have to decode would have pulled at 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.890
 decode because closely it is written 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.459
 you will need internet access 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.770
 broadband 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.140

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.209
 this story to decode the map use 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.180
 the treasure map to unlock the 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.970
 bonus content the pirate's trophy does not 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.000

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.210
 I like an idea of ​​the price in 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:28.310
 Easter but it's not good it's the way 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.050
 which it was announced and presented that 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.669
 I do not like the watch sincerely 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.200
 what about when you stop something that 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.660
 is called project legacy to make a 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.280
 thing we told you that all murderers 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.050
 have to do that while the game is 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:47.570
 a pirate game it's a game 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:48.110
 assassins chorena marc so on this I

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.390
 ask you in addition to put a 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.130
 green thumb for this video because 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.360
 you agree with me but as 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.740
 these styles and because I have not 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.960

 very pleased can say that you 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.630
 are happy to have seen or had 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:07.790
 because in the end who does not have that 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.840
 sincerely because when all 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.419
 bookings plus all 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.950
 pre-orders renames the exclusive word I 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:13.720
 do not know where he left because good 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:18.050
 it was a trick 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.400
 exclusive a vip and if you're not so 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.970
 you do not have the var is not a real 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.940
 assassin all will comment no one that I have 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:29.660
 saw what was the entrance is evry 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:31.910
 disposable blacklight power so pins 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.520
 clubs with flower you who did not 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:37.280
 pre-ordered the game so go to ubisoft 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.430
 hatchet pays buy it now because 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.729
 that later and reindeer bayod 2-3 and we 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.009
 will see gameplay and we will do that 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:49.629
 in fact that's the game 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:50.979
 oh that's good I stop trolling I 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:52.389
 take risks by doing this not in 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:54.580
 do I cause because it makes 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:56.139
 bus made date where you know the voice the 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.580
 blow I am thoroughly in this role but I 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:58.839
 say exclusively because if I am told 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.029
 no there are always assholes will do 

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:02.949
 but comments and whether or not I am 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:04.899
 really it really annoys me the offers 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:06.520
 marketing how to present themselves 

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:07.779
 but on the other hand I will understand 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.099
 that's normal they want to sell to 

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:11.229
 the entry all the license once they 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:13.089
 have squeezed and that has nothing more to draw 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:13.960
 you have to put more into marketing 

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:15.969
 that in game development 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.289
 himself after all the game I do not have 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:18.999
 still played I think I'm going to be 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:21.009
 cool but it will be a pirate game 

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:22.059
 and that I am a fan of the first 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:24.129
 Assassin's Creed 

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:26.680
 I'll have a little trouble finding myself 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:28.509
 good on that moment I can not wait to talk 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.529
 thank you for watching disturbed and a 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:30.999
 last time a little look 

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:32.469
 rijkaard treasure if it finds the video 

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:34.749
 was poorly framed in this case I am 

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:36.189
 sorry then not look at the code 

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:40.509
 because after all I'm still 

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:41.919
 enjoy my club okay ok I 'll do 

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:44.319
 a con contest to come a pass 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:45.669
 and then I ask for another then that 

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:46.059
 mean wave cannes we look at the 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:47.649
 map 

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:49.029
 it's beautiful, you know do that 

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:50.199
 we have already seen on the internet I do not 

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:53.559
 how once because the picture is 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:56.139
 already released so to decode his rival 

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:58.539
 there are crosses on animals and on 

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:00.339
 islands echoed at school is serious and 

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:05.379
 something about havana with island nassau 

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:06.849
 in ga to the whore I understood everything or 

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:11.490
 there I am piri reis 

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:13.689
 I captured everything it's just beautiful 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:18.039
 ubisoft all rights reserved 

00:07:13.689 --> 00:07:20.189
 I'm not so sad because 

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:20.189
 it is
