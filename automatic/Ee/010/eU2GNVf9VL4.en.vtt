00:00:45.300 --> 00:01:18.380 
going to take a star and put that in the
middle<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.780> cuticle

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.420 

when<00:01:19.390> it<00:01:19.540> comes<00:01:19.810> to<00:01:20.080> nail<00:01:20.290> designs<00:01:20.770> for<00:01:21.130> short

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
when it comes to nail designs for short

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.600 
when it comes to nail designs for short
nails<00:01:21.700> it's<00:01:22.240> best<00:01:22.570> to<00:01:22.690> keep<00:01:22.960> them<00:01:23.560> as<00:01:24.100> simple

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
nails it's best to keep them as simple

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.480 
nails it's best to keep them as simple
and<00:01:24.760> graphic<00:01:24.940> as<00:01:25.479> possible<00:01:26.050> you<00:01:27.040> don't<00:01:27.280> have<00:01:27.460> a

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
and graphic as possible you don't have a

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.400 
and graphic as possible you don't have a
lot<00:01:27.670> of<00:01:27.700> space<00:01:27.970> to<00:01:28.180> work<00:01:28.330> with<00:01:28.660> so<00:01:28.990> you<00:01:29.050> want<00:01:29.290> it

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
lot of space to work with so you want it

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.310 
lot of space to work with so you want it
to<00:01:29.530> keep<00:01:29.680> it<00:01:29.920> uncluttered<00:01:30.960> something<00:01:31.960> clean

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
to keep it uncluttered something clean

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:52.190 
to keep it uncluttered something clean
with<00:01:32.619> dots<00:01:32.860> is<00:01:33.250> really<00:01:33.820> effective

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.020 

if<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:53.440> make<00:01:53.620> the<00:01:53.770> design<00:01:54.130> in<00:01:54.400> the<00:01:54.550> cuticle

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
if you make the design in the cuticle

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.180 
if you make the design in the cuticle
line<00:01:55.240> it<00:01:55.510> takes<00:01:55.540> the<00:01:55.900> attention<00:01:56.440> away<00:01:56.530> again

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
line it takes the attention away again

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.920 
line it takes the attention away again
from<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.610> length<00:01:57.820> of<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.240> nail<00:01:58.450> so<00:02:00.840> now<00:02:01.840> I'm

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
from the length of the nail so now I'm

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.170 
from the length of the nail so now I'm
going<00:02:02.080> to<00:02:02.140> paint<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.740> diminishing<00:02:03.280> size<00:02:03.729> dots

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
going to paint to diminishing size dots

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.500 
going to paint to diminishing size dots
on<00:02:04.780> top<00:02:04.840> of<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.830> start<00:02:06.160> and<00:02:06.520> that's<00:02:06.820> to<00:02:07.210> create

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
on top of the start and that's to create

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:14.790 
on top of the start and that's to create
an<00:02:07.900> illusion<00:02:08.259> of<00:02:09.660> length<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:13.720> get<00:02:13.870> my<00:02:14.020> dots<00:02:14.290> I

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
an illusion of length to get my dots I

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:36.080 
an illusion of length to get my dots I
put<00:02:15.459> some<00:02:15.820> polish<00:02:16.180> on<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.690> brush<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:17.440> then<00:02:18.100> I

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.199 

and<00:02:37.090> then<00:02:37.380> I<00:02:38.380> use<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.800> smaller<00:02:39.190> size<00:02:39.520> to<00:02:40.060> do

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
and then I use the smaller size to do

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:53.220 
and then I use the smaller size to do
the<00:02:40.330> smaller<00:02:40.600> dog

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.800 

so<00:02:53.680> once<00:02:53.950> that's<00:02:54.220> dry<00:02:54.550> I'm<00:02:55.090> then<00:02:55.360> gonna<00:02:55.480> steal

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
so once that's dry I'm then gonna steal

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.920 
so once that's dry I'm then gonna steal
the<00:02:55.959> whole<00:02:56.110> thing<00:02:56.410> with<00:02:56.620> my<00:02:56.739> top
