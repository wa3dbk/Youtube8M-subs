as part of a larger whole but I think it

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.470 
as part of a larger whole but I think it
goes<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.220> show<00:04:11.250> very<00:04:11.700> clearly<00:04:12.000> that<00:04:12.210> without

what we traditionally think of as a game
we<00:04:16.470> can<00:04:16.650> wrestle<00:04:16.859> with<00:04:17.070> issues<00:04:17.190> essential<00:04:17.940> to
