00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
really took that to heart try to find

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.279 
really took that to heart try to find
solutions<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.789> make<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.239> better<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.690> make<00:00:49.170> the

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
a lot of research that went into making

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.230 
a lot of research that went into making
this<00:01:58.740> one<00:01:59.010> and<00:01:59.250> when<00:01:59.760> you<00:01:59.880> did<00:02:00.060> all<00:02:00.150> the

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
this one and when you did all the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.930 
this one and when you did all the
research<00:02:00.330> did<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.930> think<00:02:01.320> we<00:02:02.310> need<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.610> maybe

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
research did you think we need to maybe

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.910 
research did you think we need to maybe
take<00:02:03.150> a<00:02:03.210> bit<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.540> creative<00:02:03.870> license<00:02:04.470> with<00:02:04.710> your

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
take a bit of creative license with your

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.940 
take a bit of creative license with your
rendition<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.550> London<00:02:05.910> at<00:02:06.030> all<00:02:06.470> we<00:02:07.470> obviously

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
rendition of London at all we obviously

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.029 
rendition of London at all we obviously
the<00:02:08.450> first<00:02:09.450> I'm<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.840> first<00:02:10.470> person<00:02:10.740> that

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
the first I'm the first person that

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.830 
the first I'm the first person that
comes<00:02:11.370> after<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.760> project<00:02:11.940> second<00:02:12.450> person<00:02:12.720> is

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
comes after the project second person is

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.380 
comes after the project second person is
the<00:02:12.959> historian<00:02:13.440> so<00:02:14.010> it's<00:02:14.430> really<00:02:14.820> important

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
the historian so it's really important

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.960 
the historian so it's really important
for<00:02:15.420> us<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:15.810> build<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.470> London<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:17.610> feels

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
for us to build a London that feels

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.479 
for us to build a London that feels
authentic<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:19.020> credible<00:02:19.160> for<00:02:20.160> especially

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
authentic and credible for especially

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.610 
authentic and credible for especially
for<00:02:20.790> people<00:02:20.940> who<00:02:21.120> are<00:02:21.660> from<00:02:22.020> London<00:02:22.350> so<00:02:22.500> that

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
for people who are from London so that

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.080 
for people who are from London so that
they<00:02:22.709> feel<00:02:22.890> it's<00:02:23.340> important<00:02:23.730> for<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:23.910> team

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
they feel it's important for the team

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.729 
they feel it's important for the team
that<00:02:24.300> people<00:02:24.780> from<00:02:24.900> London<00:02:25.170> feel<00:02:25.350> proud<00:02:25.709> of

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
that people from London feel proud of

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.979 
that people from London feel proud of
the<00:02:26.100> game<00:02:26.310> that<00:02:26.760> we<00:02:27.000> are<00:02:27.209> building<00:02:27.510> we

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
the game that we are building we

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.510 
the game that we are building we
personally<00:02:28.380> take<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:28.830> lot<00:02:29.010> of<00:02:29.040> pride<00:02:29.340> in<00:02:29.370> that

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
personally take a lot of pride in that

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.520 
personally take a lot of pride in that
so<00:02:29.910> we<00:02:30.330> work<00:02:30.480> with<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.690> storage<00:02:31.080> historians

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
so we work with the storage historians

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.920 
so we work with the storage historians
from<00:02:31.620> London<00:02:32.100> as<00:02:32.430> well<00:02:32.730> well<00:02:33.239> world-renowned

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
from London as well well world-renowned

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.920 
from London as well well world-renowned
historians<00:02:34.620> in<00:02:34.770> fact<00:02:35.030> that<00:02:36.030> are<00:02:36.180> experts<00:02:36.780> on

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
historians in fact that are experts on

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.190 
historians in fact that are experts on
the<00:02:37.290> Victorian<00:02:37.950> times<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:39.480> course<00:02:39.780> we<00:02:39.989> take

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
the Victorian times of course we take

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.770 
the Victorian times of course we take
some<00:02:40.410> liberties<00:02:40.940> but<00:02:41.940> we<00:02:42.090> really<00:02:42.390> choose<00:02:42.630> that

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
some liberties but we really choose that

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.720 
some liberties but we really choose that
very<00:02:43.020> carefully<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.590> make<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:44.220> keep<00:02:44.459> the

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
very carefully to make to keep the

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.670 
very carefully to make to keep the
authenticity<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.510> experience<00:02:45.989> but<00:02:46.500> for

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
authenticity of the experience but for

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.680 
authenticity of the experience but for
example<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.160> one<00:02:47.370> day<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.790> train<00:02:48.000> wagons<00:02:48.150> are

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
example the one day the train wagons are

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.740 
example the one day the train wagons are
wider<00:02:49.110> than<00:02:49.760> what<00:02:50.760> they<00:02:50.880> were<00:02:50.940> at<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.570> time

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
wider than what they were at the time

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.270 
wider than what they were at the time
because<00:02:52.019> otherwise<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.709> would<00:02:52.830> just<00:02:52.920> not<00:02:53.250> be

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
because otherwise it would just not be

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.520 
because otherwise it would just not be
fun<00:02:53.700> in<00:02:53.880> terms<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.360> gameplay<00:02:54.630> so<00:02:55.019> that's<00:02:55.410> an

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
fun in terms of gameplay so that's an

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.670 
fun in terms of gameplay so that's an
example<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.340> liberties<00:02:56.760> that<00:02:56.790> we<00:02:57.299> take<00:02:57.680> in

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
example of the liberties that we take in

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.289 
example of the liberties that we take in
terms<00:02:58.890> of<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.070> layout<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.640> city<00:02:59.820> itself

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
terms of the layout of the city itself

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.390 
terms of the layout of the city itself
have<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.630> kind<00:03:00.840> of<00:03:00.930> put<00:03:01.500> landmarks<00:03:02.100> kind<00:03:02.340> of

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
have you kind of put landmarks kind of

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.280 
have you kind of put landmarks kind of
closer<00:03:02.670> so<00:03:03.090> they're<00:03:03.239> all<00:03:03.420> in<00:03:03.600> one<00:03:03.780> kind<00:03:04.110> of<00:03:04.170> bad

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
closer so they're all in one kind of bad

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.920 
closer so they're all in one kind of bad
yeah<00:03:04.500> so<00:03:04.709> we<00:03:05.010> try<00:03:05.450> obviously<00:03:06.450> London<00:03:06.810> is<00:03:06.900> a

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
yeah so we try obviously London is a

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.740 
yeah so we try obviously London is a
city<00:03:07.049> with<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.769> gazillion<00:03:08.730> landmarks<00:03:09.570> it's

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
city with a gazillion landmarks it's

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.470 
city with a gazillion landmarks it's
just<00:03:09.930> incredible<00:03:10.470> out<00:03:10.650> rich<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.370> city<00:03:11.640> is<00:03:11.910> so

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
just incredible out rich the city is so

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.240 
just incredible out rich the city is so
we<00:03:12.570> can't<00:03:12.810> represent<00:03:13.049> unfortunately<00:03:14.010> all<00:03:14.190> of

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
we can't represent unfortunately all of

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.780 
we can't represent unfortunately all of
them<00:03:14.640> and<00:03:14.820> obviously<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.900> city<00:03:16.140> is<00:03:16.290> scaled<00:03:16.790> as

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
them and obviously the city is scaled as

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.750 
them and obviously the city is scaled as
well<00:03:18.180> so<00:03:18.810> what<00:03:19.560> we<00:03:19.680> try<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:20.010> keep<00:03:20.370> when<00:03:20.610> we're

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
well so what we try to keep when we're

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.180 
well so what we try to keep when we're
focusing<00:03:21.209> on<00:03:21.269> is<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:21.900> position<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:22.650> landmarks

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
focusing on is the position of landmarks

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.240 
focusing on is the position of landmarks
with<00:03:23.670> respect<00:03:23.850> to<00:03:24.330> one<00:03:24.510> another<00:03:25.230> and

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
with respect to one another and

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.040 
with respect to one another and
in<00:03:26.460> case<00:03:26.730> of<00:03:26.760> London<00:03:27.270> every<00:03:27.540> city<00:03:27.870> has<00:03:27.990> a

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
in case of London every city has a

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.080 
in case of London every city has a
different<00:03:28.620> recipe<00:03:28.830> that<00:03:29.190> we<00:03:29.310> need<00:03:29.460> to<00:03:29.490> find<00:03:29.880> to

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
different recipe that we need to find to

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.820 
different recipe that we need to find to
make<00:03:30.210> it<00:03:30.360> feel<00:03:30.570> at<00:03:30.660> antic<00:03:31.050> and<00:03:31.260> for<00:03:31.590> us<00:03:31.650> it's

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
make it feel at antic and for us it's

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.700 
make it feel at antic and for us it's
the<00:03:31.950> hems<00:03:32.220> as<00:03:32.490> well<00:03:33.240> the<00:03:33.750> Thames<00:03:34.020> needs<00:03:34.380> it's

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
the hems as well the Thames needs it's

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.640 
the hems as well the Thames needs it's
such<00:03:35.100> an<00:03:35.340> important<00:03:36.000> part<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.990> city<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.530> me

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
such an important part of the city to me

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.080 
such an important part of the city to me
it's<00:03:37.800> a<00:03:37.890> part<00:03:38.100> that<00:03:38.190> distinguishes<00:03:38.910> it<00:03:39.060> from

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
it's a part that distinguishes it from

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.510 
it's a part that distinguishes it from
all<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.960> other<00:03:40.080> cities<00:03:40.470> in<00:03:40.740> the<00:03:41.040> world<00:03:41.190> its

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
all the other cities in the world its
