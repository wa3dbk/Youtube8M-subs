00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 in the double final for the third year 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.299
 in short, if you were happy 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.000
 keep happy but we certainly are 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.969
 we are very happy we didn't know that 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.309
 today it is a very difficult game 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.650
 we still played a big one 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.240
 so we are very happy 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:27.869
 now we will give the maximum as always for the 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:31.830
 final what you expect the one up to 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.530
 then we expect nothing we try to 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.800
 how to always be aggressive like 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.070
 has done throughout the tournament and and try 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.370
 to win then you will see we try first 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.579
 what compared to a very strong couple 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.489
 but makarova vesnina in short, like 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.770
 accomplice a very very hard couple 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.960
 we lost both istanbul and final 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:00.600
 in paris this year so it will be one 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.399
 difficult game we will have to play more or 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.710
 the field is less aggressive today 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.130
 it's very fast so that first takes 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.710
 the network has a much better chance of doing the 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.409
 point then evenings 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.119
 a match definitely set up 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.430
 on aggression and I was last year 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.070
 It exceeds won here if I'm not mistaken you 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.550
 have they are striving continues 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.979
 it seems to me to be done last year though 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.409
 a strong pair, however, the last two 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:31.750
 we have lost ourselves sometimes 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.750
 who are the revenge 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.799
 in the difficult quarters they were one 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:43.549
 po also a turn one click after the 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.619
 game better and today are short and 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.619
 anyway to get ahead a tournament 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.320
 one will always have difficult situations in the 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.390
 sense that you can't always have everything 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.490
 therefore the fact of having been easy 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.979
 good at struggling to stay there even one 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.490
 game that maybe was almost lost 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:05.020
 life a little more there is still gives you charge 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.020
 and want to do well
