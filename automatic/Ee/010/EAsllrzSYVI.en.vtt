00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:13.139 
become kind of a joke because I'm always

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:15.169 
become kind of a joke because I'm always
expected<00:01:13.889> this<00:01:13.979> but<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.189> say<00:01:14.399> that<00:01:14.549> every<00:01:14.969> time

00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:15.179 
expected this but I say that every time

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:17.300 
expected this but I say that every time
because<00:01:15.509> my<00:01:15.810> videos<00:01:16.139> are<00:01:16.170> going<00:01:16.469> to<00:01:16.529> fly<00:01:17.039> away

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
because my videos are going to fly away

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.489 
because my videos are going to fly away
and<00:01:17.340> go<00:01:17.670> elsewhere<00:01:18.209> from<00:01:18.869> where<00:01:19.079> I<00:01:19.109> initially

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:19.499 
and go elsewhere from where I initially

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:21.709 
and go elsewhere from where I initially
put<00:01:19.889> them<00:01:20.069> like<00:01:20.189> my<00:01:20.399> video<00:01:20.670> blog<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.450> that's<00:01:21.599> a

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:21.719 
put them like my video blog so that's a

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:23.419 
put them like my video blog so that's a
standard<00:01:21.959> thing<00:01:22.319> that<00:01:22.499> I<00:01:22.529> always<00:01:22.619> do<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.219> say

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:23.429 
standard thing that I always do is say

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:25.999 
standard thing that I always do is say
that<00:01:23.670> all<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.359> time<00:01:24.599> so<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.409> would<00:01:25.799> say<00:01:25.979> a

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
that all the time so I would say a

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.769 
that all the time so I would say a
mistake<00:01:26.429> might<00:01:26.729> be<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.119> have<00:01:27.240> like<00:01:27.450> 20

00:01:27.769 --> 00:01:27.779 
mistake might be to have like 20

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:30.139 
mistake might be to have like 20
different<00:01:27.899> names<00:01:28.319> and<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:29.249> good<00:01:29.669> idea<00:01:29.969> would<00:01:30.119> be

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
different names and a good idea would be

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.289 
different names and a good idea would be
to<00:01:30.799> have<00:01:31.799> one<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.399> you<00:01:32.520> use<00:01:32.549> all<00:01:32.999> the<00:01:33.029> time

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
to have one that you use all the time

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.539 
to have one that you use all the time
everywhere<00:01:33.889> so<00:01:34.889> when<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.099> click<00:01:35.219> the<00:01:35.399> video

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
big production I had another client

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.280 
big production I had another client
where<00:04:13.000> I<00:04:13.030> did<00:04:13.269> interviews<00:04:13.750> and<00:04:13.900> I<00:04:13.930> use<00:04:14.079> that

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
where I did interviews and I use that

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.930 
where I did interviews and I use that
kind<00:04:14.709> of<00:04:14.859> thing<00:04:15.220> people<00:04:15.850> were<00:04:15.970> so<00:04:16.299> nervous

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
kind of thing people were so nervous

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.509 
kind of thing people were so nervous
like<00:04:18.940> I<00:04:19.060> think<00:04:19.389> they<00:04:19.510> were<00:04:19.600> beside<00:04:19.930> themselves

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
like I think they were beside themselves

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.880 
like I think they were beside themselves
they<00:04:21.519> lost<00:04:21.789> sleep<00:04:22.090> they<00:04:22.360> were<00:04:22.479> like<00:04:22.890> about

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
they lost sleep they were like about

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.950 
they lost sleep they were like about
being<00:04:24.070> on<00:04:24.250> camera<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:24.909> so<00:04:25.300> then<00:04:25.450> I<00:04:25.570> said<00:04:25.900> well

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
being on camera and so then I said well

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.480 
being on camera and so then I said well
why<00:04:26.140> don't<00:04:26.260> we<00:04:26.320> try<00:04:26.470> one<00:04:26.710> of<00:04:26.740> these<00:04:26.890> one<00:04:27.220> time

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
why don't we try one of these one time

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.810 
why don't we try one of these one time
and

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
and

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.610 
and
just<00:04:27.970> you<00:04:28.600> know<00:04:28.690> put<00:04:28.720> on<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.050> table<00:04:29.230> and<00:04:29.500> then

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
just you know put on the table and then

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.150 
just you know put on the table and then
do<00:04:29.800> it<00:04:29.980> and<00:04:30.280> it<00:04:31.150> is<00:04:31.840> a<00:04:31.870> big<00:04:32.110> difference<00:04:32.320> so<00:04:32.950> this

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
do it and it is a big difference so this

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.060 
do it and it is a big difference so this
is<00:04:33.340> really<00:04:33.550> good<00:04:33.880> for<00:04:34.180> making<00:04:35.080> people<00:04:35.380> you

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
is really good for making people you

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.100 
is really good for making people you
know<00:04:36.190> if<00:04:36.430> they're<00:04:36.730> afraid<00:04:36.970> of<00:04:37.270> the<00:04:37.360> camera<00:04:37.780> you

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
know if they're afraid of the camera you

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.630 
know if they're afraid of the camera you
just<00:04:38.320> set<00:04:38.560> this<00:04:38.680> up<00:04:38.830> and<00:04:39.010> turn<00:04:39.160> it<00:04:39.280> on<00:04:39.430> and<00:04:39.580> then

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
just set this up and turn it on and then

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.670 
just set this up and turn it on and then
like<00:04:39.940> you<00:04:40.180> would<00:04:40.420> be<00:04:40.570> their<00:04:40.750> focus<00:04:41.170> and<00:04:41.380> forget

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
like you would be their focus and forget

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.980 
like you would be their focus and forget
that<00:04:41.860> that's<00:04:42.010> here<00:04:42.460> this<00:04:43.180> is<00:04:43.360> an<00:04:43.480> example<00:04:43.780> of

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
that that's here this is an example of

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.370 
that that's here this is an example of
me<00:04:44.200> shooting<00:04:45.600> where<00:04:46.600> i<00:04:46.660> have<00:04:46.810> i<00:04:46.960> have<00:04:46.990> three

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380
