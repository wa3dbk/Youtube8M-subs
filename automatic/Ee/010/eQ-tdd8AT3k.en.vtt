00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.750
 the last product that what though of 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.320

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:27.530
 baking soda and cornstarch 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:34.140
 they go in to absorb sweat we say 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:35.700
 while the melaleuca oil goes to give to 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.250
 scent, in short, to combat odors 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:42.050
