00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
you're loosening it it'll get lower and

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.100 
you're loosening it it'll get lower and
lower<00:01:47.220> until<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.820> strings<00:01:48.180> basically<00:01:48.930> just

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
lower until the strings basically just

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.260 
lower until the strings basically just
rattling<00:01:49.740> against<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.340> fret<00:01:52.850> so<00:01:53.850> again<00:01:54.119> I'm

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
rattling against the fret so again I'm

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:10.870 
rattling against the fret so again I'm
gonna<00:01:54.450> I'm<00:01:54.869> gonna<00:01:54.960> get<00:01:55.170> these<00:01:55.290> really<00:01:55.920> loose

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.440
