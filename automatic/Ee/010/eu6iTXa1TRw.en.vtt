00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.230 

so<00:00:00.390> in<00:00:00.539> 701<00:00:00.870> there's<00:00:01.290> a<00:00:01.350> great<00:00:01.560> little<00:00:02.240> feature

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
so in 701 there's a great little feature

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.400 
so in 701 there's a great little feature
that's<00:00:03.540> kind<00:00:03.720> of<00:00:03.780> hidden<00:00:03.899> under<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.230> radar

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
that's kind of hidden under the radar

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.460 
that's kind of hidden under the radar
called<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:04.799> variation<00:00:05.279> texture<00:00:05.700> and<00:00:06.470> its

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
called the variation texture and its

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.600 
called the variation texture and its
really<00:00:07.770> powerful<00:00:07.919> let<00:00:08.250> me<00:00:08.309> just<00:00:08.490> show<00:00:08.580> you

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
really powerful let me just show you

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.400 
really powerful let me just show you
really<00:00:08.820> quickly<00:00:09.120> if<00:00:09.420> I<00:00:09.660> have<00:00:10.110> you<00:00:10.170> here<00:00:10.320> I<00:00:10.349> just

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
really quickly if I have you here I just

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.400 
really quickly if I have you here I just
have<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.679> cube<00:00:10.980> right<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.550> so<00:00:12.300> if<00:00:12.420> i<00:00:12.570> duplicate

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
have a cube right and so if i duplicate

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.269 
have a cube right and so if i duplicate
and<00:00:13.830> do<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:15.139> scatter<00:00:16.139> clone<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.859> get<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.100> bunch

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
and do a scatter clone and get a bunch

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.730 
and do a scatter clone and get a bunch
of<00:00:17.369> cubes<00:00:17.670> in<00:00:17.820> here<00:00:17.850> maybe<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.359> little<00:00:18.740> more

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
of cubes in here maybe a little more

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.120 
of cubes in here maybe a little more
than<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:21.109> let's<00:00:22.109> crank<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.410> up<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.010> got<00:00:23.100> a

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
than that let's crank it up so I got a

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.019 
than that let's crank it up so I got a
whole<00:00:23.220> bunch<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.430> different<00:00:23.519> cubes<00:00:23.850> in<00:00:24.000> here

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
whole bunch of different cubes in here

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.839 
whole bunch of different cubes in here
right<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.750> it's<00:00:25.560> just<00:00:25.769> one<00:00:25.980> mesh<00:00:26.189> item<00:00:26.580> but

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
right and it's just one mesh item but

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.300 
right and it's just one mesh item but
it's<00:00:27.150> always<00:00:27.390> different<00:00:27.830> polygons<00:00:28.830> Islands

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
it's always different polygons Islands

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.769 
it's always different polygons Islands
you<00:00:29.429> might<00:00:29.580> want<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.760> call<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.029> m<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.359> it's<00:00:30.720> a

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
you might want to call it m so it's a

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.870 
you might want to call it m so it's a
little<00:00:30.869> different<00:00:31.080> polygons<00:00:31.700> Islands<00:00:32.700> within

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
little different polygons Islands within

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.000 
little different polygons Islands within
this<00:00:33.120> one<00:00:33.770> one<00:00:34.770> mesh<00:00:35.309> item<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.910> if<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.870> just

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
this one one mesh item and if I just

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.069 
this one one mesh item and if I just
grab<00:00:38.010> these<00:00:38.190> guys<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.670> go<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.149> material

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
grab these guys and go to a material

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.479 
grab these guys and go to a material
called<00:00:40.230> cube<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:41.040> I'm<00:00:41.100> going<00:00:41.309> here<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
called cube and I'm going here the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.100 
called cube and I'm going here the
render<00:00:41.700> tab<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.770> in<00:00:43.770> my<00:00:44.750> shader<00:00:45.750> tree<00:00:45.930> I've

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
render tab and in my shader tree I've

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.770 
render tab and in my shader tree I've
got<00:00:46.260> my<00:00:46.350> cube<00:00:46.620> material<00:00:47.010> right<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.489> if<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.420> add

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
got my cube material right and if I add

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.750 
got my cube material right and if I add
a<00:00:48.809> layer<00:00:49.320> under<00:00:49.890> processing<00:00:50.399> there's

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
a layer under processing there's

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.850 
a layer under processing there's
something<00:00:51.000> called<00:00:51.180> variation<00:00:52.020> texture<00:00:52.440> and

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
something called variation texture and

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.819 
something called variation texture and
you<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:54.000> set<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.539> variation<00:00:55.260> source<00:00:55.500> to

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
you can set that variation source to

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.880 
you can set that variation source to
particle<00:00:56.430> texture<00:00:57.000> particle<00:00:57.420> which<00:00:57.629> is

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
particle texture particle which is

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.319 
particle texture particle which is
texture<00:00:58.890> particles<00:00:59.250> are<00:00:59.370> like<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.760> little

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
texture particles are like the little

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.549 
texture particles are like the little
particles<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.780> use<00:01:01.020> for<00:01:01.260> texture

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
particles you use for texture

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.840 
particles you use for texture
replicators<00:01:02.100> if<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.399> use<00:01:02.520> texture

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
replicators if you use texture

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.759 
replicators if you use texture
replicators<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:04.049> can<00:01:04.199> use<00:01:04.320> those<00:01:04.500> as<00:01:04.710> a

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
replicators you can use those as a

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.230 
replicators you can use those as a
source<00:01:05.010> but<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.369> can<00:01:05.489> also<00:01:05.610> use<00:01:05.820> items<00:01:06.119> or

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
source but you can also use items or

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.330 
source but you can also use items or
mesh<00:01:06.360> parts<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.020> we've<00:01:07.710> got<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> mesh<00:01:08.040> part

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
mesh parts and so we've got a mesh part

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.370 
mesh parts and so we've got a mesh part
and<00:01:08.610> under<00:01:09.030> color<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.540> start<00:01:09.750> middle<00:01:09.900> clicking

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
and under color to start middle clicking

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.300 
and under color to start middle clicking
some<00:01:10.820> keyframes<00:01:11.820> there<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:13.010> add<00:01:14.010> some

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
some keyframes there I can add some

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.350 
some keyframes there I can add some
colors<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.850> you'll<00:01:14.970> notice<00:01:15.119> what's

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
colors and you'll notice what's

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.289 
colors and you'll notice what's
happening<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:16.259> just<00:01:17.119> bring<00:01:18.119> up<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
happening is we just bring up the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.080 
happening is we just bring up the
gradient<00:01:18.540> here<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.259> it's<00:01:19.860> Moto's<00:01:20.729> looking

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
gradient here is it's Moto's looking

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.940 
gradient here is it's Moto's looking
around<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:22.020> it's<00:01:22.140> seen<00:01:22.320> all<00:01:22.439> these<00:01:22.530> polygons

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
around and it's seen all these polygons

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.510 
around and it's seen all these polygons
I<00:01:23.130> know

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
I know

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.399 
I know
Islands<00:01:23.939> here<00:01:24.240> these<00:01:24.390> cubes<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.259> it's

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
Islands here these cubes and it's

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.480 
Islands here these cubes and it's
assigning<00:01:26.840> value<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.020> those<00:01:28.170> it's<00:01:28.650> using<00:01:29.100> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
assigning value to those it's using the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.399 
assigning value to those it's using the
variation<00:01:30.090> texture<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.810> will<00:01:30.990> assign<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.170> color

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
variation texture it will assign a color

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.100 
variation texture it will assign a color
to<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.770> value<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.400> I've<00:01:32.549> got<00:01:32.960> even<00:01:33.960> though

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
to that value so I've got even though

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.880 
to that value so I've got even though
you<00:01:34.799> know<00:01:34.920> these<00:01:35.040> are<00:01:35.189> all<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.520> same<00:01:36.890> whoops

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
you know these are all the same whoops

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.590 
you know these are all the same whoops
even<00:01:38.220> though<00:01:38.310> these<00:01:38.430> are<00:01:38.579> all<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.790> same<00:01:39.030> in

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
even though these are all the same in

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.420 
even though these are all the same in
the<00:01:39.720> same<00:01:39.869> texture<00:01:40.229> layer<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.680> can<00:01:41.070> really

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
the same texture layer I can really

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.840 
the same texture layer I can really
easily<00:01:41.670> randomize<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:43.250> colors<00:01:44.250> there<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.490> I

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
easily randomize the colors there and I

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.969 
easily randomize the colors there and I
can<00:01:44.970> also<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.600> know<00:01:45.689> do<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> stepped<00:01:46.200> value<00:01:46.710> on

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
can also you know do a stepped value on

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.980 
can also you know do a stepped value on
the<00:01:47.100> graph<00:01:47.310> if<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:48.060> want<00:01:48.270> them<00:01:48.360> just<00:01:48.630> to

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
the graph if you just want them just to

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.560 
the graph if you just want them just to
get<00:01:49.409> these<00:01:49.530> cars<00:01:49.799> here<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.159> can<00:01:50.490> interpolate<00:01:51.360> in

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
get these cars here I can interpolate in

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.850 
get these cars here I can interpolate in
between<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.079> we'll<00:01:52.200> get<00:01:52.380> all<00:01:52.530> these<00:01:52.680> little

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
between and we'll get all these little

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.649 
between and we'll get all these little
in<00:01:53.040> between<00:01:53.130> colors<00:01:53.610> on<00:01:53.759> these<00:01:53.880> guys<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.600> you

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
in between colors on these guys so you

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.240 
in between colors on these guys so you
can<00:01:54.990> kind<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.229> see<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.530> light<00:01:55.619> bulbs<00:01:56.070> going

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
can kind of see the light bulbs going

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.160 
can kind of see the light bulbs going
off<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.549> people's<00:01:56.759> heads<00:01:56.909> now<00:01:57.119> because<00:01:57.570> you

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
off of people's heads now because you

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.359 
off of people's heads now because you
can<00:01:58.320> use<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.500> for<00:01:58.890> leaves<00:01:59.100> on<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.310> tree

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
can use that for leaves on a tree

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.399 
can use that for leaves on a tree
because<00:01:59.880> each<00:02:00.119> leaf<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.600> texture<00:02:00.990> Island<00:02:01.320> or

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
because each leaf is a texture Island or

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.600 
because each leaf is a texture Island or
if<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.710> little<00:02:01.860> bunch<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.070> rocks<00:02:02.280> or

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
if you have a little bunch of rocks or

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.069 
if you have a little bunch of rocks or
something<00:02:02.939> in<00:02:03.290> one<00:02:04.290> way<00:02:04.500> or<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.890> can<00:02:05.070> use<00:02:06.079> the

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
something in one way or you can use the

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.479 
something in one way or you can use the
variation<00:02:07.350> texture<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.950> apply<00:02:08.160> different

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
variation texture to apply different

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.910 
variation texture to apply different
colors<00:02:08.940> or<00:02:09.239> diffuse<00:02:09.780> values<00:02:10.200> or<00:02:10.379> whatever<00:02:10.560> to

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
colors or diffuse values or whatever to

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.510 
colors or diffuse values or whatever to
those<00:02:11.039> rocks

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
those rocks

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.120 
those rocks
so<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:12.870> worked<00:02:13.050> with<00:02:13.140> items<00:02:13.470> too<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:13.920> can

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
so and it worked with items too so I can

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.840 
so and it worked with items too so I can
go<00:02:14.310> back<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.880> let's<00:02:15.840> say<00:02:15.990> we<00:02:16.770> just<00:02:16.800> keep<00:02:17.640> that

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
go back and let's say we just keep that

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.400 
go back and let's say we just keep that
and<00:02:18.150> we<00:02:18.210> just<00:02:18.390> invert<00:02:18.630> then<00:02:18.810> kill<00:02:19.140> everything

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
and we just invert then kill everything

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.090 
and we just invert then kill everything
and<00:02:19.770> I<00:02:20.070> just<00:02:20.520> have<00:02:20.640> this<00:02:20.730> one<00:02:20.940> item<00:02:21.240> here<00:02:22.100> she

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
and I just have this one item here she

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.210 
and I just have this one item here she
press<00:02:23.340> f2<00:02:23.760> you'll<00:02:23.940> get<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.210> modeling<00:02:24.570> tab<00:02:25.220> so

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
press f2 you'll get the modeling tab so

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.420 
press f2 you'll get the modeling tab so
if<00:02:26.460> I<00:02:26.720> just<00:02:27.720> center<00:02:27.930> that<00:02:28.080> guy<00:02:28.230> if<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.890> am<00:02:29.310> an

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
if I just center that guy if I am an

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.620 
if I just center that guy if I am an
item<00:02:29.760> mode<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.390> do

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
item mode and I do

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.290 
item mode and I do
the<00:02:31.640> duplicate<00:02:32.640> do<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.560> scatter<00:02:34.560> clone<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.300> now

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
the duplicate do a scatter clone and now

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.520 
the duplicate do a scatter clone and now
I'm<00:02:36.450> doing<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:36.720> with<00:02:36.780> item<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:37.290> have<00:02:37.380> a<00:02:37.410> whole

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
I'm doing it with item so I have a whole

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.870 
I'm doing it with item so I have a whole
bunch<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.680> different<00:02:37.800> items<00:02:38.190> here<00:02:38.250> right<00:02:38.580> I

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
bunch of different items here right I

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.570 
bunch of different items here right I
just<00:02:39.360> do<00:02:40.110> more<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:41.240> I<00:02:42.240> can<00:02:42.450> go<00:02:42.690> in<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.580> the

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
just do more and I can go in and the

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.910 
just do more and I can go in and the
always<00:02:44.940> items<00:02:45.300> still<00:02:45.510> have<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.810> same<00:02:46.020> you

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
always items still have the same you

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.130 
always items still have the same you
know<00:02:46.950> they<00:02:47.100> carried<00:02:47.730> that<00:02:48.470> texture<00:02:51.140> material

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
know they carried that texture material

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.990 
know they carried that texture material
tagged<00:02:52.620> with<00:02:52.860> it<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.340> saw<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.700> cube

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
tagged with it so that I saw the cube

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.880 
tagged with it so that I saw the cube
material<00:02:54.330> tagged<00:02:54.480> if<00:02:55.080> I<00:02:55.230> took<00:02:55.440> my<00:02:55.590> variation

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
material tagged if I took my variation

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.500 
material tagged if I took my variation
texture<00:02:56.400> here<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:56.910> switch<00:02:57.150> that<00:02:57.270> over<00:02:57.390> an

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
texture here and switch that over an

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.720 
texture here and switch that over an
item<00:02:57.780> you'll<00:02:58.470> see<00:02:58.620> now<00:02:58.740> I've<00:02:58.920> got<00:02:59.490> this

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
item you'll see now I've got this

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.730 
item you'll see now I've got this
gradient<00:03:00.330> going<00:03:01.110> through<00:03:01.290> it's<00:03:01.410> getting<00:03:01.620> each

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
gradient going through it's getting each

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.980 
gradient going through it's getting each
item<00:03:02.100> value<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.240> it's<00:03:03.360> applying<00:03:03.630> a<00:03:03.690> color<00:03:03.840> to

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
item value and it's applying a color to

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.770 
item value and it's applying a color to
that<00:03:04.020> value<00:03:04.440> that<00:03:04.620> in<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:06.090> shader<00:03:06.300> trees<00:03:06.540> so

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
that value that in the shader trees so

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.330 
that value that in the shader trees so
you<00:03:07.020> can<00:03:07.290> use<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:07.470> with<00:03:07.590> items<00:03:07.890> so<00:03:08.070> go<00:03:08.160> what

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
you can use it with items so go what

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.620 
you can use it with items so go what
want<00:03:08.460> you<00:03:08.520> different<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:09.000> know<00:03:09.210> whatever

work<00:03:37.260> with<00:03:37.350> particles<00:03:37.800> so<00:03:38.100> if<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.340> again<00:03:38.940> let<00:03:39.060> me

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
work with particles so if I again let me

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.310 
work with particles so if I again let me
just<00:03:39.560> kill<00:03:40.560> all<00:03:40.710> these<00:03:40.830> guys<00:03:41.810> and<00:03:42.810> I<00:03:42.990> just<00:03:43.200> have

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
just kill all these guys and I just have

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.250 
just kill all these guys and I just have
my<00:03:43.470> original<00:03:44.300> cube<00:03:45.300> here<00:03:45.600> if<00:03:45.720> I<00:03:45.840> go<00:03:45.990> over<00:03:46.230> to

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
my original cube here if I go over to

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.680 
my original cube here if I go over to
set<00:03:47.100> up<00:03:47.250> and<00:03:47.460> just<00:03:48.210> do<00:03:48.330> a<00:03:48.360> real<00:03:48.480> quick

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
set up and just do a real quick

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.010 
set up and just do a real quick
particle<00:03:49.260> simulation<00:03:50.450> yeah<00:03:51.450> just<00:03:51.870> do<00:03:51.960> a

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
particle simulation yeah just do a

00:03:52.020 --> 00:04:00.110 
particle simulation yeah just do a
radial<00:03:52.830> emitter<00:03:53.070> and<00:03:58.520> this<00:03:59.520> a<00:03:59.580> little<00:03:59.730> bit<00:04:00.030> of

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
radial emitter and this a little bit of

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.530 
radial emitter and this a little bit of
baby<00:04:01.070> so<00:04:02.070> there's<00:04:02.250> my<00:04:02.340> radial<00:04:02.640> minute<00:04:02.910> ride<00:04:03.060> if

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
baby so there's my radial minute ride if

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.000 
baby so there's my radial minute ride if
I<00:04:03.660> just<00:04:03.900> do<00:04:04.560> a<00:04:04.790> simulation<00:04:06.530> it'll<00:04:07.530> pretty<00:04:07.950> much

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
I just do a simulation it'll pretty much

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.949 
I just do a simulation it'll pretty much
calculate<00:04:08.520> that<00:04:08.610> instantly<00:04:09.120> and<00:04:09.330> scrub

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
calculate that instantly and scrub

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.420 
calculate that instantly and scrub
through<00:04:10.140> there's<00:04:10.350> my<00:04:10.470> particle<00:04:10.860> simulation

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
through there's my particle simulation

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.010 
through there's my particle simulation
and<00:04:11.790> so<00:04:12.390> I<00:04:12.420> if<00:04:12.630> I<00:04:12.750> use<00:04:12.959> like<00:04:13.140> a<00:04:13.170> replicator<00:04:15.020> will

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.020 
and so I if I use like a replicator will

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.260 
and so I if I use like a replicator will
just<00:04:16.200> go<00:04:16.380> back<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:16.650> use<00:04:16.770> my<00:04:16.920> cube<00:04:17.220> again<00:04:17.489> for

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
just go back and use my cube again for

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.940 
just go back and use my cube again for
the<00:04:18.330> prototype<00:04:18.570> the<00:04:19.020> point<00:04:19.560> source<00:04:19.710> the

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
the prototype the point source the

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.500 
the prototype the point source the
particle<00:04:20.280> simulation<00:04:20.820> and<00:04:21.030> you<00:04:21.239> know<00:04:21.330> there's

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
particle simulation and you know there's

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.620 
particle simulation and you know there's
many<00:04:22.130> cubes<00:04:23.130> going<00:04:23.430> out<00:04:23.550> if<00:04:23.729> I<00:04:23.820> go<00:04:23.940> over<00:04:23.970> here<00:04:24.090> I

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
many cubes going out if I go over here I

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.170 
many cubes going out if I go over here I
can<00:04:25.350> change<00:04:25.710> you<00:04:26.280> know<00:04:26.400> what's<00:04:26.970> cool<00:04:27.150> is

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
can change you know what's cool is

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.080 
can change you know what's cool is
actually<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:29.250> variation<00:04:29.669> texture<00:04:29.910> will

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
actually the variation texture will

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.370 
actually the variation texture will
still<00:04:30.270> work<00:04:30.390> in<00:04:30.570> item<00:04:30.840> mode<00:04:30.990> even<00:04:31.140> with<00:04:31.320> a

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
still work in item mode even with a

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.080 
still work in item mode even with a
replicator<00:04:31.800> we<00:04:31.950> can<00:04:32.130> set<00:04:32.610> that<00:04:32.700> the<00:04:32.790> particle

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
replicator we can set that the particle

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.840 
replicator we can set that the particle
mode<00:04:33.210> as<00:04:33.360> well<00:04:33.510> and<00:04:33.840> get<00:04:34.650> each<00:04:35.280> particle<00:04:35.669> as

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
mode as well and get each particle as

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.820 
mode as well and get each particle as
its<00:04:36.030> own<00:04:36.120> ID<00:04:36.330> that's<00:04:36.720> passed<00:04:36.960> on<00:04:37.140> to<00:04:37.440> that<00:04:37.590> cube

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
its own ID that's passed on to that cube

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.290 
its own ID that's passed on to that cube
being<00:04:38.010> replicated<00:04:38.190> there<00:04:38.640> and<00:04:38.820> the<00:04:38.880> variation

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
being replicated there and the variation

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.969 
being replicated there and the variation
texture<00:04:39.630> gives<00:04:40.169> us<00:04:40.320> one<00:04:40.470> of<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:40.620> gradient

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
texture gives us one of the gradient

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.360 
texture gives us one of the gradient
colors<00:04:41.220> you<00:04:41.520> know<00:04:42.050> to<00:04:43.050> those<00:04:43.800> cubes<00:04:44.160> in<00:04:44.310> the

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
colors you know to those cubes in the

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.820 
colors you know to those cubes in the
particle<00:04:44.700> simulation<00:04:45.260> so<00:04:46.260> pretty<00:04:46.650> cool

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
particle simulation so pretty cool

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.090 
particle simulation so pretty cool
really<00:04:47.310> powerful<00:04:47.790> texture<00:04:48.210> sort<00:04:49.140> of<00:04:49.290> like<00:04:49.979> I

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
really powerful texture sort of like I

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
really powerful texture sort of like I
said<00:04:50.280> I<00:04:50.310> think<00:04:50.490> it<00:04:50.550> kind<00:04:50.729> of<00:04:50.760> flew<00:04:50.910> into<00:04:51.060> the

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
said I think it kind of flew into the

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.070 
said I think it kind of flew into the
radar<00:04:51.479> because<00:04:51.600> there's<00:04:51.780> so<00:04:51.840> many<00:04:51.930> other

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
radar because there's so many other

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.880 
radar because there's so many other
features<00:04:53.070> but<00:04:53.550> this<00:04:53.669> thing<00:04:53.850> is<00:04:53.970> great<00:04:54.150> so<00:04:54.890> you

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
features but this thing is great so you

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.080 
features but this thing is great so you
know<00:04:56.490> I<00:04:56.520> should<00:04:56.820> do<00:04:56.970> is<00:04:57.180> is<00:04:57.600> go<00:04:58.640> to<00:04:59.640> layout<00:04:59.820> and

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
know I should do is is go to layout and

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:06.070 
know I should do is is go to layout and
bring<00:05:00.300> in<00:05:00.419> that<00:05:00.570> tree<00:05:02.510> organic<00:05:03.740> plants

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
bring in that tree organic plants

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.909 
bring in that tree organic plants
they're<00:05:07.080> a<00:05:07.110> tree<00:05:09.229> trees<00:05:10.229> that's<00:05:10.560> what<00:05:10.650> I<00:05:10.680> want

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
they're a tree trees that's what I want

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:13.940 
they're a tree trees that's what I want
maybe<00:05:11.310> this<00:05:11.910> guy<00:05:12.060> so<00:05:12.900> here<00:05:13.140> I've<00:05:13.260> got<00:05:13.290> double

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
maybe this guy so here I've got double

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:21.230 
maybe this guy so here I've got double
behind<00:05:14.250> our<00:05:15.030> stuff<00:05:19.580> so<00:05:20.580> there's<00:05:20.760> my<00:05:20.910> tree<00:05:21.210> and

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
behind our stuff so there's my tree and

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.610 
behind our stuff so there's my tree and
all<00:05:21.600> my<00:05:21.720> leaves<00:05:21.990> but<00:05:22.530> again<00:05:22.860> these<00:05:23.070> leaves<00:05:23.340> are

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
all my leaves but again these leaves are

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.780 
all my leaves but again these leaves are
polygons<00:05:25.620> Islands<00:05:26.010> right<00:05:26.280> so<00:05:26.910> under<00:05:28.790> need

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
polygons Islands right so under need

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.719 
polygons Islands right so under need
that<00:05:29.970> need<00:05:30.150> wealth<00:05:30.360> parent<00:05:30.780> which<00:05:31.490> witness<00:05:32.490> is

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
that need wealth parent which witness is

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:34.520 
that need wealth parent which witness is
a<00:05:32.760> usually<00:05:33.390> power<00:05:33.600> of<00:05:33.720> the<00:05:33.780> shaker<00:05:33.990> trees<00:05:34.380> you

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
a usually power of the shaker trees you

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.490 
a usually power of the shaker trees you
just<00:05:34.770> drag<00:05:34.979> this<00:05:35.190> over<00:05:35.340> to<00:05:35.520> the<00:05:35.820> leaves<00:05:36.500> and

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
just drag this over to the leaves and

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.719 
just drag this over to the leaves and
then<00:05:38.039> I<00:05:38.070> set<00:05:38.460> this<00:05:38.760> to<00:05:39.470> my<00:05:40.470> fart<00:05:40.740> and<00:05:41.430> there's

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
then I set this to my fart and there's

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:43.820 
then I set this to my fart and there's
our<00:05:41.850> leaves<00:05:42.030> right<00:05:42.330> so<00:05:43.140> you<00:05:43.200> know<00:05:43.440> you<00:05:43.500> can<00:05:43.710> do

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
our leaves right so you know you can do

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.350 
our leaves right so you know you can do
something<00:05:44.190> you<00:05:44.250> can<00:05:44.280> blend<00:05:44.580> that<00:05:44.820> if<00:05:45.030> you<00:05:45.120> want

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
something you can blend that if you want

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.210 
something you can blend that if you want
with<00:05:45.600> the<00:05:45.690> leaf<00:05:45.840> color<00:05:46.110> I<00:05:46.229> can<00:05:46.530> you<00:05:47.100> know<00:05:47.190> I

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
with the leaf color I can you know I

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.570 
with the leaf color I can you know I
could<00:05:47.490> just<00:05:47.520> do<00:05:48.080> well<00:05:49.080> we<00:05:49.200> can<00:05:49.350> do<00:05:49.500> a<00:05:49.800> couple

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
could just do well we can do a couple
