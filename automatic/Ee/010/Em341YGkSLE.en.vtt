 evening 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.020
 sembre you simpson because the light is 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.210
 yellow so maybe a little better 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:32.320
 phantasm a little white rather than 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.570
 excuse the fossil season type anyway 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.900

 however it is true thanks to the term paper that 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.379
 I'm doing that occurred to me of 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.930
 make this video which I think a lot 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.449
 let's say cute that is at least in my opinion 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.039
 spherical yours is a video from 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.590
 aircraft to talk about some curiosity 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:10.270
 on the nails that is just doing 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.310
 search for the crisis I found 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.000
 that therefore are just curiosity a 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:20.320
 random on the history of reconstruction 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.939
 nail art of growth 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.580
 of the nails of the composition of the 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.680
 in other words, something pretty that maybe 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.780
 you know you don't even know if you are 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.759
 you already knew let me know what they were 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.530
 the ones you knew were bitter if you know 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.479
 new closing quoted even fears 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.689
 under a comment that we know the most 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.329
 the better I leave you at 20 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.159
 very short random curiosities 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.229
 hoping that 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.950
 he learned something new maybe 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:50.140
 may be of interest to how the 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.310
 nail reconstruction is there because indeed 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.020
 I didn't know they were born that way 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.450
 such as 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.880
 no no food I leave you at 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.840
 curiosity randon a kiss and to the next 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.570
 video chat 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.130
 I forgot I leave you in the info box and 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.850
 also the link of the facebook page of 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.950
 twitter 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.269
 if you like to follow precisely even in 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.950
 liga mari are more direct and youtube 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.780
 because anyway I will continue to make videos 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.879
 on youtube obviously I will try to do them 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.530
 more often now that the essay will end however 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.580
 facebook and twitter are more direct 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.129
 therefore practically from the day 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.599
 daily if you like waiting for you 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:28.099
 even there I leave you now really 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.099
 curiosity I send a kiss bye 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.200
 did you know that your fingernails 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.219
 they grow four times faster 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.219
 than that of the feet 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.599
 you seemed like nail growth 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.730
 and based on the power supplies you 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.730
 nails grow about 3 mm per month 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.250
 did you know that the function of 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.140
 in the mainly prehensile man that there is 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.450
 serves precisely for we need precisely 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.040
 professor small objects while 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.969
 animals the main function is that

 nails and help to make them grow 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.940
 because by massaging we stimulate 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.410
 blood circulation and therefore 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.410
 let's improve the population 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.099
 this 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.019
 from the first to the tenth year of life and after 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.049
 50 years the nails grow more 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.049

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.190
 did you know that during pregnancy at 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.190

 did you know that iron deficiency 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.730
 slows down nail growth 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.730
 makes it more fragile 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.360
 did you know that the specks that you 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.250

 absolutely lack of calcium but they are 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.940
 of small traumas 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.400
 Did you know that in ancient China color 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.840
 of the enamel indicated the social rank 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.360
 of belonging 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.040
 in fact the richest let's say not summer 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.560
 they used dark colors like red 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.360
 black while women of iron rank 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.070
 that they had to use tv colors in the 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.430
 in case they did not, they were punished 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.430
 with death 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.720

 the first cardboard file was born in 1910 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.020
 did you know that in the twenties the technique 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.240
 of in the most widespread art is called 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.949
 nails of paris and consisted of the 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.570
 paint the sides of July with a rose 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:04.570

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.650
 that many fluorescent flowers were in fashion 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:27.399
 and that in the 90s the colors returned 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:30.329
 clear in soft and elegance and the 

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:30.329

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.850
 leaves in 1954 in philadelphia e 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.120
 increased it was a dentist who broke 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:45.430
 a fingernail fumbling among the material 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.020
 which he used to rebuild teeth test 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.150
 rebuild long and noticing that 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.509
 it seemed natural that the pain 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.190
 he passed with determined days 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:56.440
 to experiment with this new technique 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:59.460
 making nail shapes then from line 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.460
 with reconstruction 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.990
 did you know the diffusion rates 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.580
 of the only phage to this word I must 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.389
 read that they are percentages I do n't 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:13.460

 and 5 percent of the elderly 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.470
 finally a very important thing that 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.290
 even though I already told you, you knew that 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:34.690

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:37.060
 debunk the everyone breathe what 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:39.340
 alive is not the nail plate then 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.740
 the nail but it is the initial part that the 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:45.040
 matrix she is the germinative part a 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:49.120
 the one that is born that grows that feeds 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:51.430
 and it is that point which is actually alive 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.620
 the nail bed is not cool is that 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.290
 that there is underneath that alive that gives precisely 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:59.410
 the color pink to the nail because there 

00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:03.040
 blood vessels pass 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:05.800

 he said however it was a nice way to 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.160
 ask him if you knew these curiosities 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:16.600
