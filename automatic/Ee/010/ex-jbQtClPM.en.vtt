00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
update it has been 11 days and we have

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.899 
update it has been 11 days and we have
more<00:01:44.750> more<00:01:45.020> people<00:01:45.229> this<00:01:46.190> is<00:01:46.370> just<00:01:46.550> one<00:01:46.700> box

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
more more people this is just one box

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.940 
more more people this is just one box
out<00:01:47.120> of<00:01:47.150> the<00:01:47.240> five<00:01:47.420> that<00:01:47.600> I<00:01:47.659> have<00:01:47.840> they<00:01:48.800> all

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
out of the five that I have they all

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.380 
out of the five that I have they all
look<00:01:49.130> pretty<00:01:49.160> much<00:01:49.490> like<00:01:49.550> this<00:01:49.970> this<00:01:50.150> one's

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
look pretty much like this this one's

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.700 
look pretty much like this this one's
probably<00:01:50.540> the<00:01:50.750> one<00:01:51.200> that's<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.500> most

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
probably the one that's the most

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.340 
probably the one that's the most
advanced<00:01:52.310> so<00:01:52.640> this<00:01:53.450> one<00:01:53.570> only<00:01:53.720> has<00:01:53.810> five<00:01:54.080> super

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
advanced so this one only has five super

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.090 
advanced so this one only has five super
forms<00:01:54.619> left<00:01:55.960> there<00:01:56.960> probably<00:01:57.560> bust<00:01:57.800> out<00:01:57.950> of

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
forms left there probably bust out of

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.690 
forms left there probably bust out of
there<00:01:58.190> today

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
there today

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.010 
there today

colony<00:02:26.510> I'm<00:02:27.500> gonna<00:02:27.650> opt<00:02:27.830> against<00:02:28.100> doing<00:02:28.340> that

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459

cool-looking<00:03:09.820> you<00:03:10.820> got<00:03:10.970> some<00:03:11.239> people<00:03:11.390> here<00:03:11.690> so

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
that they were really kind of creamy

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.400 
that they were really kind of creamy
still<00:03:13.519> looking<00:03:13.850> those<00:03:14.600> are<00:03:14.780> those<00:03:15.019> are<00:03:15.200> still

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
still looking those are those are still

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.539 
still looking those are those are still
got<00:03:15.650> a<00:03:15.680> ways<00:03:15.860> to<00:03:15.890> go<00:03:16.070> and<00:03:16.160> then<00:03:16.370> you<00:03:16.430> have

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
got a ways to go and then you have

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.090 
got a ways to go and then you have
others<00:03:16.910> that<00:03:17.690> kind<00:03:18.140> of<00:03:18.170> look<00:03:18.320> burnt<00:03:18.620> almost

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
others that kind of look burnt almost

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.860 
others that kind of look burnt almost
they<00:03:19.310> look<00:03:19.459> like<00:03:19.640> like<00:03:20.060> they're<00:03:20.239> dying<00:03:20.510> or

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
they look like like they're dying or

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.060 
they look like like they're dying or
something<00:03:21.170> like<00:03:21.230> that<00:03:21.290> they're<00:03:21.650> not<00:03:21.769> that's

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
something like that they're not that's

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.569 
something like that they're not that's
that's<00:03:22.489> part<00:03:22.640> of<00:03:22.730> their<00:03:22.850> metamorphosis<00:03:24.579> after

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
that's part of their metamorphosis after

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.190 
that's part of their metamorphosis after
they<00:03:25.670> turn<00:03:25.850> that<00:03:26.000> real<00:03:26.239> dark<00:03:26.660> kind<00:03:26.900> of<00:03:26.989> burnt

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
they turn that real dark kind of burnt

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.710 
they turn that real dark kind of burnt
color<00:03:27.440> they<00:03:28.130> pop<00:03:28.400> out<00:03:28.579> and<00:03:28.760> they<00:03:28.820> turn<00:03:29.030> into<00:03:29.120> to

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
color they pop out and they turn into to

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.090 
color they pop out and they turn into to
those<00:03:29.870> guys<00:03:30.079> right<00:03:30.350> there<00:03:30.380> and<00:03:30.709> then<00:03:30.829> I<00:03:30.920> guess

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
those guys right there and then I guess

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.979 
those guys right there and then I guess
from<00:03:31.220> there<00:03:31.459> they<00:03:32.060> pop<00:03:32.299> out<00:03:32.450> and<00:03:32.690> they<00:03:32.780> turn

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
from there they pop out and they turn

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.440 
from there they pop out and they turn
into<00:03:33.110> those<00:03:33.350> guys<00:03:33.530> right<00:03:33.739> there<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:35.090> then<00:03:35.329> I

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
into those guys right there and then I

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.479 
into those guys right there and then I
guess<00:03:35.600> to<00:03:35.750> get<00:03:35.870> them<00:03:36.079> I<00:03:36.380> have<00:03:36.890> seen<00:03:37.160> beetles

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
guess to get them I have seen beetles

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.580 
guess to get them I have seen beetles
before<00:03:37.880> they're<00:03:38.090> they're<00:03:38.299> much<00:03:38.540> like<00:03:38.959> darker

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
before they're they're much like darker

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.890 
before they're they're much like darker
they're<00:03:39.769> they're<00:03:39.950> really<00:03:40.340> jet<00:03:40.640> black<00:03:40.940> so<00:03:41.660> I'm

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
they're they're really jet black so I'm

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.360 
they're they're really jet black so I'm
gonna<00:03:42.230> leave<00:03:42.380> these<00:03:42.470> guys<00:03:42.680> in<00:03:42.920> here<00:03:42.950> and

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
gonna leave these guys in here and

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.949 
gonna leave these guys in here and
to<00:03:43.430> have<00:03:43.580> that<00:03:43.730> real<00:03:43.909> like<00:03:44.120> nice<00:03:44.390> dark<00:03:44.720> black

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
to have that real like nice dark black

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.839 
to have that real like nice dark black
color<00:03:45.290> I<00:03:45.530> don't<00:03:45.799> want<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.099> take<00:03:46.280> them<00:03:46.459> out<00:03:46.610> too

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
color I don't want to take them out too

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.570 
color I don't want to take them out too
soon<00:03:47.170> all<00:03:48.170> beetles<00:03:48.620> do<00:03:48.830> seem<00:03:49.099> to<00:03:49.250> be<00:03:49.340> eating

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
soon all beetles do seem to be eating

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.089 
soon all beetles do seem to be eating
they're<00:03:50.709> like<00:03:51.709> sheds<00:03:52.069> they're<00:03:52.459> pupae<00:03:52.819> sheds

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
they're like sheds they're pupae sheds

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.640 
they're like sheds they're pupae sheds
so<00:03:55.099> I<00:03:55.129> guess<00:03:55.400> that's<00:03:55.610> that's<00:03:56.000> normal<00:03:56.480> um<00:03:56.750> I'm

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
so I guess that's that's normal um I'm

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.160 
so I guess that's that's normal um I'm
going<00:03:57.799> to<00:03:57.860> keep<00:03:57.980> us<00:03:58.129> updated<00:03:58.310> well<00:03:59.060> as<00:03:59.840> soon<00:04:00.049> as

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
warm to turn the beetles so we're done

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.930 
warm to turn the beetles so we're done
with<00:04:21.530> those<00:04:21.620> old<00:04:21.829> boxes<00:04:21.979> and<00:04:22.400> now<00:04:22.490> what<00:04:22.789> we're

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
with those old boxes and now what we're

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.310 
with those old boxes and now what we're
working<00:04:23.090> with<00:04:23.270> here<00:04:23.389> this<00:04:23.660> is<00:04:23.780> a<00:04:23.810> three<00:04:23.900> drawer

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
working with here this is a three drawer

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.680 
working with here this is a three drawer
starlight<00:04:25.250> box<00:04:25.550> system<00:04:25.910> it's<00:04:26.090> it's<00:04:26.300> 12<00:04:26.600> inches

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
starlight box system it's it's 12 inches

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.290 
starlight box system it's it's 12 inches
by<00:04:26.990> 12<00:04:27.260> inches<00:04:27.350> it's<00:04:28.010> actually<00:04:28.340> like<00:04:28.490> 13<00:04:29.150> by<00:04:29.270> 13

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
by 12 inches it's actually like 13 by 13

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.330 
by 12 inches it's actually like 13 by 13
so<00:04:29.870> it's<00:04:30.410> a<00:04:30.500> little<00:04:30.620> bit<00:04:30.830> bigger<00:04:31.010> than<00:04:31.130> one

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
so it's a little bit bigger than one

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.760 
so it's a little bit bigger than one
square<00:04:31.639> foot<00:04:31.850> but<00:04:32.600> um<00:04:32.750> these<00:04:33.350> Dukes<00:04:33.560> three

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
square foot but um these Dukes three

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:34.990 
square foot but um these Dukes three
tours<00:04:34.010> were<00:04:34.190> great<00:04:34.430> the<00:04:34.550> way<00:04:34.669> I<00:04:34.699> have<00:04:34.880> my
