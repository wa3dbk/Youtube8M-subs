several years now I've actually helped
out<00:00:29.099> in<00:00:29.970> designing<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.869> rods<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.650> getting

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
out in designing the rods and getting

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.100 
out in designing the rods and getting
different<00:00:32.099> models<00:00:32.519> out<00:00:32.669> there<00:00:32.699> and<00:00:33.180> we've<00:00:33.870> got

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
different models out there and we've got

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.310 
different models out there and we've got
them<00:00:34.230> now<00:00:34.640> down<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.390> believe<00:00:36.629> eight<00:00:37.050> models

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
them now down to I believe eight models

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.689 
them now down to I believe eight models
that<00:00:37.590> we're<00:00:37.680> going<00:00:37.769> get<00:00:37.920> out<00:00:38.040> there<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.460> each

head rod and again it's gonna be a

head rod and again it's gonna be a
little<00:04:15.840> bit<00:04:15.990> stiffer<00:04:16.290> than<00:04:16.380> this<00:04:16.530> one<00:04:16.770> this<00:04:17.640> is

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
little bit stiffer than this one this is

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.690 
little bit stiffer than this one this is
the<00:04:17.820> medium<00:04:18.090> heavy<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.980> shaky<00:04:19.980> head<00:04:20.100> rod<00:04:20.310> is<00:04:20.610> a

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
heavy action but it's an extra extra

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.320 
heavy action but it's an extra extra
fast<00:04:22.950> taper<00:04:23.340> which<00:04:23.550> means<00:04:23.760> it's<00:04:23.970> going<00:04:24.060> to<00:04:24.150> be

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
fast taper which means it's going to be

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.540 
fast taper which means it's going to be
real<00:04:25.260> soft<00:04:25.560> in<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:25.830> tip<00:04:25.860> it<00:04:26.220> has<00:04:26.340> a<00:04:26.370> lot<00:04:26.520> of

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
real soft in the tip it has a lot of

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.010 
real soft in the tip it has a lot of
backbone<00:04:27.000> for<00:04:27.060> getting<00:04:27.420> better<00:04:27.600> hooks<00:04:27.810> that's

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
backbone for getting better hooks that's

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.620 
backbone for getting better hooks that's
on<00:04:28.140> your<00:04:28.230> shaky<00:04:28.530> head
