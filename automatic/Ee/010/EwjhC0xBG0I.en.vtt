00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.250 
good so they don't stick on the inside
that's<00:04:51.730> right<00:04:51.880> and<00:04:52.720> we<00:04:52.840> have<00:04:52.930> a<00:04:52.960> thermometer

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
that's right and we have a thermometer

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.410 
that's right and we have a thermometer
so<00:04:53.920> that<00:04:54.100> the<00:04:54.220> temperature<00:04:54.520> stays<00:04:54.940> the<00:04:55.180> same

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
so that the temperature stays the same

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:01.230 
so that the temperature stays the same
or<00:04:56.380> ok<00:04:57.280> we<00:04:57.520> put<00:04:57.700> the<00:04:57.730> cover<00:04:58.030> on<00:04:58.120> like<00:04:58.480> this<00:05:00.240> and

we hope that the warmth of spring comes

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.260 
we hope that the warmth of spring comes
quicker<00:06:43.620> and<00:06:43.950> quicker<00:06:44.130> so<00:06:44.640> that<00:06:44.790> we<00:06:44.910> can<00:06:45.090> get

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.270 
quicker and quicker so that we can get

going<00:06:45.450> on<00:06:45.780> the<00:06:45.960> yard<00:06:46.200> but<00:06:46.680> we<00:06:46.800> will<00:06:46.950> probably

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.190 
going on the yard but we will probably

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.310 
going on the yard but we will probably
plant<00:06:47.550> some<00:06:47.790> stuff<00:06:48.000> out<00:06:48.210> and<00:06:48.390> put<00:06:48.630> our<00:06:48.860> up<00:06:49.860> our

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:51.320

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.790 
plant some stuff out and put our up our
greenhouse<00:06:53.000> this<00:06:54.000> week<00:06:54.840> although<00:06:55.320> we<00:06:55.620> had<00:06:55.770> a

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 
greenhouse this week although we had a

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.640 
greenhouse this week although we had a
huge<00:06:56.130> windstorm<00:06:56.490> last<00:06:56.850> night<00:06:57.150> so<00:06:57.510> we've<00:06:58.410> been

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650 
huge windstorm last night so we've been

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.770 
huge windstorm last night so we've been
debating<00:06:58.950> on<00:06:59.370> putting<00:06:59.670> it<00:06:59.790> up<00:06:59.910> all<00:07:00.300> that

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:00.780 
debating on putting it up all that

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.200 
debating on putting it up all that
quickly<00:07:01.080> we've<00:07:01.800> had<00:07:01.980> the<00:07:02.220> bars<00:07:02.430> eyeballs<00:07:02.910> all

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.210 
quickly we've had the bars eyeballs all

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.360 
quickly we've had the bars eyeballs all
winter<00:07:03.570> but<00:07:03.930> never<00:07:04.440> put<00:07:04.650> the<00:07:04.770> plastic<00:07:04.980> on

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.370 
winter but never put the plastic on

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.370 
winter but never put the plastic on
because<00:07:06.180> we<00:07:06.300> get<00:07:06.390> a<00:07:06.450> lot<00:07:06.510> more<00:07:06.690> wind<00:07:07.020> here<00:07:07.230> now

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:07.380 
because we get a lot more wind here now

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.790 
because we get a lot more wind here now
than<00:07:07.740> they<00:07:07.890> used<00:07:07.920> to<00:07:08.540> so<00:07:09.540> hopefully<00:07:10.470> the<00:07:10.620> wind

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 
than they used to so hopefully the wind

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.380 
than they used to so hopefully the wind
will<00:07:10.920> stay<00:07:11.130> away<00:07:11.400> and<00:07:11.700> we'll<00:07:11.910> get<00:07:12.030> the<00:07:12.180> plastic

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:12.390 
will stay away and we'll get the plastic

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.270 
will stay away and we'll get the plastic
