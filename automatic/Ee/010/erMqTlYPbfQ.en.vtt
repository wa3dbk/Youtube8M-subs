against other teams and the latency
bought<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.560> freebo's<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.430> it's<00:00:17.580> all<00:00:17.760> green

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
does that even mean like is the latency

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.630 
does that even mean like is the latency
ball<00:00:24.480> lying<00:00:24.779> or<00:00:25.019> what<00:00:25.289> because<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.949> just<00:00:26.460> want

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
it was free ball latency green and it

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.700 
it was free ball latency green and it
was<00:00:36.300> still<00:00:36.540> lagging<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.079> didn't<00:00:37.290> understand

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
was still lagging so I didn't understand

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.310

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
first up hey has really good pace I am

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.729 
first up hey has really good pace I am
he<00:01:03.180> does<00:01:03.359> live<00:01:03.570> up<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.719> his<00:01:03.960> face<00:01:04.140> stats<00:01:04.500> I

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
he does live up to his face stats I

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.200 
he does live up to his face stats I
thought<00:01:05.159> he<00:01:05.280> was<00:01:05.400> really<00:01:05.760> fast

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
thought he was really fast

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.450 
thought he was really fast
amazing<00:01:07.049> dribbling<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.920> what<00:01:08.070> surprised

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
amazing dribbling this is what surprised

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.039 
amazing dribbling this is what surprised
me<00:01:08.490> because<00:01:08.729> he<00:01:09.000> he<00:01:09.420> has<00:01:09.570> really<00:01:09.900> high

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
me because he he has really high

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.080 
me because he he has really high
dribbling<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.799> he<00:01:11.070> was<00:01:11.250> forced<00:01:11.640> at<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.880> same

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
dribbling and he was forced at the same

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.120 
dribbling and he was forced at the same
time<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.900> can't<00:01:13.229> pace<00:01:13.439> abuse<00:01:13.799> with<00:01:13.950> this

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
time so you can't pace abuse with this

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.550 
time so you can't pace abuse with this
guy<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.549> try<00:01:15.479> him<00:01:15.600> out<00:01:15.689> as<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> striker<00:01:16.259> but

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
guy and try him out as a striker but

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.080 
guy and try him out as a striker but
then<00:01:16.710> again<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.040> won't<00:01:17.220> recommend<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.850> because

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
then again I won't recommend it because

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.149 
then again I won't recommend it because
his<00:01:18.210> work<00:01:18.479> rates<00:01:18.720> aren't<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.530> good<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.040> he

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
his work rates aren't that good that he

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.609 
his work rates aren't that good that he
has<00:01:20.189> medium<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.909> medium<00:01:21.240> work<00:01:21.450> rates<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.320> he

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
has medium and medium work rates so he

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.609 
has medium and medium work rates so he
will<00:01:22.830> be<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:23.640> midfield<00:01:23.909> most<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.810> time<00:01:25.049> I

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
will be in midfield most of the time I

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.620 
will be in midfield most of the time I
don't<00:01:26.100> actually<00:01:26.280> recommend<00:01:26.610> him<00:01:27.119> much<00:01:27.360> as<00:01:27.570> a

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
don't actually recommend him much as a

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.539 
don't actually recommend him much as a
center<00:01:28.140> attacking<00:01:28.470> midfielder<00:01:28.920> because<00:01:29.430> he

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
center attacking midfielder because he

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.120 
center attacking midfielder because he

centre forward row I would recommend he

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.719 
centre forward row I would recommend he
stays<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.619> center<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.220> page<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
play really well on the wings because he

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.249 
play really well on the wings because he
stays<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.700> lot<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.149> midfield<00:01:54.689> now<00:01:54.990> another

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
attribute actually surprised me is this

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.370 
attribute actually surprised me is this
shooting<00:01:57.149> if<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.420> look<00:01:57.600> at<00:01:57.750> his<00:01:57.840> in-game<00:01:58.140> says

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
shooting if you look at his in-game says

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.609 
shooting if you look at his in-game says
it<00:01:58.590> says<00:01:58.799> 85<00:01:59.189> shot<00:01:59.670> power<00:01:59.850> now<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.960> seems<00:02:01.320> much

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
it says 85 shot power now it seems much

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.020 
it says 85 shot power now it seems much
weaker<00:02:02.009> than<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.340> when<00:02:02.640> you're<00:02:02.790> on<00:02:02.820> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
weaker than that when you're on the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.450 
weaker than that when you're on the
pitch<00:02:03.210> because<00:02:03.560> say<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.619> want<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.040> take<00:02:05.189> shots

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
pitch because say you want to take shots

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.469 
pitch because say you want to take shots
from<00:02:05.640> 4<00:02:05.880> yards<00:02:06.030> out

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
from 4 yards out

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.210 
from 4 yards out
they<00:02:06.719> won't<00:02:06.960> go<00:02:07.110> in<00:02:07.259> because<00:02:07.439> by<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.770> time<00:02:07.860> the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
they won't go in because by the time the

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.770 
they won't go in because by the time the
ball<00:02:08.340> reaches<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.819> goalkeeper<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.509> would<00:02:09.629> be

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
ball reaches the goalkeeper it would be

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.930 
ball reaches the goalkeeper it would be
way<00:02:10.080> too<00:02:10.110> slow<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.280> goalkeeper<00:02:11.610> will

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
way too slow and the goalkeeper will

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.309 
way too slow and the goalkeeper will
just<00:02:12.150> catch<00:02:12.390> it

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
just catch it

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.399 
just catch it
I<00:02:13.349> could<00:02:13.739> Moscow<00:02:14.310> any<00:02:14.599> 4-yard<00:02:15.599> goes<00:02:15.870> with<00:02:16.230> him

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
I could Moscow any 4-yard goes with him

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.309 
I could Moscow any 4-yard goes with him
because<00:02:17.239> he's<00:02:18.239> sharp<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.599> was<00:02:18.719> just<00:02:18.930> too<00:02:19.109> weak

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
because he's sharp I was just too weak

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.289 
because he's sharp I was just too weak
in<00:02:19.530> my<00:02:19.650> opinion<00:02:20.069> he<00:02:20.459> has<00:02:20.639> really<00:02:20.939> good<00:02:21.090> long

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
in my opinion he has really good long

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.140 
in my opinion he has really good long
shots<00:02:21.569> from<00:02:21.810> move<00:02:22.019> into<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.439> yards<00:02:22.889> but<00:02:23.489> again

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
shots from move into a yards but again

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.270 
shots from move into a yards but again
his<00:02:24.510> short<00:02:24.780> power<00:02:24.989> lets<00:02:25.409> him<00:02:25.650> down<00:02:25.889> in<00:02:26.129> my

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
his short power lets him down in my

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.369 
his short power lets him down in my
opinion<00:02:26.730> so<00:02:27.269> that's<00:02:27.569> another<00:02:27.900> thing<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.319> have

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
opinion so that's another thing you have

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.199 
opinion so that's another thing you have
to<00:02:28.560> take<00:02:28.709> into<00:02:28.920> consideration<00:02:29.010> if<00:02:29.849> you<00:02:30.000> want

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
to take into consideration if you want

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.490 
to take into consideration if you want
your<00:02:30.299> Center<00:02:30.659> attacking<00:02:30.989> midfield<00:02:31.290> or<00:02:31.379> a

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
your Center attacking midfield or a

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.559 
your Center attacking midfield or a
centre<00:02:31.799> forward<00:02:32.159> to<00:02:32.579> have<00:02:32.730> really<00:02:33.060> good<00:02:33.209> shots

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
centre forward to have really good shots

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.839 
centre forward to have really good shots
I<00:02:34.049> could<00:02:34.590> think<00:02:34.769> of<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.250> many<00:02:35.310> other<00:02:35.670> players

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
I could think of so many other players

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.789 
I could think of so many other players
that<00:02:36.060> have<00:02:36.180> been<00:02:36.389> shooing<00:02:36.689> than<00:02:36.900> this<00:02:37.109> guy<00:02:37.349> he

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
that have been shooing than this guy he

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.740 
that have been shooing than this guy he
has<00:02:37.980> Warsaw<00:02:38.430> skills<00:02:38.760> out<00:02:38.909> for<00:02:39.150> star<00:02:39.359> weak<00:02:39.540> foot

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
has Warsaw skills out for star weak foot

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.929 
has Warsaw skills out for star weak foot
so<00:02:40.049> that<00:02:40.709> is<00:02:40.889> another<00:02:41.219> thing<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.730> if<00:02:41.909> you

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
so that is another thing that if you

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.489 
so that is another thing that if you
want<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.239> use<00:02:42.359> skills<00:02:42.659> to<00:02:42.810> cut<00:02:43.019> in<00:02:43.169> if<00:02:43.379> you're

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:43.499 
want to use skills to cut in if you're

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:45.589 
want to use skills to cut in if you're
playing<00:02:43.739> them<00:02:43.889> on<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.639> wings<00:02:44.849> that<00:02:45.150> is<00:02:45.510> a

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
playing them on the wings that is a

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.379 
playing them on the wings that is a
really<00:02:45.989> good<00:02:46.139> way<00:02:46.829> to<00:02:46.859> use<00:02:47.579> him<00:02:47.819> now<00:02:48.180> his

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389 
really good way to use him now his

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:50.119 
really good way to use him now his
finishing<00:02:48.719> isn't<00:02:48.959> anything<00:02:49.469> amazing<00:02:49.769> when

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
finishing isn't anything amazing when

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.649 
finishing isn't anything amazing when
even<00:02:50.370> like<00:02:50.519> that<00:02:50.639> it<00:02:50.790> gets<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.120> job<00:02:51.299> done<00:02:51.359> if

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
even like that it gets the job done if

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.179 
even like that it gets the job done if
you<00:02:51.780> know<00:02:51.900> what<00:02:52.049> I<00:02:52.079> mean<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.409> that<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:53.010> pretty

sure to do so but I don't really

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.219

recommend<00:03:22.949> them<00:03:23.370> for<00:03:23.400> 500k<00:03:24.269> player<00:03:24.599> you<00:03:25.079> would

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:27.140 
recommend them for 500k player you would
expect<00:03:25.620> much<00:03:25.829> more<00:03:25.859> than<00:03:26.189> that<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.579> guess<00:03:26.849> he's

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
expect much more than that I guess he's

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.640
