00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 Hello dear friends are you on the channel 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.520
 lp my name is nil and today we 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.309
 continue to chop into the train my club 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.389
 after a pretty good past 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:15.240
 release you want not to lose not to lose 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.869
 the mood here is not enough 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.240
 players on the bench will arrange an hour 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:26.750
 Today we are playing in fact 4 in fact 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:31.080
 fifth match from no matter player search 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.940
 Hurray Hurray I finally found an opponent 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.770
 waited as a medium for a long time sitting 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.880
 what is the peculiarity of this match is that 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.910
 doesn't play mario goetze 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.329
 we broke it in the last match let's 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.840
 take a look I already see robin robin in attack 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:51.570
 the remaining fecal pretty yes but we 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:55.350
 Colin are all driven and so begins 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.780
 match, again, does not fortunately Schalke 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.660
 against lando the risk of becoming must command 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:06.720
 Then there will be a name change and spreading in 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:09.060
 this time we ok start there our on 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.380
 breaks just how long it hits 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.320
 I already hit without knowing how much back 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.799
 but we attack the course so well rah 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.909
 defend ourselves though we all do not really 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:25.740
 her as my pancake took up trouble 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.990
 a penalty at all from what to if he 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.369
 can beat then of course he will not score everything 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.500
 from he doesn't beat so it gives apiaries and 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:39.360
 barking up the penalty box to our happiness 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:42.840
 perform peredachku hold rabbena that 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:47.540

 here we nakosyachili here we can also at least 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.280
 Nakosyachili important so that they do not 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.200
 squinted us 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.200
 from each other stumbles each other 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:09.509
 beat 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:13.290

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.910
 we were lucky here to keep dad narrabana 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:26.130
 but robban is not famous for growing tall 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:31.650
 so ok well and wickets and there 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:33.930
 Ours does not have time sensitively and yes damn how are you 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.130
 for a long time you hit it, but I already pressed it 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.100
 seen when the strip starts 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.290
 fill in and back 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:45.180
 weren't caught up just didn't caught up there 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:49.380
 well there our our dude and hit 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:58.370
 our attack will not start again 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:03:00.720
 and you can want it all from want turned out yes yes 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.810
 excellent all second half we attacked 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.329
 this kid and pounded he tuned 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:11.220
 aggressively obvious and give our brave ones 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:16.670
 guys run and we are not in debt 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:23.760
 stay yes damn and saved or hit and 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:24.329
 blow you can reject the horde all this 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.660
 victory 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:29.660
 we dragged this time and it pleases 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.090
 And to the meadows of the contract, they give us so what 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.730
 one can only dream of 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.060
 such a contract to get on black but he 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.530
 flies leaving nothing of herself she 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.660
 even bronze ok 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:49.430
 although okay what is soft though bronze is not 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:52.810
 I will let him out although there are no angels 67 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.730
 it's not so bad with all of you the best 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:59.450
 59 for example just this guy put 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.860
 so we play the next division by 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.310
 each got seven points 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.440
 and so far here are the last couple of matches in 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.170
 this in the past rivals seems 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.160
 pretty hardcore 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:15.709
 We found a rival Lucas zc 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.540
 kay let's take a look at its composer 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.919
 pathetic here as the current cannot immediately 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:26.060
 that just drink jc and rooney here it is 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:28.700
 then we have the wolf of angels all the warriors 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.150
 Rooney bred does not pass on Mario Goetze 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:35.660
 this is such an interesting sign okay play 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.640
 dad want to circle this 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.220
 they turn out unfortunately worth it 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.400
 recognize military ronnie wayne rooney 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:46.100
 nifigase we rated it for it guys 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.380
 protection behind her stock can try this 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:53.900
 no foul by the way again Gibson will break and 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:56.510
 how much can you roll out here and beats 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.800
 let's react somehow 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.800
 and it does not bend was 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:06.120
 during the landing will be replays and ramming 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.120
 I understood how I tried 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:15.550
 that side went the damn zone is bad on 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.190
 Rooney played the way I want Wayne Rooney 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.199
 that did not beat yet to beat in this match, I do not 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:23.410
 I want everything that he hit how did become 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:28.570
 attack armor throw immediately on our 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:34.150
 pista the whole world did not go to war 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:37.960
 grid and good good 70 works Ali 1 more 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:45.880
 5 can not wind all really wrapped 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:50.610
 this is a team in iphone for and well others 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:54.460
 let himself obliquely there 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:59.199
 22 they left a fool and can from afar 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:02.310
 punch option can rise father 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:06.449
 he ball antony look good 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:10.449
 throw a pancake take away take away 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:14.229
 please take this penalty Tallinn 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:17.800
 we are there so screwed up a different map that i 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:18.750
 I understand so do not care about the red us 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:23.770
 goal is scored 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:24.889
 wanted by way on a draw q1 will go where 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.650
 break through 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:33.110
 grass to the left mark 40 removes removing from 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:34.990
 solid next match why i think 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.840
 what will drive left 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:42.370
 but he hit all high 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.370
 eyes need some kind of new central 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:52.599
 just lean on us Anton 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.599
 fine 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:58.509
 there is the end 

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:04.530
 no longer we lost bespeco although played 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:04.530
 not worse in my opinion but folders so 

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:10.680
 and so well what can ports there son of 

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:13.340

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:30.210

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:35.380

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:38.140
 erase total fluff what is it like this 

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.820
 It was the match we played how could he 

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.530
 have long gone from this division but 

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.960
