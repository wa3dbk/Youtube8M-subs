00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.990
 it took two or three weeks I got her 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.639
 we are with the mail box box unsightly 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.770
 but honestly most of all 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.560
 interested in the content let's 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.480
 let's see what's inside I deliberately got 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.640
 still rustling sachets not mined 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.070
 annoyed during content inspection 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.250
 almost all of us are now considering 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.520
 brief explanation for each detail 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.280
 then there will be more detail i will stop 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.980
 on each of the fragments of what i am 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.410
 now get out of the box if you 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.010
 take a look you can see now semi oval 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.239
 the recess on the hood I made it myself 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.570
 especially for yourself specifically for your 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.210
 needs originally blend comes with 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.180
 ordinary road a4 format for 3 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.340
 but I just needed more 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.250
 pay tribute to what is also in the box plus 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.890
 to everything you will find wrenches in 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.170
 some spare screws shpuntik and all 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.659
 in order to start collecting this 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.729
 let's call it the constructor right 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.630
 out of the box that is opened and started 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.369
 assembly 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.720
 no need to look for it 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.119
 additional keys 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.860
 screwdriver or other tool everything was 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.350
 packed in here such here's what that 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.200
 tattered soft patches this whether 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.900
 polypropylene whether something else and so 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.120
 let's start the top pen she 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.970
 in fact is the main 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.010
 but besides the cell itself the main 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.900
 holder that is for easy carrying 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.390
 the whole design you can by the way wear 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.740
 its both on top and on the sides now you 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.840
 see means how the cell itself is made 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.720
 By the way I will tell everyone that here is the twisting 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.520
 the rails themselves please don't be zealous 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.920
 very much there is no need to apply 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.890
 some kind of tremendous power she just there neither 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.230
 what does the cell itself mean on the sides 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.120
 pens in principle can be carried 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.970
 either for them but this is already in motion in 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.520
 frame before either i don't know what 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.680
 tracking wiring is already a pen over and 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.619
 affairs again again I warn everyone 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.480
 do not try to spin right before stupor 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.340
 it absolutely can do no good 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.110
 not lead 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.960
 despite the fact that the plastic itself 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.300
 plastic means cells are made of 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.440
 very much so i would say lasting and 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.750
 lightweight material 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.410
 if viewed very close is 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.090
 the feeling that the plastic is just the same 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.690
 Whether iron is added to tin 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.959
 some kind of fusion so strange 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.260
 means three pieces means two side and 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.450
 one top also means landing them 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.700
 on the hood 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.500
 please do not use great power 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.320
 she's not there just need you see everything 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.010
 everything clings quite easily and does not 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.230
 requires some long time 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.230
 when naturally packed and disassembling i 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.500
 would advise only shoot 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.709
 The upper burdock is this healthy because 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.900
 what if the two side perfectly easily 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.629
 fold and cover from on the other then 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.310
 top burdock he won't give you that 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.290
 make and most likely that when 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.200
 transporting it you can just 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.650
 spoil it therefore disassembling designs 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.560
 see for yourself which parts of the niv to you 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.590
 it will be more convenient to leave or what withdrawals 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.720
 so that they do not deteriorate 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:29.010
 liners for blending ratio 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.599
 sides 4 on 3 and 16 on 9 respectively 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.810
 for widescreen 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:36.269
 film and regular format 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.450
 I don't know what to say, but sometimes Iâ€™m told 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.530
 it seems that it will just drag on 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.410
 build time 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:48.540
 the rig itself and from pulling the moment of shooting 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:52.049
 Of course everyone chooses for himself further 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:55.470
 the skirt is attached to the neck of a man 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:57.450
 shoelaces them way i would say into her 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.389
 two frames are inserted which 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.230
 turn you can provide two a in 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:06.169
 light filters which mascara you decide 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.389
 one ssn lesson fixes on 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:13.109
 directly the lens will fasten the skirt 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:15.660
 mean and the second on the compendium here 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.549
 so if you pull on one side and 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.609
 other 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:24.060
 fasten on both sides and flare 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:27.389
 you can not expect a skirt attached 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.189
 simple enough to the compendium itself 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:32.009
 the main thing is also not to make much effort 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:35.039
 because it can also not be very good 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:37.830
 finish now let's consider 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:40.860
 quick release pad itself and and 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.680
 fastening to the rails and collecting itself 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.479
 designs in general 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.960
 fastening the quick release plate itself 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:50.639
 yourself strong enough and reliable when 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.469
 you will collect the whole 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.930
 I will immediately make a reservation 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:56.849
 I advise you tightly twist at all 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.129
 nothing is somewhere around 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:02.909
 to somehow hold on because 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:05.460
 as far as assembly of the construction itself and even 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:07.830
 that moment when inside and and you already 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.990
 insert and shooting technique anyway 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.960
 you will understand that there will be a lot 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.599
 customized for the convenience of the whole so 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.819
 which is why I simply advise nothing tight 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:20.039
 Immediately do not tighten all this already 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:22.469
 do it afterwards when you see 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:24.539
 that the designs collected all well 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:27.539
 arranged all matched to each 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:30.020
 friend none of the parts do not interfere in 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:33.560
 work and you are ready to start shooting 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.560
 good frames to you
