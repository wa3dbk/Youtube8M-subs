Everest

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.500 
Everest
to<00:01:09.710> basically<00:01:09.890> see<00:01:10.549> what<00:01:10.729> it<00:01:10.820> looked<00:01:11.060> like<00:01:11.150> and

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
to basically see what it looked like and

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.000 
to basically see what it looked like and
to<00:01:11.600> find<00:01:11.840> a<00:01:11.990> way<00:01:12.110> up<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:12.530> mountain

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
to find a way up the mountain

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.090 
to find a way up the mountain
so<00:01:13.790> if<00:01:13.880> you<00:01:13.970> look<00:01:14.180> at<00:01:14.330> this<00:01:14.510> picture

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
so if you look at this picture

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.719 
so if you look at this picture
it's<00:01:17.090> very<00:01:17.390> astonishing<00:01:18.140> if<00:01:18.530> you<00:01:19.040> take<00:01:19.549> the

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
it's very astonishing if you take the

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.330 
it's very astonishing if you take the
time<00:01:19.939> to<00:01:20.060> look<00:01:20.210> at<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.479> details<00:01:21.100> these<00:01:22.100> are

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
time to look at the details these are

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.160 
time to look at the details these are
absolutely<00:01:23.710> exact<00:01:24.710> matches<00:01:25.400> of<00:01:25.790> this<00:01:26.750> terrain

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
absolutely exact matches of this terrain

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.440 
absolutely exact matches of this terrain
and<00:01:27.500> this<00:01:27.680> mouth<00:01:28.119> 1921<00:01:29.979> 2008<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:32.030> glacier

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
and this mouth 1921 2008 the glacier

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.230 
and this mouth 1921 2008 the glacier
sitting<00:01:32.780> up<00:01:32.930> here<00:01:33.200> in<00:01:34.840> 1921<00:01:36.640> this<00:01:37.640> so<00:01:37.970> it<00:01:38.090> was

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
sitting up here in 1921 this so it was

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.240 
sitting up here in 1921 this so it was
here<00:01:38.600> it<00:01:39.439> has<00:01:39.680> dropped<00:01:40.040> over<00:01:41.290> 350<00:01:42.290> vertical

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
in 2008 why is it twice as tall because

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.260 
in 2008 why is it twice as tall because
the<00:02:08.630> glacier<00:02:09.110> dropped<00:02:09.440> four<00:02:10.399> hundred<00:02:10.970> feet

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.860 
the same picture in 2008 the glacier
used<00:02:44.510> to<00:02:44.690> sit<00:02:44.960> up<00:02:45.260> here<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:46.480> see<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.660> lines

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
used to sit up here and see the lines

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.120 
used to sit up here and see the lines
here's<00:02:48.770> where<00:02:49.040> I<00:02:49.070> once<00:02:49.370> was<00:02:49.700> way<00:02:50.390> up<00:02:50.600> here

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
here's where I once was way up here

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:58.660 
here's where I once was way up here
here's<00:02:52.130> where<00:02:52.400> it<00:02:52.550> is<00:02:52.700> it's<00:02:53.300> dropped<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.980> to

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
here's where it is it's dropped and to

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.850 
here's where it is it's dropped and to
give<00:02:58.850> you<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:59.000> little<00:02:59.330> bit<00:02:59.450> of<00:02:59.480> scale<00:02:59.930> on<00:03:00.350> on

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
give you a little bit of scale on on

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.370 
give you a little bit of scale on on
this<00:03:02.650> how<00:03:03.650> big<00:03:03.800> are<00:03:03.980> those<00:03:04.070> ice<00:03:04.310> ankles<00:03:05.380> well

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
this how big are those ice ankles well

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.020 
this how big are those ice ankles well
I'll<00:03:06.680> show<00:03:06.890> you<00:03:06.920> how<00:03:07.220> big<00:03:07.400> they<00:03:07.610> are<00:03:07.640> if<00:03:07.910> you

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
I'll show you how big they are if you

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.740 
I'll show you how big they are if you
come<00:03:08.270> in<00:03:09.280> because<00:03:10.280> that<00:03:10.670> ice<00:03:10.910> pinnacle<00:03:11.570> right

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
come in because that ice pinnacle right

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.920 
come in because that ice pinnacle right
there<00:03:12.160> is<00:03:13.160> right<00:03:13.489> here<00:03:15.850> and<00:03:16.870> there's<00:03:17.870> a

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
there is right here and there's a

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.330 
there is right here and there's a
climber<00:03:18.290> on<00:03:20.470> so<00:03:21.470> if<00:03:21.560> you<00:03:21.680> take<00:03:21.830> that<00:03:22.100> ice

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
climber on so if you take that ice

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.460 
climber on so if you take that ice
pinnacle<00:03:22.970> which<00:03:23.660> is<00:03:23.810> one<00:03:23.930> of<00:03:24.050> the<00:03:24.140> smaller

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
pinnacle which is one of the smaller

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.560 
pinnacle which is one of the smaller
ones<00:03:24.830> and<00:03:25.100> place<00:03:26.000> it<00:03:26.300> right<00:03:27.040> here<00:03:28.330> then<00:03:29.330> you

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
ones and place it right here then you

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.509 
ones and place it right here then you
get<00:03:29.750> an<00:03:29.870> idea<00:03:30.670> of<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.470> amount<00:03:33.830> of<00:03:34.040> ice

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
get an idea of the the amount of ice

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.560 
get an idea of the the amount of ice
that's<00:03:34.940> being<00:03:35.209> lost<00:03:35.510> and<00:03:37.239> this<00:03:38.239> is<00:03:38.420> the

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
that's being lost and this is the

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.199 
that's being lost and this is the
highest<00:03:38.959> part<00:03:39.380> of<00:03:40.010> the<00:03:40.280> highest<00:03:40.610> water<00:03:40.880> tower

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
highest part of the highest water tower

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.740 
highest part of the highest water tower
in<00:03:41.570> the<00:03:41.720> world<00:03:41.920> Mount<00:03:42.920> Everest

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
in the world Mount Everest

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.479 
in the world Mount Everest
basically<00:03:44.750> glaciers<00:03:45.260> store<00:03:45.620> and<00:03:45.950> release

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
basically glaciers store and release

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.270 
basically glaciers store and release
water<00:03:46.930> now<00:03:47.930> they're<00:03:48.140> no<00:03:48.290> longer<00:03:48.320> storing<00:03:49.070> them

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
water now they're no longer storing them

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.110 
water now they're no longer storing them
they're<00:03:49.730> only<00:03:50.110> releasing<00:03:51.110> water<00:03:51.350> and<00:03:52.120> which

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
they're only releasing water and which

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.009 
they're only releasing water and which
means<00:03:54.310> this<00:03:55.310> glacier<00:03:55.730> will<00:03:55.940> be<00:03:56.090> gone<00:03:56.300> in<00:03:56.870> the

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
means this glacier will be gone in the

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.229 
means this glacier will be gone in the
not-too-distant<00:03:57.410> future

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.119 

I<00:04:00.269> don't<00:04:00.450> know<00:04:00.540> how<00:04:00.629> many<00:04:00.810> years<00:04:00.989> that<00:04:01.349> is<00:04:01.650> the

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
I don't know how many years that is the

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.599 
I don't know how many years that is the
experts<00:04:02.959> decide<00:04:03.959> on<00:04:04.200> that<00:04:04.439> I<00:04:04.680> just<00:04:05.340> come<00:04:05.489> back

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
experts decide on that I just come back

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:09.500 
experts decide on that I just come back
with<00:04:05.849> the<00:04:05.969> evidence<00:04:06.359> to<00:04:07.260> show<00:04:07.469> people<00:04:08.510> how

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
with the evidence to show people how

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.709 
with the evidence to show people how
dramatic<00:04:10.349> the<00:04:11.129> change<00:04:11.430> is<00:04:11.790> in<00:04:12.090> such<00:04:12.299> a<00:04:12.329> short

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:12.719 
dramatic the change is in such a short

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:15.590 
dramatic the change is in such a short
period<00:04:13.019> of<00:04:13.530> time
