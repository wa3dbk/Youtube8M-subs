can<00:01:40.470> always<00:01:40.590> remove<00:01:41.159> what<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.460> can't<00:01:41.729> add<00:01:41.970> and

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
can always remove what you can't add and

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.969 
can always remove what you can't add and
then<00:01:42.299> you're<00:01:42.869> just<00:01:42.899> going<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.470> make<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.770> loop

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
then you're just going to make a loop

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.380 
then you're just going to make a loop
out<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.460> you're<00:01:44.640> just<00:01:44.700> going<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.939> fold<00:01:45.180> it

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
out of that you're just going to fold it

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.969 
out of that you're just going to fold it
over<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.960> have<00:01:46.049> two<00:01:46.200> strings<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.829> make<00:01:46.950> a

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
over so you have two strings and make a

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.639 
over so you have two strings and make a
loop<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.490> not<00:01:47.820> at<00:01:47.939> all<00:01:48.229> then<00:01:49.229> you're<00:01:49.439> going<00:01:49.590> to

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
loop and not at all then you're going to

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.300 
loop and not at all then you're going to
want<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.950> tape<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.939> knot<00:01:51.149> down<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:52.159> get<00:01:53.159> your

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
want to tape the knot down and get your

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.300 
want to tape the knot down and get your
beads<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.509> there's<00:01:55.409> just<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.710> close-up<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.159> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
beads so there's just a close-up of the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.859 
beads so there's just a close-up of the
beads<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.729> I'm<00:01:56.880> just<00:01:57.030> pouring<00:01:57.360> them<00:01:57.479> into<00:01:57.509> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
beads and I'm just pouring them into the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.170 
beads and I'm just pouring them into the
little<00:01:57.990> tray<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.680> they<00:01:58.829> come<00:01:59.040> with<00:01:59.250> just<00:02:00.000> so

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
little tray that they come with just so

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.330 
little tray that they come with just so
I<00:02:00.210> can<00:02:00.450> grab<00:02:00.689> them<00:02:00.990> easily<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.950> course<00:02:01.979> a

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
I can grab them easily and of course a

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.209 
I can grab them easily and of course a
bunch<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.610> all<00:02:02.729> on<00:02:02.850> my<00:02:02.939> floor<00:02:03.229> but<00:02:04.229> anyway<00:02:04.619> some

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
bunch of all on my floor but anyway some

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.380 
bunch of all on my floor but anyway some
are<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.399> going<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.579> want<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.759> do<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.149> take

are you going to want to do is take

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.210 
are you going to want to do is take
either<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.990> two<00:02:07.140> strings<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.799> string

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
either of the two strings and string

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.450 
either of the two strings and string
your<00:02:08.399> first<00:02:08.670> bead<00:02:09.030> on

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
your first bead on

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.700 
your first bead on
as<00:02:11.260> you<00:02:12.260> can<00:02:12.380> see<00:02:12.620> and<00:02:14.140> then<00:02:15.140> you're<00:02:15.350> going<00:02:15.560> to

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
as you can see and then you're going to

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.770 
as you can see and then you're going to
take<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.310> other<00:02:16.490> string<00:02:17.060> while<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:17.600> have

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
take the other string while you have

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.090 
take the other string while you have
that<00:02:18.020> string<00:02:18.380> beaded<00:02:18.830> and<00:02:20.590> you're<00:02:21.590> going<00:02:21.770> to

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
that string beaded and you're going to

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.360 
that string beaded and you're going to
put<00:02:22.430> that<00:02:22.460> other<00:02:22.910> string<00:02:23.330> through<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:25.130> bead

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
put that other string through the bead

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.220 
put that other string through the bead
as<00:02:25.580> well<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.180> now<00:02:26.300> you're<00:02:26.510> stringing<00:02:26.870> both

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
as well so now you're stringing both

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.040 
as well so now you're stringing both
strings<00:02:27.620> on<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.120> bead<00:02:29.300> and<00:02:29.570> then<00:02:29.810> all

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
strings on to the bead and then all

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.190 
strings on to the bead and then all
you're<00:02:30.230> going<00:02:30.380> to<00:02:30.500> do<00:02:30.710> is<00:02:30.950> pull<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:32.200> both

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
you're going to do is pull and both

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.920 
you're going to do is pull and both
strings<00:02:33.620> should<00:02:34.070> be<00:02:34.220> surrounding<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.750> bead

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
strings should be surrounding the bead

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.080 
strings should be surrounding the bead
and<00:02:36.110> then<00:02:36.460> you're<00:02:37.460> just<00:02:37.490> going<00:02:37.760> to<00:02:37.850> go<00:02:37.970> ahead

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
and then you're just going to go ahead

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.720 
and then you're just going to go ahead
and<00:02:38.510> do<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.720> same<00:02:38.930> thing<00:02:39.580> obviously<00:02:40.580> you're

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
and do the same thing obviously you're

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.620 
and do the same thing obviously you're
just<00:02:40.850> going<00:02:40.970> to<00:02:41.030> want<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.210> make<00:02:41.330> sure<00:02:41.360> you're

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
just going to want to make sure you're

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
just going to want to make sure you're
really<00:02:41.780> comfortable<00:02:42.050> while<00:02:42.410> you're<00:02:42.530> doing

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
really comfortable while you're doing

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.440 
really comfortable while you're doing
this<00:02:42.890> so<00:02:43.130> I<00:02:43.160> had<00:02:43.520> to<00:02:43.550> move<00:02:43.760> my<00:02:43.820> beads<00:02:44.150> over

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
this so I had to move my beads over

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.810 
this so I had to move my beads over
because<00:02:44.840> I<00:02:45.140> Mariah<00:02:45.830> T<00:02:45.950> so<00:02:46.250> putting<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.670> beads

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
because I Mariah T so putting the beads

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.370 
because I Mariah T so putting the beads
on<00:02:46.910> my<00:02:47.000> right<00:02:47.150> side<00:02:47.180> was<00:02:47.360> easier<00:02:47.750> so<00:02:48.050> again

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
on my right side was easier so again

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.010 
on my right side was easier so again
you're<00:02:48.980> just<00:02:49.160> going<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.550> string<00:02:49.940> your<00:02:50.750> beads

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
you're just going to string your beads

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.650 
you're just going to string your beads
through<00:02:51.350> one<00:02:51.530> of<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.740> strings<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.370> then<00:02:53.210> pull

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
through one of the strings and then pull

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.080 
through one of the strings and then pull
the<00:02:53.900> other<00:02:53.930> string<00:02:54.560> through<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.670> beat<00:02:55.880> as

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
the other string through the beat as

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.380 
the other string through the beat as
well<00:02:57.280> so<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.340> hope<00:02:58.460> you<00:02:58.640> guys<00:02:58.760> are<00:02:59.060> getting<00:02:59.150> a

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
well so I hope you guys are getting a

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.300 
well so I hope you guys are getting a
good<00:02:59.540> picture<00:02:59.870> of<00:02:59.900> what<00:03:00.200> I'm<00:03:00.320> doing<00:03:00.590> here<00:03:00.800> then

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
good picture of what I'm doing here then

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.840 
good picture of what I'm doing here then
once<00:03:01.580> you<00:03:01.820> string<00:03:02.480> both<00:03:02.720> of<00:03:03.550> the<00:03:04.550> strings

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
once you string both of the strings

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.160 
once you string both of the strings
through<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.150> bead<00:03:05.330> you're<00:03:05.570> just<00:03:05.750> going<00:03:06.020> to

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
through the bead you're just going to

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.650 
through the bead you're just going to
pull

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.460 

and<00:03:10.360> continue<00:03:11.360> doing<00:03:11.690> this<00:03:13.420> so<00:03:14.420> again<00:03:14.750> taking

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
and continue doing this so again taking

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.620 
and continue doing this so again taking
a<00:03:15.560> bead<00:03:16.030> putting<00:03:17.030> it<00:03:17.120> through<00:03:17.240> one<00:03:17.450> of<00:03:17.480> the

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
a bead putting it through one of the

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.050 
a bead putting it through one of the
strings<00:03:17.870> it<00:03:18.080> doesn't<00:03:18.320> matter<00:03:18.440> which<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:19.060> then

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
strings it doesn't matter which and then

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.820 
strings it doesn't matter which and then
pulling<00:03:20.660> it<00:03:20.780> through<00:03:20.840> the<00:03:21.050> other<00:03:21.230> string<00:03:21.560> and

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
pulling it through the other string and

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.710 
pulling it through the other string and
pulling<00:03:22.340> now<00:03:22.760> I'm<00:03:22.970> just<00:03:23.120> going<00:03:23.210> to<00:03:23.420> speed<00:03:23.690> up

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
pulling now I'm just going to speed up

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.300 
pulling now I'm just going to speed up
this<00:03:23.900> process<00:03:23.960> because<00:03:24.680> I<00:03:24.800> think<00:03:25.010> you<00:03:25.130> guys

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
this process because I think you guys

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.560 
this process because I think you guys
have<00:03:25.610> a<00:03:25.640> pretty<00:03:25.910> good<00:03:26.000> idea<00:03:26.120> of<00:03:27.040> how<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.100> do<00:03:28.340> it

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.970 

so<00:03:32.570> as<00:03:32.930> you<00:03:33.020> can<00:03:33.140> see<00:03:33.320> it's<00:03:33.440> really<00:03:33.800> really

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
so as you can see it's really really

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.560 
so as you can see it's really really
easy<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.400> only<00:03:34.730> part<00:03:34.970> that<00:03:35.030> gets<00:03:35.210> a<00:03:35.360> little

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
easy the only part that gets a little

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.200 
easy the only part that gets a little
bit<00:03:35.810> difficult<00:03:35.990> at<00:03:36.320> some<00:03:36.620> point<00:03:36.950> is<00:03:37.190> when<00:03:37.970> the

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
bit difficult at some point is when the

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:39.940 
bit difficult at some point is when the
string<00:03:38.510> phrase<00:03:38.930> because<00:03:39.410> you<00:03:39.530> kind<00:03:39.740> of<00:03:39.800> have

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
string phrase because you kind of have

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.880 
string phrase because you kind of have
to<00:03:39.980> keep<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.400> string<00:03:40.640> together<00:03:41.470> just<00:03:42.470> so<00:03:42.620> both

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
to keep the string together just so both

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.380 
to keep the string together just so both
sides<00:03:42.950> of<00:03:43.520> the<00:03:44.590> beads<00:03:45.590> fit<00:03:45.950> through<00:03:46.280> or<00:03:46.700> not

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
sides of the beads fit through or not

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.150 
sides of the beads fit through or not
both<00:03:47.540> sigh<00:03:47.720> feed<00:03:48.080> both<00:03:48.320> sides<00:03:48.620> of<00:03:48.920> the

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
both sigh feed both sides of the

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.470 
both sigh feed both sides of the
strengthened<00:03:49.640> through<00:03:49.670> and<00:03:50.090> i<00:03:50.870> found<00:03:51.290> that

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
strengthened through and i found that

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.720 
strengthened through and i found that
six<00:03:53.480> millimeter<00:03:54.200> beads<00:03:54.560> are<00:03:54.830> the<00:03:54.980> easiest<00:03:55.400> to

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
six millimeter beads are the easiest to

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.490 
six millimeter beads are the easiest to
do<00:03:55.880> this<00:03:56.060> and<00:03:56.300> that<00:03:56.330> was<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:57.020> silver<00:03:57.320> beads

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
do this and that was the silver beads

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.590 
do this and that was the silver beads
that<00:03:57.650> was<00:03:57.890> the<00:03:57.980> size<00:03:58.190> of<00:03:58.340> them<00:03:58.490> and<00:03:58.730> i<00:03:59.360> did

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
that was the size of them and i did

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.780 
that was the size of them and i did
another<00:03:59.840> bracelet<00:04:00.290> with<00:04:00.590> gold<00:04:01.100> beads<00:04:01.430> and

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
another bracelet with gold beads and

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.070 
another bracelet with gold beads and
those<00:04:01.970> weeds<00:04:02.240> were<00:04:02.360> a<00:04:02.390> little<00:04:02.630> bit<00:04:02.780> smaller

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
those weeds were a little bit smaller

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.810 
those weeds were a little bit smaller
they<00:04:03.290> were<00:04:03.350> five<00:04:03.620> millimeter<00:04:04.130> and<00:04:04.460> it<00:04:04.700> was

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
they were five millimeter and it was

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.870 
they were five millimeter and it was
just<00:04:05.000> a<00:04:05.090> little<00:04:05.120> bit<00:04:05.510> harder<00:04:05.990> to<00:04:06.490> string<00:04:07.490> both

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
just a little bit harder to string both

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.970 
just a little bit harder to string both
of<00:04:08.210> the<00:04:08.330> strings<00:04:08.690> through<00:04:09.110> the<00:04:09.290> bead<00:04:09.470> but<00:04:09.800> I

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
of the strings through the bead but I

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.090 
of the strings through the bead but I
mean<00:04:10.160> it's<00:04:10.340> doable<00:04:10.640> but<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.300> easiest<00:04:12.100> beads

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
mean it's doable but the easiest beads

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.980 
mean it's doable but the easiest beads
to<00:04:13.340> do<00:04:13.490> this<00:04:13.640> I<00:04:13.970> think<00:04:14.030> are<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:14.600> six

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
to do this I think are the six

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.750 
to do this I think are the six
millimeter<00:04:15.410> beads<00:04:15.650> so<00:04:16.250> those<00:04:16.430> are<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.670> ones

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
millimeter beads so those are the ones

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.599 
millimeter beads so those are the ones
that<00:04:16.910> I<00:04:17.030> would<00:04:17.299> get<00:04:17.480> if<00:04:17.690> I<00:04:17.959> was<00:04:18.230> to<00:04:18.620> go<00:04:19.489> ahead

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
that I would get if I was to go ahead

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:27.940 
that I would get if I was to go ahead
and<00:04:19.880> get<00:04:19.940> different<00:04:20.120> colored<00:04:20.540> beads

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.800 

so<00:04:28.950> this<00:04:29.130> is<00:04:29.250> a<00:04:29.280> really<00:04:29.490> fist<00:04:29.850> process<00:04:30.540> it

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
so this is a really fist process it

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.900 
so this is a really fist process it
takes<00:04:31.620> about<00:04:31.950> 10<00:04:32.250> minutes<00:04:32.280> in<00:04:32.730> total

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
takes about 10 minutes in total

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.760 
takes about 10 minutes in total
especially<00:04:33.690> if<00:04:33.810> you<00:04:33.930> have<00:04:33.960> like<00:04:34.350> I<00:04:34.470> said<00:04:34.650> the

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
especially if you have like I said the

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.050 
especially if you have like I said the
six<00:04:34.980> millimeter<00:04:35.370> beads<00:04:35.610> which<00:04:35.820> are<00:04:35.910> really

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
six millimeter beads which are really

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.410 
six millimeter beads which are really
easy<00:04:36.270> to<00:04:36.450> string<00:04:36.720> through<00:04:36.990> and<00:04:37.940> then<00:04:38.940> once<00:04:39.270> you

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
easy to string through and then once you

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.360 
easy to string through and then once you
have<00:04:39.600> enough<00:04:39.870> string<00:04:40.380> you're<00:04:40.740> just<00:04:40.950> going<00:04:41.190> to

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
have enough string you're just going to

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.200 
have enough string you're just going to
want<00:04:41.580> to<00:04:41.760> not<00:04:42.090> off<00:04:42.390> the<00:04:43.340> beads<00:04:44.340> just<00:04:45.000> so<00:04:45.090> they

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
want to not off the beads just so they

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.270 
want to not off the beads just so they
don't<00:04:45.240> move<00:04:45.510> around<00:04:45.630> and<00:04:45.990> then<00:04:46.290> pick<00:04:46.650> a<00:04:46.830> button

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
don't move around and then pick a button

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.950 
don't move around and then pick a button
that<00:04:47.310> you<00:04:47.460> like<00:04:47.760> you<00:04:47.790> can<00:04:48.090> choose<00:04:48.330> any<00:04:48.570> button

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
that you like you can choose any button

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.410 
that you like you can choose any button
and<00:04:49.230> you're<00:04:50.130> going<00:04:50.340> to<00:04:50.490> just<00:04:50.640> string<00:04:51.030> both<00:04:51.270> of

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
and you're going to just string both of

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.150 
and you're going to just string both of
the<00:04:51.510> strings<00:04:51.810> through<00:04:52.140> two<00:04:52.410> holes<00:04:52.440> in<00:04:53.040> the

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
the strings through two holes in the

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.960 
the strings through two holes in the
button<00:04:53.960> and<00:04:56.300> then<00:04:57.300> just<00:04:57.660> tie<00:04:57.960> a<00:04:58.790> simple<00:04:59.790> knot

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
button and then just tie a simple knot

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.590 
button and then just tie a simple knot
and<00:05:00.980> I<00:05:01.980> did<00:05:02.250> this<00:05:02.370> about<00:05:02.640> three<00:05:02.880> or<00:05:02.970> four<00:05:03.120> times

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
and I did this about three or four times

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.690 
and I did this about three or four times
just<00:05:04.170> because<00:05:04.290> I<00:05:04.500> wanted<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:04.890> ensure<00:05:05.340> that<00:05:05.550> the

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
just because I wanted to ensure that the

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.460 
just because I wanted to ensure that the
knot<00:05:05.880> stays<00:05:06.210> in<00:05:06.420> place<00:05:06.690> and<00:05:07.050> you<00:05:07.110> don't<00:05:07.230> want

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
knot stays in place and you don't want

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:14.060 
knot stays in place and you don't want
it<00:05:07.530> going<00:05:07.680> anywhere<00:05:09.560> and<00:05:12.500> then<00:05:13.500> you<00:05:13.710> can<00:05:13.890> just

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
it going anywhere and then you can just

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.920 
it going anywhere and then you can just
go<00:05:14.190> ahead<00:05:14.310> and<00:05:14.460> trim<00:05:14.820> off<00:05:14.940> that<00:05:15.000> excess<00:05:15.600> with<00:05:15.900> a

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
go ahead and trim off that excess with a

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.150 
go ahead and trim off that excess with a
scissor<00:05:16.260> and<00:05:18.410> there<00:05:19.410> is<00:05:19.650> the<00:05:19.830> finished

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
scissor and there is the finished

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.670 
scissor and there is the finished
bracelet<00:05:20.460> it's<00:05:20.880> so<00:05:21.300> super<00:05:21.720> super<00:05:22.230> simple<00:05:22.530> and

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
bracelet it's so super super simple and

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.920 
bracelet it's so super super simple and
easy<00:05:22.860> and<00:05:23.220> if<00:05:23.760> you<00:05:23.940> make<00:05:24.090> a<00:05:24.120> ton<00:05:24.390> of<00:05:24.420> these<00:05:24.630> it

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
easy and if you make a ton of these it

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.200 
easy and if you make a ton of these it
looks<00:05:25.170> awesome<00:05:25.500> stacked<00:05:26.280> so<00:05:26.970> I<00:05:27.000> would

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
looks awesome stacked so I would

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.850 
looks awesome stacked so I would
definitely<00:05:27.240> recommend<00:05:27.600> you<00:05:28.110> going<00:05:28.380> ahead<00:05:28.500> and

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
definitely recommend you going ahead and

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.070 
definitely recommend you going ahead and
making<00:05:28.920> more<00:05:29.700> than<00:05:29.880> one<00:05:30.060> especially<00:05:30.540> with

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
making more than one especially with

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.930 
making more than one especially with
different<00:05:31.500> colors<00:05:31.770> strings<00:05:32.340> and<00:05:32.670> different

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
different colors strings and different
