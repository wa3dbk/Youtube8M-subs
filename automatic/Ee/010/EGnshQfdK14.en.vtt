want to make sure that when you put the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.330 
want to make sure that when you put the
measuring<00:00:33.329> device<00:00:33.630> next<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.680> horns<00:00:35.010> next

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
measuring device next to the horns next

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.250 
measuring device next to the horns next
to<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.520> eyes<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:35.880> front<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.210> lobster<00:00:36.630> that

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
to the eyes in front of the lobster that

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.229 
to the eyes in front of the lobster that
it<00:00:37.410> doesn't<00:00:37.739> fall<00:00:37.920> back<00:00:37.980> over<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.760> back<00:00:38.969> of

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
it doesn't fall back over the back of

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.630 
it doesn't fall back over the back of
the<00:00:40.020> carapace<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.980> carapace<00:00:41.430> it

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
the carapace this is the carapace it

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.639 
the carapace this is the carapace it
ends<00:00:42.210> right<00:00:42.329> here<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:43.079> if<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.320> were<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.620> fall

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
ends right here so if this were to fall

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.240 
ends right here so if this were to fall
over<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.309> back<00:00:44.489> it'd<00:00:44.700> be<00:00:44.820> short<00:00:45.059> but<00:00:45.270> watch

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
over the back it'd be short but watch

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.799 
over the back it'd be short but watch
this<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.460> way<00:00:47.700> big<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.329> probably<00:00:48.660> about

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
this is way big this is probably about

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.229 
this is way big this is probably about
an<00:00:49.200> inch<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> half<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:50.010> larger<00:00:50.489> than<00:00:51.030> most

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
an inch and a half of larger than most
