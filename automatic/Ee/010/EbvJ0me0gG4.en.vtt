00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
it for the first two weeks but tonight

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.520 
it for the first two weeks but tonight
just<00:00:49.649> slightly<00:00:50.399> out<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.820> sync<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.540> think<00:00:52.350> being

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
just slightly out of sync I think being

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.139 
just slightly out of sync I think being
at<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.769> top<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.100> leaderboard<00:00:53.370> has<00:00:53.790> a

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
at the top the leaderboard has a

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.029 
at the top the leaderboard has a
pressure<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:55.079> there's<00:00:55.350> only<00:00:55.469> one<00:00:55.649> place<00:00:55.890> to

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
pressure that there's only one place to

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.130 
pressure that there's only one place to
go<00:00:56.159> which<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.399> down<00:00:56.729> and<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.659> I<00:00:57.690> like<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:57.989> idea

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
go which is down and so I like the idea

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.889 
go which is down and so I like the idea
of<00:00:58.500> having<00:00:58.949> some<00:00:59.219> place<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.430> go<00:00:59.760> not<00:01:00.269> to<00:01:00.510> this

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
of having some place to go not to this

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.380 
of having some place to go not to this

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
we've got the Argentine tango after my

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.940 
we've got the Argentine tango after my

00:01:09.559 --> 00:01:09.569 
concerned than my techniques really good

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:12.770 
concerned than my techniques really good
because<00:01:09.750> Derek's<00:01:10.649> technique<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.780> beyond

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
because Derek's technique is beyond

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.870 
because Derek's technique is beyond
