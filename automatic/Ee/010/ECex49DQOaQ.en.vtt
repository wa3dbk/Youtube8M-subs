00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.680
Red ribbons show that anthracite burns here below ground. 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.950
State inspectors go from door to door, measuring toxic fumes.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.220
They could extinguish the fire in a few days. They've almost done it. 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.220
But due to bureaucracy they didn't have time to do it, when it was effectively.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.900
The government wanted people to move out. But we wanted to stay.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.400
Once the fire started, it had been necessary to dig.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.740
They haven't done it. 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.380
Centralia has disappeared. It can't be returned.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:58.250
Centralia. Town that doesn't exist.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.890
Centralia is a mining town located in Pennsylvania. In the U.S. it's better known as a ghost town.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:12.370
Before the fire, Centralia was the center of the coal industry. Cost of the city's coal reserves is estimated at $1 billion.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.370
Previously, it was the whole town. But now it's not existed. 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:22.740
And through these photos I can recover the townscape that we have lost. 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.390
This image describes the situation very clearly. In particular, because nothing of what you see now, exists. 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.760
The fire started around here. And we'll start viewing area here. 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.500
But you will not see anything of what is shown in the picture. Everything has disappeared.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.040
Previously, a little more than 1,000 residents lived in the city. 4 or 5 hundred homes were there.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.400
In this picture you can see the the underground fire steam, leaked right through the asphalt on the street. 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.050
Start of mass demolition of town's buildings.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.390
Previously, 5 churches, 5 or 6 gas stations were in Centralia. 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.760
And the same number of grocery stores. Also a few bars.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.700
Oh God, it was such a lovely place. Neighbors took care of each other.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.310
To this day, the fire is blazing. 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.280
If you go on the highway, you pass a large shaft and go another to the side. There are fires.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.320
Being in collusion with the mining companies, the town's authorities wanted to set fire to the city to get people to leave, 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:48.600
then to put out the fire and start earning on mining. Rich deposits of coal are literally under the citizens' homes.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.670
Homes were here, everywhere, everywhere. Service station was right where we are staying. 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.070
There is nothing else here.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.180
This is Centralia. All this is the town of Centralia.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.990
This is an ecological disaster. Fires will continue.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:30.670
Initially municipality was responsible for the incident. Because they set fire to the town. 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.780
Although they have done it unintentionally. But it happened anyway. 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.910
After this the state government and the federal government have become responsible. 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.020
Because they didn't react to the problem in time and didn't solved it.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.060
In recent years, residents of Centralia actually were grilled over a low heat.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.960
Authorities failed to extinguish the fire. Thousands of residents have become its victims.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.770
Needless to say, we have here very large cracks in the asphalt. Along the entire stretch of road. 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.200
What a wavy, hummocky asphalt. Can you see? This is a result of fire in Centralia mines. 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.010
When the cracks appeared, the fire was burning at a depth of 6-12 meters. 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.150
And the hot air began to move and twist the asphalt surface.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.830
Cracks spread like a spider web. 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:37.110
This place is a great example of the underground fires' effect on Centralia.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.410
The road was closed in 1983. School buses drove along this road. 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.510
And I know that the children fell sick. 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.590
The accident occurred when the boy fell into the pit, into the hole that opened due to an underground fire. 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.760
The situation was very serious.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.460
My son and nephew were playing in the backyard of my mom's house. 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.470
And suddenly the earth has yawned and my son fell into the hole.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.410
Huge visible contour of gases rises above the ground. 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.410
Gases, that this hole contained, were tested. They were deadly.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.520
Emissions of deadly vapors currently continue.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.390
They threw heavy objects in the hole to check the depth. 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:26.850
There was no sound of impact with the bottom.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.860
Until now, the federal government does not pay attention to the problem of burning Centralia. 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.860
In view of the remaining reserves of coal, the fire will have been burning for another 250 years.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.270
The fire is everywhere.  

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.440
Government has accepted the fact that the town is burning. 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.840
And it's not possible to compel government to take any actions.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:57.450
Centralia. Town, that doesn't exist.
