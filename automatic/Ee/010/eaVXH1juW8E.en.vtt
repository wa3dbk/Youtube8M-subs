favorite robot masters of all time
unfortunately<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:16.830> don't<00:00:16.980> think<00:00:17.310> this<00:00:18.109> version

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
unfortunately I don't think this version

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.359 
unfortunately I don't think this version
of<00:00:19.199> this<00:00:19.320> stage<00:00:19.619> does<00:00:20.070> him<00:00:20.699> justice

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
of this stage does him justice

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.740 
of this stage does him justice
significantly<00:00:23.369> more<00:00:23.580> spike<00:00:24.060> traps<00:00:24.390> in<00:00:24.600> this

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
significantly more spike traps in this

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.359 
significantly more spike traps in this
level<00:00:25.080> though<00:00:25.199> you'll<00:00:25.500> find<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.890> console

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
level though you'll find in the console

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.479 
level though you'll find in the console
but<00:00:28.460> out<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.880> spring<00:00:30.660> enemies<00:00:31.019> but<00:00:31.949> nothing

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
but out and spring enemies but nothing

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.049 
but out and spring enemies but nothing
too<00:00:32.640> hard<00:00:33.410> the<00:00:34.410> music<00:00:34.800> was<00:00:34.980> definitely<00:00:35.040> not<00:00:35.820> as

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
too hard the music was definitely not as

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.139 
too hard the music was definitely not as
good<00:00:36.300> as<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.719> original<00:00:36.750> metal<00:00:37.380> man<00:00:37.530> theme<00:00:37.829> and

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
good as the original metal man theme and

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.660 
good as the original metal man theme and
that's<00:00:39.149> unfortunate<00:00:40.070> but<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.309> mean<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:41.610> is

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
that's unfortunate but I mean this is

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.220 
that's unfortunate but I mean this is
the<00:00:41.940> game<00:00:42.090> boy<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.420> can't<00:00:42.600> expect<00:00:42.899> too<00:00:43.050> much

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
the game boy you can't expect too much

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.920 
the game boy you can't expect too much
but<00:00:43.730> the<00:00:44.730> other<00:00:44.879> tracks<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.450> game<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.629> think

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
but the other tracks in the game I think

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.770 
but the other tracks in the game I think
are<00:00:46.020> much<00:00:46.200> better<00:00:46.379> than<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.770> one<00:00:47.780> here's

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
are much better than this one here's

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.479 
are much better than this one here's
they<00:00:49.140> made<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:49.469> section<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> bit<00:00:49.980> harder<00:00:50.340> by

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
they made this section a bit harder by

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.549 
they made this section a bit harder by
adding<00:00:51.050> much<00:00:52.050> more<00:00:52.379> difficult<00:00:52.649> jumps<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
adding much more difficult jumps to the

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.619 
adding much more difficult jumps to the
weight<00:00:55.559> section<00:00:56.190> their<00:00:56.699> metal<00:00:56.969> spike<00:00:57.329> wait

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
weight section their metal spike wait

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.529 
weight section their metal spike wait
things<00:00:58.050> whatever<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.829> supposed<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.250> be

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
things whatever it is supposed to be

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.349 
things whatever it is supposed to be
more<00:01:00.539> spike<00:01:00.899> traps<00:01:01.230> like<00:01:01.469> yes<00:01:01.649> Oh<00:01:02.180> in<00:01:03.180> these

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
more spike traps like yes Oh in these

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.200 
more spike traps like yes Oh in these
things<00:01:04.070> if<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.189> remember<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.760> console

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
things if you remember in the console

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.800 
things if you remember in the console
but<00:01:06.479> it's<00:01:06.659> more<00:01:06.900> like<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.939> horizontal<00:01:08.939> area<00:01:09.330> and

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
but it's more like a horizontal area and

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.289 
but it's more like a horizontal area and
this<00:01:10.200> one<00:01:10.409> they've<00:01:10.530> added<00:01:10.799> some<00:01:10.830> jumps<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:12.210> you

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
this one they've added some jumps so you

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.539 
this one they've added some jumps so you
have<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.510> use<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.659> bit<00:01:12.900> more<00:01:13.049> timing<00:01:13.590> but<00:01:13.740> at

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
have to use a bit more timing but at

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.550 
have to use a bit more timing but at
least<00:01:14.760> they<00:01:14.939> never<00:01:15.150> combine<00:01:15.600> these<00:01:15.869> things<00:01:16.350> to

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
least they never combine these things to

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.530 
least they never combine these things to
conveyor<00:01:16.890> belt<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.520> spike<00:01:17.820> weights<00:01:18.090> all

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
conveyor belt and the spike weights all

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.940 
conveyor belt and the spike weights all
together<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.140> mean<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.560> would<00:01:19.680> just<00:01:19.830> be<00:01:19.860> even

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.380 

think<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.159> many<00:01:26.340> hits<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.640> kill<00:01:26.729> these<00:01:27.090> things

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
think so many hits to kill these things

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.230 
think so many hits to kill these things
oh<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:28.350> lied<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.250> course<00:01:29.280> I'm<00:01:29.729> gonna<00:01:29.850> combine

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
oh I lied of course I'm gonna combine

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.560 
oh I lied of course I'm gonna combine
them<00:01:31.070> but<00:01:32.070> they<00:01:32.189> only<00:01:32.250> do<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.490> once<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.210> i've

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570

them but they only do it once and i've
already<00:01:33.689> got<00:01:33.900> through<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.170> because<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
already got through it because of the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.360 
already got through it because of the
awesome<00:01:35.130> slide<00:01:35.430> move<00:01:35.700> and

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.610 
close enough to over here so you can get
in<00:02:10.090> a<00:02:10.149> pop<00:02:10.360> up<00:02:10.570> and<00:02:10.810> shoot<00:02:11.050> him<00:02:11.200> otherwise

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
in a pop up and shoot him otherwise

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.460 
in a pop up and shoot him otherwise
you'll<00:02:12.720> slide<00:02:13.720> right<00:02:13.900> in<00:02:13.990> a<00:02:14.050> women<00:02:14.290> take

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
you'll slide right in a women take

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.190 
you'll slide right in a women take
damage<00:02:15.150> although<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:16.270> can<00:02:16.540> change<00:02:16.870> direction

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
damage although you can change direction

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.890 
damage although you can change direction
when<00:02:17.470> sliding<00:02:17.770> so<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:19.360> know<00:02:19.480> you<00:02:19.540> could<00:02:19.750> do

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
when sliding so you know you could do

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.420 
when sliding so you know you could do
different<00:02:20.260> techniques<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:20.980> of<00:02:21.070> course<00:02:21.280> I

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
different techniques and of course I

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.510 
different techniques and of course I
think<00:02:21.610> I<00:02:21.670> screwed<00:02:21.940> this<00:02:22.180> up<00:02:23.190> maybe<00:02:24.190> I<00:02:24.220> didn't

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
think I screwed this up maybe I didn't

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.350 
think I screwed this up maybe I didn't
nope<00:02:24.850> there<00:02:25.300> we<00:02:25.390> go<00:02:25.510> oops<00:02:26.940> didn't<00:02:27.940> respond<00:02:28.330> to

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
nope there we go oops didn't respond to

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.660 
nope there we go oops didn't respond to
my<00:02:28.510> jump<00:02:28.780> there<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.860> here's<00:02:33.100> what<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.460> rush

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
my jump there and here's what the rush

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.510 
my jump there and here's what the rush
coil<00:02:34.210> is<00:02:34.360> going<00:02:34.540> to<00:02:34.600> be<00:02:34.660> put<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:34.930> use<00:02:35.110> I<00:02:35.520> could

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
coil is going to be put to use I could

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.400 
coil is going to be put to use I could
have<00:02:36.640> just<00:02:37.210> as<00:02:37.330> easily<00:02:37.360> used<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.930> rush<00:02:38.110> jet

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
have just as easily used the rush jet

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.350 
have just as easily used the rush jet
but<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:38.710> want<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.010> use<00:02:39.160> all<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.460> powers<00:02:39.820> on<00:02:40.060> each

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
but I want to use all the powers on each

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.670 
but I want to use all the powers on each
stage<00:02:40.630> so<00:02:41.290> well<00:02:43.200> where<00:02:44.200> they're<00:02:44.350> useful

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
stage so well where they're useful

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.620 
stage so well where they're useful
anyway<00:02:45.220> and<00:02:45.580> we'll<00:02:45.880> be<00:02:46.000> putting<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.330> different

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
anyway and we'll be putting a different

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.390 
anyway and we'll be putting a different
one<00:02:46.720> of<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.930> use<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.830> use<00:02:47.980> in<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.190> next

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
one of the use and to use in the next

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.740 
one of the use and to use in the next
stage<00:02:48.550> so<00:02:50.790> get<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.940> that<00:02:52.030> part<00:02:52.270> when<00:02:52.390> we<00:02:52.480> get<00:02:52.630> to

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
stage so get to that part when we get to

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:00.399 
stage so get to that part when we get to
it<00:02:52.780> anyway

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:00.409 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:05.080 

think<00:03:01.409> we're<00:03:01.500> already<00:03:01.620> near<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:01.980> end<00:03:03.650> we<00:03:04.650> are

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
think we're already near the end we are

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.089 
think we're already near the end we are
now<00:03:06.090> get<00:03:06.329> my<00:03:06.480> clash<00:03:06.720> bombs<00:03:07.019> ready<00:03:07.260> these<00:03:07.500> metal

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
man is weak to clash bombs but kids will

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.199 
man is weak to clash bombs but kids will
see<00:03:12.420> it's<00:03:12.569> very<00:03:12.989> hard<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.349> hit<00:03:13.470> him<00:03:14.209> flash

quick<00:03:17.129> with<00:03:17.250> his<00:03:17.400> jumps<00:03:17.849> I<00:03:19.400> really<00:03:20.400> could<00:03:20.549> just

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
quick with his jumps I really could just

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.280 
quick with his jumps I really could just
use<00:03:20.819> my<00:03:21.060> regular<00:03:21.269> gun<00:03:21.659> but<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:21.930> know<00:03:22.110> I

figured I should we show this off and

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.319 
figured I should we show this off and

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
only attack when you attack but he seems

last<00:03:42.359> time<00:03:42.510> I<00:03:42.629> had<00:03:42.780> him<00:03:42.870> in<00:03:42.959> a<00:03:43.049> locked<00:03:43.500> in<00:03:43.680> a

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
last time I had him in a locked in a

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.879 
last time I had him in a locked in a
pattern<00:03:44.040> I<00:03:44.340> couldn't<00:03:44.670> do<00:03:44.760> it<00:03:44.879> this<00:03:45.000> time<00:03:45.060> but

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
pattern I couldn't do it this time but

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:48.319 
pattern I couldn't do it this time but
you<00:03:46.889> see<00:03:47.040> how<00:03:47.159> much<00:03:47.340> energy<00:03:47.670> that<00:03:47.819> took<00:03:48.150> off

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
you see how much energy that took off

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.050 
you see how much energy that took off
but<00:03:48.540> you<00:03:48.599> only<00:03:48.780> get<00:03:49.109> I<00:03:49.379> think<00:03:50.010> three<00:03:50.609> or<00:03:50.639> four

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
but you only get I think three or four

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.289 
but you only get I think three or four
