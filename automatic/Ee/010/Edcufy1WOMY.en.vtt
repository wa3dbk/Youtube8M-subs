real hard freeze for Mickey lights as a
great<00:01:06.850> insulating<00:01:07.690> value<00:01:07.720> so<00:01:08.590> it<00:01:08.710> keeps<00:01:08.920> the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
great insulating value so it keeps the

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.130 
great insulating value so it keeps the
temperature<00:01:09.190> even<00:01:10.149> in<00:01:10.450> that<00:01:10.690> box
