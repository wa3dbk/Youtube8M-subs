00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.950
 hello everyone it's fat today we 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:20.210
 Consider a gainer from the company vp lab most 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:23.539
 builder this pack weighs 5 kilograms 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:27.359
 now take half is not enough 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:31.940
 the cost of this package is from two thousand 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:36.690
 three hundred rubles to two thousand 600 rubles 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.590
 let chocolate in two-dimensional spoons 1 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.530
 measuring spoon 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.920
 100 grams looks like this two-dimensional 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.379
 spoons contain 59 grams of protein 3 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.780
 gram of creatine 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:55.160
 vitamins and 2 and 1024 calories 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:59.219
 he has a pretty disgusting taste 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.530
 so I advise you to add to the gainer itself 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.330
 cocoa is stirred in principle 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.119
 not bad but the first time when I parted it 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:12.570
 there were some lumps but after i 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.369
 I read on the pack that it is not lumps 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.020
 a diluted geyner and pieces of chocolate 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.380
 which gave a very negative effect 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.880
 at the first reception 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.110
 after the first reception I wanted to burp 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.820
 dissolves in principle well now we 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:37.250
 this will demonstrate 1 portion is 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:41.900
 1 measuring spoon that is 100 grams but I 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.900
 put a half measuring spoons 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:54.119
 makes 150 grams add cocoa for 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:58.170
 taste improvements to add too somewhere 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.170
 two three teaspoons 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.940
 we will not move out 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.610
 he is well stirred after 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.580
 a few 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:27.530
 take it nail the same consistency 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:32.200
 homogeneous but its taste is not ice i am 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:36.730
 I drink two servings, that is, 300 grams 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.730
 per place recommended 100 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.820
 after he stands 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:47.450
 his consistency becomes some kind 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:58.010
 jelly and so I advise you to kill right away 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:03:00.640
 after breeding cash station 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:05.480
 homogeneous but we see some lumps 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:09.200

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.830

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.830
 with regular meals 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.250
