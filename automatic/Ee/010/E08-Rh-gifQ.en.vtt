 after the studies were overturned 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.400

 first decade only the sibyl at 50 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.119
 million ati will have two tracks 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.730
 being in the eastern part of the city 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.890
 of mexico are approximately 12 thousand 500

 of 4 thousand 600 sectors 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.700
 ensures that the infrastructure considers 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.250
 as the most important of the time 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.739
 contemporary and here this has been 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.629
 raised from the garage approximately 20 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.120
 years and until this moment is 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.309
 crystallizing a paradigm shift without 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.549
 doubt this is an indispensable project 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.090
 to ensure the growth of 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.840

 that makes an increase 

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:47.700
 also to the most beautiful projects 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.520
 data will actually reflect what 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.920

 a sculpture that stretches and flies and 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.780
 opens the way in its genre we are 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.520
 talking about a work that will not only be 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.010
