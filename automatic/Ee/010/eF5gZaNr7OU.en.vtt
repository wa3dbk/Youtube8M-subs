00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
the leucadendron sir are pretty showy

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.209 
the leucadendron sir are pretty showy
and<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.489> them<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:39.000> their<00:00:39.300> own<00:00:39.450> right<00:00:39.860> so<00:00:40.860> here

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
and in them in their own right so here

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.360 
and in them in their own right so here
is<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.370> mature<00:00:41.879> plant<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.680> Monterey

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
is a mature plant that is in Monterey

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.779 
is a mature plant that is in Monterey
and<00:00:44.840> I'm<00:00:45.840> actually<00:00:46.020> Pacific<00:00:46.770> Grove<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.399> it's<00:00:47.579> a

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
and I'm actually Pacific Grove so it's a

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.900 
and I'm actually Pacific Grove so it's a
coastal<00:00:48.300> condition<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.890> does<00:00:50.190> not<00:00:50.399> freeze

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
coastal condition it does not freeze

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.950 
coastal condition it does not freeze
here<00:00:51.449> or<00:00:51.660> very<00:00:51.960> rarely<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:53.180> this<00:00:54.180> plant<00:00:54.600> is

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
here or very rarely and this plant is

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.889 
here or very rarely and this plant is
probably<00:00:55.320> seven<00:00:56.129> feet<00:00:56.430> tall<00:00:56.460> plus<00:00:57.270> or<00:00:57.480> minus

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
probably seven feet tall plus or minus

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.380 
probably seven feet tall plus or minus
and<00:00:58.250> another<00:01:00.469> five<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:02.039> seven<00:01:02.430> feet<00:01:02.640> wide<00:01:02.699> I

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
and another five to seven feet wide I

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.660 
and another five to seven feet wide I
actually<00:01:04.080> think<00:01:04.530> there's<00:01:04.830> two<00:01:05.070> plants<00:01:05.400> in

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
actually think there's two plants in

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.719 
actually think there's two plants in
this<00:01:05.850> grouping<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:07.070> so<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.159> can<00:01:08.400> see<00:01:08.610> it's

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
this grouping and so you can see it's

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.000 
this grouping and so you can see it's
got<00:01:08.939> kind<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.360> nice<00:01:09.540> dense<00:01:09.930> growth<00:01:10.470> habit

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
got kind of a nice dense growth habit

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.820 
got kind of a nice dense growth habit
and<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.729> lot<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.210> visual<00:01:12.630> interest<00:01:13.110> which

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
and a lot of visual interest which

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.830 
and a lot of visual interest which
varies<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.299> taken<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.840> mid-april<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:17.840> it

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
varies this is taken in mid-april and it

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.830 
varies this is taken in mid-april and it
it<00:01:19.740> gets<00:01:20.130> stronger<00:01:20.610> at<00:01:20.939> certain<00:01:21.299> times<00:01:21.600> of

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
it gets stronger at certain times of

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.920 
it gets stronger at certain times of
year<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:24.000> know<00:01:24.119> what<00:01:24.509> I've<00:01:24.630> read<00:01:24.869> about

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
year the you know what I've read about

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.819 
year the you know what I've read about
it<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.799> blooms<00:01:27.110> strongly<00:01:28.110> during<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
it is this blooms strongly during the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.700 
it is this blooms strongly during the
winter<00:01:29.640> but<00:01:30.329> we're<00:01:30.840> coming<00:01:31.170> out<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.500> winter

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
winter but we're coming out of winter

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.789 
winter but we're coming out of winter
when<00:01:32.100> I'm<00:01:32.250> taking<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.850> photo<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:34.110> still

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
when I'm taking this photo and still

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.069 
when I'm taking this photo and still
have<00:01:35.040> plenty<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.549> strong<00:01:36.000> red<00:01:36.420> color<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:37.020> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
have plenty of strong red color in the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.190 
have plenty of strong red color in the
newer<00:01:37.740> growth<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.579> on<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.270> Brax<00:01:39.540> around<00:01:40.079> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
newer growth and on the Brax around the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.190 
newer growth and on the Brax around the
flowers<00:01:40.650> then<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:42.119> nice<00:01:42.329> thing<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.930> is

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
flowers then so the nice thing is is

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.440 
flowers then so the nice thing is is
that<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.560> visual<00:01:44.159> interest<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.820> last<00:01:45.090> for<00:01:45.420> a

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
that this visual interest to last for a

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.230 
that this visual interest to last for a
very<00:01:45.540> long<00:01:45.930> part<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.680> year<00:01:47.040> many<00:01:47.729> months

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
very long part of the year many months

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.109 
very long part of the year many months
and<00:01:48.450> just<00:01:49.259> depending<00:01:49.799> on<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.520> think<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
and just depending on I think the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.899 
and just depending on I think the
weather<00:01:51.329> pattern<00:01:51.930> largely<00:01:52.490> also<00:01:53.490> these<00:01:53.850> are

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
weather pattern largely also these are

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.649 
weather pattern largely also these are
very<00:01:54.420> drought<00:01:54.750> tolerant<00:01:55.280> and<00:01:56.360> they're<00:01:57.360> quick

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
very drought tolerant and they're quick

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.230 
very drought tolerant and they're quick
growing<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.439> watched<00:01:59.009> this<00:01:59.310> one<00:01:59.549> grow<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.909> this

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
growing I watched this one grow to this

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.630 
growing I watched this one grow to this
full-size<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:01.229> about<00:02:01.500> two<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.860> three<00:02:02.040> years

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
full-size in about two to three years

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.700 
full-size in about two to three years
and<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.329> plant<00:02:03.570> you're<00:02:03.719> looking<00:02:04.079> at<00:02:04.229> now<00:02:04.469> is

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
and the plant you're looking at now is

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.510 
and the plant you're looking at now is
probably<00:02:04.979> about<00:02:05.250> six<00:02:05.700> years<00:02:05.939> old<00:02:07.520> also

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
probably about six years old also

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.999 
probably about six years old also
there's<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.030> strong<00:02:09.539> deer<00:02:10.050> issue<00:02:10.319> in<00:02:10.800> this

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
there's a strong deer issue in this

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.340 
there's a strong deer issue in this
particular<00:02:11.610> spot<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:12.840> the

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
particular spot so the

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.650 
particular spot so the
do<00:02:13.710> not<00:02:13.950> eat<00:02:14.130> this<00:02:14.370> plant<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:15.120> don't<00:02:15.330> know<00:02:15.540> if

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
do not eat this plant I don't know if

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.660 
do not eat this plant I don't know if
it's<00:02:15.840> poisonous<00:02:16.110> but<00:02:16.770> I<00:02:16.890> do<00:02:16.950> know<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.520> the

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
it's poisonous but I do know that the

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.700 
it's poisonous but I do know that the
deer<00:02:17.910> leave<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.300> alone<00:02:18.570> it's<00:02:19.140> also<00:02:19.290> very

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
deer leave it alone it's also very

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.710 
deer leave it alone it's also very
drought<00:02:20.130> tolerant<00:02:20.160> this<00:02:20.940> is<00:02:21.120> being<00:02:21.360> grown<00:02:21.690> in

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
drought tolerant this is being grown in

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.240 
drought tolerant this is being grown in
very<00:02:22.260> sandy<00:02:22.830> soil<00:02:22.860> as<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.580> said<00:02:24.030> near<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.480> coast

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
very sandy soil as I said near the coast

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.470 
very sandy soil as I said near the coast
so<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.460> says<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.970> lot<00:02:27.210> of<00:02:27.240> the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
so it says that a lot of the

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.710 
so it says that a lot of the
leucadendron<00:02:28.020> Czar<00:02:28.620> Hardy<00:02:29.250> down<00:02:29.490> to<00:02:29.790> about<00:02:30.000> 25

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
leucadendron Czar Hardy down to about 25

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.910 
leucadendron Czar Hardy down to about 25
degrees<00:02:32.150> Fahrenheit<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:34.110> varies<00:02:34.620> by

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
degrees Fahrenheit and that varies by

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.980 
degrees Fahrenheit and that varies by
the<00:02:35.400> variety<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.770> so<00:02:38.000> I'm<00:02:39.000> not<00:02:39.210> sure<00:02:39.270> on<00:02:39.750> these

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
the variety and so I'm not sure on these

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.260 
the variety and so I'm not sure on these
again<00:02:40.440> because<00:02:40.500> it's<00:02:41.130> in<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.520> Pacific<00:02:42.030> Grove

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
again because it's in the Pacific Grove

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.260 
again because it's in the Pacific Grove
area<00:02:42.570> I<00:02:42.960> know<00:02:43.020> that<00:02:43.500> frost<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.640> very<00:02:44.940> rare

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
area I know that frost is a very rare

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.120 
area I know that frost is a very rare
event<00:02:45.480> down<00:02:45.930> there<00:02:46.230> but<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.470> do<00:02:46.620> know<00:02:46.920> they've

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
event down there but I do know they've

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.850 
event down there but I do know they've
had<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.670> couple<00:02:47.880> of<00:02:48.090> times<00:02:48.420> during<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.680> life

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
had it a couple of times during the life

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.790 
had it a couple of times during the life
of<00:02:50.070> this<00:02:50.250> plant<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:50.820> it<00:02:50.970> was<00:02:51.090> been<00:02:51.330> fine

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
of this plant and it was been fine

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.490 
of this plant and it was been fine
so<00:02:53.370> for<00:02:53.700> me<00:02:53.850> these<00:02:54.120> in<00:02:54.450> design<00:02:54.930> these<00:02:55.260> are<00:02:55.470> a

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
so for me these in design these are a

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.300 
so for me these in design these are a
specimen<00:02:56.310> type<00:02:56.670> of<00:02:56.970> shrub<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:58.290> size<00:02:58.590> along

pride of Madera also lava tara bicolor

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.030 
pride of Madera also lava tara bicolor
would<00:03:15.390> look<00:03:15.540> really<00:03:15.750> nice<00:03:16.050> next<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.560> this<00:03:16.770> with

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
would look really nice next to this with

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.950 
would look really nice next to this with

a very drought tolerant once established

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.230 
a very drought tolerant once established
need<00:03:25.050> little<00:03:25.350> or<00:03:25.590> knows<00:03:25.860> summer<00:03:26.610> or<00:03:27.000> spring

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
need little or knows summer or spring

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.550 
need little or knows summer or spring
water<00:03:28.340> so<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.790> would<00:03:30.240> say<00:03:30.450> establish<00:03:31.080> these<00:03:31.290> on

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
water so I would say establish these on

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.790 
water so I would say establish these on
drip<00:03:31.830> irrigation<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:33.440> given<00:03:34.440> where<00:03:34.590> they

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
drip irrigation and given where they

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.530 
drip irrigation and given where they
come<00:03:35.070> from<00:03:35.100> they<00:03:35.580> really<00:03:35.910> don't<00:03:36.120> need<00:03:36.270> a<00:03:36.330> lot

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
come from they really don't need a lot

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.660 
come from they really don't need a lot
of<00:03:36.720> moisture<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:37.260> they're<00:03:37.710> very<00:03:38.010> easy<00:03:38.250> plant

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
of moisture and they're very easy plant

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.900 
of moisture and they're very easy plant
to<00:03:38.790> grow<00:03:39.860> also<00:03:40.860> what<00:03:41.070> I<00:03:41.100> read<00:03:41.400> about<00:03:41.550> them

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
to grow also what I read about them

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.730 
to grow also what I read about them
though<00:03:42.120> is<00:03:42.300> that<00:03:42.480> they're<00:03:42.660> fairly<00:03:42.990> short<00:03:43.470> live

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
though is that they're fairly short live

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.630 
though is that they're fairly short live
plants<00:03:44.370> maybe<00:03:44.640> seven<00:03:45.210> to<00:03:45.240> ten<00:03:45.690> years<00:03:46.110> and<00:03:46.640> much

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
plants maybe seven to ten years and much

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.420 
plants maybe seven to ten years and much
like<00:03:47.940> Cistus<00:03:48.600> or<00:03:48.840> rock<00:03:49.080> Rose<00:03:49.410> some<00:03:50.220> of<00:03:50.340> these

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
like Cistus or rock Rose some of these

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.700 
like Cistus or rock Rose some of these
other<00:03:50.730> shorter<00:03:51.240> live<00:03:51.420> plants<00:03:51.930> that<00:03:52.140> are<00:03:52.290> drier

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
other shorter live plants that are drier

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.220 
other shorter live plants that are drier
in<00:03:53.010> nature<00:03:53.430> I<00:03:53.700> find<00:03:54.450> that<00:03:54.630> if<00:03:54.780> you<00:03:54.930> start

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
in nature I find that if you start

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.350 
in nature I find that if you start
watering<00:03:55.590> and<00:03:55.980> fertilizing<00:03:56.580> them<00:03:57.060> you

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
watering and fertilizing them you

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.080 
watering and fertilizing them you
shorten<00:03:57.840> that<00:03:58.020> even<00:03:58.350> more<00:03:58.680> so<00:03:59.070> I<00:03:59.340> would<00:03:59.850> say

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
shorten that even more so I would say

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.940 
shorten that even more so I would say
kind<00:04:00.390> of<00:04:00.570> be<00:04:01.380> stingy<00:04:02.370> with<00:04:03.260> with<00:04:04.260> water<00:04:04.650> as

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
kind of be stingy with with water as

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.760 
kind of be stingy with with water as
well<00:04:05.220> as<00:04:05.660> fertilizing<00:04:06.660> if<00:04:06.810> you<00:04:06.960> fertilize<00:04:07.320> at

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
well as fertilizing if you fertilize at

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.250 
well as fertilizing if you fertilize at
all<00:04:08.030> so<00:04:09.030> that's<00:04:09.240> what<00:04:09.450> I<00:04:09.480> can<00:04:09.780> tell<00:04:10.020> you<00:04:10.080> about

all so that's what I can tell you about
