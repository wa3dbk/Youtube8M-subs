00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 girls hello everyone today i want with 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.790
 you talk about your new care 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.919
 face 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.620
 I recently have a problem with 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.920
 skin she became very sensitive 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.740
 constantly blushing and constantly 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.630
 irritation and Jeanne severely dry 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.210
 This cosmetics which enjoyed 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.210
 earlier she just does not suit me now 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.970
 and it all started from the moment i 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.920
 I tried cosmetics clinics remember I 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.099
 told you about their miniature 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.130
 who bought specifically for the sample but 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.020
 they didn't suit me 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.960
 skin problems after i 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.660
 ceased to use it and my skin 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.230
 did not look better for very long 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.309
 thought about what her new care 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.199
 buy what brand and I came to the conclusion 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.520
 talked to my mom on me 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.940
 recommended 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.609
 pharmacy cosmetics care she is also her 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.609
 what means also uses 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.250
 I made conclusions and decided to try 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.250
 pharmacy cosmetics me more to her 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.100
 trust because it was developed 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.110
 french doctors this makeup 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.610
 bioderma 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.729
 bought in general wanted to order through 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.200
 Internet read 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.479
 different lines that they have for 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.580
 different skin types and wanted to order 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.580
 via the internet because it's a little bit 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.770
 cheaper but then I thought that better i 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.409
 I go to the drugstore better specialist 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.070
 looking at my skin and saying and advising 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.460
 I would rather buy for 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.810
 so that my skin improves and the first 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.540
 what i got 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.700
 this is mydermal water bioderma for 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.310
 sensitive skin I first bought here 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.799
 here is such a small bottle to me 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.799
 almost over and then I went 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.710
 in the same pharmacy and bought there and two 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.710
 bottles they just went at a discount here 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.680
 500 milliliters and 250 milliliters here 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.790
 these two jars cost 22 euros this 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.129
 water perfectly clean your face from makeup 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.370
 also waterproof makeup 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:14.880
 it's great for fragile 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.590
 very delicate dry skin prone to 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.410
 the redness that I have at the moment 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.750
 I use this tool both in the morning and 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.830
 in the evening and still cool that its not 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.830
 need to flush 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.350
 I do not feel any stickiness 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.000
 no and tightness that is some water 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.640
 I had a great 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.010
 micellar water from garnier and i want 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.170
 say that after all there is a difference and 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.630
 this case hits the shit more 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.070
 I like it rather than garnier 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:47.530
 acquire a new face wash and not 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:50.290
 the pharmacy advised cleansing gel 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.400
 sibiu for normal mixed either 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.350
 oily skin 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.540
 I was surprised when I would be recommended 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.780
 woe so i have the same skin 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.300
 fat and what was my boyfriend there was 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.220
 boy and said your skin is not dry 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.390
 you have normal mixed and plus skin 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.420
 sensitively he says what exactly is this 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.300
 gel is suitable for problem skin for 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.510
 sensitive skin for skin which 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.580
 prone to dryness this gel is perfect 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.100
 suitable for washing him trusted 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.620
 bought this gel and you know not a little bit 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.440
 I regret because after it the skin is not 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.340
 I feel that my skin 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.620
 pure and this feeling is indescribable i 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.520
 still such purity a mustache she faces and not 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.220
 felt 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.380
 how many different helium used here 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.710
 I like this one at the moment 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.650
 then most of all he is very fast 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.560
 and gently cleanse the skin do not cause dryness 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.240
 and it is a huge plus as this 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.160
 does not contain 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.770
 And I also liked that this gel is not 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.070
 It irritates the eyes that is the eye 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.730
 if it gets a foam from this sink in 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.180
 the eye is not irritated 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.580
 that's great because when i 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.069
 I wash and sometimes I wash off make-up is 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.049
 this gel and I need it well 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.849
 Rinse 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:14.940
 cilia and when the gel get there 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:18.150
 eyes do not tear do not pinch 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:21.139
 then we went to the choice of cream chosen 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.120
 for me cream sensible light for 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:27.150
 normal and combined and 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.820
 sensitive skin told me that 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.940
 better light because if we 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.330
 I chose a cream fatter then with 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:39.169
 at the time appeared to me that acne 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.520
 the cream has anti-inflammatory and 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.710
 moisturizing properties also 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.190
 restores the protective layer of the skin 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.050
 makes it more resistant to effects 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.940
 external environment and then I thought that 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:55.080
 need some extra 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:57.449
 nutrition for the face and so I said that 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:02.430
 I want to get some kind of mask to 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:04.800
 1 time in 2 times a week put it on 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.380
 skin so that the skin feeds on and and me 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.570
 advised mask hydrabio 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.150
 This mask is designed for deep 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:16.650
 intense moisturizing as all the same 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:18.900
 my skin has dryness and this mask is for me 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.930
 said excellent to 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.880
 additionally moisturize the skin as this 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.599
 product helps to normalize processes 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.419
 natural skin moisturizing 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:32.400
 recommend using it at first 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:35.669
 every day and then when you see 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:39.150
 use twice the result 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:42.380
 week I use and about three times in 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:45.560
 week and I honestly have already seen 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.780
 tremendous effect and I'll show you now 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.880
 photos before use and photos 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:54.450
 I already use after use 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:58.860
 about three weeks with this makeup and i 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:06:02.130
 just insanely happy to see improvements on 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.500
 I was given a couple of probes on my face 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:07.710
 Dafa remedies are soothing. 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.169
 anti redness serum french 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.900
 again same 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:15.330
 I tried two sampler companies and 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:18.750
 and honestly I liked it and I 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:21.479
 I am thinking of buying a jar of this one 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.820
 serum because I noticed the difference 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:27.210

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:30.300
