00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.570
 so we do not have any channel video 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:22.619
 and to kill it it is connected with 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:24.810
 minimum torches and with it connects with 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.279
 This torch carries his life. 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.599
