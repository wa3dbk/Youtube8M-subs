00:00:00.163 --> 00:00:02.208
 Depending on the examples put forward in the last presentation 

00:00:02.208 --> 00:00:07.764
 Let's see if we can get the rules to find important numbers 

00:00:07.764 --> 00:00:08.957
 Or number of important houses 

00:00:08.957 --> 00:00:11.912
 In the number - or measurement 

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:16.834
 If the first thing is clear, it is non-zero numbers 

00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:19.574
 Or it can be zero if it is within the same number 

00:00:19.574 --> 00:00:24.375
 In fact, 7 and 5 are important numbers in addition to the zeros between them 

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:37.763
 So let us write this here: any number other than zero and expiation between the numbers 

00:00:37.763 --> 00:00:43.677
 The numbers will be significant. This is direct 

00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:49.436
 Now the zeros that do not fall between the non-zero numbers, will be a little annoying 

00:00:49.436 --> 00:00:52.315
 So let's make sure we can get some of them out 

00:00:52.315 --> 00:00:56.542
 We can always delete - when you think of important numbers - 

00:00:56.542 --> 00:00:57.875
 Front zeros 

00:00:57.875 --> 00:01:00.169
 When I say zeros in front, I mean those zeros 

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:03.507
 Which comes immediately before the non-zero number 

00:01:03.507 --> 00:01:06.897
 If these zeros are forward, here it is 

00:01:06.897 --> 00:01:11.169
 There are no zeros in front here, there are no zeros in this, neither, nor that 

00:01:11.169 --> 00:01:15.349
 But in any case, the front zeros are not important 

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:25.429
 If not important 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:30.907
 The last question, I mean, is that we have non-zero houses only 

00:01:30.907 --> 00:01:33.044
 And the expanse between these houses; we could have some zeros from the front 

00:01:33.044 --> 00:01:34.668
 Which as I said is not important 

00:01:34.668 --> 00:01:39.637
 So the only thing we have to determine is what we will do with these zeros 

00:01:39.637 --> 00:01:46.510
 The zero is positioned behind the last non-zero position, or on the right of the last non-zero position 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.665
 If these zeros are forward here, we have two zero forward here 

00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:54.406
 And three zeros ahead here 

00:01:54.406 --> 00:02:01.502
 So let me do ... if the zeros are in front 

00:02:01.502 --> 00:02:02.669
 What will we do with them? 

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:05.643
 The simplest way to think about it, if we have a decimal separator 

00:02:05.643 --> 00:02:10.009
 If there is a decimal separator anywhere in the number, we have to do it after them 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.581
 If there is a decimal point, we consider them important houses 

00:02:15.581 --> 00:02:20.597
 We consider them important houses 

00:02:20.597 --> 00:02:25.659
 If we do not have a decimal separator 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.563
 So there will be some mystery 

00:02:27.563 --> 00:02:29.978
 You will not be sure in this case 

00:02:29.978 --> 00:02:33.662
 So here in this issue we have a decimal point 

00:02:33.662 --> 00:02:37.269
 If we do after zeros in front - this method adds accuracy in the calculation 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.984
 We have a decimal separator here, if we do after zeros front 

00:02:40.984 --> 00:02:43.260
 We have a decimal separator here, if we do after zeros front 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.349
 There are no zeros forward here 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.669
 Here, I will make a decimal point later 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:54.312
 We will count here, if we have a decimal point, we will count all five 

00:02:54.312 --> 00:02:59.978
 If we do not have a decimal point, ie if we only have 37,000, this is 

00:02:59.978 --> 00:03:04.343
 It is considered vague, if no information is given 

00:03:04.343 --> 00:03:08.987
 You will assume that the number is close to the nearest thousand 

00:03:08.987 --> 00:03:11.210
 That is, this unit of measurement is not the actual value 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.586
 But was rounded to 37,000 

00:03:13.586 --> 00:03:16.510
 If there is no decimal point, let me write in this way 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:23.662
 This is a glade, which means we are not sure exactly what it means 

00:03:23.662 --> 00:03:27.333
 That is, it is unclear, perhaps it is better for you to 

00:03:27.333 --> 00:03:35.644
 Do not follow the front zeros 

00:03:35.644 --> 00:03:38.568
 If you want to measure something 

00:03:38.568 --> 00:03:43.260
 So you have to put a decimal point at the end of the number, so 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.862
 There is a specific term for this: 

00:03:46.862 --> 00:03:49.669
 Let's say you measured - let me solve a different number 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:53.848
 Suppose it is 56,000 

00:03:53.848 --> 00:03:59.003
 The phrase specified here is that 6 is undoubtedly the last status of value 

00:03:59.003 --> 00:04:01.975
 Sometimes you will see a line above the 6 

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:04.576
 Sometimes you will see a subject line above the 6 

00:04:04.576 --> 00:04:07.642
 This can be useful, because perhaps, it will be 

00:04:07.642 --> 00:04:09.671
 The last position of value is zero 

00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:13.492
 Perhaps you will be able to accurately up to 100 

00:04:13.492 --> 00:04:16.511
 So you write something like that 

00:04:16.511 --> 00:04:19.901
 56,000 

00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:22.641
 But then you will put a line above that zero 

00:04:22.641 --> 00:04:26.681
 Or a line under that zero and say it is another status of value 

00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:30.582
 If you see something like that, you'll say there are 3 valuable homes 

00:04:30.582 --> 00:04:35.646
 This is not much used. But the best way is to make it clear that you've yet 

00:04:35.646 --> 00:04:40.012
 Up to 3 houses of value, are to be written in scientific form 

00:04:40.012 --> 00:04:41.187
 There is a full presentation on this subject 

00:04:41.187 --> 00:04:43.167
 But until you write this in scientific form 

00:04:43.167 --> 00:04:51.637
 You can type it like 5.60 x 10 ^ 4, is not it? 

00:04:51.637 --> 00:04:55.335
 Because if you hit this B 10 ^ 4 

00:04:55.335 --> 00:04:57.054
 The decimal point will move four houses 

00:04:57.054 --> 00:04:59.003
 You get 56,000 

00:04:59.003 --> 00:05:02.000
 If 5.60 Ã— 10 ^ 4 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.124
 And if this confuses you 

00:05:03.124 --> 00:05:05.319
 I advise you to see the scientific version 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:06.991
 I hope he will make things clearer 

00:05:06.991 --> 00:05:10.010
 But when you write a number in scientific form 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.426
 Your answer will be more accurate 

00:05:12.426 --> 00:05:14.400
 You'll know how many houses you value 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.054
 Instead of doing this formula it is rather old 

00:05:17.054 --> 00:05:18.601
 Where I no longer see them being used too much 

00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:21.666
 With these lines located below or above the highest importance 

00:05:21.666 --> 00:05:23.988
 Instead of representing it with a decimal point 

00:05:23.988 --> 00:05:26.018
 Using the scientific formula 

00:05:26.018 --> 00:05:31.000
 Obviously we have 3 valuable homes 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.976
 I hope this will help you 

00:05:31.976 --> 00:05:33.133
 And in upcoming performances 

00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:36.109
 I will explain why important homes are important 

00:05:36.109 --> 99:59:59.999
 Especially when you perform calculations on several metrics
