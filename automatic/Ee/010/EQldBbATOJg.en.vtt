00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
question

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.290 
question
so<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.680> get<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.860> walk<00:00:53.010> up<00:00:53.220> from<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.490> G<00:00:53.640> minor

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.139 

and<00:00:57.989> before<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.379> even<00:00:58.530> hit<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.950> D<00:00:59.219> use<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
and before you even hit that D use the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.810 
and before you even hit that D use the
e-flat<00:01:00.480> F<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.110> G<00:01:01.290> to<00:01:02.100> get<00:01:02.220> up<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.520> point

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
e-flat F and G to get up to that point

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.329 
e-flat F and G to get up to that point
so<00:01:03.270> that's<00:01:03.450> one<00:01:03.809> two<00:01:04.080> three<00:01:04.440> four<00:01:04.710> five<00:01:05.040> six

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
so that's one two three four five six

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.980 
so that's one two three four five six
one<00:01:05.489> two<00:01:05.700> three<00:01:06.270> four<00:01:06.630> five<00:01:06.930> six<00:01:08.840> you'll<00:01:09.840> get

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
one two three four five six you'll get

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.290 
one two three four five six you'll get
some<00:01:10.110> great<00:01:10.229> ideas<00:01:10.380> for<00:01:10.800> note<00:01:11.100> choice<00:01:11.400> where

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
some great ideas for note choice where

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.520 
some great ideas for note choice where
and<00:01:12.450> when<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.690> use<00:01:12.840> more<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.260> fret<00:01:13.500> board

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
and when to use more of the fret board

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.950 
and when to use more of the fret board
and<00:01:13.950> learn<00:01:14.610> how<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.820> incorporate<00:01:15.150> heavyweight

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
and learn how to incorporate heavyweight

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.440 
and learn how to incorporate heavyweight

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.929 
again using v the D to get from G to G
and<00:01:39.100> then<00:01:40.100> a<00:01:40.159> drop<00:01:40.369> down<00:01:40.520> to<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.819> F<00:01:40.909> sharp

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
and then a drop down to the F sharp

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.270 
and then a drop down to the F sharp
which<00:01:41.719> again<00:01:41.960> is<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.170> fifth<00:01:42.560> of<00:01:42.829> the<00:01:43.130> new

thirds to form licks and in the last
little<00:01:48.469> gap<00:01:48.740> actually<00:01:48.950> fretted<00:01:49.549> something

little gap actually fretted something

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.870 
little gap actually fretted something
which<00:01:50.630> is<00:01:50.750> more<00:01:50.869> like<00:01:51.020> a<00:01:51.049> sort<00:01:51.409> of<00:01:51.439> a<00:01:51.579> G<00:01:52.579> and

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
which is more like a sort of a G and

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.539 
which is more like a sort of a G and
then<00:01:52.969> a<00:01:53.500> it's<00:01:54.500> almost<00:01:54.799> sort<00:01:54.920> of<00:01:55.009> quite<00:01:55.189> funky

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
then a it's almost sort of quite funky

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.569 
then a it's almost sort of quite funky
thing<00:01:55.729> on<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:55.969> C<00:01:56.209> sliding<00:01:57.049> up<00:01:57.109> to<00:01:57.140> a<00:01:57.259> C<00:01:57.469> sharp
