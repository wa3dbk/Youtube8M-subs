00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.410 
in this video I'm going to be talking
about<00:00:08.250> binary<00:00:08.880> fission<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.830> mitosis<00:00:11.420> despite

about binary fission and mitosis despite

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.720 
about binary fission and mitosis despite
the<00:00:12.660> differences<00:00:13.110> between<00:00:13.380> prokaryotic<00:00:14.370> cell

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730

mother it replicates you could form the

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.020

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.100 
excuse me chromatids are on opposite
sides<00:06:21.290> now<00:06:21.890> the<00:06:21.950> last<00:06:22.370> part<00:06:23.000> of<00:06:23.240> cell<00:06:23.720> division

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
sides now the last part of cell division

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.470 
sides now the last part of cell division
is<00:06:24.280> cytokinesis<00:06:25.280> which<00:06:25.520> is<00:06:25.730> the<00:06:25.940> separation

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:26.480 
is cytokinesis which is the separation

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.750 
is cytokinesis which is the separation
of<00:06:26.570> the<00:06:26.630> cytoplasm<00:06:27.190> this<00:06:28.190> is<00:06:28.340> when<00:06:28.520> new

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:28.760 
of the cytoplasm this is when new

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.640 
of the cytoplasm this is when new
organelles<00:06:29.360> are<00:06:29.660> going<00:06:29.870> to<00:06:29.960> be<00:06:30.080> synthesized

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 
organelles are going to be synthesized

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.620 
organelles are going to be synthesized
and<00:06:30.920> it<00:06:31.700> forms<00:06:32.030> this<00:06:32.150> thing<00:06:32.360> called<00:06:32.570> a

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
and it forms this thing called a

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.140 
and it forms this thing called a
cleavage<00:06:33.170> furrow<00:06:33.470> which<00:06:34.430> is<00:06:34.610> when<00:06:34.790> the<00:06:34.940> cell

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 
cleavage furrow which is when the cell

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.970 
cleavage furrow which is when the cell
is<00:06:35.180> actually<00:06:35.600> going<00:06:35.750> to<00:06:35.990> split<00:06:36.560> and<00:06:36.770> you<00:06:36.800> can

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:36.980 
is actually going to split and you can

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.770 
is actually going to split and you can
see<00:06:37.130> here<00:06:37.400> you've<00:06:37.550> got<00:06:37.760> your<00:06:37.790> mitochondria

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:38.780 
see here you've got your mitochondria

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.450 
see here you've got your mitochondria
all<00:06:39.500> your<00:06:39.800> other

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
all your other

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.350 
all your other
organelles<00:06:41.360> they're<00:06:41.960> going<00:06:42.169> to<00:06:42.289> divide<00:06:42.560> and

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 
organelles they're going to divide and

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.990 
organelles they're going to divide and
each<00:06:44.360> like<00:06:45.199> the<00:06:45.979> organelles<00:06:46.400> are<00:06:46.580> just<00:06:46.759> going

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 
each like the organelles are just going

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.689 
each like the organelles are just going
to<00:06:47.150> go<00:06:47.300> to<00:06:47.360> each<00:06:47.889> new<00:06:48.889> cell<00:06:49.160> you've<00:06:49.370> got<00:06:49.490> the

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:49.699 
to go to each new cell you've got the

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:52.510 
to go to each new cell you've got the
parent<00:06:50.030> cell<00:06:50.240> and<00:06:50.479> the<00:06:50.569> daughter<00:06:50.780> cell<00:06:51.520> that

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 
parent cell and the daughter cell that

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.559 
parent cell and the daughter cell that
is<00:06:52.699> all<00:06:52.849> I<00:06:52.880> have<00:06:53.240> for<00:06:53.599> mitosis<00:06:53.990> and<00:06:55.569> cellular

00:06:56.559 --> 00:06:56.569 
is all I have for mitosis and cellular

00:06:56.569 --> 00:06:58.629 
is all I have for mitosis and cellular
division<00:06:56.810> for<00:06:57.349> now<00:06:57.500> but<00:06:58.009> in<00:06:58.160> the<00:06:58.280> next<00:06:58.460> video

00:06:58.629 --> 00:06:58.639 
division for now but in the next video

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:01.809 
division for now but in the next video
I'll<00:06:59.090> cover<00:06:59.500> meiosis<00:07:00.500> which<00:07:00.740> is<00:07:00.919> the<00:07:01.280> process

00:07:01.809 --> 00:07:01.819 
I'll cover meiosis which is the process

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:06.789 
I'll cover meiosis which is the process
of<00:07:02.620> division<00:07:03.620> for<00:07:04.069> sex<00:07:04.520> cells
