00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.830
 second part of the interview with journalist cristiane dias ferreira 

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:13.259
 the scene is this work that is telling some of your work with the 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.120
 private schools is not 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.369
 How does she work in the public network? 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.550
 in Brazil, historically, it is not this work of 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.529
 d put the youth of the media production comes from the 50s 

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:29.519
 clemer of the basic ecclesial communities passed through the trade union movements 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.539
 social movements the 80's amnesties after that phenomenon my the mix that 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:39.210
 was born in the 1990s more rooted in the political issue but more 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.080
 of specific issues, everything is only has this practice and they all dialogue 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.740
 usually with public education 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.170
 either with schools or in the community 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.420
 nowadays this differentiation between school and community 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.650
 public education 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.979
 not start but it tends to merge these not so 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:02.479
 they will fuse more education freak happens only in the environment 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.040
 high school 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.800
 what do we call school? 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.650
 and has an increasingly stimulated right to informed education that happens in the 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.340
 around the school in the community, it was necessary to dialogue with this 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.700
 learning to school 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.719
 then these experiences and ideas 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:20.420
 already has our island 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.220
 including it mixed by expressive international UNICEF organizations 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.729
 is to measure the impact of these projects on local public education 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.950
 how that school's education improved when that organization began to 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.890
 work with the radio 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.890
 together with the school for example a general perception 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.380
 from what 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.380
 We're doing some new ant work. 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.330
 is that actually never went a bit and do a job a lab woods 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.390
 there is not much existing work 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.340
 it was 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.049
 I owe the names of people you can meet manaus and the role of the state 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.460
 just then this day in the city of Cuzco 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.840
 because education policies 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.820
 In Brazil, at first, contemplate this. 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.110
 the young people produce tools bulls that this course as politics 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.039
 educational 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:15.759
 the network ends so that this becomes a guideline 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:18.439
 of public policy 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:22.459
 the issue of minimal documentation of public policy then year 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:28.019
 many many think of brazil already very old much much more time than me 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.689
 I've been working for ten years. I do not know people who work. 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:34.689
 already the experience in santarém called health joy 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:39.559
 the boys make radio in the riverside communities of the river Tapajós the killer 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.559
 when calling some bar because it is a radio 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:45.559
 is an 80's dance organization 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.039
 He should be discharged today. 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:51.789
 strong encirclement in the health area 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:53.829
 and education in that region 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:58.249
 when you are the only thing, you are a small group if you walk two hours by boat 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:02.769
 October was a doctor from são paulo james cameron who went there 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.999
 put it because he realized that the health issue 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:10.279
 in communities is very precarious then drops roberto 

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:13.259
 coming out of the stilt by the river that sort of thing he used to 

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:19.149
 communicating minor health issues among communities. 

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:25.039
 then so is the despres dialoguing with the public power to gm said a thousand while 

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.779
 that 

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:28.399
 Why do you say that? 

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:31.809
 be a concern. 

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:34.919
 the cd policy the more education created 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:40.299
 is the most education is a policy of the sock that promised a policy that 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.889
 andré and will have 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.829
 doubling the student's shift in school 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:48.599
 - It was morning and it was late too. 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.669
 and there is a whole discussion in the white agency when the guy giving 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:54.799
 more audi math by story because it goes well 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:55.959
 has 30% 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:01.449
 have 30 to 30% of discharge in high school today in Brazil so if you 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:05.009
 do this you'll end up taking an escort agent out what puts 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.169
 is a well thought out comprehensive education 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.199
 it is an education that does other things in the contraturno 

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:13.219
 in a repeteco night 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.870
 so what he said he did was try to put this 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.879
 media production minde 

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:22.909
 like activities of contraturno of the fiscal everything because who does not produce and learn 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:26.210
 Portuguese removed and arrested the trafficker did not work 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.860
 newspaper 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.550
 community in contract does not make a newspaper or why not assemble a blog 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.940
 about an interesting issue and disseminates this community 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:39.999
 so much so that we set the most controversial case 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:42.300
 it's there 7 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.300
 got 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.960
 another at this summit a war 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.569
 it's a drill a long war 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:49.870
 no battle people get what 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.500
 is to gain scale when we started talking to mac in messi in that 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.590
 policy 7 so activity could only be done you had sporting quotes 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.590
 traditional from the tiara cacao are cool things 

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:06.199
 but had no activity communication relationship 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:09.199
 it if having documentation had not entered 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.199
 on the Mac and still no other related terms there 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.889
 is what we did, it was possible for us to open a wide exchange 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:21.279
 production of tunnel media or communication and will make a new 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:26.479
 how schools can encourage students to produce 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.069
 quality 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:29.330
 knightley at the end 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.180
 what's up 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.860
 of the ten schools enrolled in the program 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.980
 three thousand and nine hundred 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.259
 chose the deadline 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:43.499
 but it was a great thing and stopped being punctual even to gain a scale this 

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:47.689
 was the second part of the interview with the journalist furthermore it is necessary
