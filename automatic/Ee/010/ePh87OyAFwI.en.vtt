that like there was no need to add
double<00:01:49.680> infestation<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.369> can<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:51.119> pretty

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
double infestation you can you pretty

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.149 
double infestation you can you pretty
much<00:01:51.390> can<00:01:51.600> only<00:01:51.750> use<00:01:51.960> one<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.560> mean<00:01:52.920> unless<00:01:53.040> they

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
much can only use one I mean unless they

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.090 
much can only use one I mean unless they

bring<00:02:01.770> out<00:02:01.890> another<00:02:02.040> old<00:02:02.579> on<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:02.969> one<00:02:03.119> will

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
bring out another old on this one will

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.609 
bring out another old on this one will
actually<00:02:03.299> have<00:02:03.630> attachments<00:02:04.110> then<00:02:04.500> he's

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
actually have attachments then he's

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.289 
actually have attachments then he's
going<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.040> be<00:02:05.159> more<00:02:05.549> likely<00:02:05.790> searching<00:02:06.180> out

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
going to be more likely searching out

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.300 
going to be more likely searching out
that<00:02:06.450> trap<00:02:06.719> card<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.229> he<00:02:07.259> can<00:02:07.439> cycle<00:02:07.829> cards<00:02:08.129> and

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
that trap card so he can cycle cards and

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.279 
that trap card so he can cycle cards and
at<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.149> point<00:02:09.420> it's<00:02:09.989> look

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
at this point it's look

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.250 
at this point it's look
really<00:02:10.709> bad<00:02:10.890> for<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.189> morel<00:02:11.489> player<00:02:11.760> um

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
really bad for a morel player um

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.539 
really bad for a morel player um

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
I don't think this deck I mean we know

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.679 
I don't think this deck I mean we know
it<00:02:46.980> two<00:02:47.129> of<00:02:47.250> whom<00:02:47.340> are<00:02:47.400> gonna<00:02:47.579> be<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.819> oh<00:02:47.849> never

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
it two of whom are gonna be the oh never

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:49.580 
it two of whom are gonna be the oh never
mind<00:02:48.840> he's<00:02:48.959> gonna<00:02:49.049> go<00:02:49.200> ahead<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.349> pop<00:02:49.560> this

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
mind he's gonna go ahead and pop this

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.479 
mind he's gonna go ahead and pop this
more<00:02:50.340> than<00:02:50.489> likely<00:02:51.049> it<00:02:52.049> was<00:02:52.349> gun<00:02:52.680> now<00:02:53.129> gunned

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
more than likely it was gun now gunned

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.390 
more than likely it was gun now gunned
our<00:02:53.970> Gundy<00:02:54.359> is<00:02:54.389> more<00:02:54.930> likely<00:02:55.169> gonna<00:02:55.799> only<00:02:56.159> have

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
our Gundy is more likely gonna only have

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.610 
our Gundy is more likely gonna only have
I<00:02:56.760> place<00:02:57.120> his<00:02:57.239> only<00:02:57.389> target<00:02:57.689> is<00:02:57.810> going<00:02:58.439> to<00:02:58.500> be

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
I place his only target is going to be

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.819 
I place his only target is going to be
Lynn<00:02:59.459> I<00:03:00.260> don't<00:03:01.260> think<00:03:01.439> he<00:03:01.500> had<00:03:01.590> any<00:03:01.739> other

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
Lynn I don't think he had any other

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.679 
Lynn I don't think he had any other
targets<00:03:02.220> on<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.400> grave<00:03:02.549> at<00:03:02.730> yeah<00:03:03.269> okay<00:03:03.540> he

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
targets on the grave at yeah okay he

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:08.330 
targets on the grave at yeah okay he
only<00:03:03.780> has<00:03:03.989> one<00:03:04.069> so<00:03:06.019> that's<00:03:07.019> cool<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.590> let's

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
only has one so that's cool and let's

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.589 
only has one so that's cool and let's
see<00:03:08.459> if<00:03:08.489> she<00:03:08.609> goes<00:03:08.700> ahead<00:03:08.849> and<00:03:09.000> crack<00:03:09.180> he<00:03:09.450> looks

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
see if she goes ahead and crack he looks

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:10.970 
see if she goes ahead and crack he looks
like<00:03:09.689> he's<00:03:09.840> gonna<00:03:09.959> go<00:03:10.109> for<00:03:10.139> that<00:03:10.290> crash<00:03:10.590> and

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
like he's gonna go for that crash and

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.170 
like he's gonna go for that crash and
he's<00:03:11.280> gonna<00:03:11.430> go<00:03:11.549> ahead<00:03:11.609> and<00:03:11.700> pack<00:03:11.909> into<00:03:12.060> the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
he's gonna go ahead and pack into the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.780 
he's gonna go ahead and pack into the
open<00:03:12.419> it<00:03:12.569> has<00:03:12.750> material<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.650> not<00:03:14.579> that<00:03:14.699> it

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
open it has material and not that it

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.039 
open it has material and not that it
really<00:03:14.819> makes<00:03:15.150> too<00:03:15.359> much<00:03:15.479> of<00:03:15.629> a<00:03:15.690> difference<00:03:15.989> I

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
really makes too much of a difference I

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.300 
really makes too much of a difference I
mean<00:03:16.169> they're<00:03:16.260> both<00:03:16.379> the<00:03:16.590> same<00:03:16.620> attack<00:03:17.040> I'm

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
mean they're both the same attack I'm

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.920 
mean they're both the same attack I'm
trying<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.549> think<00:03:17.639> of<00:03:17.909> there's<00:03:18.479> anything<00:03:18.780> that

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
trying to think of there's anything that

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.140 
trying to think of there's anything that
I<00:03:19.019> can<00:03:19.079> comment<00:03:19.379> on<00:03:19.560> them<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.769> actually

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
I can comment on them to actually

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.250 
I can comment on them to actually
justify<00:03:21.150> why<00:03:21.449> you<00:03:21.479> would<00:03:21.720> attack<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.109> one

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
justify why you would attack the one

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.659 
justify why you would attack the one
that<00:03:22.379> has<00:03:22.590> material<00:03:23.040> versus<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.459> one<00:03:23.579> that

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:23.669 
that has material versus the one that

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:25.460 
that has material versus the one that
does<00:03:23.819> not<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.750> now<00:03:24.900> he's<00:03:25.079> going<00:03:25.199> to<00:03:25.290> be<00:03:25.379> able

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
does not and now he's going to be able

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:32.199 
does not and now he's going to be able
to<00:03:25.769> I<00:03:28.519> still<00:03:29.519> liking<00:03:29.790> this<00:03:30.000> one<00:03:30.150> m9<00:03:30.359> first<00:03:30.750> um
