more<00:01:40.320> laid-back<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.950> still<00:01:41.130> has<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.340> bit<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.880> a

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
more laid-back it still has a bit of a

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.789 
more laid-back it still has a bit of a
sense<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.329> urgency<00:01:42.540> with<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.350> thought<00:01:43.590> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
sense of urgency with it I thought the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.530 
sense of urgency with it I thought the
song<00:01:44.040> heavy<00:01:44.369> light<00:01:44.700> was<00:01:44.909> pretty<00:01:45.180> interesting

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
song heavy light was pretty interesting

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.410 
song heavy light was pretty interesting
it<00:01:45.899> starts<00:01:46.229> off<00:01:46.350> with<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.680> sort<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.040> exotic

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
it starts off with this sort of exotic

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.539 
it starts off with this sort of exotic
bongo<00:01:48.420> type<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.869> thing<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.860> overall<00:01:50.159> feel

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
bongo type of thing and the overall feel

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.730 
bongo type of thing and the overall feel
of<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.909> whole<00:01:51.090> song<00:01:51.420> really<00:01:51.840> reminds<00:01:52.170> me<00:01:52.439> of

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
of the whole song really reminds me of

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.980 
of the whole song really reminds me of
nothing<00:01:53.070> but<00:01:53.340> flowers<00:01:53.579> by<00:01:54.000> talking<00:01:54.479> heads<00:01:54.509> and

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
nothing but flowers by talking heads and

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.899 
nothing but flowers by talking heads and
whether<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.380> was<00:01:55.560> like<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> conscious<00:01:56.490> tribute

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
whether it was like a conscious tribute

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.819 
whether it was like a conscious tribute
or<00:01:57.119> just<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.689> coincidence<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.469> really<00:01:58.680> does

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
or just a coincidence it really does

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.520 
or just a coincidence it really does
sound<00:01:59.070> like<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.460> song<00:01:59.820> um<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.469> don't

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
sound like that song um and I don't

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.139 
sound like that song um and I don't
think<00:02:01.890> talking<00:02:02.280> heads<00:02:02.460> would<00:02:02.700> really<00:02:02.969> have<00:02:03.119> a

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
think talking heads would really have a

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.649 
think talking heads would really have a
problem<00:02:03.420> with<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.899> because<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.409> really<00:02:05.659> you

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
problem with it because it really you

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.900 
problem with it because it really you
know<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.380> many<00:02:07.469> songs<00:02:07.799> do<00:02:08.039> sound<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.610> similar

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
know so many songs do sound so similar

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.630 
know so many songs do sound so similar
and

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
and

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.760 
and
it<00:02:09.940> really<00:02:10.210> is<00:02:10.450> a<00:02:10.479> good<00:02:10.750> groove<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.380> a<00:02:11.500> really

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
it really is a good groove and a really

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.000 
it really is a good groove and a really
good<00:02:11.980> song<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:13.060> I<00:02:13.480> think<00:02:13.540> that<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.650> know<00:02:14.770> that

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
good song and I think that you know that

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.040 
good song and I think that you know that
even<00:02:15.459> though<00:02:15.760> those<00:02:15.940> two<00:02:16.240> songs<00:02:16.450> are<00:02:16.690> similar

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
even though those two songs are similar

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.040 
even though those two songs are similar
they<00:02:17.260> don't<00:02:17.440> exactly<00:02:17.800> sound<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.370> same<00:02:18.610> and

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
they don't exactly sound the same and

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.780 
they don't exactly sound the same and
you<00:02:20.050> know<00:02:20.200> I<00:02:20.230> think<00:02:20.410> that<00:02:20.709> they<00:02:20.860> it's<00:02:21.430> okay<00:02:21.730> to

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
you know I think that they it's okay to

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.520 
you know I think that they it's okay to
get<00:02:22.120> away<00:02:22.270> with<00:02:22.569> it<00:02:22.690> every<00:02:22.959> once<00:02:23.170> in<00:02:23.319> a<00:02:23.350> while

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
get away with it every once in a while

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.660 
get away with it every once in a while
one<00:02:23.800> thing<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.040> I<00:02:24.190> thought<00:02:24.430> was<00:02:24.580> pretty

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
one thing that I thought was pretty

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.820 
one thing that I thought was pretty
clever<00:02:24.970> on<00:02:25.209> this<00:02:25.390> song<00:02:25.600> is<00:02:25.810> it<00:02:25.959> actually<00:02:26.410> broke

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
clever on this song is it actually broke

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.460 
clever on this song is it actually broke
down<00:02:27.100> at<00:02:27.310> a<00:02:27.340> certain<00:02:27.640> point<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.180> it<00:02:29.050> just<00:02:29.350> had

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
down at a certain point and it just had

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.320 
down at a certain point and it just had
the<00:02:29.620> piano<00:02:29.920> playing<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:30.580> it<00:02:30.730> sort<00:02:31.000> of<00:02:31.060> built

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
the piano playing and it sort of built

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.390 
the piano playing and it sort of built
back<00:02:31.570> up<00:02:31.600> to<00:02:32.200> then<00:02:32.440> they<00:02:32.620> sort<00:02:32.800> of<00:02:32.890> jammed<00:02:33.130> on

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
back up to then they sort of jammed on

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.610 
back up to then they sort of jammed on
it<00:02:33.550> for<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:33.760> while<00:02:33.820> and<00:02:34.209> what<00:02:35.050> I<00:02:35.080> understand

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
it for a while and what I understand

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.800 
it for a while and what I understand
this<00:02:35.770> album<00:02:36.190> was<00:02:36.370> really<00:02:36.820> recorded<00:02:37.330> live<00:02:37.510> in

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
this album was really recorded live in

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.380 
this album was really recorded live in
the<00:02:37.900> studio<00:02:38.140> so<00:02:38.650> yeah<00:02:38.830> it's<00:02:39.640> possible<00:02:39.940> that

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
the studio so yeah it's possible that

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.330 
the studio so yeah it's possible that
was<00:02:40.540> just<00:02:40.750> an<00:02:40.870> improv<00:02:41.170> a<00:02:41.340> improvisational

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
was just an improv a improvisational

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.060 
was just an improv a improvisational
thing<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:42.910> they<00:02:43.870> it<00:02:44.140> was<00:02:44.170> just<00:02:44.440> spontaneous

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
thing and they it was just spontaneous

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.800 
thing and they it was just spontaneous
and<00:02:45.280> they<00:02:45.820> just<00:02:46.030> went<00:02:46.180> with<00:02:46.330> it<00:02:46.390> and<00:02:46.720> obviously

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
and they just went with it and obviously

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.800 
and they just went with it and obviously
it<00:02:47.260> sounded<00:02:47.560> good<00:02:47.709> and<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:49.030> know<00:02:49.150> that<00:02:49.390> tells

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
it sounded good and you know that tells

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.500 
it sounded good and you know that tells
you<00:02:50.019> that<00:02:50.290> what<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:50.970> unit<00:02:51.970> they<00:02:52.120> are<00:02:52.300> and

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
you that what a unit they are and

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.600 
you that what a unit they are and
they're<00:02:52.660> good<00:02:52.959> they<00:02:53.500> can<00:02:53.980> play<00:02:54.130> well<00:02:54.370> off<00:02:54.580> of

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
they're good they can play well off of

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.640 
they're good they can play well off of
each<00:02:54.940> other<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.540> album<00:02:55.840> closes<00:02:56.230> with<00:02:56.380> a<00:02:56.410> song

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
each other the album closes with a song

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.770 
each other the album closes with a song
called<00:02:56.890> turning<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.430> century<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.120> it's<00:02:58.630> a

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
called turning the century and it's a

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.680 
called turning the century and it's a
bit<00:02:58.959> more<00:02:59.170> of<00:02:59.230> a<00:02:59.470> psychedelic<00:02:59.800> thing<00:03:00.250> with<00:03:00.459> the

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
bit more of a psychedelic thing with the

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.229 
bit more of a psychedelic thing with the
sitar<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.620> chord<00:03:03.430> changes<00:03:03.519> are<00:03:04.000> really

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
sitar and the chord changes are really

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.000 
sitar and the chord changes are really
reminiscent<00:03:04.630> of<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:04.959> Beatles<00:03:05.410> it's<00:03:05.620> probably

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
reminiscent of the Beatles it's probably

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.150 
reminiscent of the Beatles it's probably
more<00:03:06.489> of<00:03:06.550> a<00:03:06.670> tribute<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.239> beatles<00:03:07.360> on<00:03:08.160> you

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
more of a tribute to the beatles on you

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.199 
more of a tribute to the beatles on you
know<00:03:09.280> like<00:03:09.489> I<00:03:09.519> said<00:03:09.730> with<00:03:09.820> the<00:03:09.940> chord<00:03:10.150> changes

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
know like I said with the chord changes

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.210 
know like I said with the chord changes
and<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:10.810> melody<00:03:10.959> and<00:03:11.320> the<00:03:11.350> use<00:03:11.530> of<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.800> sitar

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
and the melody and the use of the sitar

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.729 
and the melody and the use of the sitar
it<00:03:13.090> definitely<00:03:13.660> sounds<00:03:14.049> like<00:03:14.079> something<00:03:14.500> from

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
it definitely sounds like something from

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.140 
it definitely sounds like something from
sergeant<00:03:15.340> pepper<00:03:15.489> or<00:03:15.700> something<00:03:15.970> like<00:03:16.090> that

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
sergeant pepper or something like that

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.400 
sergeant pepper or something like that
um<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:17.440> you<00:03:18.160> know<00:03:18.310> it's<00:03:18.610> it's<00:03:18.880> again<00:03:19.600> each<00:03:20.200> of

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
um and you know it's it's again each of

um and you know it's it's again each of
these<00:03:20.530> songs<00:03:20.769> are<00:03:20.980> pretty<00:03:21.340> different<00:03:21.640> from

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
these songs are pretty different from

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.970 
these songs are pretty different from
the<00:03:22.180> last<00:03:22.360> this<00:03:22.959> album<00:03:23.170> is<00:03:23.410> pretty<00:03:23.500> eclectic

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
the last this album is pretty eclectic

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.430 
the last this album is pretty eclectic
and<00:03:24.459> to<00:03:24.579> go<00:03:24.670> from<00:03:24.850> song<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.180> song<00:03:25.420> and<00:03:26.019> changing

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
and to go from song to song and changing

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.410 
and to go from song to song and changing
up<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.650> style<00:03:26.920> each<00:03:27.190> time<00:03:27.519> really<00:03:28.180> keeps

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
up the style each time really keeps

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.479 
up the style each time really keeps
keeps<00:03:28.870> you<00:03:29.049> engaged<00:03:29.230> and<00:03:29.709> interested<00:03:30.040> in<00:03:30.310> the

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
keeps you engaged and interested in the

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.520 
keeps you engaged and interested in the
whole<00:03:30.670> thing<00:03:31.060> and<00:03:31.329> which<00:03:32.079> is<00:03:32.230> why<00:03:32.350> I<00:03:32.380> don't

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
whole thing and which is why I don't

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.740 
whole thing and which is why I don't
think<00:03:32.920> there's<00:03:33.100> really<00:03:33.310> a<00:03:33.459> week<00:03:33.790> song<00:03:34.299> on<00:03:34.600> this

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
think there's really a week song on this

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.810 
think there's really a week song on this
album<00:03:35.019> maybe<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:35.860> closing<00:03:36.280> track<00:03:36.400> is<00:03:36.670> the

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
album maybe the closing track is the

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.780 
album maybe the closing track is the
weakest<00:03:37.209> but<00:03:37.650> that's<00:03:38.650> because<00:03:38.829> just<00:03:39.310> so

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
weakest but that's because just so

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.250 
weakest but that's because just so
different<00:03:40.150> from<00:03:40.420> the<00:03:40.600> rest<00:03:40.750> of<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:40.989> songs

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
each song is different but this one is

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:44.880 
each song is different but this one is
pretty<00:03:43.750> different<00:03:44.079> from<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.500> rest<00:03:44.680> of<00:03:44.829> the
