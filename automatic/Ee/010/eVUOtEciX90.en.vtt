looking<00:01:53.310> at<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.610> spider<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.000> every<00:01:54.210> time<00:01:54.360> it

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
looking at the spider and every time it

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.650 
looking at the spider and every time it
moves<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:55.080> can<00:01:55.620> hear<00:01:55.920> or<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.400> can<00:01:56.640> feel<00:01:56.910> what

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
moves I can hear or I can feel what

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.600 
moves I can hear or I can feel what
feels<00:01:58.050> like<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.590> sound<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:59.010> tiny<00:01:59.310> bells

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
feels like the sound of tiny bells

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.300 
feels like the sound of tiny bells
jangling

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310

right where i was i SAT up and there it

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.080 
right where i was i SAT up and there it

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
took my little map of the place where i

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.330 
took my little map of the place where i
am<00:02:40.239> and<00:02:40.480> was<00:02:40.989> kind<00:02:41.230> of<00:02:41.290> scooting<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.769> alone<00:02:42.010> and

am and was kind of scooting it alone and

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.390 
am and was kind of scooting it alone and

little<00:02:47.290> hollow<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:47.709> then<00:02:48.069> he<00:02:48.160> walked<00:02:48.370> across

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
little hollow and then he walked across

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.430 
little hollow and then he walked across
this<00:02:48.819> mud<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:49.420> SAT<00:02:49.900> right<00:02:50.110> there<00:02:50.140> on<00:02:50.410> the

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
this mud and SAT right there on the

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.190 
this mud and SAT right there on the
stone<00:02:50.799> and<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:52.090> was<00:02:52.239> thinking<00:02:52.510> oh<00:02:52.630> no<00:02:52.870> now<00:02:53.110> I've

got<00:02:53.350> a<00:02:53.380> rear<00:02:53.680> out<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:54.010> back<00:02:54.190> in<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.430> crop

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
got a rear out you back in a crop

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.890 
got a rear out you back in a crop
because<00:02:54.850> I<00:02:55.030> figured<00:02:55.330> he<00:02:55.390> was<00:02:55.510> trying<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:55.720> get

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
because I figured he was trying to get

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.150 
because I figured he was trying to get
over<00:02:56.049> to<00:02:56.290> other<00:02:56.380> side<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.739> street<00:02:56.920> which<00:02:57.069> is

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
over to other side the street which is

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.009 
over to other side the street which is
right<00:02:57.370> over<00:02:57.670> there<00:02:58.000> I<00:02:58.390> thought<00:02:58.630> he<00:02:58.780> was<00:02:58.870> going

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
right over there I thought he was going

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.610 
right over there I thought he was going
this<00:02:59.140> way<00:02:59.319> but<00:03:00.010> what<00:03:00.670> he<00:03:00.790> did<00:03:01.000> then<00:03:01.630> has<00:03:02.290> just

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
this way but what he did then has just

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.880 
this way but what he did then has just
walked<00:03:03.489> on<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.540> water<00:03:04.569> and<00:03:05.080> then<00:03:05.350> float<00:03:05.739> it

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
walked on the water and then float it

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.860 
walked on the water and then float it
over<00:03:05.950> that<00:03:06.220> way<00:03:06.400> not<00:03:07.090> even<00:03:07.269> with<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.600> front

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
over that way not even with the front

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.539 
over that way not even with the front
and<00:03:08.110> whenever<00:03:08.709> you<00:03:08.980> would<00:03:09.070> go<00:03:09.250> away<00:03:09.370> you

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
and whenever you would go away you

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:10.800 
and whenever you would go away you
didn't<00:03:09.820> want<00:03:09.970> you<00:03:10.060> to<00:03:10.180> just<00:03:10.299> walk<00:03:10.540> a<00:03:10.570> little

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
didn't want you to just walk a little

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.200 
didn't want you to just walk a little
bit

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.960 

the<00:03:14.210> water<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:15.140> I<00:03:15.740> could<00:03:15.920> see<00:03:16.100> in<00:03:16.250> his<00:03:16.430> shadow

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
the water and I could see in his shadow

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.960 
the water and I could see in his shadow
on<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:17.420> bottom<00:03:17.870> of<00:03:17.990> water<00:03:18.620> where<00:03:19.460> the<00:03:19.640> Sun<00:03:19.820> was

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
on the bottom of water where the Sun was

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.760 
on the bottom of water where the Sun was
if<00:03:20.150> I<00:03:20.240> confirm<00:03:20.570> that<00:03:20.840> each<00:03:21.290> of<00:03:21.440> his<00:03:21.560> little

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
if I confirm that each of his little

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.490 
if I confirm that each of his little
legs<00:03:22.100> were<00:03:22.490> in<00:03:23.180> this<00:03:23.570> little<00:03:23.810> pocket<00:03:24.050> the

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
legs were in this little pocket the

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.080 
legs were in this little pocket the
service<00:03:24.830> can<00:03:24.980> she<00:03:25.100> was<00:03:25.250> making<00:03:25.580> under<00:03:25.850> his

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
service can she was making under his

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.790 
service can she was making under his
weight<00:03:26.300> and<00:03:26.630> also<00:03:27.140> those<00:03:27.260> two<00:03:27.500> front<00:03:27.740> legs

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
weight and also those two front legs

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.040 
weight and also those two front legs
were<00:03:28.100> up<00:03:28.250> kind<00:03:28.640> of<00:03:28.730> acting<00:03:29.060> like<00:03:29.210> intimacy

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
were up kind of acting like intimacy

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.900 
were up kind of acting like intimacy
facing<00:03:31.920> that<00:03:32.040> would<00:03:32.250> click<00:03:32.430> them<00:03:32.610> and<00:03:32.790> then

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
facing that would click them and then

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.300 
facing that would click them and then
field<00:03:33.210> around

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
field around

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.729 
field around
so<00:03:35.849> and<00:03:36.690> I<00:03:36.780> think<00:03:36.810> that's<00:03:37.080> also<00:03:37.230> develop<00:03:37.650> that

the energy

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.059 
the energy
so<00:04:08.370> I<00:04:08.400> was<00:04:08.640> thinking<00:04:08.700> about<00:04:09.330> the<00:04:10.069> non

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069

disconnection<00:04:11.790> I<00:04:11.879> just<00:04:12.090> been<00:04:12.209> reading<00:04:12.390> about

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
disconnection I just been reading about

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:13.729 
disconnection I just been reading about
which<00:04:12.900> I<00:04:12.989> was<00:04:13.110> thinking<00:04:13.319> about<00:04:13.349> when<00:04:13.530> I<00:04:13.590> was

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
which I was thinking about when I was

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.800 
which I was thinking about when I was
watching<00:04:13.860> which<00:04:14.310> was<00:04:14.549> why<00:04:14.970> i<00:04:15.000> think<00:04:15.510> i<00:04:15.629> could

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
watching which was why i think i could

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.469 
watching which was why i think i could
even<00:04:15.959> feel<00:04:16.199> the<00:04:16.410> bells<00:04:16.620> i<00:04:16.919> think<00:04:17.669> i<00:04:17.850> was<00:04:18.060> tuning

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
even feel the bells i think i was tuning

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:19.970 
even feel the bells i think i was tuning
into<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.840> connection

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
into the connection

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.570 
into the connection
and<00:04:20.810> and<00:04:21.810> I<00:04:21.930> was<00:04:22.110> thinking<00:04:22.140> about<00:04:22.770> walking<00:04:23.100> on

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
and and I was thinking about walking on

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.390 
and and I was thinking about walking on
a<00:04:23.880> motion<00:04:24.120> using<00:04:25.020> your<00:04:25.500> emotional<00:04:26.220> power

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
a motion using your emotional power

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.520 
a motion using your emotional power
which<00:04:26.760> is<00:04:26.940> what<00:04:27.210> makes<00:04:27.660> magic<00:04:28.050> and

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
which is what makes magic and

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.090 
which is what makes magic and
manifestation<00:04:29.220> in<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.460> hospital<00:04:29.910> at<00:04:29.970> all<00:04:30.090> and

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
manifestation in the hospital at all and

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.010 
manifestation in the hospital at all and
using<00:04:32.100> it<00:04:32.250> as<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.550> support<00:04:33.240> beneath<00:04:33.510> you<00:04:33.720> rather

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
using it as a support beneath you rather

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.879 
using it as a support beneath you rather
than

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
than

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.499 
than
something<00:04:35.219> to<00:04:35.340> fight<00:04:35.520> or<00:04:35.789> something<00:04:35.909> to<00:04:36.150> drive

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:36.509 
something to fight or something to drive

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.809 
something to fight or something to drive
you<00:04:36.840> but<00:04:37.560> rather<00:04:37.770> using<00:04:38.159> it<00:04:38.370> as<00:04:38.490> something<00:04:38.789> to

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:38.819 
you but rather using it as something to

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:39.790 
you but rather using it as something to
flow

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
flow

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.550 
flow
and<00:04:39.919> walk<00:04:40.159> across<00:04:40.310> them<00:04:40.639> navigate<00:04:40.819> over<00:04:41.560> as

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
and walk across them navigate over as

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.589 
and walk across them navigate over as
you're<00:04:43.190> a<00:04:43.460> part<00:04:43.940> of<00:04:44.060> it<00:04:44.210> because<00:04:44.360> it<00:04:44.659> scary<00:04:44.979> so

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599

you're a part of it because it scary so
go<00:04:47.599> and<00:04:48.639> I<00:04:49.639> think<00:04:49.970> that<00:04:50.120> once<00:04:50.300> that's<00:04:50.569> possible

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
go and I think that once that's possible

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.300 
go and I think that once that's possible
once<00:04:51.979> that<00:04:52.129> becomes<00:04:52.490> a<00:04:52.580> way<00:04:52.729> of<00:04:52.759> being<00:04:53.470> then<00:04:54.470> we

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
once that becomes a way of being then we

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.999 
once that becomes a way of being then we
will<00:04:55.460> all<00:04:55.490> be<00:04:55.639> a<00:04:55.759> lot<00:04:55.879> more<00:04:55.940> powerful

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:01.040

comfortable<00:05:45.900> in<00:05:46.230> this<00:05:46.290> effort<00:05:46.560> this<00:05:46.830> is

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
comfortable in this effort this is

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.860 
comfortable in this effort this is
speaking<00:05:48.280> out<00:05:48.430> here<00:05:48.820> that's<00:05:49.270> another<00:05:49.480> similar

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
speaking out here that's another similar

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.670 
speaking out here that's another similar
cases

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
cases

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.620 
cases
yeah<00:05:51.250> it<00:05:51.490> exists<00:05:51.850> outdoors<00:05:52.240> you're<00:05:52.509> not

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
yeah it exists outdoors you're not

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.950 
yeah it exists outdoors you're not
you're<00:05:53.110> not<00:05:54.120> gaining<00:05:55.120> anything<00:05:55.479> by<00:05:55.660> never

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
you're not gaining anything by never

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.310 
you're not gaining anything by never
going<00:05:56.229> outside<00:05:56.380> into<00:05:56.830> the<00:05:56.860> real<00:05:57.190> nature<00:05:57.520> where

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
going outside into the real nature where

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.260 
going outside into the real nature where
the<00:05:59.320> energies<00:06:00.250> of<00:06:00.430> the<00:06:00.490> flowing

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
the energies of the flowing

the energies of the flowing
electromagnetic<00:06:01.900> fields<00:06:02.199> at<00:06:02.289> all<00:06:02.380> plugged

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
electromagnetic fields at all plugged

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.860 
electromagnetic fields at all plugged
into<00:06:02.770> each<00:06:02.860> other<00:06:03.100> are<00:06:03.310> creating<00:06:03.789> habitat<00:06:04.300> for

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
into each other are creating habitat for

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.540 
into each other are creating habitat for
animals<00:06:04.990> and<00:06:05.470> also<00:06:05.740> will<00:06:06.340> provide<00:06:06.520> the

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
animals and also will provide the

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.340 
animals and also will provide the
consistency<00:06:07.240> of<00:06:07.300> their<00:06:07.479> compensation<00:06:07.840> here

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
consistency of their compensation here

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.189 
consistency of their compensation here
as<00:06:08.440> well<00:06:08.590> go<00:06:09.400> find<00:06:09.669> them<00:06:09.789> like<00:06:10.030> a<00:06:10.060> spring<00:06:10.389> coat

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 
as well go find them like a spring coat

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:13.889 
as well go find them like a spring coat
together<00:06:11.650> great
