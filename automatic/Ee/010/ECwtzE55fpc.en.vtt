up or firm up we can take the pulse
light<00:01:30.939> device<00:01:31.469> with<00:01:32.469> a<00:01:32.500> little<00:01:32.770> ultrasound

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
light device with a little ultrasound

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.550 
light device with a little ultrasound
gel<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:33.939> just<00:01:34.090> gently<00:01:34.420> rub<00:01:34.780> this<00:01:35.079> over<00:01:35.439> the

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
gel and just gently rub this over the

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.099 
gel and just gently rub this over the
area<00:01:35.920> until<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.490> tissue<00:01:36.700> heats<00:01:37.030> up<00:01:37.270> we

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
area until the tissue heats up we

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:41.940 
area until the tissue heats up we
actually<00:01:38.439> have<00:01:38.619> a<00:01:40.079> infrared<00:01:41.079> temperature

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
actually have a infrared temperature

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.069 
actually have a infrared temperature
sensor<00:01:42.579> so<00:01:42.850> we<00:01:43.000> have<00:01:43.149> a<00:01:43.179> target<00:01:43.509> temperature

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
sensor so we have a target temperature

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.050 
sensor so we have a target temperature
that<00:01:44.200> we're<00:01:44.380> looking<00:01:44.530> for<00:01:44.770> and<00:01:45.249> it's

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
that we're looking for and it's

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.389 
that we're looking for and it's
interesting<00:01:46.359> because<00:01:46.719> it<00:01:47.200> feels<00:01:47.439> the

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
interesting because it feels the

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:49.859 
interesting because it feels the
benefits<00:01:48.850> of<00:01:48.999> that<00:01:49.090> when<00:01:49.270> a<00:01:49.299> patient<00:01:49.659> leaves

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
benefits of that when a patient leaves

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.870 
benefits of that when a patient leaves
their<00:01:50.259> cheeks<00:01:50.590> feel<00:01:50.859> full<00:01:51.159> the<00:01:51.369> neck<00:01:51.579> feels

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
their cheeks feel full the neck feels

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.169 
their cheeks feel full the neck feels
you<00:01:52.420> know<00:01:52.509> nice<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:54.700> get<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:54.939> the<00:01:55.030> target

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
you know nice we get to the target

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:57.270 
you know nice we get to the target
temperature<00:01:55.450> sometimes<00:01:55.990> and<00:01:56.590> they're<00:01:57.100> not

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
temperature sometimes and they're not

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.919 
temperature sometimes and they're not
feeling<00:01:57.640> much<00:01:57.999> in<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.270> way<00:01:58.359> of<00:01:58.390> heat<00:01:58.689> at<00:01:58.780> all

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
feeling much in the way of heat at all

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.480 
feeling much in the way of heat at all
and<00:01:59.170> then<00:01:59.289> some<00:01:59.649> of<00:01:59.770> them<00:01:59.890> actually<00:02:00.039> say<00:02:00.340> well

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
and then some of them actually say well

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.800 
and then some of them actually say well
can<00:02:00.640> you<00:02:00.729> take<00:02:00.880> it<00:02:01.060> higher<00:02:01.240> okay<00:02:01.659> because

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
can you take it higher okay because

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.870 
can you take it higher okay because
they're<00:02:02.049> seeing<00:02:02.289> the<00:02:02.439> benefits<00:02:02.890> of<00:02:03.009> that<00:02:03.189> so

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
they're seeing the benefits of that so

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.910 
they're seeing the benefits of that so
it<00:02:04.060> has<00:02:04.240> a<00:02:04.270> lot<00:02:04.600> of<00:02:04.630> different<00:02:05.200> a<00:02:05.499> lot<00:02:05.740> of

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
it has a lot of different a lot of

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.810 
it has a lot of different a lot of
different<00:02:06.249> uses<00:02:06.640> oddly<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.770> broadband<00:02:09.580> light

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
different uses oddly the broadband light

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.060 
different uses oddly the broadband light
was

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
was

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.170 
was
something<00:02:12.070> that<00:02:12.160> I<00:02:12.190> purchased<00:02:12.670> just<00:02:12.910> for<00:02:13.060> the
