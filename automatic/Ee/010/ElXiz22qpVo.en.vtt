so one thing to note is that this will

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.240 
so one thing to note is that this will
update<00:01:42.750> your<00:01:43.079> baseband<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:43.680> if<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.890> unlock

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250

your baseband version so then also the
ipsw<00:01:53.490> successfully<00:01:54.000> identified<00:01:54.540> we<00:01:55.170> can<00:01:55.290> go

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
ipsw successfully identified we can go

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.200 
ipsw successfully identified we can go
ahead<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.740> hit<00:01:55.860> next<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.430> unlike<00:01:57.149> the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
ahead and hit next and unlike the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.330 
ahead and hit next and unlike the
previous<00:01:57.689> untethered<00:01:58.380> like<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.979> jailbreak

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
previous untethered like the jailbreak

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.850 
previous untethered like the jailbreak
monte<00:01:59.729> this<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.509> done<00:02:00.840> all<00:02:01.049> in<00:02:01.200> one<00:02:01.350> step<00:02:01.619> so

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
monte this is done all in one step so

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.380 
monte this is done all in one step so
you<00:02:01.950> don't<00:02:02.130> have<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.369> go<00:02:02.490> through<00:02:02.729> jailbreak

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
you don't have to go through jailbreak

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.539 
you don't have to go through jailbreak
it<00:02:03.540> then<00:02:03.810> go<00:02:04.079> ahead<00:02:04.229> go<00:02:04.770> through<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.159> untether

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
it then go ahead go through and untether

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.559 
it then go ahead go through and untether
it<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:06.600> now<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.920> can<00:02:08.069> see<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:08.429> have<00:02:08.569> several

for putting it into dfu mode so that

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.130 
for putting it into dfu mode so that
consists<00:02:33.000> of<00:02:33.090> holding<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.510> top<00:02:33.690> button<00:02:33.930> for

consists of holding the top button for

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.040 
consists of holding the top button for
three<00:02:34.319> seconds<00:02:34.739> holding<00:02:35.550> power<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.360> home<00:02:36.660> for

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
three seconds holding power and home for

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.199 
three seconds holding power and home for
10<00:02:37.230> seconds<00:02:37.739> basically<00:02:38.640> until<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:38.970> screen

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
10 seconds basically until the screen

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.110 
10 seconds basically until the screen
goes<00:02:39.450> black<00:02:40.310> then<00:02:41.310> releasing<00:02:41.849> the<00:02:41.940> power

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120

button and holding home for 15 seconds

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.190 
button and holding home for 15 seconds
this<00:02:44.430> will<00:02:44.580> usually<00:02:44.790> jump<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.810> next<00:02:45.840> step

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
this will usually jump to the next step

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.630 
this will usually jump to the next step
about<00:02:46.500> halfway<00:02:46.769> through<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.400> doesn't

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
about halfway through it doesn't

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.949 
about halfway through it doesn't
actually<00:02:47.760> have<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.180> go<00:02:48.330> for<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.569> full<00:02:48.780> 15

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
actually have to go for the full 15

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.680 
actually have to go for the full 15
seconds<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.830> now<00:02:49.910> it'll<00:02:50.910> say<00:02:51.060> jailbreaking

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
seconds and now it'll say jailbreaking

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.330 
seconds and now it'll say jailbreaking
and<00:02:51.930> go<00:02:52.830> through<00:02:53.100> all<00:02:53.280> this<00:02:53.459> process<00:02:54.000> this<00:02:54.930> is

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
and go through all this process this is

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.160 
and go through all this process this is
actually<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.370> pretty<00:02:56.610> quick<00:02:56.940> process<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.720> um

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
actually a pretty quick process it um

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.500 
actually a pretty quick process it um
then<00:02:59.099> and<00:02:59.489> your<00:02:59.730> iPhone<00:03:00.060> screen<00:03:00.150> will<00:03:00.420> be

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
then and your iPhone screen will be

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.330 
then and your iPhone screen will be
flashing<00:03:00.780> throughout<00:03:01.200> it<00:03:01.349> white<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:02.069> then

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
flashing throughout it white and then

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.309 
flashing throughout it white and then
I'll<00:03:02.430> say<00:03:02.580> downloading<00:03:03.090> jailbreak<00:03:03.480> data<00:03:04.110> when

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
I'll say downloading jailbreak data when

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.280 
I'll say downloading jailbreak data when
it<00:03:04.410> says<00:03:04.560> uploading<00:03:05.010> ramdisk<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:06.140> after<00:03:07.140> it

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
it says uploading ramdisk and after it

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.680 
it says uploading ramdisk and after it
uploads<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.980> colonel<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.459> reboots<00:03:09.269> your

uploads the colonel and reboots your

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.470 
uploads the colonel and reboots your
device<00:03:10.530> it'll<00:03:11.310> say<00:03:11.489> done<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:12.060> there<00:03:12.330> will<00:03:12.420> be
