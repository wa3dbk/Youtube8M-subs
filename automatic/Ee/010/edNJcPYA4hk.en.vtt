you want it to be or in the middle and

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.400 
you want it to be or in the middle and
then<00:00:15.240> I'm<00:00:15.360> going<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.599> section<00:00:15.780> off<00:00:15.960> my<00:00:16.199> hair

then I'm going to section off my hair

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.410 
then I'm going to section off my hair
with<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.130> bottom<00:00:17.640> section<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.029> then<00:00:18.119> or<00:00:18.270> top

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
with a bottom section and then or top

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.630 
with a bottom section and then or top
section<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.949> don't<00:00:20.130> have<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.310> do<00:00:20.430> this<00:00:20.490> if

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
section and you don't have to do this if

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.189 
section and you don't have to do this if
you<00:00:20.670> want<00:00:20.880> if<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.210> don't<00:00:21.480> want<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.779> but<00:00:21.990> I

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
you want if you don't want to but I

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.990 
you want if you don't want to but I
think<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.710> helps<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.980> lot<00:00:23.100> better<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:23.880> can

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
think it helps a lot better so you can

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.599 
think it helps a lot better so you can
get<00:00:24.180> all<00:00:24.330> your<00:00:24.359> hair<00:00:25.099> then<00:00:26.099> I'm<00:00:26.250> just<00:00:26.340> going<00:00:26.519> to

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
get all your hair then I'm just going to

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.550 
get all your hair then I'm just going to
use<00:00:26.789> some<00:00:27.029> water<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.660> dampen<00:00:27.960> my<00:00:28.289> hair<00:00:28.529> a

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
use some water to dampen my hair a

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.080 
use some water to dampen my hair a
little<00:00:28.740> bit<00:00:28.890> because<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.340> think<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.640> helps<00:00:29.880> when

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
little bit because I think it helps when

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.620 
little bit because I think it helps when
the<00:00:30.300> curls<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.660> lot<00:00:30.810> better<00:00:32.120> so<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.149> take<00:00:33.450> your

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
the curls a lot better so you take your

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.540 
the curls a lot better so you take your
phone<00:00:33.870> curler<00:00:34.320> or<00:00:34.559> whatever<00:00:35.070> going<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.370> use

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
phone curler or whatever going to use

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.430 
phone curler or whatever going to use
and<00:00:35.820> just<00:00:36.149> wrap<00:00:36.300> your<00:00:36.329> hair<00:00:36.660> around<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.350> I

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
and just wrap your hair around and I

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.280 
and just wrap your hair around and I
just<00:00:37.590> take<00:00:37.770> about<00:00:38.040> one<00:00:38.309> inch<00:00:38.489> sections<00:00:38.940> or<00:00:39.360> so

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
just take about one inch sections or so

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.810 
just take about one inch sections or so
like<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.890> then<00:00:41.070> just<00:00:41.100> wrap<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.610> around

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
like that and then just wrap it around

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.900 
like that and then just wrap it around
and<00:00:42.360> then<00:00:42.440> I<00:00:43.440> bend<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.920> ends<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.520> make<00:00:44.879> sure

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
and then I bend the ends so make sure

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.490 
and then I bend the ends so make sure
your<00:00:45.300> hair<00:00:45.480> doesn't<00:00:45.660> go<00:00:45.870> all<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.140> way<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.379> the
